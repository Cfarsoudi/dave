 HIGHLANDER IV WORLD WITHOUT END OVER BLACK, A VOICE: VOICE IN THE DAYS BEFORE MEMORY, THERE WERE THE IMMORTALS. WE WERE WITH YOU THEN, AND WE ARE WITH YOU NOW. SWEEP LOW through CLINGING HIGHLAND MISTS that shroud a land still in its infancy. Cathedral spires of granite. Cradled lakes. A solitary vastness. VOICE (cont'd) WE HAVE BEEN WORSHIPPED AS GODS MISTAKEN FOR DEMONS AND REVILED'AS WITCHES. WE ARE THE SEEDS OF A MILLION LEGENDS BUT OUR TRUE ORIGINS ARE UNKNOWN. WE SIMPLY ARE. ANCIENT CASTLES dot the landscape, whisper of battles long forgotton. VOICE (cont'd) WE ARE DRIVEN BY THE CEASELESS FIGHT TO ENDURE. NO LIMIT, IT IS A BATTLE THAT KNOWS NO BOUNDRY OF TIME OR PLACE. TWO FIGURES clash with broadswords atop the tallest promontory. VOICE (cont'd) TO THE WINNER COMES AN UNKNOWABLE PRIZE. YET AN IMMORTAL CAN FIND NO COMFORT IN VICTORY. MATCH MOVE to the top of an ULTRA-MODERN SKYSCRAPER. Swordsmen continue to battle. VOICE (cont'd) BECAUSE IN THE END, THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE. Loser falls to the other's sword as the HEAVENS CLEAVE in a TITANIC RUPTURE OF SIGHT AND SOUND. Like the birth of a brand new universe. BEGIN/END TITLES: EXT - MANHATTAN, PRESENT-DAY ESTABLISHING - DAWN Teeming millions. Yawning concrete spires. Blare of traffic. EXT - ANTIQUE STORE - DAWN Engraved into a brass plaque: MACLEOD & ELLENSTEIN ANTIQUES (FORMERLY RUSSELL NASH LTD) A FACE reflects in the window glass. It's RACHEL ELLENSTEIN, early 60's now, a graying, maternal beauty. She moves to the front door, reaches out to unlock i.t. It falls open at her touch. Even though the hanging placard is still flipped to "WERE CLOSED" Rachel hesitates. Draws a shallow breath and steps inside. INT - ANTIQUE STORE All those sublime European antiquities now drip with menace. Celtic harp. Scottish targe. Brooding statuary. She moves deeper into the shadowed recesses, flicks on a lamp. Her gaze settles on the one exception to the impeccable order of things. An open wooden case, empty. Just the felt impression of a missing broadsword. RACHEL (icy dread) Connor...? She crosses to the foot of the staircase. Listens. A MUSIC BOX spools a faint, tinny madrigal. She climbs the stairs, padding softly upward. The music grinds EVER LOUDER in its maddening repetitions. Every so often, it's punctuated by a CHILD'S GIGGLE. AT THE SECOND FLOOR LANDING Rachel edges around the corner. Her breath catches in her throat. BEFORE HER stands a locked wooden cabinet. It's been cleaved nearly in half by the BROADSWORD that still juts hilt-first from the base of the splintered front panel. PHOTO ALBUMS and leather-bound DIARIES have been shredded and scattered across the floor-- --except for several selected PHOTOGRAPHS, skewered onto the sword tip like a Medieval message spike. Rachel struggles to breathe. Like she's taken that sword in her own gut. INSIDE THE CABINET A TELEVISION flickers with videotape of GRAINY HOME MOVIES. A LITTLE GIRL (RACHEL) is entranced by a PORCELAIN MUSIC BOX held out by an AGELESS CONNOR MACLEOD. YOUNG RACHEL Let me see, Connor! Let me see! Rachel stands frozen, watching her life with Connor flash by in RAGGED FILM CLIPS. CONNOR teaching RACHEL to ride a horse. CONNOR with RACHEL outside an English boarding school. In a train station. At her college graduation. CONNOR and RACHEL in a laughing embrace that only hints at something deeper. In each new clip, Rachel has aged further. Connor has not. Rachel steps up to the broadsword, wraps both hands around the grip and jerks it clean of the cabinet. THE SKEWERED PHOTOGRAPHS (flutterd to the floor like dead leaves) THE VIDEOTAPE ENDS, CLICKS OFF... and a NEW IMAGE burns itself onto the screen in perfect digital clarity. Rachel. Staring back at herself, terror-stricken. She hadn't even noticed it before now. The tiny CAMCORDER on the shelf above the TV with the glowing red light. MOVE IN ON THE TV as Rachel SLOWLY BACKS AWAY. Keep moving in on the TV until the PIXELS SWIM... THE PHONE RINGS shattering the stillness. The old rotary phone on the little Louis XIV stand. It's not just beckoning her. It's taunting her. Gathering up the photos and hugging them to her breast, Rachel slowly approaches the phone. Any second now, you'd expect it to stop ringing, nobody home. But whoever's on the other end knows better. It keeps right on RINGING. Insistant. Trembling fingers reach out for the receiver. Slowly lift it off the hook. RACHEL Hello? EXTREME CLOSE ON PHONE: A TINY ELECTRIC CLICK is the last thing Rachel hears before-- EXT - ANTIQUE STORE - WIDE --a BLISTERING EXPLOSION blows out the entire second floor. Rachel Ellenstein is obliterated right along with her own treasured history. Linger on the FLAMES as we TRANSITION TO: EXT - SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS (1565) - DAY A MOUND OF BURNING CORPSES They crackle and twist in the fire that feeds off them. It takes a moment to realize they're LIVESTOCK-- oxen, pigs, goats, sheep-- piled like burning refuse. A CRUDE, WOVEN-STRAW HUMAN EFFIGY stands astride the pile, engulfed in flame. BEYOND THE FIRE Connor MacLeod and his young wife, HEATHER, watch from the steps of their simple, isolated home. Connor betrays no emotion. Heather looks on in horror. HEATHER My God, what are they? CONNOR Farm animals. Dead of the plague. HEATHER Why do they torment us with their dead cattle? (no response) Connor...? CONNOR They think I've brought this upon them. It's a warning. A deeper fear now grips Heather. HEATHER A warning?! They drove you from your home! They cut you off from your own people! What else could they want?! Connor turns away from the flaming heap. CONNOR Someone to blame. CUT TO: CONNOR swinging astride his horse. HEATHER (dread) Don't go back there. THUNDER RUMBLES in the distance. CONNOR I have no choice. HEATHER Please-- CONNOR They can't hurt me. And they know it. But they can still hurt the ones I care about. Heather looks off. Shivers. HEATHER I'm afraid. Connor leans forward, takes her face in his hands. CONNOR I love you, Heather. More than anything in this world. She grips his hands. Desperately. CONNOR (cont'd) Do you believe me? HEATHER Yes. CONNOR Then you needn't be afraid. (kisses her) Nothing can ever keep us apart. DISSOLVE TO: EXT - SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS, VARIOUS - DAWN Connor travels a primeval landscape of jagged peaks and fog-shrouded valleys. CONNOR'S VOICE Nothing... CUT TO: EXT - RIDGE ABOVE GLENFINNAN - TWILIGHT He gazes down at the tiny hamlet of Glenfinnan, nestled between castle and shimmering loch. Breathes deep the forgotten smell of home. INT - HUT - EVENING CAIOLIN MACLEOD, ravaged by neglect and despair, strokes her son's face as if confirming his reality. CAIOLIN I thought you might be the water horse come to take me on his back and drown me in the loch. CONNOR (smiles) Maybe I am, Mother. CAIOLIN (touches his hair) Then come, let me grab hold of your golden mane and off we go. Connor lifts her from the tattered bed, spins her around several giddy times and sits her upright in a chair. CONNOR Not before we put some meat on those bones. He rummages through her shelves looking for food. Finds painfully little. CONNOR (cont'd) No one comes to look after you? CAIOLIN They're all afraid of me. They think I bedevil their children because I've lost my own. CONNOR I'm sorry. I'm so sorry... CAIOLIN Tiny minds and sour dispositions. I don't need them, Connor. Any of them. Connor crouches at her feet. CONNOR Then it's settled. You're coming with me. There's somebody I want you to meet. She's nearly as beautiful as you. Caiolin blinks back her disbelief. CAIOLIN You're sure? CONNOR (cont'd) We leave tonight. Let's start packing. CAIOLIN (lifts up her shoes) I'm already packed. THE SLATTED WOODEN DOOR swings OPEN. A YOUNG MAN stands in the doorway. He's strong and severe, dressed in clergyman's black. But that's not what draws the eye. Even though it's cold enough to fog his breath-- he's sweatinq. Connor looks up, guarded. CONNOR Jacob-- KASE You shouldna come back, Connor. Connor feels the tension in Kase's voice. CONNOR Surely as a friend you can look the other way just this once... For old times' sake... KASE You knew. You knew what would happen if you came back. I am not to blame for this. CONNOR What? (beat) What have you done? KASE God help you. FATHER ALASDAIR RAINEY, the local priest and inquisitor, steps inside, bent over a silver cane. He's gross, corpulent and perpetually short of breath. A nasty NOSE BOIL figures prominently in his overall appearance. VILLAGERS of varying stripe crowd nervously behind them. FATHER RAINEY In the name of the Holy See and the rule of law, you are hereby charged, Connor MacLeod, with heresy and the practice of black magic. (turns to the villagers) Take him. The townsmen jostle in place, each trying to squeeze backward behind the other. FATHER RAINEY (cont'd) (squints) Heresy is not contagious. Two of the bolder men move forward, gripping Connor by the elbows. Once its clear they haven't sucked up any demons, the others SWARM HIM. EXT - STONE HUT - NIGHT Caiolin SCREAMS as Connor's dragged outside and driven to the ground by a relentless battery of sticks and clubs. CUT TO: INT - STONE CELL - NIGHT Connor stirs awake in a centuries-old dungeon, a dark hole, crumbling and damp. VOICES seem to drip through the porous mortar. Taunting, vengeful, expectant. He crosses to the barred window that affords him a narrow, ground-level view of THE TOWN COMMONS where a well-attended EXECUTION is now underway. Connor squints, craning to make out the identity of the condemned. TOWNSPEOPLE mingle and mill in front of him, obstructing his line-of-sight. Even as A FAMILIAR VOICE rises above the surrounding chatter. JACOB KASE'S VOICE The curse that afflicts one generation will invariably pass its mark onto the next. The ties of blood cannot be severed by word or deed, if in fact your blood is that of your son. Several villagers STEP ASIDE to reveal: CONNOR'S MOTHER bound to an UPRIGHT STAKE atop a mound of shorn timber. CONNOR siezes with the impossible horror of recognition. CONNOR No.. . NO! ! JACOB KASE Makes the sign of the cross as he reads from a writ of execution. He stands atop a primeval CELTIC MONOLITH worn down to the form of a pedestal. Father Rainey wobbles behind him, sniffing ammonia to spell his chronic angina. KASE Through the infinite compassion of our Lord God, you are entitled one final opportunity to renounce all that is unholy, to declare Connor MacLeod not of your loins and help put an end to the darkness that has been cast upon this land. How say you, Caiolin MacLeod? Caiolin lifts her head, pale and beatific. CAIOLIN If your god should persecute me into the next world, then I shall simply have to find myself another. Shocked murmers of outrage shudder through the crowd. Kase steps up and RIPS AWAY Caiolin's cherished silver CRUCIFIX, with its distinctive wooden Christ figure. KASE (holding up Caiolin's crucifix) You won't need this where you're going. CONNOR grabs at the iron window-bars. Shakes them until the mortar chips from their moorings. THE RUDDY-FACED EXECUTIONER solemnly approaches Caiolin. Unseen by the bloodlusting crowd, he takes out a small leather sack and drapes it around her neck by the drawstring. He tucks it under her coarse woolen robe and pats it flush against her chest. EXECUTIONER (softly) Black powder. It will make short work of your suffering. Caiolin nods. He steps down off the pyre. Reaches for a BURNING TORCH. CONNOR strains against the bars like a madman. Mortar continues crumbling until one bar actually RIPS AWAY COMPLETELY. THE EXECUTIONER touches torch to kindling. It ALIGHTS. CONNOR tries to squeeze through the window gap. Too tight. So he winds back with the iron bar and swings with mindless fury. Iron strikes unyielding stone, SPARKING and CHIPPING... THE PYRE BENEATH CAIOLIN ENGULFS IN FLAME. Heat ripples her face, distorts her body. CONNOR hammers harder, quicker, louder. Bits of stone fly everywhere. But the bulk of it remains spitefully intact. Still, it's enough to convince ALL FOUR GUARDS to intervene. They throw open the heavy iron door and descend upon Connor with swords and axes. >Wielding the iron bar like a battle mace, Connor splits the first guard's head, catches his sword mid-air and slices into the next. Third guard's axe catches on a ceiling beam. Connor runs him through like an overstuffed feedsack. The fourth guard drops his sword and BOLTS. THE PYRE is now fully ABLAZE. Caiolin looks out through the rippling wall of flame... . . . and smiles weakly. CAIOLIN My water horse... AS CONNOR splits the crowd like a battering ram. He reaches the pyre, hurling flaming timbers aside with his bare hands. Initially stunned, the townsfolk shrink back, watching Connor desperately scatter the fire. Caiolin buries her face in her shoulder, biting back the agony as... Sword in hand, Connor stretches upward, hacking away the ropes that bind her, oblivious to the fire now crawling in serpentine coils around his own arms and legs. Freed of the ropes, Caiolin begins to slump forward. Connor grabs for her arm as THE BLACK POWDER EXPLODES in a CONCUSSION of FIRE that renders any further hope of rescue futile. Connor stands atop the burning pyre, wicked tongues of flame leaping off his back and shoulders like fiery wings. He throws back his head and HOWLS to the heavens. Fire dances across Connor's skin and clothing as he raises his broadsword and steps down into the crowd. PANDEMONIUM breaks out. This isn't just a common witch. This is one of Hell's very own. Those few foolish enough to attack are cut down where they stand. The rest scatter in mindless PANIC. Father Rainey blocks Connor's path. Lifts his cross... . . . as he's CUT DOWN by the blind SLASH of Connor's sword. Connor steps over Rainey's body and keeps coming, driving the mob fleeing into their dwellings. Kase crouches blustering over Rainey. KASE Father... Father, please-- (tries to staunch the bleeding) Father--! Rainey's eyes open slightly. RAINEY Who are you...? KASE Your son. It's your son-- Jacob. Rainey stares back as if a veil has suddenly been lifted. And what he now sees terrifies him to death. RAINEY (eyes widen) Who are YOU? KASE I'm your-- He stops. Rainey's eyes are frozen. Dead. CONNOR returns to the flaming pyre, refueling his rage with the sight of his mother's blackened corpse. >KASE scoops up a discarded sword, leaps to his feet and CHARGES CONNOR, bellowing like a madman. >Connor whirls around with his sword, making Kase IMPALE HIMSELF on the blade. Kase stares wide-eyed and gagging at Connor's smoldering visage-- the depthless black pools of hate that shroud his eyes. It's the last thing Jacob Kase will ever see. Connor opens his fingers and lets him DROP, the sword hilt still jutting from Kase's chest. Gathering up several chunks of flaming timber, Connor HEAVES them onto the straw-covered rooftops, setting them instantly ABLAZE. In short order, the village is transformed into a giant swirling INFERNO. Silhouetted against the crimson sky, Connor lifts Caiolin's body and turns his back on Glenfinnan for the last time. DISSOLVE TO: EXT - ANCIENT STONE MONASTERY - NIGHT Standing outside the massive door is a MONK clad in dark, hooded monastic garb. Nothing in the panorama would suggest we've just jumped four centuries into an uncertain future... Until-- A PACK OF MOTORCYCLISTS chew their way up the rubbled slope. Fishtail to a stop. THE LEADER, a tall eclectically-dressed Jamaican, dismounts and approaches the hooded monk. JAMAICAN You people are extremely hard to find. Monk unshoulders a PUMP-ACTION SHOTGUN. HOODED MONK We like it that way. (pumps shotgun) Now go. The other six INTRUDERS surround the monk. His eyes flick from one to the next-- a buffet of different nationalities, all big. JAMAICAN Take your pick. Before you squeeze the trigger a second time, you'll be dead. Easy choice. Monk levels his gun and BLOWS the Jamaican right off his feet. And sure enough, he GAGS before his next trigger-pull. A very nasty SERRATED BLADE retracts into a wooden hilt. Monk drops in a heap as his assailant, a WIRY ASIAN, turns for the door, joined by the others. IN THE VERY NEXT INSTANT the heavy oak-and-iron door SWINGS OPEN with a BARRAGE of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE-- The intruders are CUT DOWN where they stand. THREE MORE HOODED MONKS appear in the doorway, wielding ASSAULT RIFLES. They grimly regard the bodies. MONK #1 Take the heads. Just in case. Saws and cleavers are pulled by the other two guards while Guard #l keeps his gun trained on the corpses. VOICE Don't bother. Really. A FIGURE stands in shadow, his face UNSEEN. We catch only a brief glimpse of a PRIESTS COLLAR. Guard #l whips his rifle toward the Stranger. Stranger diverts it with the tip of his sword. Bullets go nowhere. One slash and the guard is gone. Two more slashes and his comrades fall. Stranger kicks the body of the dead Jamaican as he steps through the open doorway. STRANGER Dont be long. INT - MONASTERY - NIGHT FOLLOW THE STRANGER through a maze of chambers and DOWN into serpentine catacombs. He KICKS THROUGH a DOOR into AN INNER ROOM cavernous and dripping, where even the air seems septic. A few dim candles illuminate A DOZEN MEN bound to complicated, almost Giger-esque chairs. Arms, legs and faces have been immobilized by crossing flats of metal BOLTED into flesh and wood. From the wild overgrowth of hair and beard, and the impossibly long, curled fingernails, it's a good guess none of them have moved a muscle in years. Except for a pale CUSTODIAN standing in a corner, trembling silently. Stranger stands at the threshold, his face obscured by flickering shadows. He scans the living corpses. STRANGER So it's true. He moves slowly among them. STRANGER (cont'd) What sacrifices they made of you all. Warehoused, like rotting pieces of meat. He pauses to lift up a downcast head. Gazes into the shackled face. The eyes are covered by strips of rusted iron, the face by tangled beard. STRANGER (cont'd) Tell me-- is this the better way? I'm sure you've had some time to reflect on it. One by one, THE RECENTLY-DEAD INTRUDERS filter into the room, led by the Jamaican. Blood stipples their clothes, streaks their faces. But they are, in every other sense, fully-restored. Stranger straightens, swivels around to the terrified Custodian. Custodian backpeddles into the wall. STRANGER Which one is Connor MacLeod? CUSTODIAN I-- I don't know... They never told me names... STRANGER (low, seething) Don't. Lie. To. Me. CUSTODIAN I swear. I don't know... Stranger grabs him under the chin, lifts him to his toes. STRANGER You need to understand one thing, my gimpy friend. I don't care about the Game. I don't care about the rules. I don't even care about these other pathetic souls you lock away as a barrier to the Prize. The Custodian stares back, uncomprehending. STRANGER (cont'd) (squeezes his throat) I want Connor MacLeod. Give me MacLeod and I'll leave. And you can go right on pretending that what you do here actually matters. The custodian lifts a shaking finger. RACK FOCUS TO: THE PRISONER IN THE LAST CHAIR Even with an iron slat across his eyes, he is unmistakably Connor MacLeod. Stranger lets go of the custodian, turns... STRANGER Long time. Connor strains to lift his head. His voice comes weak and drug-heavy. CONNOR Who are you...? STRANGER You'll know soon enough. GLINT OF A SWUNG BLADE-- CUT TO: EXT - MONASTERY - NIGHT An unearthly LIGHT pulses through slitted windows and cracked mortar. TENDRILS of RAW ENERGY vein the ancient building, growing BRIGHTER until-- THE WINDOWS EXPLODE OUTWARD with a keening, animal-like HOWL. ABOVE the sky responds with SCREAMING WIND and TORRENTS of RAIN. CUT TO: EXT - PARIS - NIGHT WIND HOWLS over the City of Lights, slicing up the Seine to. . . DUNCAN MACLEOD'S BARGE docked at the quay. EXT - BARGE - NIGHT PUSH IN on DUNCAN MACLEOD, cross-legged in meditation atop the deck. He JOLTS from a series of SUDDEN VIOLENT IMAGES. A FACE, bolted immobile, wrenched in agony. A SWORDBLADE slashing into flesh. FINGERNAILS clawing wood. BLOOD flecking tile. ESSENCE. PHONE. Ringing. Duncan snaps up the receiver, sweat drenched. DUNCAN Yeah? Tiny electric CLICK... . . . then the HISS of an overseas line. WOMAN'S VOICE (filtered) He's dead. DUNCAN Who? CUT TO: A PAYPHONE, SOMEWHERE IN LOWER MANHATTAN In a driving RAIN. A woman's hand holds the receiver to her face, obscuring her features. WOMAN Connor MacLeod. He was killed last night. INT - DUNCAN'S BARGE Duncan reels with a sudden flood of emotions. DUNCAN Who is this?! WOMAN'S VOICE A friend. EXT - PAYPHONE The unidentified woman slowly lowers the receiver and sets it back in the cradle. CUT TO: EXT - PARIS, ESTABLISHING, SUNRISE Shadows crawl across the Parisian skyline as an ENGINE REVS TO 8000 RPM. STREET LEVEL POV: We PUNCH through the ARC DE TRIOMPHE and up the CHAMPS ELYSEE with a throaty FERARRI HOWL. On a WICKED DOWNSHIFT, we SQUEAL HARD RIGHT onto the PONT NEUF, stopping on a franc at EXT - NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL - DAY Duncan hops out of his Ferrari 355 Spyder, pauses before the massive Gothic edifice, then disappears inside. CLOSE ON A CROUCHING STONE GARGOYLE perched atop the highest balustrade. MOVE SIDEWAYS TO REVEAL A SECOND CROUCHING FIGURE, this one human. To many he'll be instantly familiar. Hes METHOS, oldest of all Immortals, gazing down in quiet contemplation. Methos keeps staring at the ground below, sipping bordeaux from a paper cup, even as Duncan joins him at the edge. DUNCAN Methos. METHOS so-- What brings you up here to the aerie of the lesser gods? DUNCAN I need your help. METHOS I'm out of the help business. No future in it. DUNCAN I was told Connor MacLeod was killed last night. Methos' darkens. Another one lost. DUNCAN (cont'd) I just want to know who did it. METHOS (sighs) In our world, does it really matter? DUNCAN It does to me. Methos looks down at the clotted life below. METHOS Did I ever tell you I once kept a vineyard on the very spot where they built this monstrosity? Glorious, the wine. (looks up) When did you see him last? DUNCAN Almost ten years ago. METHOS What did you talk about? DUNCAN Nothing much. METHOS Think back. FLASH TO: INT - PUB (FROM HIGHLANDER 1) - DAY Connor and Duncan hunch over the bar, pounding scotch. DUNCAN We mostly just sat around, downing shots, staring at the beer lights above the bar. When he finally got up to go, he looked at me like it was the last time I'd ever see him again. No goodbye. No handshake. Just got up and left. BACK TO SCENE: Duncan blinks back the memory. DUNCAN (cont'd) Nobody's seen him since. METHOS Describe the look. DUNCAN What do you mean? METHOS Describe it. DUNCAN It was like... FLASH: CONNOR'S FACE DUNCAN (cont'd) . . . Like every death he'd ever caused had come back to haunt him. BACK TO SCENE: Methos takes a thoughtful sip from his wine. METHOS For an Immortal who comes to abhor bloodshed, there's a solution-- a way to be removed from the Game forever. The price is unimaginably high, but you are, for all practical purposes, protected from the violence within yourself. It's called The Sanctuary. DUNCAN I don't understand. METHOS Think of those Buddhist monks who came to cherish life so much that to step on a single insect, to harm a blade of grass was a violation of their creed. They placed themselves into an extreme form of protective custody. A sanctuary of sorts. (beat) What I'm talking about is something similar. But one that doesn't allow for a change of heart. He opens his fingers and watches his cup plummet to the plaza below. Wine SPLATTERS like blood on white marble. METHOS (cont'd) Apparently it was wiped out last night. DUNCAN By who? METHOS I don't know. EXT - ABOVE THE ATLANTIC - DAY A 747 cruises at 40,000 feet. METHOS (O.S.) He left no witnesses. INT - 747 - DAY Duncan stares out the passenger window as the FLIGHT ATTENDANT sets a DRINK down. He lifts the little plastic COCKTAIL SWORD from the glass. Yanks it out of the olive... TRANSITION TO: A BROADSWORD being jerked from a fallen warrior. EXT - 17TH CENTURY BATTLEFIELD - DAWN FOLLOW THE SWORD swinging above a PAIR OF HIDE-BOOTED FEET that tramp across uneven ground littered with CORPSES. FEET STOP at a BLOOD-CAKED BODY, swathed in the shredded colors of a defeated army. On a SWIFT KICK TO THE RIBCAGE-- DUNCAN MACLEOD JERKS UPRIGHT, flailing in spastic fits. DUNCAN GAHHHHHHH! ! He blinks thickly, as if routed from a deep, disorienting slumber. Gapes up at-- A SILHOUETTE that ECLIPSES the rising sun. SILHOUETTE You've better things to do than lie there collecting flies. Duncan puts a hand to his chest, touches the worst of his several lethal wounds. Utter confusion stitches his face. SILHOUETTE (cont'd) I suppose you're wondering how a knock- kneed swordsman with your obvious lack of skill keeps living to fight another day. The figure extends a hand to Duncan. Duncan hesitantly reaches up... DUNCAN (squints) Are you an angel? SILHOUETTE I've been called that. And worse. Duncans hand RECOILS-- SILHOUETTE (cont'd) Rest assured, I'm neither. He hoists Duncan to his feet. Duncan gazes for the first time ever upon the face of CONNOR MACLEOD who smiles back with the gift of untold secrets. CONNOR I'm Connor MacLeod of the Clan MacLeod. And like you, I have a hard time dying. TRANSITION BACK TO: INT - 747 - DAY Duncan's now sitting upright in his seat as the FLIGHT ATTENDANT'S VOICE brings him back to the here and now. FLIGHT ATTENDANT (O.S.) We'll be making our final descent into New York... WHEELS SMACK down onto the runway at JFK. CUT TO: A PHOTOGRAPH OF DUNCAN PULL BACK and see it's his passport, held by a US CUSTOMS OFFICER. He lowers the passport and turns to the long metal case Duncan's brought with him from the plane. CUSTOMS OFFICER Would you open the case, please? Duncan hands the Officer documentation as he sets it on the counter and opens it. Inside is an old, meticulously cared-for Japanese KATANA SWORD. Customs Officer studies Duncan's paperwork, smiles. CUSTOMS OFFICER (cont'd) Get much use for this? DUNCAN You'd be surprised. Duncan shuts the case and continues on. Next MAN in line watches Duncan exit as he hands over his passport. Hang on the PHOTO. We'll remember those steel- gray eyes. INT - CAB, DRIVING - DAY Duncan watches the passing scenery. MUSIC and LANDMARKS familiar from the first "Highlander" sweep past. EXT - NEW YORK SIDE-STREET - DAY Cab WIPES FRAME, leaving Duncan standing before the charred husk of Connor's antique store. Windows boarded, shreds of flapping police tape, the investigators have long since come and gone. INT - ANTIQUE STORE Door SPLINTERS OPEN. Duncan steps inside. In the aftermath of the firebombing, nothing has been spared. Rachel and Connor's richly-cultivated collection has been reduced to a bitter moonscape. One can only shudder at the degree of overkill that went into this attack. Duncan climbs the back stairs to THE SECOND FLOOR LOFT which is even worse. Ash and cinder are virtually all that remain of Connor's home. Pausing at the far wall, Duncan yanks down an old charred tapestry, revealing AN INNER DOOR deliberately hidden from view. He dips down, retrieves a key from under a loose floorboard and opens the heavily- reinforced door. ENTERING he finds himself in a LARGE CIRCULAR ROOM surrounded by a staggering display of ARTIFACTS drawn from centuries of personal history. We're looking at the sum total of Connor MacLeod's existance, stacked floor to ceiling. Duncan moves among the mementos, smiles as he lifts them; an old Scottish coin, pocket flask... a faded PHOTO of himself in a World War I uniform. He pauses at a painting of Connor's wife HEATHER, radiant in simple peasant garb, smiling serenely across the ages. Finally, a tarnished epee that he wields with instant familiarity. TRANSITION TO: INT - FENCING ACADEMY, RAVENNA ITALY (1627) - DAY Duncan's LUNGE misses Connor by a mile. He stumbles upright in a grand hall streaked by SUNLIGHT from floor- to-ceiling windows. Duncan and Connor face off with duelling swords, sporting black waistcoak andd knee breeches in the manner of the times. Several other elegant FENCING PAIRS spar in this most genteel version of the ancient bloodsport, a far cry from the corpse-littered battlefield seen earlier. A little mustachioed PUFFER darts between the duellists with lint brush, pail and towel as Connor and Duncan re- engage in a rapid series of strikes and parries. CONNOR You've improved greatly. DUNCAN You really think so? Connor executes a simple combination that sends'Duncan's sword flying one way, his body the other. CONNOR No. I'm just being gracious. Duncan recovers, sets his feet. Puffer skitters over, brushes the dust off Duncan's coat, dabs his sweat and puffs the back of his hair. Duncan swats him away. They take en-garde position. Connor points his blade. CONNOR (cont'd) Remember, you're only immortal as long as your head remains attached to those shoulders. Duncan lunges again. Misses and hits the deck. CONNOR (cont'd) Which in your case might not be long at all. He puts his blade to Duncan's neck. Humor evaporates. CONNOR (cont'd) What we give up to our adversary in defeat, Duncan... is evervthinq. Duncan stares up at him, uncomprehending. CONNOR (cont'd) We call it "The Quickening"-- our strength, our knowledge, our life essence-- it all flows into the victor, feeds him, makes him stronger, in ways you can't possibly comprehend. It's what drives other Immortals to kill us. And what forces us to be better-- smarter-- than the rest. He takes Duncan by the arm, jerks him to his feet. CONNOR (cont'd) Survival. Learn it. Duncan goes on the attack. What he lacks in technique, he makes up for in determination. Almost. Connor sidesteps Duncan's next lunge, swats his blade flat across Duncan's ass and sends him plowing face-first into the floor. Duncan re-engages Connor in fighting stance. Puffer races up behind Duncan again, meticulously dusts his backside. Reaches around and plucks an unsightly piece of lint off his crotch with thumb and forefinger. DUNCAN (whirls around) You mind?! Connor clucks his tongue. CONNOR (cont'd) Allow me. He squares Duncans shoulders and steps back. Considers. CONNOR (cont'd) Unh uh. He steps up and swivels Duncan around until hes facing the opposite way. CONNOR (cont'd) If you should ever again find yourself backside to a blade... just keep this in mind. He proceeds to take Duncan through a move that's dazzling in it's inherent simplicity-- a move that winds up with Duncan's blade whisking perilously close across Connor's throat. CONNOR (cont'd) It's a coup de fin. He catches Duncan's sword-fist in his own, holds it immobile. CONNOR (cont'd) Properly executed, even you cannot prevent your blade from finding its mark. DUNCAN Properly executed, we'll never have this talk again. Duncan and Connor's eyes lock. They break. TRANSITION BACK TO: INT - CIRCULAR ROOM Duncan suddenly SIEZES UP with a strange disquiet and ringing in the ears known as THE BUZZ. It's the sense of another Immortal. He swings around, reaches for his katana and steps back through the door, swinging it closed as A YOUNG WOMAN appears at the top of the stairs. She saunters toward him, glancing around. She takes her time checking out the place before stepping up to Duncan. The ragged crop of her hair and the slashing trowel application of makeup impart a kind of crazed anti- beauty. Like a post-nuclear Barbi doll. Duncan regards her, intrigued and wary. DUNCAN Who are you? YOUNG WOMAN A friend. Those two words instantly recall the mystery voice on the phone. YOUNG WOMAN (cont'd) Or lover. Or wife. Take your pick. Memory jogs with a sudden lurch. DUNCAN Kate? YOUNG WOMAN Atta boy. 'cept I'm "Faith" now. Part of the makeover. Like it? She runs a playful finger across his chest. FAITH Funny how 'the time slips by, huh? You wake up one day and ohmigod-- Airplanes! DUNCAN Why're you here? FAITH Remember our wedding day, Duncan? I do. She takes him by the hands and leads him into an impromptu dance. FAITH (cont'd) We danced the "Highland Fling." She spins under his arm, circles back into his embrace. FAITH (cont'd) I felt like we were flying. Her sinuous body moves in perfect sync with his. FAITH (cont'd) And that we'd never come down. She spins out of his arms again-- --and SPIN KICKS him across the FACE. BLOOD spatters from his nose and mouth. FAITH (cont'd) Of course, we did come down. Didn't we? (kicks him again) Crashinq. Duncan staggers backward into a concrete stanchion. Recovers. They stand facing each other across a gulf centuries wide. DUNCAN (spitting blood) Why are you here? FAITH Isn't it obvious? I wanted to see you again. Duncan tenses at-- THE ROAR OF APPROACHING MOTORCYCLES. His eyes track the SOUND. It's directly BELOW him. EXT - STREET OUTSIDE ANTIQUE STORE THREE MOTORCYCLES hop the curb, SLICE through the open door to the antique store... INT - ANTIQUE STORE . . . and SPIRAL up the BACK STAIRS. INT - LOFT Duncan's eyes flick upward to a NEW SOUND, directly above him as-- EXT - ROOF - DAY A FOURTH BIKE VAULTS the NARROW GAP between buildings and LANDS. Knobby tires SLAM onto the rooftop, squirrelling wild across the tarred surface before shuddering to a stop. A jackbooted heel digs in and grinds to a stop. Biker suddenly BACKWHEELS around, BLASTS through the ROOF ACCESS DOOR and disappears inside. TWO MORE BIKERS follow suit, SLAMMING DOWN onto the roof like alien invaders. INT - LOFT Duncan reacts. But it's not just the full-throttle howl of approaching bikes. It's the BUZZ of approaching IMMORTALS. THE BIKERS now crest the stairs and fan out into the loft-- Same group we saw outside the monastery. Tricked out in everything from Keds to chainmail, they drag a variety of weapons in their trailing hands-- sword, baseball bat, mace, dao and chain-whip. The tips make a scraping noise across the floor that's deliberately unsettling. They surround Duncan, cutting off any avenue of escape. Nobody moves or speaks. Just the low staccato growl of idling two-stroke engines. Duncan takes a step backward. Looks to Faith. DUNCAN Who're they? FAITH More friends. PAN THE FACES. CARLOS from Bed-Stuy, BUG from Kyoto, WINSTON from Jamaica, SARGE from Shreveport and CRACKER BOB from nowhere in particular. And then there's CALVIN. A swaggering Immortal from the he's traded brute force in on a brand new weapon of choice. A DIGITAL VIDEO CAMERA. CALVIN Make it pretty now. It's the bottom of the ninth. BIKERS DISMOUNT and CONVERGE on Duncan, swinging their weapons to limber up. Duncan backs away. This is unheard of-- Immortals packing like jackals. DUNCAN What-- it's a team sport now? CALVIN (zooming in) Whole new ballgame. THREE IMMORTALS ATTACK. They're good. Duncan's better. About three times better. CALVIN jockeys his camcorder-- GOES IN TIGHT on Duncan. CALVIN Sup with the new blood, huh? Who's gonna lay him out? Take his secret sauce? (swivels around) YOU, Winston? WINSTON, the tall Jamaican, stands off to one side watching, the lone holdout. CALVIN (cont'd) Nope. Too proud. Old school. INTERCUT - VIDEO VIEWFINDER Image lurches and jostles as Calvin mixes it up with the combatants. CALVIN (O.S.) How 'bout you, Carlos? You good for it? Carlos--? CARLOS HURTLES THROUGH FRAME. Lands hard. CALVIN (O.S.) I'll catch you later. SWISH PAN TO: SWORD sparking off chainmail. HANDS AND FEET pounding flesh. BODIES slamming into walls. BLOOD. MAYHEM. PAIN. And Calvin, catching it all, up close and personal. CALVIN (cont'd) Sarge is down. Cracker Bob's down. But Carlos got some kick. Still got some kick. Carlos crawls to his feet, oozing blood and spite. CALVIN (cont'd) Like the man says, you gotta play with the small hurts. Carlos LUNGES-- Duncan lays him out flat again, then swivels around to face-- BUG who straightens up to his full five-foot frame. CALVIN (cont'd) Say hello to my man BUG and his ugly- stick. Bug brandishes a simple metal ROD with a woven grip. Nothing much to speak of... Until he squeezes the grip-- --and SIX BLADES EJECT SIMULTANEOUSLY. The two on each end are SWORD BLADES, one for piercing, one for slashing. Jutting perpendicular to the shaft, like an insane Swiss Army knife, are twin sets of DAGGERS-- two for stabbing and two sawtoothed SWORDBREAKERS. And then there's the shaft itself, if you're in need of a good old-fashioned battering ram. CALVIN (cont'd) Like it? Came from a Tamaric swordsmith. (grins) Who smoked a lotta very wicked stuff. Bug opens up a multi-pronged BARRAGE on Duncan. Duncan adapts to the first assault-- only to find himself reacting to an entirely new set of insane moves. CALVIN (cont'd) Uhp--- Say welcome back to Carlos... Carlos cuts in yet again, swinging for the stands. He fans several times before Duncan backfists him across the nose and dumps him back onto the floor. Duncan spins back to Bug as the wiry Asian lifts his lethal metal rod again and grins. But this time as he SQUEEZES the release mechanism-- --Duncan KICKS IT, shoving it flush against Bug's chest. SNICK SNICK two PIVOTING DAGGERS slice into the dumbstruck Immortal. He falls backward WAILING like a stuck pig. A BOOMING VOICE freezes everyone in their tracks. VOICE That's enough. All eyes converge on: THE STRANGER who stands at a distance, cloaked in murky halflight. STRANGER I'm sorry, Duncan. When it comes to discipline, the first hundred years are the hardest. Duncan lowers his katana, turns to the Stranger as-- CARLOS painfully hauls himself upright and suddenly BULLDOZES Duncan clear through one of the immense loft windows. Duncan's launched AIRBORNE in a plume of shattered glass, still clutching his katana. Carlos hooks an arm around the empty window-frame and watches with unvarnished satisfaction as the body SPIKES onto an upright iron ROD jutting from the construction site below. STRANGER What was that? CARLOS (squinting) Full gainer with a quarter twist. Degree of difficulty-- not very. STRANGER I thought I told you to stop. CARLOS Yeah, well. I stopped. STRANGER (cont'd) Are you challenging my authority? Carlos does his best to ignore him. STRANGER (cont'd) Because the only way to challenge my authority is to kill me. CARLOS (turns away) Hey hey, take it easy, man. STRANGER (cont'd) Is that clear? In the split second it takes Carlos to turn back from the window, the Stranger is right there in his face. CARLOS Shit! STRANGER IS THAT CLEAR? Stranger takes Carlos' sword and yanks it uo to his own neck -. STRANGER (cont'd) Here's your chance. Carlos stares wide-eyed. Pride won't let him back down. Fear won't let him proceed. STRANGER (cont'd) Take it. You won't have another. We can FEEL the SUDDEN HAMMERING of Carlos' HEART. CARLOS You're crazy, man! STRANGER Am I? Then go ahead... (rubs his neck across the blade) Stop the madness. CARLOS Hey-- STRANGER Or walk away... in perpetual fear of your own shadow. (beat) Tell me, Carlos. Can you live with that? Can you live with the fear? Can you live with the weakness? THUMP-THUMP-THUMP-THUMP-- STRANGER (cont'd) Weakness, Carlos. Isn't that why you're here with me? Isn't that why youre ALL here with me?! Face it, you're nothing but. . . (savoring) . . . cattle. Blood POUNDS in Carlos' eyes. He YANKS back the sword, CRIES OUT and SLASHES for the Stranger's neck. CLOSE ON STRANGER'S HAND as it catches his wrist and diverts the blade around to Carlos' own throat, wedging it up tight under his chin. STRANGER (cont'd) God loves you. I don't. In one vicious UP-SLICE, Stranger cuts through bone and sinew, stopping just short of a clean sever. Carlos gags and gurgles in liquid protest. STRANGER (cont'd) (whispers) They say the worst part, Carlos, is those last few seconds when you find yourself staring at your own headless body. SNICK-- He sends Carlos' head tumbling to the floor. STRANGER (cont'd) Of course it's pure speculation, since nobody ever lives to tell about it. HOLD ON CARLOS' EYES staring in pure, unknowable horror at his own body, twitching several yards away. A tiny ARC of electrical ESSENCE crackles from the neck... THE OTHERS bear mute witness to the GLOWING TENDRILS of ENERGY that stutter across the walls and ceiling. EXT - CONSTRUCTION SITE BELOW Duncan lies IMPALED on a JUTTING SHAFT OF RE-BAR as an UNMARKED PANEL VAN screeches INTO FRAME. His eyes stare sightless upward as THE LOFT WINDOWS EXPLODE with unearthly HOWLS of stretching metal and pulverizing concrete. SHOCKWAVES strafe the walls, blowing out mortar and brick. POWER LINES SNAP and LASH against the building, spitting fiery plumes of SPARKS. INT - LOFT Seen from behind, the Stranger absorbs the QUICKENING in a series of wild electro-shock convulsions. EXT - CONSTRUCTION SITE BELOW Several darkly-clad MEN jump from the panel van and race up to Duncan. With pit crew efficiency, one takes a mondo set of BOLT CUTTERS to the metal stake while the others grab Duncan by the arms and ankles. A fourth throws open the cargo door. Snap-lift... they TOSS Duncan in the back of the van. INT - LOFT, SAME Arms outstretched and rigid, head thrown back in silent rapture, the Stranger RISES slowly off the floor, suspended Christ-like in the air. BLINDING HALOES of PURE RADIANT ESSENCE engulf him, a lifeforce beyond human understanding. THE OTHERS watch transfixed. They've seen it all before, but it never ceases to amaze and terrify them. CUT TO: DARKNESS Which becomes a harsh blast of LIGHT. DUNCAN'S EYES flutter open, squint at the glare. He's strapped to the same Giger-like chair, immobilized. Standing around him are hooded members of that same monk-like order in what is, essentially, a dungeon. One of them, MATTHEW, steps forward. His steel-gray eyes are familiar. He's the one who followed Duncan through customs. As he reaches to cinch closed one of the iron cuffs with a thick metal dowel, he reveals a distinctive TATTOO across his inner forearm. One that Duncan instantly recognizes. _ DUNCAN Watchers? Matthew simply nods. DUNCAN Watchers observe. They don't interfere. MATTHEW True. And we were more than happy to perform our traditional function. Believe me, it's a whole lot easier charting the history of Immortals than it is running a day care center for them. Unfortunately our role has changed somewhat. DUNCAN Why? MATTHEW Because the rules have been broken. DUNCAN Not by me. MATTHEW You're not the one we're worried about. Matthew moves to the other side of the chair. Pegs the arm cuff and ratchets down a redundant set of bindings. MATTHEW (cont'd) One of your kind has gone renegade. In doing so he's gained himself a sizeable advantage. One that will be impossible to overcome. DUNCAN Nobody's unbeatable. MATTHEW He's surrounded himself with Immortals loyal only to him. He uses holy ground as a safe haven. And every head taken in battle is reserved for him alone, each Quickening-- hundreds upon hundreds-- taken by just one man. Yes, Duncan. He is unbeatable. Matthew pours a Scotch. Glenmorangie. Holds it to Duncan's lips like the final offering to a condemned man. MATTHEW (cont'd) Worse still, far worse, is that he's become a perversion to the Game. And if he prevails, that perversion will resonate through everything we know. For eternity. In ways we can't possibly comprehend. Duncan tugs at his bonds. Knows what's in store for him. MATTHEW (cont'd) There must always be two of your kind. As long as there are two, and they're kept from fighting, the Prize is safe. The Sanctuary must continue. DUNCAN Get yourself another volunteer. MATTHEW We had a number of "volunteers." Sadly, that's no longer the case. Another WATCHER steps up and forces an IRON FACE SHACKLE down over Duncan's head. MATTHEW (cont'd) You'll be warehoused. Hidden away. So the Prize can remain safe. Duncan struggles frantically against his bonds. DUNCAN You're insane! MATTHEW For the world, Duncan. We do this for the world... The Watcher takes two large BOLTS and begins to screw the mask directly into Duncan's skull. DUNCAN'S POV: BLACKNESS, accompanied by BRIGHT SEARING FLASHES of AGONY. MATTHEW'S VOICE (cont'd) Don't worry. The drugs should kick in momentarily. All external SOUND is slowly DROWNED OUT by the POUNDING IN HIS OWN BRAIN. A POUNDING interspersed with jarring, synaptic flashes of BATTLE. Killing. Dying. Killing again. Dying again. The recycling nightmare finally RECEDES back into NOTHINGNESS. Then, a NEW SOUND. Distant. Grind of metal on bone. Bolts being unscrewed. Iron plate lifts from his eyes, flood of LIGHT. Once again, Duncan SQUINTS up at a FACE. This time, the blurred, swimming features of a familiar Irish-American mug. DUNCAN (WOOZY) Dawson... JOE DAWSON, familiar to many as Duncan's one friend inside the Watchers, smiles back. DAWSON You look like shit. DUNCAN How... long...? DAWSON Week, maybe longer. We can't talk here. (unstraps Duncan) We gotta go. Dawson reacts to the sound of APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS. DAWSON (cont'd) (urgently) Now. Can you walk? DUNCAN Think so. He takes one step and pitches forward onto his face. DUNCAN (cont'd) Potent whiskey. He clambers to his feet and follows Dawson out of the chamber. EXT - ARMORY - NIGHT Dawson and Duncan emerge from a nondescript cinderblock armory, an overgrown Cold War relic recently co-opted by the Watchers. They duck some scurrying guards, plow through thick underbrush to A HIDDEN CAR and climb inside. INT - CAR, TRAVELLING - NIGHT DUNCAN You knew about The Sanctuary. DAWSON Just because I'm a Watcher, doesn't mean I'm always in the loop. DUNCAN I don't buy that. Dawson averts his gaze. Stares ahead. DAWSON I really struggled with it, y'know, the idea of keeping guys on ice like that. But I couldn't argue with the logic. Least not 'til they went after you. (squeals hard onto the main drag) Guess that put it a little too close to home. DUNCAN I owe you. Dawson slides Duncan's katana out from under the seat. Hands it over. DAWSON Do me a favor, buddy. Live to pay me back. DUNCAN What happened to the bodies? Dawson winces slightly. Keeps driving. DUNCAN (cont'd) C'mon, Joe. DAWSON Listen-- I got you outta one jam. Don't push your luck. DUNCAN I need to see them. DAWSON They're dead. Trust me. DUNCAN Was one of them Connor MacLeod? DAWSON Yes. DUNCAN Let me see the bodies. DAWSON The heads are gone. You really don't wanna go there. DUNCAN I have to, Joe. I have to know. Dawson jerks the car to a sudden shuddering stop. DAWSON Alright... Alright-- If I tell you, that's it, I'm outta here! You're on your own! I can't be a part of this, OK?! DUNCAN OK. DAWSON OK. Dawson stares at Duncan. A beat, then: DAWSON Fuck. I'm a part of it. He throws the car back into gear and fishtails back onto the road. CUT TO: A VIEW THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD of a forlorn and forgotten CEMETERY. Nothing marks its perimeter but a toppled gate and some trampled barbed wire. DAWSON It was a Christian burial. Decent. They said all the right words. DUNCAN I can't begin to tell you how reassuring that is. Pull over. WIDE Dawson pulls over. He and Duncan get out of the car. DAWSON Needless to say, with a dozen unexplainable corpses, they had to go a bit off the beaten track. EXT - CEMETERY - SUNSET From here it looks like just a barren hillside littered with broken and crumbling marble. CLOSER Duncan and Dawson tramp up the shallow incline. DAWSON (cont'd) What do you think you're gonna find when you get up there? DUNCAN I don't know. DAWSON I'm not digging. Get that through your skull right now. Not these hands... CRESTING THE RIDGE Twelve freshly-mounded graves come into view, gouged into the rubbled downslope like wounds, each set off by a simple wooden cross. Duncan stops when he reaches the first grave. Stiffens. DAWSON What? Duncan remains frozen, staring, seemingly at nothing. DAWSON (cont'd) My dog used to do that with locked closets. I hate that. DUNCAN Shh. Dawson listens. Nothing but the soft moan of WIND. DUNCAN (cont'd) He's here. DAWSON Tell me I'm not here for a seance. Duncan squints. Feels the BUZZ. Slight, but unmistakable. WHAT HE SEES: A row of stunted oaks, thick and gnarled againt the setting sun. CLOSER. . . Standing against the trunk, silhouette on silhouette, is the ghostly form of a MAN. Barely discernible, his features are hidden in shadow. Duncan slowly approaches the figure. Dawson hangs back, nervous and slightly twitchy. CLOSER STILL... The figure steps up to greet Duncan. Sunlight brightens the face of CONNOR MACLEOD who smiles as he embraces Duncan in the traditional bear- crush of Scottish clansmen. DUNCAN Sorry I missed your funeral. CONNOR All told, it was a bit underwhelming. DUNCAN So it would seem. They break. The brief joy suddenly drains from Connor's face-- his eyes speak of diffuse, faraway suffering. CONNOR Why are you here? DUNCAN Ten years ago you skipped out on a bartab. Connor's expression hardens. CONNOR You need to know something... He steps up to Duncan, locks eyes. CONNOR (cont'd) Every life I touch ends. Brutally. And for no reason. It's a curse that's followed me for centuries. I can't outrun it and I can't outlive it. (beat) You're my last friend in this world, Duncan. I left for your own good. It was better that you didn't know where. DUNCAN The Sanctuary. CONNOR Yes. The Sanctuary. DUNCAN But you escaped. CONNOR No, I didn't escape... FLASH BACK TO THE SANCTUARY as the STRANGER moves toward a shackled Connor MacLeod. CONNOR (V.O.) ...I was freed. As before, the immobilized Connor stirs in a drug-addled haze. CONNOR Who are you? STRANGER You'll know soon enough. CONNOR'S POV - THROUGH THE BOTTOM EDGE OF HIS FACEPLATE All Connor can see is the Stranger's HAND as it reaches down and PULLS THE PIN from one of Connor's arm shackles. The cuff FALLS OPEN. Stranger turns away. A beat later come the unmistakable SOUNDS of SLAUGHTER that fill the room to a DEAFENING CRESCENDO. CONNOR (V.O.) I couldn't see the slaughter. I only heard it. BACK TO CEMETERY: We can still see the agony playing out in Connor's eyes. He turns away, sees JOE DAWSON still standing on the ridge, swatting at the occasional deerfly. CONNOR Who's he? DUNCAN The reason I didn't become your replacement. Dawson casually removes one of his legs and vigorously shakes it upside down. CONNOR What's he doing now? DUNCAN Sand in the shoe would be my guess. Connor suddenly gazes beyond Dawson to THE NEXT HILLSIDE and the FAINT SOUND OF APPROACHING MOTORCYCLES. He stiffens. CONNOR You were followed. One by one, a HALF-DOZEN MOTORCYCLISTS crest the surrounding hills and come to a menacing stop. DUNCAN Yeah. I was meaning to tell you about those guys. Dawson fumbles to put his leg back on. Hops a full 360 as he watches the intruders surround them. TWO MORE approach on foot, following the same path Duncan and Dawson took. One is Faith. The other, The Stranger. Except he's no stranger to Connor MacLeod. Far from it. Connor goes rigid. Breathing stops. His nightmare's finally taken human form. MOVE IN for our first clear look at JACOB KASE striding forward, bigger than death. His is a face hewn by Gods sharpest blade, every angle cold, remorseless, Puritannical. As before, he's clad in basic black, accented by the stark white of a priest's collar. CONNOR (ice) Jacob Kase... Connor edges back his coat. Hand seeks out the grip of his sword. Duncan grabs his arm. DUNCAN Not here. CONNOR Walk away, Duncan. Kase and Faith continue toward them. Connor's rage seems to ratchet up with every step. DUNCAN You're on holy ground. Remember the rules... Pure, radiating hate seethes in Connor's eyes. CONNOR The rules be damned. Kase stops, inches from Connor's face. Cooly regards the sword. KASE Look at you. You'd think after half a millenium, you'd learn to keep that you'd learn to keep that temper of yours in check. Gone is any trace of brogue. He's a fully-assimilated New Yorker now. Connor's fingers tighten around the swordgrip... CONNOR Just tell me where, Kase. KASE If all I wanted was to kill you, you'd have been dead a very long time ago, Connor. Something roils under Kase's controlled exterior. A rage every bit as consuming as Connor's. KASE (cont'd) But your death alone could never appease the innocent souls you slaughtered. FLASH TO SEVERAL OF GLENFINNAN'S VILLAGERS being MOWED DOWN by Connor's mindless fury. KASE (cont'd) It couldn't even begin to appease mine. FLASH TO KASE as he drops to his knees, gagging blood, RUN THROUGH by Connor's blade. KASE (cont'd) Worst of all, you murdered a man of God. Who raised me as his son. FLASH TO A FATHER RAINEY as Connor brings his sword CLEAVING DOWN on him. KASE (cont'd) ...and no punishment conceived by man can ever atone for that. AFTERMATH OF MASSACRE Scattered wisps of smoke gambol across the demolished commons, leading up to the CORPSE of JACOB KASE. KASE (cont'd) What you never could have expected was that you'd leave behind this one humble servant... Kase's body lies there as cold as the Highland dawn. KASE (cont'd) ...who would trade eternity itself to make you pay. HIS EYES snap open. And we're once again TRANSPORTED BACK TO: EXT - CEMETERY - DAY Kase steps closer, revelling in this moment. KASE Look back over the endless travesties of your life and you'll see me. Always there, waiting in the shadows. (beat) When friends and lovers are wiped from your sight, I'm there. KASE (cont'd) When those you cherish die abruptly and for no reason, I'm there. (kicks a clod of dirt onto a grave) And when a handful of misguided and pathetic idiots just happen to share your own private hell... (shrugs) Guess who? He walks a full circle around Connor. All the while Kase addresses Connor, Faith never takes her eyes off Duncan. KASE (cont'd) But if you think it ends here, my ancient friend, you're wrong. Very... Very... Wrong. Kase turns back to Faith. Pulls his sword and without warning SLICES it across her throat. Faith reflexively GASPS, stumbles backward, leaving-- A WOOD AND SILVER CRUCIFIX dangling on Kase's swordtip. FOLLOW THE CRUCIFIX as he swings it around and offers it up to Connor. KASE Thought you might be wanting this. I kept it for you... FLASH TO CONNOR'S MOTHER, bound to the stake as Kase rips the crucifix from her neck. BACK TO SCENE: Connor stares down at the crucifix now in his open palm. KASE (cont'd) For old times' sake. Kase puts an arm around Faith. KASE (cont'd) Want to find me again, Connor? Just put your hands together... KASE (cont'd) (winks) And pray. He gives Faith a little shove and they both start downhill. THE SURROUNDING BIKERS gun their engines and ride off on billowing plumes of dust. Connor makes no move to follow. Strangely silent and impassive, he's like a warrior gutted by an invisible sword. Duncan puts a hand on his shoulder. DUNCAN Whatever it is... Connor swipes away Duncan's hand, starts walking. DUNCAN (cont'd) I can help you, Connor. Connor stops, swivels back. Eyes dead. CONNOR Nobody can help me. He walks off alone, a ghost against a sea of gravestones, DUNCAN CONNOR-- Duncan watches his friend depart, helpless. Turning back, he sees FAITH AND KASE stopped halfway down the hill. They seem to be arguing. Kase turns abruptly and strides off. CLOSE ON FAITH She stands there a moment, sullenly rubbing her throat. Duncan's VOICE spins her back around. DUNCAN (O.S.) Problem? FAITH I get a bit fussy whenever somebody points a sword at me. (dry) Goes a long way back. Their eyes fix on one another. Air thickens. Buzzes with electricity. DUNCAN Just one question. After all these years. . . (re: Kase) Why him? Faith glances down at Kase, who stands waiting at the base of the hill. Considers. FAITH Because I've never known anyone who had such an amazing capacity for hate. (beat) Except me. On that, she brushes past Duncan and rejoins Kase. TRANSITION TO: EXT - IRISH COUNTRYSIDE, 17TH CENTURY - DAY Duncan and Connor ride side by side on horseback. They reach a RIVERBANK where a YOUNG WOMAN and her elderly CONSORT are detained at a crude wooden TOLL GATE. Eight or nine disreputable-looking HIGHWAYMEN surround their carriage. Connor rides up to what would appear to be the LEADER. He has the most teeth. CONNOR What's going on? HIGHWAYMAN The lady here refuses to pay her toll. CONNOR Toll for what? HIGHWAYMAN Passage over the bridge. Connor cranes his eyes, upriver and down. CONNOR I see no bridge. HIGHWAYMAN What do you think pays for the bridge? Connor considers, then turns back to the lady with a shrug. CONNOR The man has a point. Despite her sweeping auburn hair and natural beauty, we now recognize the young woman as FAITH from an earlier era. Her original name is CATHERINE MARY DEVANEY. CATHERINE These men are liars and scoundrels. Theyve preyed upon us three years running. CONNOR This true? HIGHWAYMAN A good sturdy bridge is not an overnight accomplishment, Sir. CONNOR Exactly what, may I ask, have you accomplished so far? HIGHWAYMAN (proudly) The tollgate. Duncan trots around the tollgate and up alongside Connor. He leans over to the highwayman. DUNCAN Excuse me, but by whose authority do you act? HIGHWAYMAN (holds up scroll) By deed of the King. DUNCAN Might I see that? Highwayman slowly unravels the parchment scroll. The nearly-illegible scrawl suggests random words copied by an illiterate. DUNCAN (cont'd) Does the King always sign his name with an "X"? Highwayman's cronies reach for their swords. HIGHWAYMAN He was in a hurry. All eyes hover on Duncan's reaction. Two of the highwaymen edge around behind Catherine and her elderly consort, ready to gut them both at a moment's notice. Duncan tracks them with his eyes. DUNCAN (nods) Busy man, the King. (to Catherine) I suggest you pay the gentlemen and be on your way. CATHERINE His deed is a fake! DUNCAN That's a matter of opinion. CATHERINE You, Sir, are no better than they! DUNCAN That's also a matter of opinion. (to Connor) Shall we? Connor sizes up his young protege'. Gives a dubious nod. CONNOR Lead on. CATHERINE You can't just leave! DUNCAN You're right... He tosses a handful of gold coins to the Highwayman. DUNCAN (cont'd) Good luck with the bridge. He kicks his horse into a brisk trot. Connor reluctantly follows suit. They cross the river through ankle-deep water. CONNOR I can't believe you gave those bastards your money. DUNCAN It wasn't my money. Duncan pulls a cinched canvas BAG overstuffed with coins from his overcoat. DUNCAN (cont'd) It was theirs. RACK FOCUS TO the duped HIGHWAYMEN scrambling onto their horses and riding hard in frantic pursuit. They hit the river at a gallop, kicking up giant shimmering fantails of water. DUNCAN (cont'd) By the time they reach us, the young lady and her escort should be safely out of harms way. The pursuers close the gap in seconds. Connor grins approvingly. Draws his sword and glances over at Duncan. CONNOR Shall we? Duncan FLICKS his own sword, lets the hilt auto-rotate around his open palm and snaps it vertical. He nods back at Connor. DUNCAN Let's. Together, they whirl around to face the onrushing horde. THEY BATTLE in the middle of the shallow river. Nine maniacal thieves against two sporting Immortals. The spray of water, the slashing of swords and the pounding of hooves all build to an operatic crescendo. Duncan's improved since Ravenna. He easily scatters three of his adversaries before engaging the blood-crazed LEADER. This time it's Connor who finds himself in trouble. He tumbles from his horse and goes down, losing his sword in the river. DUNCAN suddenly winds back and FLINGS his sword at his opponent like a throwing dagger. BLADE whistles past the dumbstruck highwayman's head. Which was not the intended target... . . .as we discover when we follow it's end-over-end flight. . . . . . straight into CONNOR'S OUTSTRETCHED HAND. Connor parries his attackers, drives them backward onto their asses, then swivels around and TOSSES the sword back to DUNCAN, who catches it, ducks the highwayman's next swing and swiftly sends him packing. CONNOR recovers his own sword, which is enough to send the last of their attackers into a full-on, stumbling retreat. They both stand watching as THE CARRIAGE jostles safely across the river. CLOSE ON CATHERINE as she looks back at Duncan. She gives Duncan a knowing smile that's as innocent as it is seductive. CONNOR (watching Duncan) You know that stirring in your gut? It's not just simple lust, my friend. DUNCAN I know... CONNOR Ah, but do you really? MATCH CUT TO: FAITH as she and Kase drive away from the cemetery in a late model convertible. EXT - CEMETERY - SUNSET Joe Dawson walks up to Duncan. DAWSON I feel like I stepped in on the wrong party. Duncan keeps watching the convertible until it disappears over the next rise. DUNCAN (quietly) Let's go. CUT TO: EXT - BAR - NIGHT We recognize this place. It's where Connor and Duncan shared a last drink together. Duncan and Joe Dawson now hunch over that same bar, staring into their drinks. DAWSON I swear, the man's a walking ghost. EXT - SIDEWALK - NIGHT FEET pound pavement. DAWSON (V.O.) (CONT'D) Whatever it is he's carrying around inside him, it's like he's dead already. Glare of streetlights rake across Connor's face, his eyes fixed forward as if driven by a sense more powerful than sight. Connor bumps shoulders with a passing PEDESTRIAN. PEDESTRIAN Eyy man-- watch it. He continues on, oblivious. INT - BAR - NIGHT Duncan turns to Dawson. DUNCAN There are things you do in this life that damn you for eternity. They can't be changed. And they can't be undone. You carry these things to the grave, Joe, in the hopes that maybe, just maybe, you'll find some peace there. Some relief, even if it's oblivion. (hollow smile) But Immortals don't die. We just go on reliving our sins. Over and over again. EXT - ANOTHER STREET - LATER Connor stops. Lifts his eyes to the light. A SOLITARY STONE CHURCH stands before him in a bed of crawling mist. It seems eerily out of place amid the urban blight around it. INT - BAR - NIGHT Duncan downs the last of his drink, shoves off from the bar. Dawson glances warily up at him. DAWSON Where now? DUNCAN There were two places I figured Connor was likely to go. One of 'em was here. DAWSON And the other? DUNCAN You're the "Watcher." You tell me. EXT - STONE CHURCH - NIGHT Connor climbs the steps, presses through the heavy wooden doors... INT - CHURCH . . . and prowls slowly through the dimly-lit interior. Icon SHADOWS loom large and menacing. JUMP CUT: He moves along the stations of the cross. JUMP CUT: He's stalking through the nave. JUMP CUT: Barging into the sacristy. EXT - DAWSON'S CAR, DRIVING - NIGHT Dawson's car screams past with a doppler howl. DAWSON (O.S.) It's an old abandoned church just off Canal... INT - DAWSON'S CAR - SAME Dawson's behind the wheel, gunning through narrow back streets. DAWSON . . . Perfect safe haven for a so-called priest, huh? "Our Lady of Sorrows." (dry) Kinda has a nice ring to it. He fishtails around the next corner. Recovers. DAWSON (cont'd) I'll tell ya this-- if he's going after Kase, he's in for a rude awakening. The man's untouchable. DUNCAN So they tell me. INT - CHURCH SANCTUARY - NIGHT Connor stops before the darkened altar, senses BUZZING. THE SHADOWED CRUCIFIX stirs. Arms lift in the darkness. Jacob Kase steps down off the cross, lingers in shadow. KASE I would grant you absolution. If I were a better man. He turns and disappears out the back. Connor follows. Right past KASE'S POSSE OF IMMORTALS scattered throughout the pews, who simply track him with their eyes but make no move to follow. WINSTON, the tall Jamaican, leans over to Faith. WINSTON You know we're next, don't you? Faith lowers the book she's reading-- the Holy Bible. Looks up. FAITH What? WINSTON Our days are numbered. You can see it in Kase's eyes. FAITH Do you believe in a hereafter, Winston? WINSTON All I know is I won't be hereafter Jacob Kase gets through with me. And that's all I care about right now. Faith leans back against the hardback pew, closes her eyes. FAITH Yeah... CUT TO: EXT - REAR OF CHURCH - NIGHT Kase strides just beyond the perimeter of the church grounds, then turns back to Connor. Connor draws his sword, moves on Kase. KASE The ancient samurai vowed never to draw blood in anger. It defiled their sense of purpose. (draws his own sword) Of course they're also somewhat extinct. He steps fearlessly up to Connor, places his neck against Connor's swordblade... . . . just like he did with a certain late Immortal named Carlos. CLOSE ON KASE'S SWORD He opens his fingers and lets the sword DROP. It clatters useless to the ground. KASE Would you slaughter an unarmed man of God again, Connor? Would that finally put your soul to rest? (low, taunting) Then go ahead. Send me home. BLOOD POUNDS with the rage pulsing through Connor's veins. KASE (cont'd) What's stopping you? Guilt? The nagging sense that maybe you, more than I, deserve to die? Dawson's car pulls up in the background. Duncan jumps out. KASE (cont'd) Or somewhere along the way did you just lose your nerve? Connor's sword digs into Kase's neck. Breaks skin. DUNCAN (approaching) Don't do it, Connor. CONNOR (gritted) Keep back. KASE (to Duncan) You heard him. No Immortal can interfere with another's duel. DUNCAN He's playing you! Step back onto holy ground before it's too late-- Kase faces back to Connor. KASE Go ahead-- what better chance than now? Take your shot. DUNCAN Don't listen to him! KASE Do it. For your sweet mother... FLASH Caiolin burns at the stake. Suddenly startled, KASE (cont'd) Your Huguenot bitch in Navarre... FLASH rears back, THROWS Suddenly startled, the HORSE bearing a FRENCH DUCHESS her to the ground, breaking her neck. KASE (cont'd) Brenda Wyatt... FLASH BRENDA WYATT ("Highlander 1") is seen walking in CENTRAL PARK. A HIT-AND-RUN DRIVER MOWS HER DOWN from behind. KASE (cont'd) Rachel Ellenstein... FLASH RACHEL is BLOWN APART in the antique store she shared with Connor. KASE (cont'd) Tell me-- do they even begin to equal the devastation of an entire village? BLADE TREMBLES in Connor's hands. Kase presses his neck even harder against Connor's blade. BLOOD trickles down his neck. KASE (cont'd) So close. Soooo close... Duncan stands by, helpless to intervene. KASE (cont'd) Look at you. Even now, you're afraid you'll lose. That's your true fear isn't it? (whispers low, seductive) Oh, it's not the dying, my friend. I know that. That would be a blessing. It's the thought of giving up your essence to me. Making me even stronger by it. One look in Connor's eyes and you know he's right. KASE (cont'd) What's wrong? (almost a purr) Don't you want to be inside me? Connor slowly LOWERS his sword... and FLICKS Kase's discarded sword back up into his hands. Kase simply smiles and takes position. Duncan can only look on helplessly as Kase takes the first offensive, driving Connor backward with dazzling -- almost casual-- swordplay. KASE I've taken more heads than you can possibly imagine. His sword whistles across Connor's face, opens a THREE INCH GASH over his eye. KASE (cont'd) Do you really want a taste of all those accumulated quickenings? Connor stumbles backward again, blinded by his own dripping blood. Knows beyond a shadow of a doubt he's doomed. Duncan knows it too. And it's killing him to watch. Still Connor won't go down easy. He manages a brief offensive, walking Kase backward on his toes. Kase puts one hand behind his back, fencing-style, and goes to work on Connor's torso, crosshatching him in blood. Connor lunges wildly. Kase parries effortlessly. Kase now opens up a BLINDING BARRAGE on Connor. It's like duelling against lightning, so quick and unpredictable are Kase's strikes. Constantly off balance, Connor still manages to NICK Kase in the cheek. KASE (cont'd) (touches scratch) I'd almost forgotten what that felt like. Thank you. He now turns it on full. Drives Connor up against a wall and pins him with his swordtip. His eyes go impossibly cold. KASE I want you to think back to this moment in the endless nights ahead. And know that every time you close your eyes, from now to eternity, I'll be there. (beat) Ripping apart the ones you care about most. He removes his sword and steps back. KASE (cont'd) It's not over, Connor MacLeod. It will never, never be over. He turns and walks back toward the church. Duncan does not step aside to let him pass-- their shoulders bump. KASE (cont'd) You, on the other hand, are on borrowed time. He continues on, past the other Immortals who have gathered to watch the unfolding spectacle. One-by-one, they turn and file back into the church behind Kase. Connor stares into Duncan's eyes as if wanting to say something. Can't. Instead, he turns and starts limping out across the empty lot. Feeling the presence of another Immortal, Duncan slowly looks over at FAITH who stands at a distance. Watching him. As their eyes meet, she, too, turns and melts back into the surrounding blackness. TRANSITION TO: EXT - DUBLIN ROWHOUSE (17TH CENTURY) - DAY A BEARDED BRAWLER CRASHES DOWN onto a wooden table. He takes the table cloth with him as he TUMBLES head over heels onto the floor in a cascade of soda bread and cabbage. Miraculously (unless you're an Irishman) he spills not one drop of precious Guinness, which he hoists in a cheery salute to: THE BRIDE AND GROOM who sit laughing in the eye of an Irish hurricane. DUNCAN MACLEOD and CATHERINE MARY (KATE) DEVANEY-- aka "Faith"-- are a stunning couple that inspire joyful madness. Things have progressed nicely since their chance encounter at the toll crossing. BRAWLER Let's have at it! They kiss to a CHORUS of BOOS. So this time they REALLY KISS. Crowd goes wild. AROUND THEM REVELERS DANCE and FIGHT with equal abandon, making it almost impossible to tell the difference. But they stop like clockwork for every new toast and testimonial. THE BEARDED BRAWLER spears his mug into the air like a royal scepter. BRAWLER Happy is the bride that sees the sun! Sorry the corpse that sees the rain! CLOSE ON BEER MUG framed in a perfect BEAM of SUNLIGHT streaming through an open window. FOLLOW THE SUNBEAM TO: KATE who smiles back with her own inner radiance. Bedecked in flowers, her brown hair sweets low over white lace shoulders and cream skin. She leans over RAUCOUS CHEERS and kisses Duncan, provoking a new RIOT of and UPRAISED GLASSES. THE PIPERS resplendent in their Celtic kilts, launch into the "Highland Fling. Kate is instantly YANKED up onto her feet and into a ROUSING JIG. Before Duncan can protest, he's HOISTED from his seat and FLUNG onto the dance floor. Duncan and Kate link arms, goaded on by a circle of shouting, stumbling CLAPPERS. With each new upshift in tempo, they spin faster and faster until they're hanging on for dear life. SIGHT AND SOUND gradually blur into a queasy sense of vertigo. But for Duncan, it's not just the headstrong mix of drink and passion. It's the BUZZ of another Immortal. He spins to a stop as his eyes come to rest on CONNOR MACLEOD who enters the room on a wave of silence. Duncan breaks away from Kate, crosses over to Connor and wraps him in a bear hug. DUNCAN About time. I was beginning to wonder. CONNOR I was on a junk in the South China Sea when I got your notice. 12 hours ago. DUNCAN How...? CONNOR Don't ask. Kate spins by on the arm of a new partner. KATE You're next, Connor MacLeod. CONNOR That better be no idle threat. Duncan watches Kate with a rapturous smile. DUNCAN Well, I finally did it! CONNOR So it would appear. DUNCAN What do you think of her? CONNOR You know that's not an easy answer. The edge in his voice is not lost on Duncan. CONNOR (cont'd) Outside. EXT - PORCH - NIGHT Connor stands with Duncan at the railing, staring out into the encroaching night. CONNOR You know she's like us. DUNCAN Yes. I sensed it the day we met her. CONNOR So you know that, like us, her immortality can only be triggered by the shock of a violent death. Duncan looks off, as if purging the thought from his head. CONNOR (cont'd) It's what makes warriors of us all, Duncan. Good or bad, there seems a purpose to it. DUNCAN Yes. And without such a death, she'll simply grow old and die like any other. Is that what you dragged me out here to tell me? Connor removes a uniquely-braided GOLDEN ROPE from his vest pocket. It catches the candlelight with the glint of a thousand silken threads as he runs it lightly over his fingertips. CONNOR Many years after I was married, I came home to find Heather sitting on a stool in the kitchen, with a knife in one hand... and her hair in the other. FLASH TO: HEATHER, early-forties, her hair shorn to the scalp. She looks up at Connor with red-rimmed eyes and a bitter smile. CONNOR (cont'd) At first I was scared. Scared that she'd gone mad. And then angry, as if she'd somehow meant to hurt me by it. BACK TO CONNOR AND DUNCAN: CONNOR (cont'd) When I asked her why she'd done such a thing to herself, her answer cut me to the quick. She said it was the one part of her that would not age. It would forever remain the same as when I first fell in love with her. FLASH TO: CONNOR burying Heather in a simple grave overlooking their home. Tears streak his face. He sinks to his knees in unspeakable anguish. CONNOR (cont'd) And that's how she wanted me to remember her. BACK TO CONNOR AND DUNCAN: Connor closes his fingers around the braid. Squeezes. CONNOR (cont'd) It's all I have now. DUNCAN I love Kate. I'll hold on to her as long as I can. That's all I can do. Kate can be seen through the window behind them, exchanging dance partners with dizzying abandon. CONNOR If that's your intent, so be it. Duncan swings over the rail and hops off the porch. Takes to the ground in long angry strides. EXT - COBBLED STREET - NIGHT Conner walks double time to catch up with him. DUNCAN Why are you telling me this? CONNOR Because I once loved a woman more than life itself. And I watched her die. Unlike you, I had no other choice. DUNCAN And I have a choice?! What would you have me tell her?! CONNOR I'd tell her nothing. She wouldn't believe you. They never do when it involves themselves. DUNCAN Then I can do nothing. CONNOR She's in the flower of her youth. Enjoy the moment and let it pass. If you think you can. Duncan suddenly grabs Connor's shoulder, spins him around. DUNCAN You'd have me kill her?! Is that it?! Is that what you came all this way to tell me on my WEDDING NIGHT?! CONNOR I'd have you do what your heart-- and our conscience-- demand. Duncan settles. Searches his eyes. DUNCAN And if it were you in my place? Connor ponders. Then shakes his head. CONNOR I thank God I never had the choice. He listens to the faint strains of music and laughter carried on the rising WIND. CONNOR (cont'd) Tell Catherine I'm sorry I couldn't stay longer. He clasps Duncan by the forearm. Then turns and continues n down the cobbled lane leading from the wedding party. TRANSITION BACK TO: INT - SOHO HOTEL - NIGHT Duncan lies sleepless in a nouveau-stark hotel room, somewhere in the bowels of Manhattan. A half-empty bottle of Glenmorangie is there for company. The door CREAKS OPEN, casting a single ribbon of light across the room. It WIDENS to REVEAL THE SILHOUETTE OF A WOMAN. Duncan closes his eyes. Feigns sleep. She pads silently inside. Pulls the door closed. Duncan remains still, breathing heavily. The woman steals slowly up to the bedside. Pauses, as if quietly studying Duncan-- --then swings her leg up and straddles him. Even in the murky halflight, he can still make out the familiar painted eyes framed by a tangle of bleached hair. She says nothing, her expression lost under a veil of darkness. Only her rapid breathing betrays her tension. Instead, she suddenly leans forward and KISSES HIM. Passionately. Duncan responds in kind. AS if powerless to do anything else... LIGHTNING stitches the sky outside as-- They embrace. Bodies entwine with an urgency that builds with the STORM raging outside. ON THE NEXT THUNDERCRACK TRANSITION TO: EXT - EMPTY FIELD (DUBLIN) - NIGHT ANGRY SHEETS OF RAIN rake the countryside as Duncan slogs imlessly through calf-deep mud. Still in his wedding arb, he's thoroughly drenched, as if he's been wandering this way for hours. INT - ROWHOUSE - NIGHT The last of the guests have gone or passed out beneath toppled kegs of ale. Only Kate remains upright, her face etched with sober dread as DUNCAN appears in the doorway, rivulets of water pouring off his shoulders and brow. For a while they just stare at one another, each lost to his own sense of foreboding. Kate is the first to speak. Despite her stoic veneer, her voice comes out small and terrified. KATE If this is wrong, Duncan, tell me now. Saying nothing, Duncan slowly crosses the floor and takes her hands in his own. INT - BEDROOM - NIGHT CANDLES flicker in the storm-fed drafts that whistle through closed windows. Kate lays Duncan's rainsoaked clothing across a nightstand then turns, regarding him naked for the very first time. Duncan reaches out to touch her. She trembles. Gently, as if unwrapping an object of unimaginable fragility, Duncan removes her clothing down to a simple floating chemise. Then guides her down onto a canopied bed encircled by a hundred fresh-cut wildflowers. HANDS clasp, fingers dig into skin. Whatever refinements Kate displayed in public are now happily abandoned. She arches up under Duncan, puts her lips to his ear. KATE I'll love you forever. On an OMINOUS THUNDERCLAP-- TRANSITION BACK TO: INT - SOHO HOTEL - NIGHT We're back in the present. Little has changed but the sheets. And the fury of their lovemaking. Each new THUNDERCRACK highlights a different aspect of their hunger-- their wet, glistening bodies STROBING FASTER AND FASTER until the act itself becomes abstracted from any sense of time or place. FLASH FRAMES stutter inside the lightning: SILKEN HAIR coursing over cream-colored breasts and a simple pewter cross. EYES similar in shape and color, that shift from painted to plain... FINGERNAILS that toggle between neo-goth BLACK and natural pink... FAITH throws back her head, biting back the shudders of release... . . . and sinks down into the bed with a drawn sigh. INT - DUBLIN BEDROOM - NIGHT A SHADOW darkens Kate as she sleeps. It lingers there, deadly still. DUNCAN stands over her, gripped by indecision. The fateful choice tears at him, even as he holds a DAGGER over her gently-rising chest. His hand TREMBLES. DUNCAN (softly) Forgive me. KATE'S EYES SNAP OPEN as the DAGGER PLUNGES INTO HER HEART. For an instant their eves meet. And in that single shattering moment, Duncan knows he chose wrong. It's not just terror that passes through Kate's eyes. It's the incomprehensible pain of betrayal. Kate gasps once, jerks and settles. Lies there dead, blood pooling across her nightgown. Duncan stares down at her body, numb. DUNCAN I'm sorry... On that look we TRANSITION BACK TO: INT - HOTEL - NIGHT The pain imprints on Duncan as if he's still clutching the knife. DUNCAN I'm sorry. Whatever passion stirred Faith moments before is gone without a trace. Her eyes are as cold and empty as the dead Kate. FAITH You had no right. DUNCAN I was doing it for you. For us. FLASH TO: INT - DUBLIN BEDROOM - NIGHT Kate CONVULSES BACK TO LIFE, eyes wild, insane. Duncan reaches out to her, which only sends her reeling further into panic delirium. She swats at him, punching flailing... DUNCAN Now you're an immortal. Like me. It was the only way... Words fall on deaf ears. She wrenches out of his grip. Stumbles for the door, drenched in her own blood. Leaves Duncan standing mindblown in her wake. EXT - DUBLIN STREETS - NIGHT Kate flees through wet empty streets-- barefoot, nightgown ripped and bloody, face contorted like a madwoman. Breath comes in ragged, whimpering gasps. She trips, falls. Comes up running. BACK TO PRESENT: Faith climbs off the bed, throws on Duncan's shirt, whirls back, tears streaking her face like warpaint. FAITH You wanted this! I never asked for eternity! You forced it on me! (screams) IT WAS MY DECISION, NOT YOURS!! DUNCAN Would you have really understood? FAITH Understood? Which part?! The part about never having children? Or the endless, numbing sameness of it all? (bitter laugh) Or maybe you mean the part where you wake up one day and realize you're nothing but a whore racking up faceless affairs because whole lifetimes tick by so fast they don't even count anymore! She wraps her arms around herself as if to stem the escaping demons. Duncan remains silent, taking it all in. FAITH (cont'd) Here's the kicker, Duncan. I came here for one reason and one reason only. To see if I could feel again. Anything. She walks out, leaving the door hanging wide in her wake. INT - HALLWAY Faith reaches for the stairwell door as-- --DUNCAN'S ARM LANCES OUT, holding it shut. DUNCAN (leaning in) I'm watching my best friend driven insane by something that happened four centuries ago. And there's nothing I can do to stop it. Because those people are dead and nobody can bring them back. Faith struggles to open the door. Duncan holds firm. DUNCAN (cont'd) But I'm lucky. You know why? FAITH Let go! DUNCAN I'm lucky because my crime can still be forgiven. FAITH LET GO!! DUNCAN As long as you're still alive, there's at least the chance. It could take years. Centuries even. It may never happen... Faith is now PUSHING FURIOUSLY on the door. DUNCAN (cont'd) But at least I can still carry the hope inside me. That's one blessing of immortality. There's always tomorrow. He lets go of the door and steps back. DUNCAN (cont'd) Even for you. Faith shoves her way past him and disappears into the stairwell. CUT TO: EXT - MANHATTAN SKYLINE - NIGHT CONNOR MACLEOD stands on a ROOFTOP, sword in hand, face upturned to the bitter heavens. Stinging WIND and RAIN slash at his face. He doesn't even blink. CUT TO: EXT - NEAR CHURCH - NIGHT Seen through a CAMCORDER VIEWFINDER, our roving POV wends its way past a couple fixing junkies up to a GARAGE where WINSTON hunkers over his bike making repairs. Kase's church looms in the background like a veiled threat. CALVIN (O.S.) Win-ston. WINSTON Shut that thing off. CALVIN (O.S.) Hey, c'mon. WINSTON SHUT IT OFF! SCREEN BLACKS OUT as Winston slams his hand over the lens, ENDING CAMCORDER POV. Calvin sets it down. CALVIN Awright... WINSTON I'm out. I'm leaving. CALVIN You're out. You're out... You don't g&z out. WINSTON Watch me. CALVIN You saw what he did to Carlos. He's Genghis the fucking Hun, man. You live his way or you die your way. Be grateful you got the choice. Winston looks off. WINSTON We could take him. CALVIN Huh? Say how much you value your life? WINSTON Forty-three guineas. Saw the bill of sale myself. Kingston Jamaica, August 14th, 1813. CALVIN Sorry there, Cinque', but I got a bigger price goin on this unit. WINSTON I watched Connor MacLeod stand up to Kase tonight. Got me thinking. CALVIN What about. WINSTON That maybe my soul wasn't part of the deal after all. Calvin considers his point. CALVIN You really think we can take him? WINSTON The man can't stop a bullet. I know that much. But I need your help. CALVIN Yeah and who takes his head, huh? Gets that bucket fulla lucky charms. You, Mr Cool? (beat) Who's gonna be master then? INSERT - CALVIN'S CAMERA and that little glowing RECORD LIGHT... EXT - RUBBLED CEMETERY - DAWN FOLLOW CONNOR MACLEOD CUT TO: as he reaches the crest of the cemetery ridge. He sags against a solitary windswept oak, slides down until he's sitting cross-legged at the base of the tree. Eyes wide, unblinking. BEFORE HIM stand those TWELVE DEAD IMMORTALS from The Sanctuary, directly over their burial plots. Their heads are missing. CONNOR looks on impassively. Even as-- THOUSANDS MORE now stipple the barren landscape. All headless, in period dress spanning untold centuries. The forgotten casualties of an endless, impossible war. Connor nods solemnly. CONNOR Soon. He blinks. The specters are gone. TIME LAPSE ON CONNOR: DAY becomes NIGHT becomes DAY. And still he sits there, unmoved, as if ready to embrace the rest of eternity from this one desolate spot. TRANSITION TO: EXT - CEMETERY RIDGE - DAY Connor remains sitting against the tree as A SHADOW slices over him. He slowly tilts his gaze upward. Squints. DUNCAN (O.S.) There's supposed to be an end to all this, right? A final answer... Duncan slides down next to him. Gazes out at the trackless ocean. DUNCAN Isn't that the "prize" we're all butchering each other to win? CONNOR I already know the answer. The "prize"-- the real prize-- is just to close your eyes and see nothing. DUNCAN I don't believe that. CONNOR You think the Game is still about good against evil? A better world? Look around. Who among us really deserves to win? DUNCAN Not Jacob Kase. CONNOR And who's going to stop him? You? Me? DUNCAN There has to be a way. Connor looks off. Nods. CONNOR Oh, there's a way, kinsman. There's a way. But I don't believe you have the guts to take it. DUNCAN Try me. Connor stands up. Offers a hand to Duncan. Hauls him upright. CONNOR Alright then. HE SUDDENLY LASHES OUT WITH HIS SWORD. Duncan barely catches Connor's blade with his own. DUNCAN What're you doing?! CONNOR Don't you know? The better of us will take the other's gift. Pray it'll be enough. Duncan lowers his blade. DUNCAN I won't do it. CONNOR Then you'll die. Again, Connor STRIKES. Again, Duncan barely escapes with his head. And settles into a fighting stance. DUNCAN It can't end like this! CONNOR It already has. Goodbye, brother. He SWINGS FOR DUNCAN'S NECK. Steel RINGS against steel. Clansman against clansman. CUT TO: INT - CHURCH SANCTUARY - DAY Faith sits in a center pew, head bowed, deep in thought. Or prayer. Hard to tell with somebody like Faith. Kase sits down beside her. KASE You were with him. He curls his nose, as if he can still smell the sin. KASE (cont'd) Woman is a temple built upon a sewer. FAITH Glad I can help you feel a bit better about yourself there, Jacob. KASE Remember what you were when I first found you? A whore. Now look. A liberated woman. FAITH Fuck you. Kase runs a delicate finger across her neck. KASE Be grateful I don't this minute remove your pretty little heafod. FAITH (looks up, cold) Holy ground, lover. It's a bitch, ain't it? CUT TO: EXT - CEMETERY RIDGE - DAY Two figures dot the faraway ridge as the savage music of their swordplay PEALS out across the barren countryside. MOVING CLOSER, we watch these timeless warriors exchange strikes that would drive lesser men into the ground. Each gifted in his own way, neither gaining full advantage over the other... . . . they both gradually succumb to EXHAUSTION. CLOSER: Connor and Duncan finally lower their swords, panting and spent. DUNCAN (hollow rasp) Enough? CONNOR (barely audible) Enough... And that's as much as either can say as they suck back great gulping lungfulls of air. A little color finally returns to Duncan's cheeks. He mops his face with his sleeve. DUNCAN Next time I won't hold back. CONNOR Nor I. Dragging his sword like a half-ton barbell, Duncan turns and makes his way back toward the "resting tree. CONNOR closes his eyes and HOISTS HIS SWORD... CONNoR (whispered) Remember well, old friend. DUNCAN feels, more than sees, the ONCOMING BLADE. He turns into the ARC of CONNOR'S SWING-- SLOW MOTION He reacts on pure instinct, SWORD LIFTING, BODY PIVOTING with the DRIVING FORCE of CONNOR'S THRUST... FLASH TO: CONNOR TEACHING THAT SAME MOVE TO DUNCAN BACK IN 1627. FLASH BACK TO: CONNOR'S SWORD as it GRAZES Duncans side. DUNCAN'S KATANA SWINGS UP with the same vicious thrust, CATCHES CONNOR UNDER THE CHIN... Connor doesn't flinch. TIME SUSPENDS the instant before blade meets flesh... CONNOR'S VOICE The game is not about survival, Duncan. It's about living. In the end, it's all that matters. REAL TIME-- THE BLADE CUTS CLEAN THROUGH CONNOR'S NECK WITH UNSTOPPABLE MOMENTUM. Duncan CRIES OUT as he follows through, BLOOD staining his blade with the crushing reality of what he has just committed. He sinks to his knees... . . . and SCREAMS TO THE HEAVENS. The heavens answer back with THUNDER, LIGHTNING and GALE FORCE WINDS that seem to come from everywhere at once. PURE ESSENCE-- --HOWLS out of CONNOR'S BODY. DUNCAN CON-NORRRRRRR!! It SURGES UPWARD into endless SHEETS of LIGHTNING. Duncan CONVULSES at the epicenter of a GROWING CLASH between EARTH and SKY. SHOCKWAVES POUND through his skull, triggering A LAST FLEETING VISION OF CONNOR MACLEOD: Walking with Heather across an open field. He turns and looks back at Duncan. CONNOR'S EYES shine with a look of ultimate peace and transcendence. He seems to be gazing straight into Duncan's soul. And smiling at what he sees as-- A FINAL BLAST OF ESSENCE RIPS through Duncan's BRAIN. EXT - HIGHRISE - NIGHT DISSOLVE TO: Duncan stands alone on the rooftop, stripped to the waist, moving slowly through an elaborate kata. The precision of his movement belies the chaos inside him. He windmills the katana over his head, faster and faster, until he suddenly RELEASES IT-- THE SWORD PINWHEELS through the night sky, arcing out across the open space between buildings... Duncan watches its long, lofting trajectory... . ..then takes off RUNNING. He reaches the edge of the rooftop and LEAPS. WIDE Legs cycling through empty air, he traces a matching arc directly under the far-flung sword. Like a long-jumper stretching for that last inch of sand, Duncan HYPER-EXTENDS for the next rooftop. EXT - NEXT ROOFTOP HIS LEADING FOOT hits the edge-- digs in, pivots and sets. HIS HAND THRUSTS UPWARD as the sword grip SLAPS INTO HIS OPEN PALM. Fingers wrap around the ivory hilt, slowly lowering it down to eye-level. GO IN CLOSE ON THOSE EYES and see a new Duncan MacLeod. Stronger. Deadlier. A man cooly aware of his own destiny. CUT TO: EXT - ARMORY - DAY Dawson's car pulls up to the generic cinderblock building that now stands unguarded and abandoned. INT - ARMORY - DAY Dawson enters, squints into the darkness. The interior looks as if it's stood fallow for the last three decades. No giger-chair, no gothic restraints. No evidence the Watchers ever took up temporary residence here. Except for MATTHEW, who emerges from the stale halflight to confront Dawson. MATTHEW I'm a bit surprised to see you again. All things considered. Dawson just stands there, hands plunged inside his coat pockets. MATTHEW (cont'd) As you can see, we had to move on. Find a new Sanctuary. DAWSON It's wrong. What you're doing. It's inhuman. MATTHEW Ah, but they're not human, really. Are they? DAWSON Gimme a reason, Matthew. MATTHEW It's for the good of us all. You know that. DAWSON Gimme a reason. Matthew cocks his head like the RCA dog. MATTHEW Because we must. It's that simple. And if you get in our way again, there will be very serious consequences. DAWSON Gimme a good reason. Matthew pulls a gun. Aims it at Dawson's heart. MATTHEW I'm sorry to have to do this, Joe. He pulls the trigger... as TWO SLUGS pound into his chest. Matthew topples backward, dead. Dawson palms the gun still concealed in his coat pocket. Nods. DAWSON Reason enough. CUT TO: EXT - NEW YORK STREET - DAY Kase is roaring through narrow streets in a low-slung convertible, Faith at his side. With utter disregard for speed or care, he guns it madly in shrieking turns. INT - CONVERTIBLE, DRIVING Faith grips the dashboard two-handed. FAITH Slow down. KASE Adrenalin's good for the sex drive. FAITH I'm not amused, Jacob. She reaches over and slaps on her shoulder harness. KASE Thought maybe you needed a little more excitement. You know, spice up our relationship a bit. WIDE He OVERSTEERS, caroms off several parked cars, recovers... KASE (cont'd) I mean, isn't that why you went back to Duncan MacLeod? The risk? FAITH I don't know what you're trying to prove. Kase puts an arm around her shoulder... KASE Why do I have to prove anything to you? .... as his foot flattens the accelerator. ENGINE WHINES. KASE (cont'd) I can have anything I want already. FAITH Except me. And that bugs the shit out of you, doesn't it? KASE Not really. AT THE NEXT TURN it's clear he'll never make it, he's going too fast. Kase only smiles. Releasing the wheel, he stands in his seat, lifts his arms above his head and SHOUTS in exultation as-- --the car EXPLODES into the wall. It's all over in a breath. Accordioned metal, drooling radiator, and Faith, slumped over the dash. Kase lies sprawled and battered on the pavement, thrown some distance from the wreckage. He's clearly taken the worst of the impact. FAITH stirs and slowly wrenches herself free of the smoking mangle of steel and plastic. She reaches back and pulls Kase's sword free of the wreckage. With single-minded determination, she limps over to Kase's body, face-up in his own pooling blood. A disbelieving PEDESTRIAN pauses in shock. Faith gives her a twisted smile. FAITH Don't mind us. Pedestrian SCURRIES OFF as Faith lifts the sword over her head and brings it WHISTLING DOWN across Kase's neck. With inhuman reflexes, Kase awakens and catches her wrist in the same heartbeat. Eyes narrow. KASE Does this mean it's over? DISSOLVE TO: EXT - KASE'S CHURCH - DAY Kase steps up to the back entrance, alone. THE DOOR hangs slightly ajar, which clearly disturbs him. INT - CHURCH SANCTUARY - DAY Kase enters the main room to find Calvin and Sarge asleep on their pews. He kicks the first pew, awakens both with a start. KASE Who left the back door open? CALVIN Huh? Kase looks to Sarge. SARGE I dunno. KASE Where's Cracker Bob? He was supposed to be watching the back. Calvin and Sarge both shrug. KASE (cont'd) (sotto) Infants. He whirls, stalks out. INT - SACRISTY Kase enters his dark, cluttered office, SLAMMING the door behind him. FLICKS ON THE LIGHT and stops cold. A SWORD JUTS from a small wooden table... . . . right through CRACKER BOB, who lies skewered to the tabletop. WRAPPED AROUND THE SWORDHILT is Caiolin MacLeods unique silver-and-wood CRUCIFIX. The message is not lost on Kase. BOB'S EYES suddenly flutter open. First thing he sees is that sword hilt sticking rudely out of his own chest. CRACKER BOB Ah-- Ahhh-- AHHHHHHH!! KASE Shut up. He reaches forward and JERKS the sword out of Bob, and with it A SINGLE SCRAP OF PAPER impaled on the blade. It bears just one word, scrawled in Bob's plentiful blood. GLENFINNAN Bob sits up on the table, wild-eyed, as Kase calmly opens his fingers and lets the paper slide from his fingers. CUT TO: EXT - LITTLE ITALY, ESTABLISHING - NIGHT Glitter lights and milling tourists. Row upon row of gimmicky Italian restaurants. INT - ITALIAN RESTAURANT, PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT Jacob Kase and his acolytes dine at a long table set against a gaudy backdrop of faux Roman ruins, babbling fountains and plastic holly. It all imparts a whiff of "Last Supper" pomp to the proceeding. Which is not lost on the other Immortals, who glance around warily while eating, as suspicious of each other as they are of Kase. Nor does anyone miss the fact that there are no windows in this particular room. CLOSE ON WINSTON He stares into his pasta, beading sweat. BENEATH THE TABLE his fingers curl around the cold steel of a .38 SPECIAL wedged between his knees. He inches the gun upward toward the table rim as... Kase suddenly stands up in the center. KASE A toast... All heads turn. Gun freezes in Winston's lap, just hidden from view. KASE (cont'd) I see tonight as a celebration of the spirit. (raises his glass) Here's to all of you who continue to stand by me... (smiles at Winston) . . . even those who might waver at times. Winston stiffens, fears that Kase is on to him. And when Calvin averts his gaze, he knows. Still, he raises his glass. As do the others. KASE (cont'd) You are my flock. You nourish my soul. It's now or never for Winston. His moment of truth. Kase's eyes slowly drift over to meet his. SLOW MOTION, Kase tips back his glass and drinks, eyes locked on Winston. Winston responds in kind, gulping down his wine as he slips the gun back into his pocket. He shoves off from the table. WINSTON Excuse me. KASE Where you going? WINSTON Toilet. KASE Sit sit. I'm not through with my toast yet. WINSTON Can't wait. He angles for the door. KASE I'm almost finished. Sit. Winston reaches for the doorknob. Locked. He swivels back. Sees death in Jacob Kase's eyes. His death. KASE (cont'd) It'll all be over in a few more seconds. A cold spike of fear shoots through every single one of them... . . . as Kase continues. KASE (cont'd) Youve all been a part of a great quest. A four hundred year quest for justice. He lifts up an exquisitely-crafted sword. KASE (cont'd) And here, my friends, is the instrument of that justice. It's called the "Colichmarde." Finest sword known to man. The blade WHISTLES upright. KASE (cont'd) Blessed by Popes and baptized in blood. I only break it out for special occasions. He kisses the perfect cross formed by the juncture of blade and quillons. KASE (cont'd) It sings like an angel. Just listen. Winston jerks for his gun. In a SUDDEN BLUR of STEEL and BLOOD, Kase beheads Winston and dispatches the next two of his stunned acolytes with blinding efficiency. TONGUES OF LIQUID ENERGY coil up and around Kase's body. But he keeps right on coming. The others scatter like roaches. ESSENCE PULSES off walls and ceiling, SHATTERING STATUARY, HURLING FURNITURE... . ..before MERGING with the WALKING INFERNO that is now Jacob Kase. His sword BLAZES through the remaining victims, trailing STREAKS OF BLUE FIRE. One after another, they drop headless to the concrete, triggering A FULL-ON MULTIPLE-QUICKENING. THE NEXT WAVE OF ESSENCE SLAMS into Kase front on. His knees BUCKLE. ANOTHER Hits him BROADSIDE, buffeting him one way as YET ANOTHER POUNDS him from the opposite- side, rocking him back center and IMMOBILIZING HIM inside an omni-directional CRUSH of LIGHT AND SOUND that WHITES OUT THE FRAME. DISSOLVE TO: EXT - SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS - DAY A THICK CLINGING FOG, enshrouds the rocky highlands. Somewhere along the invisible coastline below, a foghorn MOANS. The skeletal remains of an ancient Gaelic CASTLE loom spectral gray above JACOB KASE who stands before an ANCIENT CELTIC MONOLITH (familiar from Glenfinnan's town square) revelling in the changeless land of his birth. KASE (calling out) Where else could stir the blood of a Scotsman too long of this earth and too far from home? Kase picks his way across the uneven ground, unable to see beyond the reach of his own arm. KASE (cont'd) (filling his lungs) I can nae get enough of it. He draws his sword, extends it outward until the tip disappears from sight. A LOW SCRAPING OF METAL ON STONE taunts him from somewhere out there in the slow-drifting whiteness Kase's sword TWITCHES toward the SOUND. Just the FAINTEST OUTLINE of a FIGURE COALESCES BRIEFLY inside the fog. KASE Ah, what's this? Hamlet's ghost? The FIGURE melts back into silent nothingness. KASE (cont'd) I'm afraid even the cloak of fog won't help you overcome a sizeable disadvantage. A DIFFERENT SCRAPING SOUND spins him around to see ANOTHER GHOSTLY FIGURE looming over him from a narrow stone outcropping. Kase masks a slight tinge of concern. KASE (cont'd) It's always good to see two fellow clansmen banded together in a common cause. But I hope you haven't sunk to the level of a simultaneous ambush. Once again, the figure steps backward into the enveloping fog. Disappears. Slightly unnerved, Kase jerks around. No sign of anyone. Just that infernal mist. A SOFT SCRAPING of SWORD against ROCK swivels him back around to his original position. CLOSE ON KASE His nerves are starting to shred. He turns several full rotations, craning for a glimpse of his tormentors. And then he sees it... AN APPARITION WIELDING A SWORD. Kase LUNGES for it. And this time, it doesn't retreat. Swords CLANG in thunderous overture as TWO SPECTRES IN THE FOG battle for position on tenuous footing. KASE drives his adversary backward into a BLUNTED STONE WALL, leaving him no avenue of escape. Their swords LOCK UP and Kase suddenly finds himself FACE TO FACE WITH-- DUNCAN MACLEOD. You can sense Kase's bitter disappointment. KASE Not at all who I'd hoped for. CLOSE ON DUNCAN'S EYES as they flick to a point iust behind Kase's head. CLOSE ON KASE'S EYES as he realizes he's been had. He SWINGS FULLY AROUND TO FACE CONNOR-- --and sees that NOBODY'S THERE! Too late-- he SWINGS BACK TO DUNCAN-- and IMPALES HIMSELF ON DUNCAN'S SWORD. DUNCAN (through clenched teeth) I'm afraid Connor couldn't be here. But don't worry, he's with us in spirit. Still gripping his sword two-fisted, Duncan seems to surge with newfound strength. DUNCAN He gave himself for this moment. And I shan't let him down. Duncan SHOVES OFF from Kase and goes to work on him with a VENGEANCE. WHAT KASE SEES: A frightening, hallucinitory vision of a DUAL ADVERSARY-- one that CHANGES back and forth in the flux of swirling mist. As Duncan's blade BLURS PAST, Kase sees CONNOR. With the very next SWING, he sees Duncan again. Then Connor. Then Duncan. Connor. Duncan... Kase rubs his eyes with the back of his hand. Shakes it off. Can't be. Duncan buffets Kase backward with several dazzling combinations, then goes inside, tough and ugly. Kase seems suddenly overwhelmed, physically and mentally, as he's driven onto his back by sheer relentless overdrive. Duncan SLASHES DOWN for the killing blow, which Kase BARELY DEFLECTS. He SLASHES AGAIN. And AGAIN. Each time Kase barely escapes with his head intact. Duncan keeps up this relentless barrage, hacking down in every conceivable direction, looking for an opening, finding none. With each increasingly-leaden DOWNSTROKE, Duncan is losing strength... . . . and Kase is regaining his. Kase BATTLES BACK TO HIS FEET, deftly siezes the advantage. KASE (savage smile) This is not a game won on points, I'm afraid. He drives Duncan back with an answering exchange that leaves no doubt of his superior ability. In a single massive THRUST, Kase STRIPS Duncan's sword and sends him flying. Duncan lands on his back, weaponless. Kase steps up to the katana, scoops his toe under it and FLICKS IT BACK TO DUNCAN. Then waves him back to his feet. A cat playing with his prey. Both combatants square off... and RESUME. KASE That's the beauty of eternity. The fun never stops. He THRUSTS-- spiking Duncan clear through the shoulder. Duncan hangs up on the blade, unable to move. Grimaces in pain. Setting boot to chest, Kase KICKS Duncan off his sword and sends him spiralling backward. Duncan reaches out to break his fall-- --but there's no ground beneath him. He PLUMMETS OFF a SLANTED CLIFF. Bounces at fifty feet, then tumbles clear to the bottom. Kase steps up to the edge, scowls. A FRESHLY-CUT QUARRY has been hewn from the hilltop by the massive sword of modern technology. EARTH MOVING EQUIPMENT several stories tall lines the inner basin. KASE What have they done to my mountain?! He gazes down at DUNCAN'S BODY sprawled at the base of the cliff. Then starts down after him. EXT - BOTTOM OF QUARRY - DAY Duncan crawls over to his sword... . . . as Kase picks his way down the steep incline. Duncan spikes his sword into the ground and uses it to climb upright. One look at his battered body and you know this fight is over. He just stands there, hunched over his sword, grimly waiting for Kase to reach him and deliver the killing blow. It doesn't take long. Kase stops, regards him with contempt. KASE Don't make it easy. I hate that. DUNCAN Youre breaking my heart. KASE Pick up! Duncan shakes his blood-streaked head. KASE PICK UP! DUNCAN It's always been too easy for you, Kase. No reason this time should be any different. He plucks his sword out of the ground... . . . and TURNS HIS BACK TO KASE. DUNCAN (cont'd) Take your best shot. He hobbles off, sword hanging limp at his side. Kase starts TREMBLING WITH RAGE. KASE MACLEOD! Duncan ignores him, keeps walking. About now, we should have a pretty good idea what Duncan has in mind. But Kase doesn't have a clue. DUNCAN'S POV: For a fleeting moment, Connor stands before Duncan, more mist than flesh. He opens his arms wide. CONNOR'S APPARITION Remember weil, old friend. He DISSOLVES AWAY as Kase hoists sword over shoulder... KASE (cont'd) MAC-LEOD!! . ..and CHARGES... Which is exactly what Duncan expected. USING THE SAME MOVE CONNOR TAUGHT HIM-- --Duncan PIVOTS WITH the THRUST, catching Kase completely off guard and off balance. This time, no force of man or nature can keep Duncan's sword from hitting home. He SLICES UPWARD with a ROAR OF DEFIANCE... . ..and FOLLOWS THROUGH. ON KASE: He stands there, head miraculously still intact, a look of bewildered relief. Duncan simply POPS his sword butt into Kase's face. The head comes easily away from the neck and falls. KASE'S POV spins END OVER END through the air, bounces twice and comes to a rest SIDEWAYS. And that's how we first see his HEADLESS BODY, sprawled across the ground. KASE'S SEVERED HEAD blinks with sudden recognition. And now he knows. This is the worst part of losing your head-- those last few seconds of cold lucidity. DUNCAN opens his arms to HEAVES UNDERFOOT. WIDE - THE QUARRY the ULTIMATE OUICKENING as THE EARTH WALLS EXPLODE like a circle of VOLCANOES venting into the center. Duncan CLAWS UPWARD on a GROUNDSWELL OF RAW ENERGY as DIRT, ROCK, ASH and SMOKE OBLITERATE THE BASIN. The SEISMIC CONVULSIONS GRADUALLY SUBSIDE. The dust settles. And the blighted landscape falls into an unearthly SILENCE, blind to its own buried secrets. HOLD on the trailing wisps of smoke as THE GROUND SHUDDERS and DUNCAN'S KATANA BREAKS THE SURFACE. It PLUNGES UPWARD ONE, TWO, THREE MORE TIMES, pulverizing dirt and stone. HANDS FOLLOW, clawing their up way through the loosely- mounded earth until DUNCAN'S HEAD AND SHOULDERS APPEAR. As if the earth itself is giving birth to a new generation of Immortal. He rolls out onto the ground, gasping, triumphant. Reborn. One inch at a time, he slowly rises to his feet. As we KEEP ON RISING up into a FIERY HIGHLAND SUNSET. TILT BACK DOWN TO: EXT - HIGHLANDS ABOVE GLENFINNAN Duncan stands over a freshly-dug grave. Onto the simple stone, he's chisled: HEATHER MACLEOD BELOVED WIFE OF CONNOR And beneath it: CONNOR MACLEOD BELOVED HUSBAND OF HEATHER Duncan's eyes glisten with an unspeakable loss. And a comfort in knowing that his friend has finally found the peace of eternity. DUNCAN yours is the greater prize my friend. Welcome home. LINGER ON DUNCAN as we DISSOLVE SLOWLY TO... EXT - MANHATTAN SKYLINE - DAWN FAITH stands sentinel-like atop a bluff overlooking the Hudson River and the insignificant island of Manhattan beyond. Her trademark slashes of facepaint and hair dye have been shed like molted skin. What remains is a serene beauty that defies fashion or vanity. Her faraway eyes BLINK with a sudden, frightening clarity. THE BUZZ sets her reflexes snapping as she SPINS AROUND-- --and CATCHES the COLICHMARDE, handle first. DUNCAN follows, strolling toward her with hands loose at his side. Faith runs her finger down the shimmering blade. FAITH (considers) So... what am I supposed to do next -- kiss you or take your head? Duncan steps up to her, smiling enigmatically. DUNCAN The choice is yours. FADE OUT: THE END

    OVER DARKNESS...                                                  1

    ...we hear what we will come to know as the VOICE OF THE
    GUIDE.
                 GUIDE VOICE
         It is an important and popular fact that
         things are not always what they seem.

    A small square image appears on screen.    Home video.      The
    dolphin stadium at Sea World.

                 GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
         For instance, on the planet Earth, man had
         always assumed that he was the most
         intelligent species occupying the planet,
         instead of the third most intelligent
         which was, in fact, entirely accurate.

    The dolphins perform; leaping through hoops, etc.

                 GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
         The second most intelligent creatures
         were, of course, dolphins who curiously
         enough had long known of the impending
         destruction of the planet Earth. They had
         made many attempts to alert mankind to the
         danger, but most of their communications
         were misinterpreted as amusing attempts to
         punch footballs or whistle for tidbits, so
         they eventually decided they would leave
         Earth by their own means.

    They leap madly, desperately. Higher and higher...

                 GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
         The last ever dolphin message was
         misinterpreted as a surprisingly
         sophisticated attempt to do a double-
         backward somersault through a hoop while
         whistling the "Star-Spangled Banner" but
         in fact the message was this...
         "So long and thanks for all the fish."

    TITLES ROLL - (FULL SCREEN 35mm IMAGES)

    Dolphins leap over and interact with the opening titles.
    Breathtaking somersaults, back flips, choreographed to a
    Buzby Berkley-style song called, "SO LONG AND THANKS FOR
    ALL THE FISH." We end with a wide shot of all the
    dolphins jumping out of the top of frame, but they never
    come back down. TILT UP to a starry night sky - the
    dolphins have vanished.

    END TITLES

    As night turns to morning, we hear CLICK, then...

                         VOICE ON RADIO
                 ...as well as Sea World Orlando and San
                 Diego reporting their dolphins have
                 mysteriously disappeared overnight.

    INT. ARTHUR DENT'S BEDROOM - MORNING                        2

    CLOSE ON the clock radio from which the voice emanates.
    A hand shuts it off. ARTHUR DENT is awake. 30's. Kind
    faced. His feet land perfectly in slippers as he stands
    and shuffles out of his very neat but very boring room.

3   IN THE BATHROOM - Arthur gargles in front of the mirror.    3
    He bends over to spit revealing a YELLOW BULLDOZER
    through the window, crawling toward his house. A TEA
    KETTLE WHISTLES O.S.

4   INT. ARTHUR DENT'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS                     4

    Arthur sets the newspaper (with the headline "DOLPHINS
    VANISH") on the table, removes the kettle. Doesn't notice
    through the window 3 MORE LARGE YELLOW BULLDOZERS.

    He pours a cup of tea, sets the pot down next o his
    mobile phone. He picks it up, stares at a DIGITAL PHOTO
    ON THE SCREEN of himself and a very pretty woman (Tricia)
    at a costume party.

    He presses the phone to his head as if it were a cold
    compress. Suddenly, there's a LOUD RUMBLING o.s. The
    tea cup RATTLES. Arthur looks out the window. Now he
    sees the bulldozers.

    The tea cup shatters on the floor.
                                                     CUT TO:
5   EXT. ARTHUR DENT'S HOUSE - MORNING                          5

    Arthur, dressed in pajamas and robe, lies in the dirt in
    front of a bulldozer, blocking it from destroying his
    house. He yells into his mobile phone.

                       ARTHUR
                  (into phone)
              What do you mean he's gone out to lunch?
              You just said he was still at breakfast!

    MR. PROSSER, a bureaucrat, leans over him.

                      PROSSER
              Come off it, Mr. Dent. You can't lie in
              front of the bulldozers forever.

                      ARTHUR
              I'm game. We'll see who rusts first.

                      PROSSER
              This bypass has got to be built and it's
              going to be built. You should have made
              your protest months ago.

                      ARTHUR
              The first I heard of it was when a workman
              came yesterday. I asked if he'd come to
              clean the windows, and he said he'd come
              to demolish the house. He didn't tell me
              right away of course. First he wiped a
              couple of windows and charged me twenty
              quid. Then he told me.
                                                (CONTINUED)

    The bulldozer driver, looking guilty, ducks behind the
    steering wheel. Prosser removes plans from his briefcase.

                         PROSSER
                 Look. These plans have been on display at
                 the planning office now for a year.

                         ARTHUR
                 On display? I had to go down to a cellar!

                         PROSSER
                 That's the display department.

                         ARTHUR
                 I eventually found them in the bottom of a
                 locked filing cabinet in a disused
                 lavatory with a sign on the door saying
                 'beware of the leopard'.

                         PROSSER
                 Mr. Dent, have you any idea how much
                 damage that bulldozer would suffer if I
                 just let it roll straight over you?

                         ARTHUR
                 How much?

                         PROSSER
                 None at all.

                         FORD (O.S.)
                   (American accent)
                 Arthur!

    Arthur and Prosser turn to see a man cresting a hill,
    pushing a shopping cart which is filled with beer and
    bags of peanuts. This is FORD PREFECT. Wiry, intense.
    As he heads downhill, he leaps up and rides the cart down
    towards Arthur's house -- like a kid in a supermarket.
    He rolls right past Arthur and the bulldozers.

                         ARTHUR
                 Ford?

    He leaps off, drags the cart to a full stop.

                         FORD
                 Arthur! There you are. Here drink and
                 eat with me. We need to talk.

                         ARTHUR
                 Er, um...now's not the best time, Ford
                 They're going to demolish my home,

                          FORD
                 Whoa.   You already know? How?

    Arthur simply motions to the bulldozer.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                       FORD (CONT'D)
               Oh. When you say "they" you mean they.
               Got it. Listen, I gotta tell you
               something important, and I gotta tell you
               now.

                       ARTHUR
               But what about my house?

    Ford looks to Prosser who is conferring with the
    bulldozer driver. He pushes the cart over to him.

    ARTHUR - watches as Ford gestures to Prosser who waves
    his hand and the all the 'dozer engines die.
    The bulldozer drivers step down, start drinking the beer
    and eating the peanuts. Ford returns to Arthur.

                      FORD
              C'mon. Let's go to the pub. He said they

              finished the beers.

                      ARTHUR
              Can we trust him?

                       FORD
               I'd trust him to the end of the Earth.

                      ARTHUR
              And how far's that?

                      FORD
              About twelve minutes away.

                                                                CUT TO:

6   INT. VILLAGE PUB - MIDDAY                                             6

    Ford and Arthur enter the half-full pub. Ford hurries to
    the bar. Arthur follows, cell phone to his ear.

                      FORD
              Six pints of bitter. And quickly.      The
              world's about to end.

                       BARMAN
               Oh yes, sir? Nice weather for it.

    He starts to pull pints. Ford shoves bar peanuts into
    his pockets while Arthur shouts into his phone...

                      ARTHUR
              Well, when does he get back from lunch?
              Or is he going straight out for tea?!

    He shuts the phone, sits, looking forlorn.

                      ARTHUR (CONT'D)
              This is shaping up to be a crap day.

                         FORD
                 It's about to get a lot crappier.

                         BARMAN
                 There you are, six pints.

    Ford slaps down a £50 note. The barman's impressed.

                         FORD
                 Keep the change. You've got ten minutes to
                 spend it.

    Ford pushes three pints in front of Arthur.

                         ARTHUR
                 Three? At lunchtime?

                         FORD
                 Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.

                         ARTHUR
                 Very deep. You should send that in to the
                 Reader's Digest. They've got a page for
                 people like you.

                         FORD
                 Drink up.

                         ARTHUR
                 Why three pints?

                         FORD
                 Muscle relaxant.
                    (grabbing more peanuts)
                 And eat these. You'll need the salt.

                         ARTHUR
                 What's going on. Ford?

                         FORD
                 What would you say if I told you I wasn't
                 really from Guilford but from a small
                 planet somewhere in the vicinity of
                 Eetelgeuse?

                         ARTHUR
                 Why, is it the sort of thing you're likely
                 to say?

                         FORD
                 Remember when we met? That car was racing
                 toward me, I was trying to greet it, you
                 pushed me out of the way?

         QUICK CUT TO A STREET - MID-DAY                                  7

         Ford stands in the middle of the road, extending a hand
         to a fast approaching car.
         Arthur drops his shopping, dives at him and tackles him
         out of the way as the car zooms past.

(6 cont) BACK TO FORD IN THE PUB:                                      (6 cont)

                           FORD
                   Didn't you find it a little strange that I
                   was trying to shake hands with a car?

                           ARTHUR
                   I assumed you were drunk.

                           FORD
                      (shaking his head)
                   I thought cars were the dominant life
                   form. I was trying to introduce myself.

                           ARTHUR
                   And that's why you're named after a
                   discontinued car from the seventies?

                           FORD
                      (nodding)
                   You saved my life that day.      Now I'm
                   saving yours.

         Arthur just stares at him, then turns to his beer.

                           ARTHUR
                   This must be Thursday. I never could get
                   the hang of Thursdays.

                           FORD
                   Look, if it's about your house...

                           ARTHUR
                   No, it's not that.    It's....

         He shows Ford the photo of he and Tricia on his phone.

                           ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                   I found her. Ford. The perfect girl. I
                   found her, and then I let her get away.
                   You remember that fancy dress party I told
                   you about?

                           FORD
                   This isn't a long story, is it? We've
                   only got six minutes.

         Arthur shakes his head.    Ford checks his watch.

              Okay.     Talk and drink. Fancy dress party.

                      ARTHUR
              At that flat in Islington. I told you
              about it. Last week, remember?

                                                    FLASHBACK TO:

8   INT. ISLINGTON FLAT - NIGHT                                     8

    Crowded flat.    Everyone is in costume.   Loud music BLARES.

                       ARTHUR (V.O.)
               I can't bear those sort of parties, didn't
               want to go, would have much rather stayed
               home and, I don't know, brush the dog.
               Anything. But there I was -- and then,
               there she was...

    Arthur, dressed in safari attire complete with pith helmet,
    sits off to the side, observing, looking miserable.

                       TRICIA (O.S.)
               Who are you?

    Arthur looks up. TRICIA MCMILLAN is dressed in a mid
    19th century mens suit with mutton chop sideburns and is
    holding a taxidermy beagle -- and she still looks
    beautiful.   Arthur, ever the gentleman, stands.

                       ARTHUR
               I'm Arthur. Arthur Dent.

                       TRICIA
               No, I mean who are you?

                       ARTHUR
               Oh, the costume. Right. Er, um...
                  (sheepishly tipping his hat)
               Livingston, I presume.
                   (pointing to her attire)
               Granted. Not as clever as Darwin, but the
               best I could do on short notice.

                       TRICIA
               You're the first person who's got it
               right. Everyone keeps calling me
               Sherlock.

                      ARTHUR
              Really? I thought the beagle made it
              rather obvious.

    He pets the dog.    She smiles.    He smiles back.

    THE BALCONY -- Arthur has just taken a digital photo of
    he and Tricia on his cell phone. They look at the screen
    image and laugh.

                         ARTHUR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                 She was amazing, Ford. Witty, and
                 beautiful, and brilliant. Four or five
                 degrees. One in math, one in astrophysics,
                 another in biology...

                         TRICIA
                 I've got so many degrees I am officially
                 unemployable. Let's drink to that!

    They clink their wine glasses, take sips, continue to chat.

                         ARTHUR (V.O.)
                 And just as I was asking myself, "Why is
                 this stunning and intelligent woman even
                 giving me the time of day, out of nowhere
                 she says...

                         TRICIA
                 Let's go somewhere.

                         ARTHUR
                 Yeah. It is a bit noisy. There's a
                 lovely little cafe around the corner...

                         TRICIA
                 I was thinking Madagascar.

                         ARTHUR
                 Is that a new club on Dean Street?

                         TRICIA
                 No. It's a country.    Off the coast of
                 Africa.

                         ARTHUR
                 Oh, that Madagascar. Right, off we go
                 then.
                    (then realizing...)
                 Good God, you're serious.

                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                  Well...that's...an extraordinary
                  proposition. But...I can't just up and
                  go. What about my job?

                           TRICIA
                  Quit.   Get a new one when we return.

                          ARTHUR
                  I can't just...what about my house?     Who
                  would feed my dog?

                          TRICIA
                  Bring him with.

                          ARTHUR
                  He's a Welsh Collie.   He'd feel all out of
                  place in Madagascar.

     Trillian forces a smile, clearly disappointed.

                          ZAPHOD (O.S.)
                  You don't want to go to Madagascar.

     They both turn to face ZAPHOD BEEBLEBROX - very charming,
     extremely handsome - whose attire seems very "other
     worldly." Knee high boots, a yellow sash...

                          ZAPHOD (CONT'D)
                  Hi. I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of

                  already know that. I'm headed for a lost
                  and distant planet. Would you like to see
                  my spaceship?

                          ARTHUR (V.O.)
                  I went to refresh our drinks.     When I came
                  back, she was gone.

     Arthur stares into his beer, plagued by this loss.

                  More popular than you'd think.

                  I've left messages, sent letters... It's

      Arthur runs up the road towards his house which is being
      bulldozed. Ford strides casually behind in the distance.

                            ARTHUR
                   STOP!   STOP, YOU BASTARDS!!

      Arthur suddenly stops running and covers his ears as we
      hear THE LOUDEST RUMBLE IN MOTION PICTURE HISTORY.

11a   A GIGANTIC YELLOW SPACESHIP (picture a concrete tower         11a
      block)) sweeps overhead. Ford hits the deck. Arthur is

      Ford rises and hurries to the rubble that was Arthur's
      house. He digs around near the exposed toilet and comes
      up with -- A TOWEL. He hurries to Arthur's side.

         Another ship screams over, blowing them down again. Rain
         is knocked out of the clouds and lands in one big THWUMP!

                      Here.   You'll need this.

         He tosses Arthur the towel. Then, he removes a short
         black rod, his ELECTRONIC THUMB. He sticks it out.

        Like a giant casino going down in Vegas, there are a few
        small explosions AMD THE EARTH IMPLODES. Just collapses
        in on itself. Gone.

        The Vogon ships slowly retreat in formation, leaving
        nothing but DARKNESS AND STARS.

21      Then a distant RED GLOW appears. As it gets nearer we       21
        see that it says..."THE HITCHHIKERS GUIDE TO THE GALAXY."

                             GUIDE VOICE
                     The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a
                     wholly remarkable book...

        The title draws nearer. We see that it sits on an
        electronic book with lots of buttons.

                             GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
                     ...Perhaps the most remarkable, certainly
                     the most successful book ever to come out
                     of the great publishing corporations of
                     Ursa Minor.

        The book opens revealing TWO SCREENS. Images appear. A
        star map, layers of data, captions, video, animations...

                             GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
                     More popular than the CELESTIAL HOME CARE
                     OMNIBUS, better selling than 53 MORE
                     THINGS TO DO IN ZERO GRAVITY, and more
                     controversial than Oolon Colluphid's
                     trilogy of philosophical blockbusters,
                     WHERE GOD WENT WRONG, SOME MORE OF GOD'S
                     GREATEST MISTAKES, and WHO IS THIS GOD
                     PERSON, ANYWAY?

        Now the images rise up from the screen like holographs as
        the book "presents itself" like some hi-tech infomercial.

                             GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
                     In many of the more relaxed civilizations
                     on the Outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy,
                     the Hitchhiker's Guide has already
                     supplanted the great Encyclopedia
                     Galactica as the standard repository of
                     all knowledge and wisdom. For though it
                     has many omissions, and contains much
                     which is apocryphal, or at least wildly
                     inaccurate, it scores over the older, more
                     pedestrian work in two important respects.
                     First, it is slightly cheaper. And second,
                     it has the words "DON'T PANIC" printed in
                     large friendly letters on its cover.

        The book closes. The words "DON'T PANIC" appear just
        below the title, blinking like a tacky diner marquee.

        PULL BACK FROM THE GUIDE to find Arthur holding it, the
        blinking light illuminating his very disoriented face.

        Arthur, in total shock, holds up the guide.

                             ARTHUR
                     So you're not from Guilford, which would
                     explain the accent -- which I've always
                     wondered about...and you're not an out of
                     work actor -- but rather a writer for
                     this...this...book thing.

        Ford nods.    Arthur rubs his weary brow.

                             ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                     I don't feel well. I need a cup of tea.

        Ford hands him a fistful of peanuts.

                             FORD
                     Here. Eat these. If you've never been
                     through a transmat beam before you've
                     probably lost some salt and protein.

        Arthur eats some peanuts, sits up, squints. Ford feels
        his way around the room, looking for something.

                             ARTHUR
                     If I asked where we were would I regret

                             FORD
                     We're safe. For now.

                     Good.

                             FORD

                     Obviously some strange usage of the word
                     safe I wasn't previously aware of.

                             FORD

                     Is it?

                     Tell me you're joking.

                             FORD
                     Okay. I'm joking.

                             ARTHUR
                     And do a reassuring little laugh.

        Ford does a reassuring little laugh.

                             ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                     Now tell me where we really are.

                      It's a tough galaxy. You want to survive

                      Careful, it's hot.

        He slides the towel behind the pipe, holding each end of
        it, Arthur does the same.

                      We've got to get off this ship before the
                      Vogons find us. Vogons hate hitchhikers.
                      Which is why they make ships with walls
                      that won't allow the Sub-Etna signal to

        They both pull. A section of pipe snaps off. Steam
        shoots out. Ford holds the black Thumb under the pipe.

                  Vogons are one of the most unpleasant
                  races in the Galaxy - not evil, but bad-
                  tempered, bureaucratic, officious and
                  callous. They wouldn't even lift a finger
                  to save their own grandmothers from the
                  Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal without

                  back, queried, lost, found, subjected to
                  public inquiry, lost again, and finally
                  buried in soft peat for three months and
                  recycled as fire-lighters.

                  Mostly harmless.

        Before Arthur can react, a speaker HUMS to life with
        screeching HOWLS and GARGLES. Arthur cups his ears.

        Ford removes a small yellow fish from his pouch. He
        moves to put it in Arthur's ear. Arthur struggles.

        The LOUD GARGLING NOISE continues. Ford has to wrestle to

        The struggle continues. As they're dragged out the door,

                  It feeds on brainwave energy, absorbing

                  upshot of which is that if you stick one in
                  your ear, you instantly understand anything
                  said to you in any language.

        Arthur continues to struggle, until he passes a portal
        window. He backs up to look out.

                          GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
                  Now, it is such a bizarrely improbable
                  thing that anything so mind-bogglingly
                  useful could have evolved in the Universe
                  purely by chance that many thinkers have

27       INT. VOGON CONSTRUCTOR BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                        27

         Arthur and Ford are strapped against two concrete pillars
         with hundreds of elastic bands.

         A STRANGE AND LETHAL LOOKING DEVICE DESCENDS FROM THE
         CEILING. Looks like an instrument of torture. As the
         device descends, Jeltz fishes a JEWELED CRAB out of a
         gunky trough and smashes it with a hammer -- BLAM!

         Jeltz takes the device in his hand -- then blows in it.
         We hear FEEDBACK. It's a microphone (like ones used to
         introduce boxers). He taps it. This thing on? It is.
         He faces them, holds up a book entitled... "       " --
         smirks, then begins to read Vogon poetry.

                     The second worst is that of the Azgoths of

                     gnawing one of his own legs off.

        Spasms wrack Ford's body.    He SCREAMS.     Arthur squints.

        Ford's entire body tenses, arches, then goes limp.
        Arthur lets out an audible sigh as the poem ends.

                             GUIDE VOICE
                     The absolute worst poetry was written by
                     Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings of Sussix.
                     It involved decaying swans. Luckily, it
                     was destroyed when the Earth was.

                     simple choice. Either die in the vacuum
                     of space, or -- tell what you thought of
                     my poem.

        Ford is spent, can't say a word. Arthur looks up.

                     Actually...I rather liked it.

        Jeltz looks surprised. Ford notices, whispers to Arthur.

                  soul, which contrives through the medium
                  of the verse structure to sublimate, er...

                          ARTHUR
                  ... the poem was about.

        Jeltz rubs one of his chins, then smiles and claps slowly.

                             FORD
                  Damn.

                             ARTHUR
                  What?

                          FORD
                  I think you just saved my life again.

                          JELTZ
                  An astute analysis. Very impressive.
                     (turning to the Guard)
                  Throw them off the ship.

        The guard grabs them, drags them out of the bridge.

                          VOGON GUARD
                  Resistance is useless!

                           JELTZ
                  Hmph. "Counterpoint the surrealism of the
                  underlying metaphor..." Death's too good
                  for them.

        Jeltz picks up his fishing rod, goes for another crab.

28      INT. VOGON SHIP CORRIDOR -- MOMENTS LATER                     28

        The Guard shoves them into the airlock.

        They sit, panting.    Arthur stares forward.

                           ARTHUR
                   So this is it? We're going to die?

                        (reaching for it)
                     No, it's nothing. We are going to die.

        Arthur sits for a moment, then oddly chuckles to himself.

                             ARTHUR
                     You know, it's at times like this, when
                     I'm trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man
                     from Betelgeuse and about to die of
                     asphyxiation in deep space that I really
                     wish I'd listened to what my mother told
                     me when I was young.

                             FORD
                     Why? What did you she tell you?

                             ARTHUR
                     I don't know. I didn't listen.

        Ford folds his towel into a tiny square, holds it up
        toward Arthur. He raises an eyebrow. Will this help?

                             FORD
                     You're sweating.

        Ford dabs Arthur's brow. They stare forward at the
        airlock door. Long pause. Nothing happens. They look
        to each other. Shrug. They might be okay. Then --
        PSSH. The bottom drops out. They're sucked down and out.

30      EXT. DEEP SPACE -- CONTINUOUS                                   30

        Ford and Arthur spin away from the ship, holding their
        breath. The guide slips out of Arthur's pocket.

                             GUIDE VOICE
                     "Space..." says the introduction to the
                     Hitchhikers Guide, "...is big. Really big.
                     You just won't believe how vastly, hugely
                     mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you
                     may think it's a long way down the road to
                     the market, but that's just peanuts
                     compared to space..." and so on.

        The weightless guide twirls away.    Arthur reaches for it.
        The words "DON'T PANIC" alight.

                             GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
                     It also says that if you hold a lung full
                     of air you can survive in the total vacuum
                     of space for about thirty seconds -- but
                     with space being really big and all, the
                     chances of being picked up within that

        Something else falls out of his pocket -- his digital
        phone with the photo of he and Tricia at the fancy dress
        party.

                             GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
                     ...which, by a staggering coincidence, is
                     also the telephone number of the Islington
                     flat where Arthur once went to a fancy
                     dress party and met a very nice girl whom
                     he totally failed to connect with.

        He reaches for the phone, it's just beyond his fingertips.
        His eyes widen with fret as the phone tumbles away.

30a     Then -- WOOMPH -- space seems to stretch and bend. A tiny        30a
        hole appears, then opens wide. Paper hats and party
        balloons fall out, then drift away. The hole flips inside
        out. Arthur and Ford are enveloped, then replaced by a
        stunning, sleek starship, the HEART OF GOLD.

        In the middle of this hi-tech receiving bay sit two
        ornate golden brocade sofas.

                             FORD
                     I think I know how you feel.

        A long pause. Both sofas begin to thrash in panic.

                  ...and of course, the top story is still
                  the sensational theft of the new
                  Improbability Drive prototype ship Heart of
                  Gold last week, stolen at the launch
                  ceremony by none other than Galactic
                  President Zaphod Beeblebrox.

                          ZAPHOD (ON TV)
                  So, in the name of the people and freedom
                  and, I dunno, democracy and stuff like
                  that, I hereby declare this ship
                  officially stolen!

        PULL BACK to reveal ZAPHOD BEEBLEBROX, leaning toward the
        TV, watching with a very satisfied grin...

                  Three to one...two to one...

        Annoyed, he turns. There's a woman with red hair
        (TRILLIAN), her back to him, reading numbers off a
        console display and speaking into a microphone.

                  therefore your own problem. Please relax.
                  You will be sent for soon.

                            ZAPHOD
                   Hey.   Do you mind?   I can't hear.

        TRILLIAN turns -- and we now recognize her as Tricia from
        the fancy dress party. Her hair is shorter and bright
        red. She looks amazing.

                           TRILLIAN
                   Can we put your ego aside for one moment?
                   Something important has happened.

                           ZAPHOD
                   If there's anything more important than my
                   ego on this ship, I want it caught and
                   shot now.

        He turns back to the TV and turns it up.

                           REPORTER (OK TV)
                   ...the question everyone seems to be

        The TV suddenly clicks off.    Zaphod spins.    Trillian's
        holding a remote.

                            ZAPHOD

                  We have a couple of hitchhikers in our
                  receiving bay.

        His head jerks upwards. He quickly grabs it with his
        hands and shoves it back down.

                          TRILLIAN (CONT'D)
                  I didn't pick them up. The ship did.

                            ZAPHOD
                  Huh?

                          TRILLIAN
                  When you engaged the Improbability Drive.

                          ZAPHOD
                  I didn't engage the drive.

                          TRILLIAN
                  We picked them up in sector ZZ9 Plural Z
                  Alpha -- where you picked me up.

                          ZAPHOD
                  That's impossible.

                            TRILLIAN
                  No.    Just very, very improbable.

                           ZAPHOD
                  I don't have time for this! We've got the
                  police of half the Galaxy after us and we
                  stop to pick up hitchhikers?! Okay, so
                  ten out of ten for style, but minus
                  several million for good thinking, eh?

        He reaches for a hi-tech gun on the wall.      She stops him.

                          TRILLIAN
                  Don't. I'll send Marvin. (calling)
                  Marvin!

        Zaphod rolls his eyes as a humanoid robot rises from its
        seat behind them. This is MARVIN. He trudges slump-
        shouldered toward Zaphod.

                          MARVIN
                  I think you ought to know I'm feeling very

        Marvin turns and trudges away. Then he turns again.

                           MARVIN
                  Life.   Don't talk to me about life.

        Marvin trudges away. A door slides open for him and
        makes an audible, satisfied SIGH as it does.

        Kwaltz sits at the end of a concrete war room table.

                     Get me the vice-president.

        Approximately 15 Vogons sit around the table murmuring
        sporadically. A VOGON MESSENGER runs up, holding papers.
        Kwaltz takes them, signs, signs the next page -- and the
        next. He hands them back to the messengers (who has been
        jogging in place the whole time). He runs off. The
        VOGON CAPTAIN appears on the large screen before him.

37      INT. HEART OF GOLD. RECEIVING BAY - NIGHT                              37

        Arthur looks around and notices the room is gleaming
        white, hi-tech, brand new, plastic still on some stuff.

                              ARTHUR
                     Now this is more like my idea of a
                     spaceship. Look at all these buttons...

                             FORD (CONT'D)
                     This way.

        He pushes a button. The door slides open with a satisfied
        sigh -- "Hhhmmyaaaahhh". As they walk through...

                     Ghastly, isn't it?

        They whip around to find Marvin standing before them.

                      I've been ordered to take you up to the

                      'cause I don't.

         Marvin turns and walks away. They shrug to each other and
         follow. Marvin passes through another door that opens with
         the same sigh -- "Hhmmaaaahhh"

                    Probably because he's so negative.

                    Yes, I know. I was being...never mind.

38       INT. HEART OF GOLD. BRIDGE. -- MOMENTS LATER                  38

         HANGING ON THE WALL is the official presidential portrait,
         featuring Zaphod who sports a very smart suit and a fake
         politicians smile. Tilt down to the door which opens -
         "Mmyyahhh!" - to reveal Ford, Arthur and Marvin.

                            MARVIN
                    I've brought the aliens.    Don't thank me
                    or anything.

         Zaphod spins around in his chair, holding a gun but
         sporting that same politically correct smile.

                              ZAPHOD
                    Freeze!

         Arthur and Ford throw their hands up.      Marvin doesn't.

                            MARVIN
                    Do you mean sit in a corner and rust or
                    just fall apart where I'm standing?

                           ZAPHOD

         Zaphod gives Ford a big bear hug. He pulls away, then
         playfully punches Ford in the arm.

        Arthur is stunned silent. He goes to her, making sure she's
        really there. He's speechless. She smiles and gives him a

                   I know. And it was rude to just leave,

                   he had a spaceship parked outside, well,

                   Actually -- I am that type. But...well
                   you do know what happened, don't you?

        Zaphod stops in between them, puts his arm around Arthur.

                           ZAPHOD
                   --Ford picked him up, they hitched a ride,

                   talk, Trill. We're on the run, remember?
                   I stole a ship?

                   mind.

        Arthur SHOVES Zaphod's hand off his shoulder. Oddly,
        Zaphod reacts with a smile. And then -- his head shoots
        all the up way revealing a second head that lives
        somewhere under his chin.

                            ZAPHOD HEAD 2
                    You blew it with her, Earthman, so shut up

        Arthur recoils in horror, instinctively raises his fists.

        Zaphod wrestles with Head 2 while A THIRD ARM springs out
        of Zaphod's chest and PUNCHES ARTHUR in the jaw. Arthur
        buckles and hits the floor.

         Trillian leaves Arthur, joins Zaphod

                       They're after us! Fire a gun! Launch a

         A dull gray rectangular Vogon BATTLE CRUISER is easing up
         behind the Heart of Gold. Behind the cruiser is about
         ONE HUNDRED OTHER BATTLE SHIPS, flying in formation.

                     such an effort, and gee am I impressed.
                     They're sending a message. I'd be super

        An IMAGE APPEARS on the ship's monitor - Vice President,
        QUESTULAR RONTOK, flanked by Vogon Commander KWALTZ {at
        H.Q.). He looks reluctant. He has to say this...

                          QUESTULAR (ON MONITOR)
                  This is Vice President Questular Rontok.
                  I am speaking to the kidnapper of the
                  President. Surrender your stolen vessel at
                  once or we will take action as defined and
                  permitted by Section 1.8 of the Galactic
                  Interstellar Space Bi-Laws.

                          ZAPHOD HEAD 2
                  Leap to hyperspace!

                          EDDIE
                  Sure thing, fella, but I should tell you
                  we need proper authorization before
                  entering a hyperspace expressway.

                          ZAPHOD HEAD 2
                  Or else what? They'll send a hundred and
                  one ships? DO it!

        He and Trillian buckle up. Ford turns to Arthur.

                          FORD
                  Brace yourself.   This is a bit like being
                  drunk.

                          ARTHUR
                  What's so bad about being drunk?

        They are stretched and squeezed by extraordinary forces.

                             VOGON WORKER
                     No, Commander.

                             KWALTZ
                     Add that to their list of offences!
                        (scoffing)
                     Blatant disregard for protocol.

                            QUESTULAR
                     You do realize he did what he did because
                     he knew this is what you would do.

                            KWALTZ
                     Rules are rules, Mr. Vice President.     And
                     they are made to be followed.

        Questular looks up to the screen at all the Vogon ships.

                            QUESTULAR
                     Don't you think this many ships is a bit,
                     oh I don't know -- excessive?

                            KWALTZ
                     The provisions are clear. Under
                     subsection 37a these are the forces we
                     deploy to protect the president in the
                     case of an attempted or actual kidnapping-

        He holds up one fat official book with one hand.

                            KWALTZ (CONT'D)
                     -- and these are the forces we deploy to
                     apprehend any intentional or actual
                     kidnapper.

        He holds up another fat book with the other.

                            QUESTULAR
                     You are aware, Commander, that the
                     President kidnapped himself.

                            KWALTZ
                     Hence...

        He puts the two books together, slams them down.

                            QUESTULAR
                     Do you have any idea how ridiculous this
                     is?

                            KWALTZ
                     I don't have ideas Mr. Vice President.     I
                     just do what I do.

        A VOGON MESSENGER runs up holding papers. Kwaltz takes
        them, signs one in two places, initials others, lifts the
        top sheet, removes the pink copy. Folds it.

        Questular watches dumbfounded as Kwaltz hands the papers
        back to the messenger who turns and runs off.

        Hands slam Head 2 down.         Zaphod (Head 1) turns to Ford.

                     Apparently you can't be President with a

                     So you carved it up?

                     such a way that it wouldn't be detected by
                     the Government screening tests -- or by
                     me. So, what's so secret that I can't let
                     anybody know I know it, not the Galactic
                     Government, not even myself? And the
                     answer is--
                        (thinking)
                     --I don't know. Obviously. But I put a

                     Can it keep? You might want to see this.

        Arthur nods. She leaves.        He looks at his "tea", throws
        it in the trash bin.

    3   INT. HEART OF GOLD, BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                     43

        Trillian and Arthur join Ford and Zaphod at the computer.

                          ZAPHOD
                  --and when I saw what I'm about to show
                  you, that's when I realized why I did what
                  I did to my brain -- or it least, I think
                  that's why.

44      ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN --                                   44

        The screen brightens. A BRAND LOGO appears (a circle made
        of a dotted line with an "M" in the middle) then a sub-
        title: MAGRATHEAN PUBLIC ARCHIVE. Zaphod fast forwards
        until a noisy picture DISSOLVES TO...

45      EXT. OUTSIDE TEMPLE OF DEEP THOUGHT -- DAY                  45

        A procession surrounds a CHARIOT. Two young philosophers,
        LUNKWILL and FOOK (20'S) ride it into a grand TEMPLE.

46      INT. TEMPLE OF DEEP THOUGHT.                                46

        The aisles are lined with Priest-Technicians. Ahead is
        DEEP THOUGHT - a huge Buddha-esque computer.

        The procession peels away to both sides. Lunkwill and
        Fook dismount and approach.

                          DEEP THOUGHT
                     (deep and sonorous)
                  What is this great task for which I, Deep
                  Thought, the second greatest computer of
                  all time have been called into existence?

                          LUNKWILL
                  Your task, O computer...

                          FOOK
                  Hang on. Did you say second greatest?

                          DEEP THOUGHT
                  Second greatest. Yes.

                          FOOK
                  But we designed you to be the greatest
                  computer so you could...

                          LUNKWILL
                  You're not talking about the Milliard
                  Gargantubrain which can count all the
                  atoms in a star in a millisecond?

                          DEEP THOUGHT
                  The Milliard Gargantubrain? A mere abacus,
                  mention it not.

                          FOOK
                  The Omnicognate Neutron Wrangler then?

                             DEEP THOUGHT
                     The Omnicognate Neutron Wrangler could
                     argue all four legs off an Arcturan
                     Megadonkey, but only I could persuade it
                     to go for a walk afterwards.

                             FOOK
                     Then what's the problem?

                             DEEP THOUGHT
                     I am the greatest computer you are able to
                     design without my help. Which, one day,
                     you are going to need.

                              LUNKWILL
                         (to Fook)
                     Let's just ask the question.

                              FOOK
                     Oh Deep Thought, your task is this. We
                     want you to tell us -- the Answer.

        Long pause.    Deep Thought bleeps and bloops.

                             DEEP THOUGHT
                     The Answer...to what?

                              LUNKWILL
                     You know. The answer.      To Life...the
                     Universe...Everything.

                              FOOK
                     We'd really like an answer. Something
                     simple. Can you do it?

                             DEEP THOUGHT
                     The Ultimate Question of Life, the
                     Universe and Everything. Yes. There is an
                     answer. But I'll have to think about it.

        Lunkwill glances at his time piece, Fook at the expectant
        throng behind them. They wait.

                             DEEP THOUGHT (CONT'D)
                     Return to this place in exactly... seven and
                     a half million years.

                              LUNKWILL & FOOK
                     What?!

        PSSSH.   The screen goes to snow.

48      INT. TEMPLE OF DEEP THOUGHT --                                     48

        Lunkwill and Fook enter the now modern temple, flanked by a
        crowd. They have beards and look like they're in their
        40's. Deep Thought rises, looks lifeless. WORRIED MUTTERS
        FROM THE CROWD. Slowly, Deep Thought groans to life.

                             DEEP THOUGHT
                     Can I help you?

                             FOOK

                             DEEP THOUGHT
                     An answer for you? Yes. I have.

                             FOOK
                     There really is an answer?

                             DEEP THOUGHT
                     Yes. There really is one.

                                FOOK
                           (almost strangled with emotion)
                     Oh!

                             LUNKWILL
                     Can you tell us what it is?

                             DEEP THOUGHT
                     Yes. Though I don't think you're going to
                     like it.

                             FOOK

                     I checked it thoroughly. It would have
                     been simpler, of course, to have known
                     what the actual question was.

                     Yes, but what actually is it?

                             FOOK (O.S.)
                     Everything! You know ... just EVERYTHING!

                             DEEP THOUGHT (O.S.)
                     That's not a question. Only when you know

                     what the answer means.

                     it... so you could go to Magrathea --
                     which, according to most sane people,
                     doesn't even exist?

                             ARTHUR
                     Why this ship? What's so special about
                     it?

        Zaphod thinks again -- hard.

                             ZAPHOD
                     I don't seem to be letting myself in on
                     any of my secrets.

                             TRILLIAN (O.S.)
                     Because of this, obviously.

        They turn to see Trillian flipping open a glass lid
        revealing a BIG RED BUTTON. Ford reads the glowing
        letters above the button...

                  dead.

        He takes out the Guide.       Zaphod looks to Trillian.

                          TRILLIAN
                  Definitely. I'm in.

        They're all standing together. They turn to Arthur.
        Arthur looks to Trillian. She stares back -- waiting.

                          ARTHUR
                  Do I even have a choice?

        Zaphod smiles, all bright and cheery.

                             ZAPHOD
                  No!

        Arthur looks at the button.

                  What exactly does an Infinite

                             GUIDE VOICE
                     The Infinite Improbability Drive is a new
                     method of crossing vast interstellar
                     distances without all that tedious mucking
                     about in hyperspace. As soon as the drive
                     reaches Infinite Improbability, it passes
                     through every conceivable point in every
                     conceivable Universe almost simultaneously,
                     then selects the appropriate re-entry
                     point. The principle of generating small
                     amounts of finite improbability by hooking
                     the logic circuits of a Bambleweeny 57 Sub-
                     Meson Brain to an atomic vector plotter
                     suspended in a strong Brownian Motion
                     producer, say a nice hot cup of tea, were
                     of course well understood.

        Seconds later, the Vogon Destroyer comes out of
        hyperspace and slows to cruising speed.

        Vogon controllers and copilots turn dials and push

                     Such generators were often used to break
                     the ice at parties by making all the
                     molecules in the hostess's undergarments
                     leap simultaneously one foot to the left,
                     in accordance with the Theory of
                     Indeterminacy.

        Kwaltz and Questular appear on the monitor.

                     Well, Captain...?

        Controllers turn more dials, trying to find the ship.

                     Many respectable physicists said they
                     weren't going to stand for that sort of
                     thing partly because it was a debasement
                     of science, but mostly because they didn't
                     get invited to those sort of parties.

        We hover above a greenish/purplish planet.

        IMPROBABILITY EFFECT - space RIPPLES. Something begins to
        materialize, something big and gray - tumbling toward us.

        We now see the big, gray thing is a GIANT RHINOCEROS --
        which ripples, flips inside out and becomes the Heart of
        Gold.

        sit in chairs before the ships console.

                  Very probably, yes.

53      The air ripples. The 'knitted' crew flip back to their       53
        former selves. Arthur pukes into a trash bin and with a
        sick expression, looks up to the screen.

                          ARTHUR
                  Did it work? Are we there?

        Now Zaphod looks -- and he's elated.

        the chair and brushes it off.

        The two mice land on the floor across the ship, then
        scurry away down a hallway. Before Arthur can react...

        Vogon crew quickly enter data. A FLIGHT ENGINEER gets
        something on his screen, shows it to the Captain.

                             VOGON CAPTAIN
                     Sir, the Heart of Gold has just requested
                     permission to land on Viltvodle 6. Should
                     I pursue?

                     That is not a request to which I can
                     respond, captain. Should I pursue what?
                     Are you requesting hyperspace clearance so
                     that you may pursue the fugitive?

                             VOGON CAPTAIN
                     Yes, commander.

                             KWALTZ (ON MONITOR)
                     Then you must say that, captain -- in

        All we can see are the lights of the Heart of Gold's
        entry ramp cutting through a dense fog. Or is it fog?

        Zaphod's 2nd head is up as he comes down the ramp ahead
        of the other three.

                     Sorry, but I can't for the life of me
                     figure out why you, the most brilliant
                     woman I have ever met, have ended up with
                     that half-witted, self-obsessed, vapid
                     politician! I mean, look at him!

        They squint through the fog at Zaphod, Head 2 out. His
        hands keep trying to get it down but the 3rd arm keeps
        whacking them away. He disappears into the fog.

                             FORD (CONT'D)
                     I wouldn't tell her if I were you.

                             ARTHUR
                     She deserves to know.

                              FORD
                     But if you tell her and she ends up with
                     you because you're literally the last guy
                     on Earth -- you'll always doubt her
                     intentions.

        Arthur considers this.      Nods.

                             FORD (CONT'D)
                     Got your towel?

                             ARTHUR
                     Do I need it?

                             FORD
                     Only always.

        Ford puts his towel to his mouth as they follow Trillian
        down the mist covered street. She's reading the guide.

                     In the beginning, the universe was created.
                     This made a lot of people very angry and
                     has been widely regarded as a bad move.

        Zaphod continues several steps ahead of them.

                   Humma Kavula!

        SLAM.   Zaphod's two arms shove his chin back down.

                           ZAPHOD
                   I'll handle this.

56a     EXT. SEEDY STREET-VILTVODLE                                   56a

        The others approach, watching Zaphod as he stops a
        passing an eight-armed alien creature, asks him
        something, oozing charm. The creature points down the
        street with 3 arms, then with 2 others hands him a pen
        and paper. Zaphod signs an autograph and moves on.

        The alien beams, then squirts three cans of aerosol under
        several arms. More mist rises. FOLLOW IT UP revealing:

57      A LARGE BUILDING -- a temple with two giant arches.           57

        The others follow. CAMERA TILTS UP and we see this
        building looks like a nose lying horizontally, the "giant
        arches" are the nostrils.

58      INT. ARKLESEIZURE TEMPLE - CONTINUOUS                         58

        Zaphod opens the huge doors inside the large
        nostril/arches. A rush of air blows the mist past Ford,
        Trillian and Arthur a few steps behind. They stop.

        A congregation of worshipers faces front where HUMMA KAVULA
        stands behind a podium. He's a humanoid wearing a white
        robe and night-vision sun glasses.

                           HUMMA KAVULA
                   The handkerchief is coming, beloveds. Are
                   you ready? Let us pray that the almighty
                   will exhale a breath of compassion on us.

        Instead of bowing, they all point their noses heavenward.
        Zaphod marches down the center aisle while Humma prays.

                           HUMMA KAVULA (CONT'D)
                   Almighty Arkleseizure, we lift our noses,
                   clogged and unblown in reverence to you.

        Zaphod stops a few feet away from Humma's chair.

                           ZAPHOD
                   Hello, Humma.

                             ARTHUR
                     That's Humma Kavula? I thought he was
                     just using a swear word.

                             FORD
                        (shaking his head)
                     Humma Kavula was his opponent in the
                     election. Something happened during the
                     campaign. Zaphod never forgave him.

                             ARTHUR
                     What was it?

        Ford shrugs.    HUMMA looks up, sees Zaphod, smiles.

                             HUMMA KAVULA
                        (wrapping up the prayer)
                     Send the handkerchief, lord, so that it may
                     wipe us clean. We ask this in your

                     Achoo.

        And they all sneeze. Akin to crossing himself, Humma
        raises a hand to his nose, then down again.

                             HUMMA KAVULA
                     Bless you.

59      INT. HUMMA'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS                             59

        Humma's quarters are opulent. He sits behind his desk
        flanked by several ARMED BODY GUARDS. Ford, Arthur and
        Trillian keep a safe distance as Zaphod faces off with
        Humma who has the air of a cool news anchor man.

                         HUMMA KAVULA
                 Zaphod Beeblebrox, our famous President.
                 The Arkleseizure has exhaled many
                 blessings upon you. What brings you to
                 our humble planet?

                         ZAPHOD
                 I think you know why I'm here.

                         HUMMA KAVULA
                 I don't think I do.

                         ZAPHOD
                 Oh, I think you think you don't, but we
                 both know -- you do.

                         HUMMA KAVULA
                 Elequent as always, Zaphod. Your ability
                 to communicate a clear thought never
                 ceases to amaze.

        Head 2 suddenly springs up -- to the surprise of all.

                         ZAPHOD HEAD 2
                 You called me stupid!

                         HUMKA KAVULA
                    (re: the heads)
                 Interesting. And I don't know what you're
                 talking about.

                         ZAPHOD HEAD 2
                 During the campaign, Humma -- you said I
                 was stupid.

                         HUMMA KAVULA
                 This Humma you speak of no longer exists.
                 He came here in his consolation position
                 as Ambassador to Gamma Z10 to squelch an
                 ideological threat to the system and
                 repented from his wicked ways. He now
                 goes by the holy name Tazelo the
                 Unceasingly Righteous, given to him by his
                 devoted followers.

                            ZAPHOD HEAD 2
                     I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU CALL YOURSELF, YOU
                     RIGHTEOUS FREAK!! YOU STARTED THE RUMOR
                     THAT I'M STUPID AND YOU'RE GONNA PAY!!!

        The 3rd arm reaches for a gun in Zaphod's vest. The BODY
        GUARDS aim their weapons. One runs up and smacks Zaphod
        in the back of the head -- slamming Head 2 back in place.

                            ZAPHOD
                     Thank you.

        The 3rd arm disappears.      The gun falls.   A BODY GUARD
        picks it up.

        WITH ARTHUR, FORD AND TRILLIAN

                            ARTHUR
                     Why do I get the feeling he's going to get
                     us all killed?

                            FORD
                     Probably because it's very possible.    Just
                     don't save me, okay? We're even.

        Humma lays his palms on the table and lifts himself as if
        to stand - but there is nothing of him below the table
        line except for thirty, one inch metal legs, attached to
        the base of his torso. He glides towards Zaphod, the
        little legs extending to reach the floor as he reaches
        the end of the table.

                          HUMMA KAVULA
                  The election is ancient history, Zaphod,
                  but if memory serves -- you won, proving
                  that good looks and charm win over
                  brilliance and ability to govern.

        A guard drapes a white robes over Humma's shoulders - which
        he ties with a belt - hiding his peculiar undercarriage.

                          HUMMA KAVULA (CONT'D)
                  And incidently -- you are stupid.

        His head jerks up.   Zaphod stops it, paints on a smile.

                          ZAPHOD
                  That's really not the point.

                          HUMMA KAVULA
                  You haven't come halfway across the galaxy
                  to settle a campaign grudge. Why are you
                  here, Zaphod?

        Zaphod doesn't answer. Humma motions to a guard who
        grabs his arm, twists it -- hard.

                          ZAPHOD
                     (wincing)
                  I don't know. I was headed for Magrathea,
                  I ended up here.

        PUSH IN ON HUMMA -- who raises his hi-tech sun glasses.

                          HUMMA KAVULA
                  How very, very...
                     (knowingly)
                  ...improbable.

        He pulls the nose off his body guard, turns a key.    A
        secret safe door slides open from the mans' chest.

                          HUMMA KAVULA (CONT'D)
                  I kept a few souvenirs from my former
                  life. Ah, the heady days of space
                  piracy... so young, so foolish..,

        Another, smaller box rises from the chest cabinet. Inside
        we see glowing jewels, a skeleton hand, etc. Humma
        removes a PINK CUBE (like Zaphod's blue cube.)

                  I'll gladly give you the coordinates to
                  Magrathea...

        He holds up the pink cube revealing A SERIES OF
        COORDINATE NUMBERS on each side. Zaphod reaches for it.
        Humma takes it back...

                   Only what does Zaphod Beeblebrox treasure?

        ON ZAPHOD'S SECOND HEAD -- peeping out of the collar
        looking terrified.

        Humma smiles. Bingo. He signals the guards. They grab
        Zaphod who looks back to Trillian, offers a weak smile.

    1   INT. HUMMA KAVULA'S ROOM -- LATER                           61

        Zaphod's head hangs on the wall. Wires feed out of the
        neck into a huge machine.
        Beneath the head is a crude drawing of a body and the
        words "I'm with Stupid." An arrow points to Zaphod's
        Head 2 -- which is shouting...

                           ZAPHOD HEAD 2
                   IDIOT! ZARKING MORON!! COME BACK!! YOU
                   NEED ME!! COME BAAAAACKKKK!!!!

                           HUMMA KAVULA
                   You should quit while you're "a head"
                   Zaphod. No one has ever got passed the
                   Magrathean defence system alive.

        Humma laughs maniacally.

62      EXT. VILTVODLE 6. MAIN STREET - NIGHT                       62

        Zaphod, held aloft on Ford and Arthur's shoulders,
        staggers down the street toward the spaceport where the
        Heart of Gold is parked. His neck is wrapped with a
        blood-soaked bandage which looks like a scarlet ascot.

                           ARTHUR
                   Are we sure this is the right way?

                            FORD
                   Yes!   I think.   I don't know.   Maybe not.

                           ARTHUR
                   Yes, thank you for clearing that up.

        Ford looks puzzled at Arthur. Did I clear it up? A crowd
        has gathered. When they see Zaphod, they scream...

                           CROWD
                   Mr. President!...Zaphod, over here!...I
                   want to have your baby!, etc...

        Zaphod, still feeling the effects of whatever drugs he
        was given, dons a presidential smile and waves.

                           FORD
                   Back to the ship. Quickly.

        They quicken their pace when suddenly...

        FIFTY VOGON POLICE -- emerge from the mist.

                           VOGON POLICE #1
                   Mr. President! We are here for your
                   protection!

        Zaphod, Ford, Trillian and Arthur freeze in their tracks.

         Kwaltz and Questular watch the action on the front

         The police fire.      F, T, & A run for it, but Z stays put.

                            ZAPHOD
                    Zarquon! Friendly fire! Well, if that's
                    what they want--

         He pulls out his gun up and fires back.

                            ZAPHOD (CONT'D)
                    Hey! Let's do lunch! Nice haircut, fella!
                    Hey! Your kids are the same age as mine--
                    We should get them together some time!

         With each line he fires. Ford grabs him. Shots hit a
         stack of aerosol cans. They EXPLODE. More mist rises.

(62 cont) BEHIND THE KIOSK--                                            (62 cont}

         The gang run down an alley and hide behind a kiosk.
         Zaphod sports a goofy smile. Arthur is scared to death.

                            ARTHUR
                    Oh God, I really hate Thursdays.

                            FORD
                    Zaphod, what do we do?

                            ZAPHOD
                    Build bridges between the stars!
                    He holds up two peace signs, a la Nixon.

                               ARTHUR
                    What?

                            FORD
                    I think that was his campaign slogan.

         Trillian finds a deodorant can, grabs it, gets an idea.

                            TRILLIAN
                    Alright, follow me.
               She aims the can at Zaphod's ear- Arthur's face registers
               the madness of the moment.

(62 cont) ON SCREEN -- Trillian, with aerosol can to Zaphod's ear (62 cont)
          moves down the street. The crowd GASPS. The quartet
          continues anxiously forward, eyeing the police whose guns
          track their every move.

                               TRILLIAN

(62 cont) The police step backwards -- but the crowd takes a step       (62 cont)
          forward. A huddle of female ADMIRERS rush them, waving
          pens and paper as if the Beatles have arrived.

                               ADMIRERS
                       Mr. President, Mr. President!...

            Zaphod paints on a smile, breaks away from the others to
            go sign a few autographs.

                              FEMALE ADMIRER
                      I totally voted for you!

(62 cont) CHAOS! The walrusy Vogon police swarm in like maggots,        (62 cont)
          surrounding Trillian and edging Ford and Arthur away.

                               VOGON POLICE
                       Resistance is useless!

            Shots are fired. The crowd SCREAMS and SCATTERS. Arthur
            reaches for Trillian but she is engulfed by Vogons who
            move, en masse, and pull her away into the mist.

                                ARTHUR
                      Tricia!

            Ford, with Zaphod in tow, shoves Arthur forward, using
            his towel to clear a path through the mist. They see the
            Heart of Gold ramp descending from the belly of the ship.

                               FORD

            usher Trillian, in futuristic hand-cuffs, past the Vogon
            Captain who stands in the foreground on his ship.

                          And until the kidnapper is properly
                          processed, she isn't officially
                          apprehended, now is she, Mr. Vice-
                          President?

            Questular pulls out another small clump of hair.

        Arthur sees the Vogon ships getting away. Desperate, he
        shoves_Zaphod out of_the_driver's seat. Zaphod hits the
        floor, considers protesting, lies down on the floor to
        sleep instead -- with a contented smile.

        Arthur sits. He looks very out of place in a seat
        normally reserved for the likes of Han Solo. He scans
        the console. Ford sits in the seat beside him.

64a     DING. A chime sounds. A switch on the console                 64a

        The cockpit is sealed in a glass ball and shoots upwards.

        little glass pod. It floats through space, then rear
        thrusters ignite and blast the ship forward.

        An aircraft steering wheel rises up between Arthur's

        Ford pushes a big button.    AN ALARM SOUNDS!

                     A sign lit up saying "Please do not push

        Arthur grabs the control, does his best to steer.

    9    DIFFERENT PART OF VOGSPHERE/NEAR SWAMP--                          69

         The ground is barren. A scintillatingly jeweled crab
         crawls out of a swamp and looks up at the sky. We hear
         the sound of the pod approaching (but hold on the crab)
         as EEEOOOO-KA-KFFFZZZ! The crab runs back into the
         swamp. PAN LEFT to see the pod rammed into the ground,
         steam rising. The door opens. The three emerge.

                              FORD

                    Wrong. This is the Vogon planet.     This is
                    Vogsphere.

                             ZAPHOD
                    No.   It's Magrathea!   I know it!

         Ford reaches in his satchel, pulls out a sort of
         ELECTRONIC BERET, pulls it snugly onto Zaphod's head.

                    Little something I learned about on an

                    I checked the guide for ways to rescue a
                    prisoner from Vogsphere. It said "Don't."

                     Well, I sort of had this idea we could...

        A TELESCOPIC ROD WITH A PADDLE AT THE TOP shoots out of
        the ground, SMACKS Arthur on the face, then retracts.

        Arthur is stunned. None of the others have noticed.

                             ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                     Did anyone see that?

        They look at Arthur. It suddenly seems ridiculous.

                             ARTHUR
                     Nothing.

        They all walk along - Arthur at the back, perplexed.

        Another paddle springs up, double smack in the face.
        Arthur leaps back. Looks down. Nothing. Nothing at all.

                             ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                     Alright, stop. Everyone stop and watch

                     AH!

                  I think we should keep going.

        A paddle shoots up, smacks Zaphod's face.    They all saw.

                  I have... an idea.

        A paddle shoots up. Ford ducks. It misses. He grabs its
        telescopic stalk. It thrashes in his hands. He breaks it.

                         FORD (CONT'D)
                  Okay, don't think of anything.     Don't have
                  ideas or theories -- nothing.

        A beat. They all strain to think of nothing.     Several
        paddles shoot up. Smacking them.

                         ARTHUR
                  I can't, help it!    Trillian is in there

        They take off running. A forest of paddle stalks erupts
        out of the ground around them, smacking violently.

        They come to rest at the side of a Vogon building.

         The front doors BURST open. Arthur storms through them,
         holding Marvin's arm which has the fingers pointed like a
         gun. He trips, falls, drops the arm, picks it up again,
         trying hard to look tough. Ford and Zaphod follow, Zaphod
         wearing the Thinking Cap and sunglasses for disguise.
         Ford wearing his towel over his face like a bandit.

                       President, in which case you are to be fed
                       to the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal.
                       We thank you for your cooperation.

            A door is opened revealing a room with a large steel box.
            A huge, angry eye stares out of a tiny barred window.

            The box shakes like crazy. Trillian gulps.

            Zaphod is in line with Arthur and Ford.     He looks up to:

            A PRESIDENTIAL PHOTOGRAPH -- of himself, in suit and tie,
            smiling broadly. He lowers his thinking cap.

                               FEMALE VOGON PROCESSOR
                       Next!

            Arthur steps up, followed by Ford and Zaphod who keeps
            his head low and bowed.

                               ARTHUR
                       Yes. Hi. We're here about getting a
                       prisoner released?

                               FEMALE VOGON PROCESSOR
                       Prisoner release form?

            She holds out her hand. Arthur doesn't have a form.
            Annoyed, she points across the room to a wall that is
            nothing but shelves holding forms.

                           ARTHUR
                  Right. Once I've filled it out can I
                  return to the front of the line, seeing as
                  I've already waited...

                              FEMALE VOGON PROCESSOR
                  No.     Next!

        Arthur sighs, frustrated. All three of them walk to the
        shelves holding the forms. Arthur turns to Zaphod.

                           ARTHUR
                  Can't you do something?!     You're
                  President, aren't you?

                           ZAPHOD
                  You want me to make a speech, shake a
                  hand? That's what I do -- I think. It's
                  all a little fuzzy.

        Arthur angrily fills out the form.

        MOMENTS LATER--

        Arthur is back in line, having waited a long time. He
        finally gets to the window, hands the green form to the
        Vogon Processor. She types into her computer, then checks
        the screen.

                          FEMALE VOGON PROCESSOR
                  This Prisoner is being detained for...
                     (reading)
                  Kidnapping the president. Not eligible for
                  release at this time. You can make an
                  appointment for a later date or take a
                  number and wait.

        Arthur's breathing quickens.     He can't take this.

                          ARTHUR
                  Alright, look.
                      (yanks thinking cap and
                       sunglasses off Zaphod)
                  This is the President.

        She looks at Zaphod, then back to the large portrait of
        Zaphod, then back to Zaphod. She nods. Okay...

                              ARTHUR   (CONT'D)
                      He says the whole kidnapping thing was a
                      terrible misunderstanding, she didn't mean
                      anything by it and he's ordering you to
                      let her go.

                              FEMALE VOGON PROCESSOR
                         (holding up green form)
                      But this isn't a Presidential Release of
                      Prisoner form. Those are blue.

        She points to the wall of forms. Arthur sighs.

            Trillian is lowered into the Bugblatter beast box/cage.
            We cannot see the beast but it's screams of hunger are
            scaring the hell out of Trillian.

            Zaphod hands the Vogon Processor the blue form.

                                 FEMALE VOGON PROCESSOR (CONT'D)
                       Okay...

            She reviews the form, stamps it, pulls off the carbon
            copy underneath, hands that to Zaphod.

                               VOGON PROCESSOR
                       Go to the Prisoner Release Lobby, out the
                       door, right, left, 2nd door on the right.

(72 cont) BACK WITH TRILLIAN --                                           (72 cont)

            As she braces herself to be eaten by the monster.
            Suddenly, a couple of VOGON GUARDS enter and hand Kwaltz
            a blue piece of paper. He reviews it, then signs it.

                               KWALTZ
                       You're free to go.    Release her.

            The Vogon Guard pulls Trillian up and out of the box on a
            cable. The Bugblatter beast goes berserk.

                               QUESTULAR
                       What!?
                           (yanking blue paper away,
                            reading)
                       He's here?! Zaphod is here!? Let's go
                       get him!

            But the Guard is already escorting Trillian out of the
            room. Kwaltz is completing paperwork.

                               QUESTULAR (CONT'D)
                       Commander?

            Kwaltz holds up a walrusy hand, one finger raised,
            silencing Questular while he continues. Questular sighs.

            We hear the Bugblatter beast weeping as the doors are
            closed on him.
                                                              CUT TO:

            A guard escorts Trillian into the Lobby where F, A & Z
            await. Arthur steps toward her but Zaphod steps in front
            of him, smiling, arms outstretched.

            Trillian walks up to Zaphod -- and SLAPS HIM.

        sees a one-armed Marvin standing by the glass pod. She

        TRILLIAN -- who stares out a portal window into the
        emptiness of space. A tear rolls down her cheek.

        Arthur steps up, isn't sure what to say.

                             ARTHUR
                     Look, you're right. You deserved to know
                     and I should've told you. I don't blame
                     you if you're angry.

        She turns and stares, wipes the tears away.     Can't speak.

                              ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                     Right.   Anyway...I'm sorry.

                             EDDIE (O.S.)
                     Guys, it just tickles me pink to tell you
                     we are currently in orbit at an altitude
                     of three hundred miles around the
                     legendary planet of Magrathea. Goll-ee.

        Hearing this news, Arthur, Trillian and Ford turn.

                          ZAPHOD
                       (tasting it)
                     Take us in.

83a     EXT. NIGHT DEEP SPACE - MAGRATHEA                              83a

        They all stare in awe as they move toward a planet which
        gets closer and closer. Suddenly, their faces are awash
        with light.

        Two suns rise behind the planet.     It's breathtaking.

                             ZAPHOD
                     The twin suns of Soulianis and Rahm...

        Marvin (both arms in tact) rises in the back, peers out.

                             MARVIN
                     It's rubbish.

83b     Suddenly,a ghostly white swirl of light, vaguely in the        83b
        shape of a man, appears on the screen before them.

                     Greetings. This is a recorded announcement
                     as we're all out the moment. The Commercial
                     council of Magrathea thanks you for your
                     esteemed visit, but regrets that the entire
                     planet is temporarily closed for business.
                     If you would like to leave your name and a
                     planet where you can be contacted, kindly
                     do so at the tone.

        BEEP.   Then stunned silence.

                      Closed? How can a planet be closed?

                               ZAPHOD
                      For once, Aldus, I agree with you. Okay,
                      computer. Keep going. Take us down.

                              EDDIE
                      Happy to!

         The ship eases forward. The image appears again.

                              GHOSTLY IMAGE
                      It is most gratifying that your enthusiasm
                      for our planet continues unabated.    As a
                      token of our appreciation, we hope you
                      will enjoy the two thermonuclear missiles
                      we've just sent to converge with your
                      craft. To ensure on-going quality of
                      service, your death may be monitored for
                      training purposes. Thank you.

         The image vanishes. A beat.    Then...

                              EDDIE
                      Guys, I'm delighted to tell you there are
                      two thermonuclear missiles headed right
                      for us. Should I take evasive action?

83c      The screens show two huge rockets thundering at us,               83c
         Zaphod just smiles. Ford steps up.

                              FORD
                      Um...yes, computer.   Evade!

         Massive acceleration! An illuminated dome lowers from the
         ceiling over the crew seats - creating a safety pod.

84       EXT. ABOVE MAGRATHEA. DAWN                                        84

         The Heart of Gold streaks away. Two large missiles follow
         and mimic the H.O.G.'s every move.

85       INT. THE BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                                      85

         The crew are thrown from one side of the pod to the other.

                      There seems to be something jamming my
                      guidance systems. Impact minus 45

                      relax.

            Big swell of Muzak. The ship drops like a stone.
            THE MISSILES -- miss, then turn in a screeching curve.

(85 cont) INT. THE SAFETY POD -                                            (85 cont)

            Zaphod tries to wrestle with three controls.

                                  ZAPHOD
                          I can't do this without my other arm!

                          No.   They're right behind us.

            He looks down, sees the IMPROBABILITY DRIVE BUTTON.

                                  ARTHUR
                          Look, why don't I just hit this thing?

                                   ZAPHOD
                          NO! We're here! No telling where it will

             The missiles turn and accelerate high into the sky. A
             second set of boosters kick in on the missiles as they
             soar back toward the H.O.G. --- much, much faster.

(85 cont) ON THE BRIDGE--                                                  (85 cont)

            They all stare at the approaching missiles. Arthur looks
            at the drive button. Screw it. He flips open the glass
            lid.
                               ZAPHOD
                       NO!

            Too late. ARTHUR HITS THE BUTTON.

            WOOMF! Light blasts through the bridge. Morphing
            madness!

            Empty for a moment. Then, the HEART OF GOLD reforms. A
            few beats later, a SPERM WHALE floats into frame followed
            by a BOWL OF PETUNIAS.

        It coalesces back into shape out of chaos. The safety
        dome rises revealing our heroes standing in the exact
        same place they were - dazed.

                           ZAPHOD
                   Um...where are we?

                           TRILLIAN
                   Exactly where we were, I think.

                           ZAPHOD
                   And the missiles?

                           FORD
                   Have apparently turned into a bowl of
                   petunias and a very surprised looking
                   whale.

        He points to the screen. The whale and petunias float by.

                           EDDIE
                   At an improbability factor of eight
                   million, seven hundred and sixty-seven
                   thousand, one hundred and twenty-eight to
                   one against.

        They all look to Arthur who shrugs. Zaphod nods his
        approval. Ford counts on his fingers -- are they even?

        He waves it off, gives Arthur a little salute and moves
        on. Trillian looks to Arthur and musters a smile.

                          ARTHUR
                  I could really use a cup of tea.

88      EXT. SPACE - NIGHT                                          88

        The H.O.G. arches away. The whale in mid-air, stops
        rising, starts falling.

                          GUIDE VOICE
                  It is important to note that suddenly, and
                  against all probability, a sperm whale had
                  been called into existence several miles
                  above the surface of an alien planet. And
                  since this is not a naturally tenable
                  position for a whale, this innocent
                  creature had very little time to come to
                  terms with its identity as a whale before
                  it then had to come to terms with suddenly
                  not being a whale any more. This is what
                  it thought as it fell.

        The camera moves around the whale as it falls.

                     want to make any headway in what for the
                     sake of what I shall call an argument I
                     shall call the world, so let's call it my

                     strong now. And hey,what's this whistling
                     roaring sound going past what I'm suddenly
                     going to call my head? Perhaps I can call
                     that ... wind! Is that a good name? It'll
                     do. Perhaps I can give it a better name
                     later when I've found out what it's for!
                     It must be very important because there
                     certainly seems to be an awful lot of it.
                     Hey! What's this thing ... this ... let's call
                     it a tail - yeah! Tail!

        The whale thrashes its tail. Between the camera and the
        whale drops the bowl of petunias. It falls from sight.

                     achieve much but I'll probably find out
                     what it's for later on. How. Have I built
                     up a coherent picture of things yet?

89      EXT. HEART OF GOLD. MAGRATHEA SURFACE - DAY                   89

        The gang stand by A HUGE CRATER (the H.O.G. parked in the
        b.g.) -- a large whale carcass sits in the middle of it --
        along with a few petunias. They all grimace.

        BEYOND THE CRATER -- they see a formation of large rocks,
        aligned in a circle. It's the only structure in sight.

        They walk toward it.

90      EXT. ROCK FORMATION - DAY                                     90

        Arthur walks behind the others, his head down.

                             FORD (O.S.)
                     Hey...this looks familiar.

        Arthur looks up, registers surprise.

        THE ROCK FORMATION -- looks like Stonehenge - only newer.
        The rocks letters carved into them that read "DESIGN
        DEPARTMENT" "SHOWROOM" "EXECUTIVE OFFICES" "TOILETS"

                             FORD (CONT'D}
                     Must be portal doors.

                             ARTHUR
                     You mean -- the hippies were right?

        In the middle of the circle sits a stone receptionist
        desk with a sign on it that says "OUT TO LUNCH."

        Zaphod heads for the "To Design Department" stone.
        Trillian and Ford follow.

        Zaphod feels around it, looking for a switch, a knob,
        anything. He must've hit something because the front of
        the stone suddenly slides open revealing a SWIRLING
        VORTEX THAT LOOKS LIKE A JET ENGINE.

                              ZAPHOD
                     Okay.   In we go.

                             ARTHUR
                     What?! Are you out of what's left of your
                     mind? We can't step into that...that.

                             FORD
                     We gotta pick one, right? If it's not the
                     right one, we come back and pick another.
                     No biggie.

                             ARTHUR
                     Yes -- big biggie. What if that's the
                     last door we ever step through? What if
                     it rips us into tiny little atomic
                     particle...thingies.

        Trillian, who hasn't said a word since leaving Vogsphere,
        covers her ears - trying to block them out

                             ZAPHOD
                     It's the right one.   I have a hunch.

                               ARTHUR
                     Ford..?

                             FORD
                     He's got good hunches.   I say we go.

                             ARTHUR
                     Go with the hunch of a narcissist with
                     half a brain who's wearing a ridiculous
                     thinking cap!? Are you insane?!

                             ZAPHOD
                     Hey, I think I resent that.

                             ARTHUR
                     I don't care what you think you think...

        They all start arguing over each other. We focus on
        Trillian -- Anger and frustration building, she covers
        her ears -- then screams....

                             TRILLIAN
                     AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!

        And she takes off running for the door. Suicide? Bravery?

        They turn just in time to see her jump into the vortex.
        She YELPS as her body is bent in half, twisted like a
        rung mop, then sucked inside.

        Arthur is horrified, literally gasping for air.      Ford is
        semi-impressed. Zaphod, unfazed.

                             ZAPHOD
                     That's supposed to happen...I think.

        Ford shrugs, throws his towel around his neck like a
        scarf and dives through. Same thing. Bent, twisted...

                  Hey, wait for me!

        He runs after Ford, stops at the door, turns like he's
        about to board Air Force one, gives a salute, jumps in.

        Arthur finally gets his legs to move, steps up -- but
        hesitates at the threshold, paralyzed with fear, unable
        to take a step. Then -- FFSSSSH - the door seals shut.

                               ARTHUR
                  No.    No!     NOOO!!!

        He bangs on the stone, slides his hand around like Zaphod
        did, desperately looking for a way to open it. He
        collapses and buries his head in his hands.

                          MARVIN
                  I told you this would all end in tears.

                                                            CUT TO:

91      EXT. TEMPLE OF DEEP THOUGHT - MOMENTS LATER                   91

        Ford stands outside a stone doorway at the end of a
        cobblestone street. Zaphod's body falls to the ground
        next to him, untwists, unbends and snaps bolt upright
        beside them.

        Trillian is already heading down the street toward the
        Temple. Ford and Zaphod hurry to catch up to her.

92      EXT. ROCK FORMATION - DAY                                     92

        Arthur sits with his back against the stone, staring
        across the field at the beautiful double sunset. He looks
        over and sees THE TWO MICE FROM THE SHIP -- scurrying
        toward one of the giant stone doors. They slip through a
        crack beneath the stone. A FLASH OF LIGHT bursts through
        the crack. Arthur barely reacts, so drained of emotion.

                          ARTHUR
                  Life is full of paradoxes, isn't it?

                          MARVIN
                  Don't talk to me about life.

                          ARTHUR
                  Here I am, God knows how far from home...

                          MARVIN
                  Don't talk to me about God.

                          ARTHUR
                  ...and this is where I see the most
                  spectacular sunset I've ever laid eyes on.
                  We only had the one sun at home. Planet
                  called Earth.

                     I know. You keep going on about it.      It
                     sounds awful.

                             ARTHUR
                     Oh no, it's beautiful.    Or at least, it
                     was...

                             MARVIN
                     Did it have oceans?

                              ARTHUR
                     Yes.   Great wide rolling blue oceans.

                             MARVIN
                     Can't bear oceans.

        Arthur looks up at Marvin.

                             ARTHUR
                     So this is how it will all end, then? Me,
                     on a dead planet -- with a manically
                     depressed robot.

                             MARVIN
                     You think you've got problems? What are
                     you supposed to do if you are a manically
                     depressed robot? No, don't bother to
                     answer that, I'm fifty thousand times more
                     intelligent than you and even I don't know
                     the answer. It gives me a headache just
                     trying to think down to your level.

                             SLARTIBARTFAST    (0.S.)
                     Excuse me.

        Arthur spins to see AN OLD, BEARDED MAN IN LONG ROBES.

                             ARTHUR
                     Aah!

        He jumps, crab walks backwards away from the man.

                             ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                     Who are you?

                             SLARTIBARTFAST
                     My name is not important.

        Arthur continues to scramble away from the man.

                             SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D)
                     You must come with me. Terrible events are
                     afoot. You must come or you'll be late.

                             ARTHUR
                     Late? What for?

                             SLARTIBARTFAST
                     What is your name, Earthman?

                    Dent. Arthur Dent.

                              SLARTIBARTFAST
                    Late   as in "the late Dentarthurdent."
                    It's   a sort of threat you see. Never been
                    much   good at them myself, but I'm told
                    they   can be terribly effective.

        He motions to the stone that is marked "To Showroom."

                            SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D)
                    Your friends are safe. You can trust me.

                            ARTHUR
                    Trust a man who won't tell me his name?

                    My name? Very well...
                       (heaves a sigh, reluctant)
                    My name is...Slartibartfast.

        Arthur reacts with a furrowed brow.

                            SLARTIBARTFAST(CONT'D)
                    I said it wasn't important.

        Slartibartfast motions to the door.     He looks to Marvin.

                             MARVIN
                    I could calculate your chances of survival
                    -- but you won't like it.

        Arthur rises, cautiously moves over to Slarti's side.

                            SLARTIBARTFAST
                    I must warn you. We are about to pass
                    through, well, a sort of gateway thing. It
                    may disturb you. It scares the willies out
                    of me.

        He puts his hand on a certain spot in the stone and
        presses. The stone dissolves revealing once again the
        jet engine swirling vortex. Slarti motions -- after you.

        Arthur takes a deep breath -- and steps in.

                              ARTHUR
                    Whaa!

        He is bent, twisted and sucked away.     Slarti follows.

        Marvin stands for a moment, then looks up to...

        Arthur is hunched over a litter bin, barfing.

                           SLARTIBARTFAST
                   I told you you might find it a bit
                   disturbing.

                           ARTHUR
                   I have found this whole day a bit
                   disturbing.

        Arthur realizes he has his towel with him. He wipes his
        mouth with it, dabs his brow. Then he notices...

        ...THE ROOM -- which is like a car dealer's showroom only
        instead of cars there are models of various planets.

                           SLARTIBARTFAST
                   Did you know we built planets?

        No.   Arthur didn't know that.   He looks perplexed.

                           SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D)
                   Fascinating trade. Doing the coastlines
                   was always my favorite. Used to have
                   endless fun doing all the little fiddly
                   bits round fjords. But the Galactic
                   economy collapsed, and seeing that custom-
                   built planets are something of a luxury
                   commodity...
                        (getting back on subject)
                   At any rate, there's been a terrible mix
                   up with your planet. You must come with me

                     I don't think men have got much to do with
                     it.

        Arthur looks confused.     Slarti motions him to a door.

95      Arthur readies his towel at his mouth as Slarti hits a        95
        button. The door slides open and nothing happens. It's
        just a door that leads to a room where several TRANSPORT
        CARTS move past -- like a kids ride at Disneyland. They
        step into one. Slarti closes the little door. The cart
        MOVES through a curtain, out into DEEP SPACE.

        PULL BACK - till the cart is no more than a speck being
        pushed forward by the longest telescoping arm in history.

        The space is millions of miles across. Floating in it are
        half-finished planets, construction gantries around them.

                     Welcome to our factory floor.

        ON ARTHUR -- who is positively blown away.
                                                            CUT TO:

97      INT. TEMPLE OF DEEP THOUGHT -- CONTINUOUS                     97

        Ford, Zaphod and Trillian enter the dimly lit temple.
        They hear a faint, tinny sound. They follow it.

        FURTHER DOWN THE CORRIDOR...

        The sound gets louder. Tinny music. And laughter...
        Flickering light illuminates the end of the corridor.

                             ZAPHOD
                     This is it!

        He quickens his pace. Trillian and Ford follow.      They
        round the corner to find...

        DEEP THOUGHT -- sitting there majestically.     The TINNY
        MUSIC emanates from somewhere near him.

        Zaphod takes another step in and now sees the source of
        the TINNY MUSIC.

        Deep Thought is watching TV.     A violent, stupid cartoon.

                             ZAPHOD (CONT'D)
                     Deep Thought...!

                              DEEP THOUGHT
                     Shhh.   This is a good bit.

        The cartoon continues. Zaphod enters, removes his
        thinking cap and reverently approaches. He kneels...

                     Oh great Deep Thought...we have traveled
                     long...and far.
                     Have you calculated... the Ultimate
                     Question? Of Life, the Universe and
                     Everything?

                              DEEP THOUGHT
                     No.

                              ZAPHQD
                     No?

                             DEEP THOUGHT
                     I've been watching TV.

                              ZAPHOD
                     Oh...

        Zaphod holds a smile but his world is slowly crumbling.

                             DEEP THOUGHT
                     I designed another computer to perform
                     that great task.

                             ZAPHOD
                     Oh, right...I forgot.
                        (looking around)
                     Is it here?

                             DEEP THOUGHT
                     Not here. Another world.

                             ZAPHOD
                     It's on another world?

                             DEEP THOUGHT
                     It is another world. Or was.

                              ZAPHOD
                     Where?

                             DEEP THOUGHT
                     Ask your companion.

        Zaphod turns to Ford.     Ford looks confused.

                             DEEP THOUGHT (CONT'D)
                     Not him.

        Zaphod looks to Trillian. She looks equally confused.
        Zaphod puts the thinking cap back on. Strains hard.

                             ZAPHOD
                     0kay -- you're sure you don't have the

                     Or a way to you, you know -- access it or

                  Shhhhhh...

        Zaphod looks up.    Deep Thought is shushing him?

                          DEEP THOUGHT (CONT'D)
                  The show's back on.

        A robotic arm reaches out and turns up the volume.

        Zaphod stands, turns to Ford and Trillian, smiles that
        smile -- but it's starting to look a bit crazed.

                          ZAPHOD
                  Great. This is just great. Let's go find
                  something else for my entire life to be
                  about.

        He starts to march off.    Ford grabs his arm.

                          FORD
                  Zaphod. The gun? The one Humma sent us
                  for? We have to get it. You gave the guy
                  your head.

                            ZAPHOD
                  I know.    Why did I do that?

        He pulls his thinking cap down -- all the way over his
        eyes. Ford rolls his eyes, turns...

                          FORD
                  Um...Deep Thought? We we're told you have
                  a g...

        Before he finishes the sentence, a PANEL in the wall
        slides open revealing a LARGE, SCARY LOOKING GUN. A
        robotic arm pushes it forward.

        Ford goes over, takes it, carries it like it's
        nitroglycerin to Zaphod who's already walking away,

        CORRIDOR LEADING AWAY FROM DEEP THOUGHT

        Ford hands Zaphod the gun.

                             FORD (CONT'D)
                  Here.     Take it. I don't do guns.

        Zaphod takes it with a smile...

                          ZAPHOD
                  Thank you.

        ...and instantly points it at his head. Ford lunges for
        it. There's a struggle. Ford's trying to get Zaphod's
        finger off the trigger when CLICK! The trigger is
        pulled. Ford winces. But apparently, nothing has
        happened.

                            ZAPHOD (CONT'D)
                  Great!    This is a bust, too!

                  Hey, man, you must be really frustrated.
                  To go through all you did only to come
                  here and get no answer, which means no
                  fame and money, and you deserve that, man.
                  Because you're great -- you're just
                  really, really great.

        Zaphod isn't sure what just happened. But he smiles
        anyway. Trillian, however, is onto something.

                  The galaxy was a bit of a shambles, you

                  and interesting things like that. No one
                  doing the boring jobs.

                          ARTHUR

                  In spades. So a species was genetically
                  engineered to do the boring jobs. Tax
                  inspectors, traffic wardens, government
                  officials. We were commissioned to build
                  a special planet for them.
                  Problem was, some cleverdick made it so
                  any time one of the creatures had an
                  interesting idea it would get a hefty
                  smack around the face.

                  What? You did that? I've been there!

                   Of course you're edgy, your planet's been

         CLICK.   She shoots him again.

                   You actually wanted to know the Question
                   because you always thought there was more
                   to life, and now you're crushed because
                   you find out there really isn't.

         She's getting angrier and more hurt.     CLICK.

                              ZAPHOD (CONT'D)
                      You've got no home, no family, no one to
                      be with -- and you're stuck with me,
                      another in a long line of men who doesn't
                      appreciate you because he's too busy
                      appreciating himself.

         Hearing this puts a lump in her throat, causes her eyes
         to well with tears. She lowers the gun.

         Zaphod shakes his head -- the effect wearing off.       But he
         realizes what he said and doesn't like it.

                              ZAPHOD (CONT'D)
                      Give me that thing.

         He grabs the gun, points it at her.

                              TRILLIAN
                      Won't affect me.   I'm already a woman.

         Before he can react, A BRIGHT LIGHT SHINES BEHIND THEM.
         They turn, shielding their eyes.

                              ZAPHOD

101      EXT. DEEP SPACE (FACTORY FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS                     101

         The transport cart continues toward the 3rd planet.

                              SLARTIBARTFAST
                      Here we are, then. Look familiar?

         Arthur turns and looks. There before him is...

    O1a   EARTH -- Arthur is thunderstruck...then confused.           101a

                            ARTHUR
                    So -- it wasn't destroyed?

                            SLARTIBARTFAST
                    Actually, it was. This is a back-up.
                    Earth Mark II.

                            ARTHUR
                    So you're saying you ... made the Earth?

                            SLARTIBARTFAST
                    Well, not me alone. It was a group
                    effort. I did my part, though. Ever heard
                    of a place, I think it's called Norway?

101b      Arthur nods. The cart pushes through the clouds, towards    101b
          Ayers Rock. A GUY ON A LADDER is painting it it's
          familiar red color. Some of it is still primer grey.

                            SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D)
                    That was one of mine. Won an award you
                    know. Lovely crinkly edges. I was sorry
                    to hear about it being blown up. Shocking
                    cock up. The mice were furious.

                              ARTHUR
                    Mice?    Who cares about bloody mice?

                            SLARTIBARTFAST
                    Are you a fan of plate tectonics?

          Arthur looks up.   Slartibartfast points down.

101c      ANOTHER MAN pushes a button causing mountains to spring     101c
          up noisily.

                             SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D)
                    Voila!   Himalayas. Good, eh?

          Arthur is working very hard to process all this.

101d      JUMP CUT. They move through a forest where a man presses    101d
          a lever making several MUSHROOMS pop up on the ground.

                            SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D)
                    Earthman, you must realize that the planet
                    you lived on was commissioned, paid for,
                    and run by mice. It was destroyed shortly
                    before the completion of the purpose for
                    which it was built. Ten minutes later, we
                    would have been free and clear. But we
                    gave them our standard ten million year
                    warranty and they have come here to
                    retrieve this back-up copy. And they've
                    brought you with them.

          The transport cart flies out of forest toward the ocean.

                    They brought...I'm sorry, when you say
                    "mice" do you mean the little white furry
                    creatures with the cheese fixation?

                               SLARTIBARTFAST
                       These creatures you call "mice" are merely
                       the protrusion into our dimension of hyper-
                       intelligent pan-dimensional beings. The
                       whole business with the cheese must've
                       been a front. They were experimenting on
                       you, you see. A vast computer program...

                               ARTHUR
                       Ah. I see where you're confused.    You see
                       -- we were experimenting on them.

101e      Over the ocean, a "Perfect Storm" wave rolls toward them.      101e

                               SLARTIBARTFAST
                       Oh, I gather they arranged for you to
                       conduct some primitively staged
                       experiments so they could prod your
                       thinking here and there. But you were
                       actually elements in the computer program.
                       They really are very clever hyper-
                       intelligent pan-dimensional beings.
                          (looking down)
                       Ah. They've nearly finished the oceans.

101f      They move toward the white cliffs of Dover. A man stands       101f
          on a cliff holding a giant hose, water spewing from it.

                               ARTHUR
                       So -- you're trying to tell me that mice
                       designed and built Deep Thought...and Deep
                       Thought designed the Earth...which was a
                       giant supercomputer...that you built...to
                       calculate the Ultimate Question. Only,
                       Vogons destroyed it ten minutes before the
                       program was completed?

                               SLARTIBARTFAST
                       That's bureaucracy for you.

                               ARTHUR
                       Actually, this explains a lot. All my
                       life I've had this strange feeling that
                       something was going on in the world,
                       something big, something sinister ...

                               SLARTIBARTFAST
                       That's just perfectly normal paranoia.
                       Everyone in the universe has that.

102       EXT. EARTH II. ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE - CONTINUOUS                102

          A & S swoop down and soar over the English countryside --
          partially constructed; tall tree stocks with branch and
          leaves lying beside them, waiting to be attached. Men
          rolling out sod like a giant carpet, etc.

                              SLARTIBARTFAST
                      I don't know, perhaps I'm old and tired,
                      but I always think that the chances of
                      finding out what's really going on are so
                      absurdly remote that the only thing to do
                      is say hang the sense of it and keep
                      yourself busy. I'd much rather be happy
                      than right any day.

                              ARTHUR
                      And are you?

                              SLARTIBARTFAST
                      No. That's where it all falls down of
                      course.
                         (slowing the platform)
                      Here we are, then.

l03      The platform slows to a stop.      Arthur steps out and is     103
         stunned to see...

         HIS HOUSE. It's partially constructed. The chimney lies
         intact on the ground, waiting to be hoisted up. A row of
         hedges lies on it's side beside a trench. But it's his
         house alright.

                              ARTHUR
                      Is this...?

         Slartibartfast nods.      Arthur, in a daze, stumbles toward
         the house.

103a     INT. ARTHUR DENT'S HOUSE/MARK 2 - CONTINUOUS                   103a

         Arthur enters his house. There is no furniture, no
         photographs or books or any evidence of his existence
         there. He feels the walls, the countertops. He's home?

                                TRILLIAN (O.S.)
                      Arthur!

         Arthur pokes his head around a wall to find...

104      FORD, ZAPHOD AND TRILLIAN -- sitting at an elegantly set       104
         table -- stuffing their faces with a meal fit for a king.

                      What -- what are you doing? What happened
                      to you?

         They talk while continuing to stuff food in their mouths.

                              FORD
                      Funniest thing. (chew, chew) Our hosts
                      attacked us with Dismodulating Anti Phase
                      Stun Mist (chew, chew) then brought us to
                      this amazing meal as a way to make it up
                      to us (chew, chew). Try the mutton. It's
                      fantastic.

                       Zarking incredible.

          They can't seem to stop eating, like they've been
          drugged.

                               ARTHUR
                       Hosts attack you --? And then you sit
                       down for -- is that tea?

          Arthur has spotted a TEA POT on the table. He hurries to
          it, feels it. Warm. He pours a cup, takes a sip,
          Closes his eyes, enjoying it.

                               ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                       Now that's a cup of tea.

                               FRANKY MOUSE (O.S.)
                       We're glad you like it, Earth creature.

          He looks down and sees THE TWO WHITE MICE sitting on a
          silver platter.

                               BENJY MOUSE
                       After ten million years on Earth, and a
                       rather large chunk of that time in
                       England, it would be utterly humiliating
                       if we didn't know how to make a decent pot
                       of tea.

          Arthur stares in shock...can't speak.

                               TRILLIAN
                       Arthur, these are our hosts. Benjy mouse
                       and Franky mouse (chew, chew).
                       They control a large sector of the
                       Universe in our dimension (chew, chew).
                       I'm sorry, I thought you were told about
                       the mice...

                                ARTHUR
                       Yes. Yes, I was. I just wasn't quite
                       prepared for the full reality of it.

          He steadies himself on the table.

                               BENJY MOUSE
                       Sit, Earthman. Eat.

          Benjy pushes his hand through the air, the chair at the
          end slides backward.

                               ARTHUR
                       In a moment, perhaps.   I can't seem to let
                       go of this table.

          Slartibartfast steps forward.

                    That won't be necessary, Slartibartfast.

                    Right.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    It looks like we won't be needing the new
                    Earth after all, now that we've found the
                    only living native of the planet.

                            SLARTIBARTFAST

                            FRAHKY MOUSE
                    That will be all, Slartibartfast.

          Slarti, slightly hurt, backs away out of sight.

                            ARTHUR
                    I'm sorry, when you say "the only living
                    native" -- do you mean me? What about
                    her?

          Benjy holds up a strand of hairs, same color as Trillian's.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    We performed some rudimentary DNA tests on
                    the ship. She's half-native. Her real
                    father was a Blahardid, the hyper-
                    intelligent yet carelessly nomadic race
                    native to the planet Olbed, who apparently
                    popped in to Earth for a one-nighter with

                    Which explains a lot.

          She goes back to eating.    Arthur is taking this all in.

                            ARTHUR
                    So -- mostly harmless and me.    That's it.

                    here by any means necessary.

                    We've spent a considerable amount of time
                    on your planet trying to find this
                    wretched Ultimate Question, and the
                    thought of doing it all over again on
                    account of those idiotic Vogons sickens me
                    to no end. Which is why you're here.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    Sit, Earthling. Sit.

          Arthur goes to pull out the chair beside him.

                            BENJY/FRANKY
                    NOT THERE!

          Arthur jumps. The others look up.      Benjy and Franky
          cover their outburst with a smile.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    This chair is much more -- comfortable.

          Benjy makes a motion. The chair he pushed out before
          slides over behind Arthur's knees, making him sit.

                              BENJY MOUSE (CONT'D)
                    Drink.

          He slides the cup of tea over.     Arthur takes a sip.

                              ARTHUR
                    Mmmm.    This really is delicious.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    Good. Glad you like it.      Now -- to
                    business.

          Ford and Zaphod raise their glasses like drunken sailors.

                            FORD/ZAPHOD
                    To business!

          Benjy and Franky fire them a look.

                              ZAPHOD
                    Sorry.    Thought you were proposing a
                    toast.

                              BENJY/FRANKY
                    EAT!

          Ford and Zaphod eat. Benjy turns to Arthur. Smiles. No
          one notices, through the window, a row of Vogons cresting
          the hill.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    About this Ultimate Question. You see,
                    we've been offered a quite enormously fat
                    contract to do the 5D TV chat show and
                    lecture circuit, and quite frankly, we're
                    very much inclined to take it.

                            FRANKY MOUSE
                    But - and here's the point - we have to
                    have product. Which means we still need
                    an ultimate question.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    Or at least, one that sounds ultimate.

                               FRANKY HOUSE
                    Yes.     Got to sound good.

                            ARTHUR
                    An Ultimate Question that sounds good...
                    From a couple of mice...for a chat show.

                            FRANKY MOUSE
                    And as it turns out, the chances are
                    astronomically high that the structure of
                    the question is encoded in your brain.
                    Which is why we need it. More tea?

          Franky tries to pour more tea. Arthur stops drinking, a
          little woozy. Did he hear them right?

                            ARTHUR
                    I'm sorry -- did you just say you need my
                    brain?

                               BENJY MOUSE
                    Yes.     To extract the question.

                            ARTHUR
                    You can't have my brain. I'm using it.

                               FRANKY MOUSE
                    Barely.

                             BENJY MOUSE
                     We can replace it if you think it's
                     important. An electronic brain maybe.

                             FRANKY MOUSE
                     A simple one should suffice. Who would
                     know the difference?

                             ARTHUR
                     I would!

                             FRANKY MOUSE
                     No, you wouldn't. We could program you not
                     to.

          Arthur tries to get up. Clamps spring up from the chair
          and wrap around his arms. A dome flips over from the
          back and slams down on his head. Arthur struggles.

                               ARTHUR
                     Ford!    Zaphod!   TRILLIAN!!

          They're gorging on the food, half-lidded, out of it.

                            ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                    What are they-- what's in the food?!
                    WHAT WAS IN THAT TEA!?

          The platter the mice are standing on rises up, moves toward
          Arthur, ominous surgical instruments spring from it.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    Don't worry. You won't feel a thing.

          The mice on the platter move ominously toward Arthur.
          Arthur, still attached to the chair, backs away.

          Scythes and rotating arms with circular saw blades shoot
          out -- ominous surgical equipment to remove his brain.

                             ARTHUR
                    Wait a minute, JUST WAIT A SODDING
                    MINUTE!!

          The scythes and arms stop spinning. Arthur stumbles
          backwards and sits down in the chair. The others stop
          eating and listen.

                            ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                    You want the question that goes with the
                    answer "42" How about "What's six times
                    seven?" Or "How many Vogons does it take
                    to screw in a lightbulb?" Or here's one,
                    "How many roads must a man walk down?"

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    Hey, that's not bad.

          Through the opposite window (in much the same way
          bulldozers arrived in the opening) we see more Vogons
          arriving.

                            ARTHUR
                    Fine. Take it. There's plenty more where
                    that came from because my head is filled,
                    with questions, and I can assure you mate,
                    no answer to any of them has ever brought
                    me one iota of happiness. Confusion? Yes.
                    Indecision? Loads. But happiness...?

          He shakes his head.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    We don't want to be happy.   We want to be
                    rich.

                            FRANKY MOUSE
                    Take his brain.

          Benjy steers the platter toward Arthur. He jerks his
          arms up. They break free of the shackles and hit the
          platter. The mice fly through the air and land on the
          table -- right beside the POV gun. They scramble to
          their feet.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    Shoot him!!

          They try to lift the POV gun but it's way too heavy.

          Arthur, his butt still strapped in the chair, leaps over
          to the table and grabs the first thing he sees -- a leg
          of mutton. He raises it high. Benjy and Franky look up.

                            FRANKY MOUSE
                    Oh, shit.

          Arthur brings the mutton down, squashing them flat.

          The others instantly snap out of their food induced haze,
          Zaphod suddenly clutches his gut.

                            ZAPHOD
                    Ohhhh, I think I'm gonna be sick.

          Arthur looks up and now he sees the Vogons marching down
          the hill toward the house. He leans over the table,
          bumping his teacup. IT SHATTERS TO THE GROUND.

105       ON THE HILL JUST BEYOND --                                   105

          An ARMY OF VOGON POLICE march over it.    Amongst them...

          MARVIN -- marches as well, a gun held to his head.

                            MARVIN
                       (to the Vogon)
                    I must warn you, I'm feeling very
                    depressed.

                            KWALTZ
                    Mr. President!     We are here for your
                    protection!

          Zaphod appears at the front door and waves Presidentially.

                            ZAPHOD
                    Thank you!

106       The Police open fire. Zaphod and the others flee as the      106
          barrage of fire continues. Trillian drops the POV gun,
          goes back for it. Arthur stops her and pulls her behind
          the truck. Marvin catches a bullet in the back of his
          head - sparks fly and he is thrown forwards! Is he dead?

          BEHIND THE TRUCK --

          FORD looks at MARVIN lying face down in the dirt - his
          head emitting smoke.

                      Okay -- I'll create a distraction.

         He holds up his towel.

                               ARTHUR
                          (sarcastic)
                      Brilliant plan. I'm certain it will work.

                          (squinting at Arthur)

                      things that mean something other than what
                      you're actually saying.

         More gunfire erupts. Ford spins his towel until it's
         twisted and taught. He leaps up and runs towards...

107      ...THE VOGON POLICE FORCE -- who see him coming, his            107
         towel held like he's going to whip someone on the ass.

                              FORD (CONT'D)
                      AHHHHHHHH!!!!

         The Vogons are so caught off guard, they back away.

                              TRILLIAN
                      Now!

108      She and Arthur both run out toward the gun.                     108

                    ARTHUR                        TRILLIAN
         I thought I was...what are       I thought I was...I'll get
         you... get back... okay          it... you already... fine,
         fine...                          fine

         They each grab the gun just as Questular realizes...

         The Police stop their retreat, raise their guns, move
         forward. Ford skids to a stop and runs back toward
         Arthur and Trillian, both clinging to the gun, running
         back toward the truck. GUNFIRE ERUPTS. A and T TRIP.
         The POV gun goes flying and lands in... MARVIN'S ARMS.

         The Vogon Police run in formation toward the gang.       Ford
         looks back, sees the Vogons approaching. He looks

         MARVIN FIRES THE POV GUN,

         Questular ducks. CLICK. The entire Vogon Police force is
         hit. They instantly stop. Their shoulders slump.

         They turn their weapons on themselves and...

         ANGLE ON FORD, ZAPHOD, ARTHUR AND TRILLIAN -- turning
         their heads as we hear the weapons fire. They look up.

108a     All the Vogon Police lie motionless on the ground                108a
         including Kwaltz. Questular is the last man standing.

         He marches toward them, patches of clump baldness on his
         head. He drops to his knees.

                              QUESTULAR
                      Shoot me. Please Zaphod. Shoot me.

         Zaphod takes the gun, fires it at Questular.       He rises --
         and paints on a big smile.

                              QUESTULAR (CONT'D}
                      What am I so pissed off about? I'm great?
                      I'm zarking incredible! Everyone loves
                      me! WHOOO HOOO!!! Look at me...etc.

         Questular runs towards a lake/blow hole, takes off his
         clothes and jumps in.

                                ZAPHOD
                      Marvin.    You saved our lives.

                                MARVIN
                      I know.    Wretched, isn't it?

                              QUESTULAR
                      (distant) Oh man! I love being me!!

         They share a laugh.      Arthur approaches Slartibartfast.

                              ARTHUR
                      Thank you.

                                                           (CONTINUED)

    08a   CONTINUED:                                                   108a

                               SLARTIBARTFAST
                       I've just been informed by some of the
                       lads that since we're so near completion,
                       we're going to go ahead and finish Earth.
                       We can put it back exactly the way it was
                       when you left, you know -- unless there's
                       anything you'd like to change. Something
                       you think your planet could do without?

          Arthur thinks about it...looks around...slowly nods...

                                ARTHUR
                       Yes.   Me.

          He looks to Trillian who raises an eyebrow.    Really?
          She smiles.

                               TRILLIAN
                       Let's go somewhere.

                               ARTHUR
                       Yes, You name it. I'll go.

                               ZAPHOD
                       I'm going to Humma's. He has my head...I
                       think. Doesn't he? I'm so confused.

                               FORD
                       And I'm hungry. After we get your head
                       let's grab a bite. I know this great
                       restaurant at the end of the universe.

          As they walk away, we CUT TO...

109       SLARTI'S FACTORY ELEVATOR -- where they all board.           109

                               SLARTIBARTFAST
                       Okay. Hold tight.

          Everyone grabs the rail, except for Trillian who holds on
          to Arthur. SSSSSSHHHHHHHHHVUMP! Up into the sky they go.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
                       Stand-by for commencement of life cycle.
                       All systems checked and cleared.
                       Commencing.

          We hear KL-KLUNK. BZZZZZZZ... and watch nature burst
          into life - animals run - flowers bloom - waterfalls
          cascade - mountains rise in the mist - monkeys bathe in
          hot springs etc. Set to a wonderful, uplifting piece of
          music ("WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLD?").

          Tilt up to the sky. The day turns to night. Stars appear.
          The Heart of Gold streaks through the stars.

The Hollow Man

6/26/98

	FADE IN:
	On complete darkness.
	A SMALL DOOR swings open.
	A circle of light reveals that we I re looking down the 
	length of a tube. At the far end of the tube, we see a 
	gloved hand dangling a rat. The hand shoves the 
	frightened rat into the tube and closes the door behind 
	it. The rat s stark white fur bristles and it begins to 
	pad down the tube s length.
	After several feet, the tube opens up into a dimly lit 
	cubicle. The rat hesitates and stops.
	The SOUNDS of gentle BREATHING whispers in the rat s 
	ears.
	The rat turns round to head back down the tube, but a 
	door swings shut, trapping it in the cubicle.
	The rat cowers as the BREATHING turns to SNORTING.
	The rat s head jerks around, looking for signs of danger, 
	but the cubicle is empty. The rat sees a water dish on 
	the far side of the cubicle - a place to hide - and 
	dashes toward it.
	But an invisible force descends.
	The rat squeals in agony as something smashes down on its 
	body, crushing it.
	A LOUD BELLOW rings out, and the rat flies into the air, 
	halting a few feet off the ground. Its body writhes, 
	struggling against the unholy force.
	Then a sick crunch of tiny bones snapping. All life 
	quickly drains from the levitating body. Dead eyes...
	The creature s corpse floats in mid-air. Then the white 
	fur of the rat explodes in a shower of blood.
	HUGE BLOOD SMEARED INCISORS appear, as do the red-slicked 
	ape- like lips. The gaping bloody mouth bites again into 
	the rat.
									
	CUT TO:
	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
	In the background we hear Jay Leno s monologue from the 
	Tonight Show. A small lamp and the glow from a computer 
	screen illuminates SEBASTIAN CAINE, late twenties with 
	the shabby good looks of a perpetual grad-student. Wiry 
	framed and wearing only boxer shorts, Sebastian sips 
	coffee from an  Einstein  coffee mug. He peers at a 
	complex computer rendered molecule displayed on his 
	screen. He pecks a few keys and the molecule shifts 
	slightly, then falls apart.
	Sebastian pulls a twinkie from a hostess box, unwraps the 
	cellophane and sucks it down. He attacks the keyboard 
	with renewed vigor.
	Another molecule appears on the screen. Sebastian s 
	fingers fly across the keyboard. The molecule blinks on 
	and off, it trembles and twists apart.
				SEBASTIAN
			Damnit.
	Sebastian pears out his window. Across the courtyard, a 
	light comes on in a neighboring window. He sees a 
	BRUNETTE, mid-twenties, absolutely stunning, enter her 
	living room. The Brunette thumbs through the mail, tosses 
	it and then begins to undress. Sebastian loans over to 
	the window, getting interested. But when the brunette 
	reaches her bra and panties, she crosses to the window 
	and lowers her shades.
				SEBASTIAN (cont d)
			Damnit.
	Sebastian leans back in his chair and closes his eyes. 
	He s obviously tired. He opens his eyes and stares up at 
	the ceiling. Painted across the white matte finish in big 
	red letters is a brief reminder -  You Should Be 
	Working.  Sebastian sighs, leans forward and begins 
	pecking away again.
										 
LATER:
	The television is now only static. We pan by his alarm 
	clock. 4 am. We find Sebastian pacing in front of his 
	computer.
	He gets an idea... slides back in his chair. Types away 
	again. The molecule reforms on the computer screen.
	He types a few more keys, waits, watches the molecule. 
	Nothing happens.
	He hits a few more keys and watches intently for a 
	reaction.
				SEBASTIAN
				 (beat)
			I am a goddamn genius.
	He hits a few more keys and a telephone keypad appears on 
	the screen. He dials.
									
	CUT TO:
	INT. ANOTHER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	Digital phone rings.
	In the bed, LINDA FOSTER, late twenties, stirs from a 
	deep sleep. As she straggles out of bed and over to her 
	desk, we notice a young man sleeping next to her.
	The ringing continues. She moves her computer mouse 
	around and her screen comes to life. She click on a 
	telephone icon and the ringing stops. A beat later, 
	Sebastian appears in a window on her screen.
				LINDA
			Sebastian, do you know what time it 
			is?
				SEBASTIAN (SCREEN)
			You know Da Vinci never slept. Said it 
			was waste of time.
				LINDA
			What is it this time?
	INTERCUT: SEBASTIAN S BEDROOM
	Sebastian peers at the image of Linda in the computer 
	window. He notices something behind her in the bed, the 
	young man sleeping face down.
				SEBASTIAN
			Who s that?
	Linda pulls the camera off the top of the of the computer 
	screen and positions it so Sebastian can t see the bed.
				LINDA
			Not your business. Not anymore.
				SEBASTIAN
			Touche.
				LINDA
			So you calling about anything in 
			particular, or were you just hoping to 
			catch me sleeping in the nude?
				SEBASTIAN
			I cracked the reversion.
	Upon hearing this, Linda receives a jolt of adrenaline.
				LINDA
			You cracked it?
				SEBASTIAN
			Look at this. 
	Sebastian hits a couple of keys. A moment later the 
	molecular structure appears on Linda s computer.
				SEBASTIAN
			Watch this.
				LINDA
			You sure?
				SEBASTIAN
			91% sure.
				LINDA
				 (astonished)
			Eleven months with no progress and you 
			suddenly come up with it out of the 
			blue? How?
				SEBASTIAN
			The usual. Coffee and twinkies.
				LINDA
			I hate you.
				SEBASTIAN
			I know. You think you could hunt down 
			Matt and get to the lab early. I want 
			Isabelle prepped for a live test.
				LINDA
			Yeah, I think I can find him. What are 
			you going to do?
				SEBASTIAN
			Well y know. It s daylight in 
			Switzerland. I gotta call the Nobel
			Committee and tell them to get our
			prizes ready. See you in a few.
	ON LINDA S COMPUTER SCREEN as Sebastian clicks off. Linda 
	crosses to her bed, and shakes the guy awake.
				LINDA
			Hey... come on.
	DR. MATTHEW KENSINGTON, late 20s too, stirs from under 
	sheets.
				MATT
				 (groggy)
			What?
				LINDA
			Sebastian just called. We gotta get to 
			the lab.
	Matt bolts up.
				MATT
			Shit! You didn t tell him I was here, 
			did you?
				LINDA
			Give me some credit, will ya.
				MATT
			So what s the rush?
				LINDA
			He cracked reversion.
	Matt pulls his jeans on.
				MATT
			Wanna ride down?
				LINDA
			We better take our own cars.
				MATT
			You re gonna have to tell him about us 
			eventually.
				LINDA
			I know. It s just You re his best 
			friend. He ll feel betrayed.
	EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. SKYLINE - DAY
	From a distance, the Nation s Monuments stand awash in 
	the harsh light of morning.
	CAMERA finds a BLACK PORSCHE as it pulls to the security 
	fence of a warehouse. The imposing structure is 
	surrounded by a chainlink fence and barbed wire.
	The Porsche is waved through security and heads straight 
	into the warehouse.
	INT. WAREHOUSE -DAY
	The Porsche pulls to a halt in a reserved parking space 
	and Sebastian exits, wearing a Hawaiian shirt, shorts, 
	and Birkenstocks. He notes the other cars parked in the 
	lot, then crosses to bunker in the center of the 
	warehouse, guarded by a MARINE, shouldering an M-16.
				MARINE GUARD
			Morning, sir.
				SEBASTIAN
			Morning, Ed.
				MARINE GUARD
			Your team s in early. Something 
			special going on?
				SEBASTIAN
			Sorry, Ed. You know the rules. 
	Sebastian presses his thumb against a glass screen. A 
	laser reads his print. 
	Scan readout: CAINE, SEBASTIAN 
	Clearance:    ALPHA ALPHA THREE 
	Division:	CLASSIFIED 
	The doors whisk open and Sebastian steps inside.
				MARINE GUARD
			Have a good day, sir.
	INT. ELEVATOR - DAY
	Inside the elevator is a numberless keypad. Sebastian 
	taps in his floor code.
				ELEVATOR (V.0.)
			Authorization please.
				SEBASTIAN
			Caine zero zero two seven.
				ELEVATOR (V.0.)
			Authorization verified. Good morning, 
			Dr. Caine. 
	The elevator descends with a groaning hum. It passes 
	below us and keeps descending into the belly of the 
	earth, the shaft goes down forever.
	INT. HABITAT S CORRIDOR
	We slowly push down a hallway panelled by Plexiglas 
	chambers. Each chamber looks as if it s tailored for a 
	specific animal, although no animals are visible.
	As we pass one habitat, something slams into the 
	Plexiglas and begins barking. Another HOWL joins in. Then 
	SCREECHING. Suddenly the hallway fills with a dozen 
	animal cries. THUMP.
	THUMP.
	The Plexiglas on several chambers vibrates as if angry 
	animals were slamming against it. But still, no animals 
	are seen.
	Above each chamber, VIDEO SCREENS display THERMAL IMAGES 
	revealing heat signatures of the various animals, but 
	they remain invisible to the naked eye. MATT taps on a 
	sheet of Plexiglas which seals off another seemingly 
	empty cage.
				MATT
			Isabelle ...
	The woodchips on the floor shift and suddenly the 
	Plexiglas steams up right in front of Matt s face. The 
	Plexiglas begins to shake violently.
				MATT (cont d)
			Calm down baby. Calm down. It s 
			okay...
	Matt takes a pair of thermal goggles from his belt and 
	pulls them down over his eyes. 
	THERMAL POV - A rather large heat signature, ape-like in 
	shape, rattles about the cage. Matt slowly unlatches the 
	Plexiglas door and reaches inside.
				MATT (cont d)
			It s okay, baby. It s okay. I m not 
			going to hurt you. Come here.
	THERMAL POV - he reaches out to the creature. He grabs 
	hold of it, firmly. Stroking it. The creature COOS. Matt 
	reaches for a hypo and brings it up to the creature.
				MATT (cont d)
			Just hold still. 
	Something clamps down on his hand, breaking his skin. 
	Blood erupts in a bite pattern.
				MATT (cont d)
			 Ow, shit.
	Matt drops the hypo and falls back. The cage door flies 
	open and something runs out. Matt pulls himself up to see 
	the heat signature running down the hallway. He turns 
	around to see another heat signature coming at him. Matt 
	pulls off his goggles to see Linda coming up the 
	Corridor.
				LINDA
			You okay?
				MATT
			She bit me.
				LINDA
			Yeah. She s become a lot more 
			aggressive in the last few days.
	Linda takes the goggles from Matt.
				LINDA (cont d)
			Go take care of that bite. I ll get 
			her.
				MATT
			And give you a chance to pull ahead? 
			Never.
	Linda opens a lock-box at the end of the hallway and 
	pulls out a two tranquilizer guns. She hands one to Matt.
	AROUND THE CORNER
	A slight distortion shimmers as something runs past us. 
	We hear HOOTS and FOOTSTEPS.
	Looking down the shadowy corridor, we hear grunting and a 
	haunting heavy breathing. The control door is closed 
	though and something large and angry is throwing itself 
	against it. We can t see anything.
	A few moments later, Linda and Matt round the corner, 
	wearing goggles and leveling their pistols.
				MATT
				 (ala Porky)
			Shh. Be vewy, vewy quiet. I m hunting 
			simians.   heheheheh.
				LINDA
			Knock it off.
				 (soothing voice)
			Isabelle!
	THERMAL POV - Dark hallway. Movement. A red shimmering 
	heat signature. It comes running at Linda. HOWLING. Linda 
	fires. A T-DART flies. Thwack... It stops in mid-air. 
	Then falls. But it doesn t hit the floor. Instead, it 
	stops inches above the ground. 
	THERMAL POV - the heat signature lies in a heap at 
	Linda s feet.
				MATT
			Good shootin , Tex.
				LINDA
			What s that make it?
				MATT
			I m still ahead. 6 to 5.
	Like a smug gunfighter, Linda blows imaginary smoke from 
	the top of her tranquilizer gun.
				LINDA
			But I m catching up.
	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
	The elevator doors open and Sebastian steps out. He s met 
	by SARAH KENNEDY, early thirties, a fiery red-head.
				SARAH
			Can I have a word?
				SEBASTIAN
			Most normal people say good morning.
				SARAH
			Don t you think you should test the 
			protocol on the liver samples before 
			you inject Isabelle?
				SEBASTIAN
			How many tissue samples have we 
			successfully regressed? Hundreds, 
			right? How many have gone on to work 
			on the full system? None.
				SARAH
			That s beside the point.
				SEBASTIAN
			No, that is the point. I m not going 
			to waste six months of my life on an 
			outmoded testing procedure. This thing 
			works. I know it. I feel it.
	Linda comes down the corridor, listening in on the tail 
	end of the conversation.
				SARAH
			Fine. You can mop up afterward.
				SEBASTIAN
			You think I m going to kill Isabelle?
				SARAH
			Kill? More like liquefy.
				SEBASTIAN
			Sarah, thank you for your opinion, but 
			I m the project leader. Understand? 
	She says ...
				SARAH
			Yes, Sir.
	... but somehow it feels like  Fuck you.  She storms off. 
	Sebastian turns to Linda.
				SEBASTIAN
			How did you ever convince me to hire 
			her?
				LINDA
			You said you wanted the beat vet in 
			the country.
				SEBASTIAN
			Yeah, well she cares more about the 
			animals than the research.
				LINDA
			Maybe that s why she s so good.
									
	CUT TO:
	CLOSE ON: MATT as he shuts off the spinning cyclotron. As 
	it s spinning slows to a halt, he pops the top and 
	reaches in, removing...
	A GLOWING VIAL OF ORANGE LIQUID.
	Sebastian peers at the vial.
				SEBASTIAN
			Who da Man? You da Man.
				MATT
			As we pull out we see we are.
	INT. LABORATORY - DAY
	Almost feels like a dungeon. Think high-tech 
	Frankenstein. Walls lined with video displays, technical 
	readouts, bizarre medical equipment.
	On a table in the middle of the room, a sheet drapes over 
	a humanoid form, strapped down at it s invisible limbs. 
	The straps move slightly... ghostly. Wires lead from the 
	body to lots of machinery.
				MATT
			Protocol is hot.
				SEBASTIAN
			Vitals?
	Sarah, checks over the various readouts ... heartbeat, 
	blood pressure, the rest.
				SARAH
			Normal.
	CARTER ABBEY, the late thirties lab assistant, wheels in 
	a cart of equipment. Linda taken a seat by the table and 
	pushes aside the sheet.
				BOOMING VOICE
			THIS IS GOD. YOU ARE DISTURBING THE
			NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS AND WILL BE
			SEVERELY PUNISHED FOR ALL ETERNITY.
			GOD HAS SPOKEN.
				SEBASTIAN
			How many times do I have to tell you, 
			Frank you aren t God.
				 (beat)
			I am.
				FRANK (LOUDSPEAKER)
			Sorry, Boss. Forgot.
	Sebastian glance up at a glass booth overlooking the 
	Laboratory floor. TWO PEOPLE in the booth.
				SEBASTIAN
			You guys ready to roll?
	INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH
	FRANK CHASE, early thirties, and tech expert JANICE 
	WALTON, early twenties, man a small booth above the lab. 
	They re dressed more like band roadies than scientists.
	The room is crammed with electronic and recording 
	equipment. A handful of monitors display different images 
	of the lab. Thermal and regular video. Another screen 
	monitors vital signs.
				FRANK
			We are live and in color. On your 
			mark.
	Frank and Janice looks down on their colleagues. 
	Sebastian nods their way.
				SEBASTIAN
			Okay. Roll  em.
				JANICE
			Okay. We are rolling record on videos 
			one through twelve.
	Frank hits a series of buttons and speaks into a 
	microphone. Recording.
	INT. LABORATORY - DAY
	Frank s voice echoes through the chamber.
				FRANK (V.O.)
			Subject Isabelle Two. Currently in 
			phase shift... one hundred twenty six 
			days, eighteen hours.
				LINDA
			Testing De-Phase protocol. Injecting 
			serial protein Caine One Two Five. 
	Linda removes a glowing vial of orange liquid from a 
	centrifuge nearby.
				MATT
			Maybe if you stopped naming them after 
			yourself, you d have better luck.
				SEBASTIAN
			Why thank you, Dr. Kensington, for 
			that keen scientific observation. I ll 
			be sure to include it in my memoirs.
				MATT
			A whole mention? And I thought I was 
			just gonna be a footnote.
	Matt unwraps a hypodermic needle and jabs the needle into 
	the vial, drawing up the colored liquid.
	INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH
				MATT
			Okay.
	Frank and Janice monitor Isabelle s vitals.
	INT. LABORATORY - DAY
	Tension in the air.
				SEBASTIAN
				 (to Linda)
			Ready.
	She wraps a bungee cord around nothing and pulls it 
	tight. She then takes some dye and sprays it. A surface 
	appears, floating beneath the restraints. It sheens in 
	the light as Linda searches for a vein. She slaps the 
	surface several times. A small bulge appears, like a 
	vein.
				LINDA
			Propped.
				MATT
			Let s make some history.
	Matt lowers the hypo to the vein. But Sebastian takes the 
	hypo from Matt s hand.
				SEBASTIAN
			Nice try, Sparky.
	Matt relinquishes the needle.
				LINDA
			Come on, Isabelle. You can do this. 
	Sebastian lowers the hypo. The skin bonds and gives. The 
	needle remains in sight after it slips through the 
	visible surface. Matt presses down on the hypo plunger, 
	releasing a dye into his bloodstream. The gold liquid 
	twists into a long snaking tube up and down the limb. 
	It s the shape of a vein. The liquid begins to react. 
	Small flashes of light blip up and down the strand of 
	color. Ba-bump.. ba-bump... the heartbeat starts to speed 
	up.
				SARAH
			Elevated heartbeat.
	INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH
	Janice analyzes the screens.
				JANICE
			We re still in the green.
				FRANK
			Confirmed. Vitals still in the normal 
			range.
	INT. LABORATORY
	The glowing liquid turns from gold to red as the complex 
	webbing of a bloodstream appears.
				MATT
			It s reacting.
	Spreading out from the bloodstream, soon becomes 
	visible.. the shadow of a skeletal system.
				SEBASTIAN
			Do you see this?
				LINDA
			It s working. It s actually working. 
	Matt pulls the sheet back. Muscles are beginning to 
	appear. And eyeballs. Frightened eyeballs.
				SARAH
			Heart rate s up. She s scared.
	Sarah soothes her.
				SARAH (cont d)
			It's okay, baby. It's okay.
				SEBASTIAN
			Subject began manifesting almost 
			Immediately. Protocol is reacting 
			quickly.
	Isabelle starts to struggle against her restraints. She 
	begins to howl.
				LINDA
			Subject may be in pain or extreme 
			discomfort.
				SARAH
			Goddamnit. Blood pressure elevating. 
			Brain activity going through the roof. 
	The brain appears, seemingly growing from the inside out. 
	The shape of a large half-formed monkey grows from the 
	inside out. A SKULL APPEARS howling in pain, in horror.
				SARAH (cont d)
			We ve got a problem.
				SEBASTIAN
			What? What problem!
	Sarah checks her monitors.
				SARAH
			It s her heart. We can see the heart 
			beating in the ape s
				FRANK (V.0.)
			I got an erratic heart beat.
				SARAH
			She s going into cardiac arrest.
				LINDA
			Got the crash cart.
	Carter charges the crash cart and rolls it in.
				SARAH
			We re losing her.
	Her machine flatlines.
				SEBASTIAN
			No! It s got to work.
	The body is only half there. It looks as if its caught in 
	decomposition. Linda rubs the cardiac paddles together.
				LINDA
			Clear!
	Linda slams the paddles on the monkey s chest. The jolt 
	of electricity makes the monkey visible again for a brief 
	moment. Then the skin and flesh fade away again.
				SARAH
			We ve got something!
	The heartbeat starts up again. The body continues its 
	march toward,visibility.
				SARAH (cont d)
			Still. erratic.
				LINDA
			Come on Isabelle. Come on. You can do 
			it. You can fucking do it.
	Everybody s pulling for her.
				SARAH
			Come on, monkey.
				MATT
			Do it. Do it. Come on.
	Muscles spread like a rash on bone as the monkey twists 
	and turns, frightened. Then skin. The monkey howls. Skin 
	forms over the muscles reappearing like it was being 
	painted on before our eyes.
				SARAH
			Stabilizing.
	The entire form glows, then blinks, then glows again, as 
	if it was discharging some stored energy.
				FRANK (V.0.)
			Brain activity returning to normal.
	The monkey grunts and groans. Blinks its eyes. Linda 
	hovers over it stroking its fur.
				LINDA
			Welcome back, Isabelle.
	Sebastian puts his hand on Linda s shoulder... a move 
	that does not go unnoticed by Matt. We did it.
				SEBASTIAN
				 (beat)
			How is she?
				SARAH
				 (surprised)
			I think she s gonna be okay
								
	DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. HABITAT

	Frank, Matt, Sarah, Janice and Linda watch Isabelle rise 
	and walk about the cage. She goes over to the other 
	monkeys and joins in their grooming rituals.

				CARTER
			Amazing. She's normal, absolutely 
			healthy. If you didn't know any 
			better, you'd think nothing had 
			happened to her.

				MATT
				 (ribbing Sarah)
			Yeah. I can't wait to slice up her 
			brain and trace her neural pathways.

				SARAH
			Screw you, Matt.

				MATT
			Well maybe not right away.

				LINDA
			We should celebrate.

	INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	The fanciest one in D.C.

	The entire eight person team sits around a round table, 
	drunk and laughing, as the last champagne flute is 
	filled.

	Sebastian raises his glass.

				SEBASTIAN
			To the finest research team I've ever 
			known.

	A round of "Hear, hears" and they all clink glasses and 
	drink.

	EXT. RESTAURANT BALCONY - LATER

	The din of the diners fades away as Linda slips out onto 
	the restaurant's balcony. She find Sebastian leaning 
	against a railing, breathing in the night air.

				SEBASTIAN
			Hey...

				LINDA
			I thought you'd gone.

				SEBASTIAN
			Where would I go?

	He looks out over the sweep of the city, the twinkling 
	lights of D.C. and darkness of the Potomac river.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			Twenty years ago there were no 
			computers, no fax machines, no cell 
			phones. I was just wondering what the 
			world will be like twenty years from 
			now... if what we're doing will change 
			everything.

				LINDA
			A little "I am become death... the 
			shatterer of worlds"?

				SEBASTIAN
			Something like that.

				LINDA
			Since the day I met, all you wanted to 
			do was change the world.

	She puts her hand on his shoulder.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Listen, I know we've... I mean... well 
			... I just want you to know how proud 
			I am of you. I know it probably 
			doesn't mean a lot...

				SEBASTIAN
			Actually it does.
				 (beat)
			I guess since you were there from the 
			beginning, you know me better than 
			anyone else on this godforsaken 
			planet.

				LINDA
			You're positively maudlin. You should 
			be happy. Do you have any idea what 
			you've accomplished?

				SEBASTIAN
			Yeah... but I was working so hard, I 
			didn't realize I'd have no one to 
			share it with.

	Sebastian heads back inside. But he stops and turns back.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			I don't suppose we could turn back the 
			clock for a night and you could come 
			home with me?

	Her look says it all. Too much water under the bridge.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			Right. Sorry. Too much champagne.

	He turns and heads back into the party. As he heads in he 
	passes Matt heading out. He and Sebastian exchange 
	"Heys".

				MATT
			What was that about?

				LINDA
			Nothing. It's just... He is who he is. 
			Sometimes I just have to be reminded.

									
	CUT TO:

	INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

	Sebastian wanders through the empty hallways of the 
	laboratory.

	INT. HALLWAY OF HABITATS - NIGHT

	Sebastian paces back and forth, examining the habitats. 
	He taps on the Plexiglas of one. The cubicle explodes 
	with

	BARKING.

	We see the Plexi steam up in one part, as if something 
	was breathing on it. As if a nose were pressed against 
	it.

				SEBASTIAN
				 (a little drunk)
			What's it like? Talk goddamnit! Tell 
			me what it's like!

								
	DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. PENTAGON - DAY

	Flying over Washington D. C. , we cross the Potomac and 
	circle the five-cornered building, looking particularly 
	gloomy on this grey day.

				SEBASTIAN (V.0.)
			Six years ago, this committee 
			commissioned me with a very specific 
			task...

	INT. PENTAGON CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

	At the table are six men. A handful of senior military 
	brass and top civilian advisors direct their attention to 
	the front of the room, where Sebastian, flanked by Matt 
	and Linda, is in the middle of his presentation.

				SEBASTIAN
			To successful phase-shift a human 
			being out of quantum sync with the 
			visible universe and then return him 
			safely, with no after affects.

	Next to Sebastian a video shows a small monkey shifting 
	from the visible spectrum. It's hair, skin, organs and 
	skeletons slowly dissolve before our eyes.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			Well, we found out sending them to 
			"never-never-land" was easy, it's the 
			getting back that's hard.

	Sebastian fast forwards a few moments until the video 
	screen shows the bizarrely tangled heap of flesh and bone 
	that used to be alive.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			Every time we've tried to bring a test 
			subject back from phase-shift. 
			Cellular bonds would dissolve, the 
			primary DNA strands would decay. But 
			now...

	Sebastian pauses. Something's bothering him.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			But now...

	One of the senior advisers, DR. HARRY KRAMER, 
	distinguished 50s, finally breaks the silence.

				KRAMER
			But now?

	Linda and Matt look up at Sebastian expectantly.

				SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
			But now...
				 (pause)
			But now, we feel we are closer than 
			ever to resolving this issue. We've 
			been experimenting with a new 
			regression formula that looks rather 
			promising.
			A FOUR STAR GENERAL leans forward.

				GENERAL
			How long?

				SEBASTIAN
			Sir?

				GENERAL
			Son, as you can imagine, we are very 
			anxious to field test this tactical 
			asset. How long till you resolve this 
			issue?

	Linda starts to speak, but Sebastian cuts her off with a 
	look.

				SEBASTIAN
			Shouldn't be more than another year, 
			Sir.

	Frustrated sighs all around the room.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			Maybe sooner.

	EXT. PENTAGON - DAY

	As Linda, Matt and Sebastian head to their cars.

				MATT
			Yo. Reality check! What the hell was 
			that about?

				SEBASTIAN
			Keep your voice down.

				MATT
			The protocol works. Why'd you tell 
			them it didn't?

				SEBASTIAN
			I wasn't ready for them to know.

				MATT
			But they're the oversight committee. 
			They're supposed to know.

				LINDA
			I'm sure he had a reason.
				 (firmly)
			You did have a reason, didn't you, 
			Sebastian?

				SEBASTIAN
			I had more than a reason. I had a 
			goddamn epiphany.

	They reach his Porsche.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			What do you think they'd do if they 
			know we could send a subject into 
			phase shift and pull it back out 
			again? How many seconds would it take 
			for them to take over the whole 
			project, bringing in their soldiers to 
			test the formula on. We'd have lost 
			control of it by the end of the week.

				LINDA
			It's their money, Sebastian. It's 
			going to happen eventually.

				SEBASTIAN
			I know. But not yet. There's too much 
			for us to learn. I don't want my hands 
			tied by their political agenda when we 
			go to phase three.

				MATT
			Well, then... mind telling us how 
			you're gonna get a human test-subject 
			for phase three without the committee 
			finding out?

				SEBASTIAN
			That's easy. I've decided to test the 
			procedure ...

	INT. LABORATORY CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

				SEBASTIAN
			... on myself.

	The team sits around the conference table. Their jaws 
	drop and they stare at him with wide eyes.

				FRANK
			Are you nuts?

				SEBASTIAN
			Was Jonas Salk nuts?

				FRANK
			Yeah. Pretty sure he was.

				CARTER
			And remember, for every Jonas Salk, 
			there are a bunch of guys who aren't 
			famous cuz they died.

				SEBASTIAN
			If we're that unsure, how can we 
			morally justify testing it on someone 
			else?

				JANICE
			Isn't it a little soon to be moving 
			into phase three anyway?

				SARAH
			She's right. We haven't even finished 
			collating the phase two research.

				SEBASTIAN
			We'll have plenty of time to collate 
			and cross-reference later. Monkey data 
			doesn't matter anyway. The only real 
			data is human data.

				SARAH
			You don't even know if any of the 
			protocols will work on humans.

				SEBASTIAN
			How are we gonna find out? Besides, 
			we've succeeded with a gorilla and 
			their DNA is 98% the same as humans. 
			And the 2% is not that significant.

				LINDA
			Sebastian ... humans can talk, build 
			houses and cook in microwave ovens. 
			Gorilla's live in trees. That's a 
			helluva 2% if you ask me.

				SEBASTIAN
			We're all concerned. I know that. But 
			if we're gonna move forward ever, this 
			is something we have to do.

				LINDA
			Why you? Why not one of us?

				SEBASTIAN
			The risks. I couldn't ask...

				MATT
				 (interrupting)
			What if we volunteer?

				LINDA
			What if you're too valuable to lose?

				SEBASTIAN
			I'm Project Leader. It's my formula 
			and my call. The best way to express 
			your concern is to make damn sure you 
			do your best work. I'll want about 
			four weeks to...

				FRANK
			To put your affairs in order?

				SEBASTIAN
			To run some more reversions and tissue 
			tests and then we'll attempt the phase 
			shift. I'll stay shifted for three 
			days of testing and then we'll perform 
			a quantum regression.

	INT. SEBASTIAN'S OFFICE

	A knock on the door.

				SEBASTIAN
			Come in.

	Linda pushes into the room and closes the door behind 
	her.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			What?

				LINDA
			In the past six years, I've never once 
			challenged your decisions, but this 
			... Sebastian. I don't think you 
			should do this.

				SEBASTIAN
			You don't understand.

				LINDA
			Oh please. How long were we together? 
			You must've said it a million times 
			... Nobody knows who built the lunar 
			lander. All they remember in the first 
			man on the moon.

	Sebastian shrugs and nods.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			But what if something happens to 
			you... what about the project? 

	Sebastian smiles.

				SEBASTIAN
			Lin, trust me... nothing's going to 
			happen.

	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Linda and Matt are in bed together. Matt kisses her way 
	up and down her arm. But Linda is distracted.

				LINDA
			He refuses to listen to reason.

				MATT
			Can we talk about this later? I'm 
			trying to make love to you.

				LINDA
			Sorry. I just can't let it go.

	Matt props himself up on the pillow.

				MATT
			I know how you're feeling. Hell, he 
			and I've been friends since freshman 
			year.

				LINDA
			So how can we let him do this?

				MATT
			What if you were given the opportunity 
			to be the first person on ,Mars, would 
			you go?

				LINDA
			In a heartbeat.

				MATT
			What if they didn't know whether or 
			not they could get you home?

	Linda thinks about it. It's still tempting.

				MATT (cont'd)
			This is his chance to be Chuck Yeager 
			or Christopher Columbus. Well, if I 
			were him I'd do the same thing.

	Matt goes back to kissing Linda.

				LINDA
			Let me ask another question.

				MATT
			Is about who gets to be on top?

				LINDA
			Is the human race really ready for 
			what we're doing?

	Matt groans and rolls over.

				MATT
			Why do you always get philosophical 
			before we're about to get physical?

				LINDA
			No really. Is it ready? We're 
			barrelling down a road that begs moral 
			and ethical questions that I don't 
			think we can answer.

				MATT
			They said the same thing about the 
			bomb. They said we'd never survive the 
			nuclear age... but here we are.

				LINDA
			This night is still young.
				 (beat)
			I mean, when you think about it, it's 
			creepy. Do we really want to live in a 
			world where people can just disappear 
			in the blink of an eye?

				MATT
			We made our deal with the devil years 
			ago. Might as well stick around to 
			cash in.

	INT. MEDICAL EXAMINING ROOM - DAY

	Sebastian stripped to his shorts paces nervously. A knock 
	on the door.

				SEBASTIAN
				 (his voice catches)
			Yes?

	Matt sticks his head in.

				MATT
			We're ready.

	Sebastian nervously shakes his limbs out. Then nods.

				SEBASTIAN
			Okay.

				MATT
			It's not too late to back out. I'm 
			happy to take your place.

				SEBASTIAN
			No. I'm ready.

	Matt leads him into the hallway.

	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

	As they walk down the corridor toward the lab...

				MATT
			Nervous?

				SEBASTIAN
			A little.

				MATT
			Ever tell you the one about Superman 
			and Wonder Woman?

				SEBASTIAN
			I don't think so.

				MATT
			So Superman's flying around the city, 
			and he's horny as hell.  Lo and behold 
			he looks down and sees Wonder Woman, 
			completely nude, sunning herself up on 
			the roof of the Justice League. I mean 
			she is lying there naked and spread 
			eagle. So Superman starts thinking, 
			"man... this is too easy. I could go 
			down there, do a little fast pumping 
			and be gone before she even sees me." 
			After all he is faster than a speeding 
			bullet, right? Anyway, he swoops down, 
			takes care of business so quick, you 
			can't even see him. Well ... I tell 
			ya. Wonder Woman looks up, surprised 
			as hell and says "What the hell was 
			that." And the Invisible Man replies 
			"I dunno know, but it sure hurt like 
			hell."

	INT. LABORATORY

	Sebastian shoots Matt a look.

				SEBASTIAN
			You know, that could be the last joke 
			I ever hear.

				MATT
			C'mon, man. That's funny shit.

	The buzz of conversation is punctuated by an amplified 
	HEARTBEAT, thumping its familiar rhythm. Bah-bump. 
	Bah-bump. In the center of the room, Sebastian, dressed 
	only in a pair of jogging shorts is strapped to a table 
	inclined at a 45 degree angle. Electrodes are strapped to 
	his body. An I.V. tube snakes from the needle in his vein 
	up to a bag of saline solution. Dripping slowly. Linda 
	makes last minute checks of some of the equipment. She 
	pats Sebastian on the shoulder.

				LINDA
			O.K. How're you feeling?
			
			Sebastian takes a deep breath.

				SEBASTIAN
			Fine.

	Sarah checks his vitals.

				SARAH
			Pulse 88, BP 140 over 95. A bit 
			elevated.

				SEBASTIAN
			To be expected.

				SARAH
			No reason for concern. He's ready. 

	Linda takes a moment and studies Sebastian's face. She's 
	almost teary eyed.

				SEBASTIAN
			Hey... it's gonna be okay.

	Linda nods. Back to business.

				LINDA
			Start recording.

	INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH.

	Janice hits record on the equipment decks.

				JANICE
			We're hot. All systems nominal, 
			Houston.

	Frank coordinates all the data being fed into the 
	computers. He pushes a series of buttons and speaks into 
	a microphone.

				FRANK
			Okay, kids. Let's make some history.

	INT. LABORATORY - DAY

	Frank's voice echoes through the chamber.

				LINDA
			Subject: Male, Age 29, weight 166 lbs. 

	Matt jabs a hypodermic into small vial of colored liquid. 
	Draws up 20ccs.

				MATT
				 (to Linda)
			Ready.

	Linda takes the hypo from Matt.

				MATT (cont'd)
			If the tests are any indication it 
			should work quickly.

				SEBASTIAN
			I'll inject myself. If anything goes 
			wrong, they can't blame you.

	She hands the hypo Sebastian and steps away. Sebastian 
	stares at the golden formula silently for a moment.

				LINDA
			We can still shut down, Sebastian.

	He shakes his head.

				MATT
			Any last words?

				SEBASTIAN
			Yeah. If I'm killed, pretend I said 
			something deep and clever. 

	Then... Back to business. He inserts the needle into the 
	I.V. Sebastian. Presses into himself and depresses the 
	plunger.

				LINDA
			Injection was administered at
				 (checks watch)
			... 18:23:47.

	The colored liquid snakes it's way into his bloodstream.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Keep talking. Tell us what you're 
			feeling.

				SEBASTIAN
			Nothing so far.

				SARAH
			Vitals are stable.

	They wait and watch.

				LINDA
			Nothing's happening.

	Another moment passes by.

				MATT
			Human DNA structure is slightly more 
			complex... it's possible that it may 
			take more time...

	Another moment passes.

				LINDA
			Maybe we overlooked something.

				SEBASTIAN
			Recheck the protocol. It can't be non- 
			reactive.

				CARTER
			Kinda like a firecracker with a bad 
			fuse...

	Sebastian shoots Carter a questioning look.

				CARTER (cont'd)
			Don't know if it'll go off.

				LINDA
			Frank?

				FRANK (V.0.)
				 (from the booth)
			No change in bio-electric.

				SEBASTIAN
			Goddammit.

	Another long pause. Sebastian concentrates.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			Okay wait, my arm... it's getting a 
			bit warm... yeah, it's ... it's 
			starting to tingle...

	Excitement overtakes the room.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			Okay... it's spreading to my back... 
			like, like a fever...

				LINDA
			Here we go.

	Slowly the flesh on Sebastian's arm begins dissolving, 
	revealing the complex network of nerves, blood vessels 
	and flesh beneath it.

				SEBASTIAN
			Shit... it's starting to burn... Oh 
			god. It hurts. I didn't think it would 
			hurt.

	The HEART BEAT thumps faster, accelerating

				SARAH
			Heartbeat's elevated. Pulse at 100.
			... 130 ...

				LINDA
			What do you feel? Keep talking. KEEP 
			TALKING!

				SEBASTIAN
			Pain!

				SARAH
			Pulse is 165 ... 170 Blood pressure 
			180 over 100. ... 

				CARTER
			He's going to blow out his heart.

				LINDA
			Prop the crash cart.

	Carter grabs the crash cart, rolls it in. Matt tears off 
	the I.V. leads into Sebastian's arms.

				MATT
			We've got to stop it!

				LINDA
			We can't!

	INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH

	All the monitors are going crazy.

				JANICE
			Something's happening.

	Frank leans into the microphone.

				FRANK
			Listen up! Electric activity 
			increasing in all limbs. Brainwaves 
			are through the roof.

				JANICE
			I didn't think the human brain could 
			spike that high.

				FRANK
			Maybe it can't.

	INT. LABORATORY

	Sebastian screams in dire pain. He struggles against his 
	restraints as his skin liquefies into a muscular mass. 
	It's like something's eating away at him. Gruesome. The 
	yells become louder and more painful to hear.

				SEBASTIAN
			No. Oh god! NO! STOP IT! STOP IT!

	The muscular system begins to dissolve, leaving a 
	struggling skeleton wrapped with tentacular blood vessels 
	and stuffed with the major organs. The beating heart, the 
	heaving lungs.

				SARAH
			Pulse is 180 .... holding stable. 

	Screaming.... Then the organs go. Then the blood vessels. 
	Leaving only a skeleton howling in pain. The jawbones 
	spread wide ... Screaming... screaming...

				CARTER
			 Holy shit.

	Then as if someone had poured acid all over the bones, 
	the skeleton evaporates into nothingness.

				SARAH
			Pulse is dropping. 170..
			150 .... 160..

	There is NOTHING left of Sebastian Caine.

				LINDA
			Bio-quantum phase shift occurred at
			18:26.

	The screaming continues and the restraints continue to 
	twist and turn. Suddenly the restraints go limp.

				MATT
			Is he dead?

	Linda checks the readouts.

				LINDA
			No. He passed out from the trauma.

				SARAH
			Vitals returning to normal. Pulse 110 
			... dropping. Blood pressure 130 over 
			75.

	A long beat as everybody's eyes stare at the instruments.

				FRANK (V.O.)
			Electrical activity is stabilizing.

				SARAH
			Pulse steady at 70.

	A long beat.

				MATT
			Un-fucking-believable.

	A reverent pause as Linda runs her fingers over what 
	would be his skin. Small electrical charge dance around 
	her fingertips. She gasps.

				LINDA
				 (whispers in his ear)
			You did it, Sebastian. You're the 
			first.

				CARTER
			Let's get him into recovery.

								
	DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER

	The chamber is half constructed out of Plexiglas at the 
	end of the Hallway of Habitats.

	On the recovery bed, a sheet drapes over Sebastian's 
	invisible body. The gentle bleatings of medical machinery 
	pound out a dulling rhythm.

	Linda sleeps in a corner chair as Matt slips into the 
	room. He checks the readouts on Sebastian then takes a 
	seat by Linda. She wakes with a start.

				MATT
			S'okay. You nodded off.

				LINDA
			His breathing's hypnotic. How long's 
			it been?

				MATT
			Seventeen hours.

				LINDA
			Where are the others?

				MATT
			In the lab crunching numbers. We've 
			got enough data there for two 
			lifetimes of research.

	Linda rubs her temples and gestures to the bed.

				LINDA
			I keep looking at that hole, wondering 
			if he's really there.

	She notices something out of the corner of his eye. The 
	sheet twitches.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Did you see...

	The sheet twitches again.

				MATT
			He may be coming out of it.

	Linda and Matt watch intently. Then suddenly... the 
	sheets thrash violently. A yell of pain.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			The lights! Turn off the goddamn 
			lights! Ah Christ!

	Linda jumps up and crosses to Sebastian. Matt rushes to 
	the wall and turns off the lights. Darkness. The room is 
	lit by the glow of machinery.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
			I can't... I can't close my eyes. I 
			can't close my eyes.

				LINDA
			Your eyelids are transparent.

	The sheets slowly stop thrashing.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			So I ... I'm...

				LINDA
			Yes.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			My arms. I can.. where? ... I can feel 
			them...

				LINDA
			Your arms ... your whole body... It 
			worked, Sebastian. It worked.

	The sheet rises and slips away. The wires, seemingly 
	connected to thin air, spread out like a spider's web and 
	then fall away one-by-one. The monitors all go dead.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Mirror. I ... I want to see.

				MATT
			Over here in the corner.

	Matt motions to a dark corner of the room, toward a 
	mirror and sink. We push in on the mirror. No reflection. 
	Suddenly it fogs up ... Sebastian's breath. A finger 
	tracing appears in the fog ... but of course we see no 
	finger. The sink faucet twists on and water runs. It cups 
	into the shape of hands and lifts into the air, splashing 
	against the surface of Sebastian's face. Beads of water 
	cling to his f ace, outlining it I shape f or a moment 
	before dripping away.

				MATT (cont'd)
			What was it like?

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			I ... It's hard to think.

	Sebastian's voice is now behind him. Matt turns around.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
			The transformation... I remember every 
			molecule in my body shattering.

				MATT
			It was painful?

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			At first... but then everything went 
			black. I couldn't see or hear or feel 
			anything. It was all just black... 
			like I wasn't connected.

				LINDA
			Your system received quite a shock.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			At least my senses are starting to 
			return... You're wearing your 
			Shalimar, aren't you?

	Linda realizes that he's standing very close by. Her hair 
	lifts slightly and Sebastian inhales. Chills go down her 
	spine.

				LINDA
			Sebastian.

	Linda's hair drops back to her shoulders.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			This is weird. I'm looking through 
			myself at the floor. I'm looking right 
			through myself. I can't tell ...

	He bumps into a chair.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
			... where my body is.

	A moment of silence.

				LINDA
			Sebastian?

	No answer. Linda and Matt look at each other, slightly 
	alarmed.

				MATT
			Sebastian?

	An indentation forms on the bed a moment later.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			You really can't see me. Can you?

				LINDA
			Gimme symptoms. Dizziness, nausea, 
			headache, body-ache, disorientation.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			No, just tired.
				 (beat)
			It's funny. I can see everything... 
			more than before... but I can't see 
			myself.

	INT. LABORATORY - DAY

	Carter, Frank, Janice and Sarah work at various research 
	stations. The door opens and Linda and Matt enter.

				CARTER
			Hey. How's he doing?

				LINDA
			Why don't you ask him?

	Linda motions to the gap between her and Matt. The four 
	of them stare at the nothing.

				SARAH
			Sebastian, how do you feel.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Not to bad, considering.

	They turn round. The voice is coming from behind them. 
	The group rises from their various workstations and turn 
	toward where the voice came from.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
			Odd, isn't it?

	A rheostat switch on the wall turns and the lights dim. 
	Though it's a simple act, it feels somewhat ominous.

				LINDA
			He can't close his eyes so they're 
			sensitive to light.

	Linda's explanation puts everyone at ease.

				JANICE
			So, what was it like?

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Over here.

	Sebastian has moved. As everyone turns toward him again, 
	he can't stifle a slight giggle.

				LINDA
			C'mon Sebastian. Knock it off.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Sorry. Couldn't resist.

	His voice again come s from somewhere else in the room.

				FRANK
			I feel like we're playing Marco Polo.

				MATT
			Well, I see the procedure hasn't 
			changed your personality.

	Frank pulls on a pair of THERMAL GOGGLES.

				FRANK
			No worries. I'm on it.

	THERMAL POV - Every body in the laboratory shows up as a 
	heat signature, including Sebastian. Frank points.

				FRANK (cont'd)
			Gotcha, big man.

	THERMAL POV - The HEAT SIGNATURE reaches for a chair.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Boy, you people have no sense of 
			humor.

	A chair slides back from a desk and bends under 
	Sebastian's weight.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
			Show me. So ...

									
	CUT TO:

	INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

	Frank and Janice shuttle the playback controls as a VIDEO 
	MONITOR re-plays various angles of Sebastian's phase 
	shift.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Stop there.

	Frank halts the tape.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
			Index that. That was when it started 
			burn. Epidermal reaction.

				JANICE
			Index Mark. 112125.

	Janice scribble the numbers in her notebook. Linda 
	crosses, nursing a cup of coffee.

				LINDA
			It's late. Time you got some rest.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Just a little longer.

				LINDA
			Hate to pull rank, but you're my 
			patient now and you need rest. We've 
			got a busy day tomorrow.

	Heavy sigh.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Fine.

	

	INT. THE RECOVERY ROOM - NIGHT

	As Linda enters she points to a small camera in the upper 
	corner of the room.

				LINDA
			We've set up a thermal camera for 
			observation and I've arranged one of 
			us to be here 24/7 in case you need 
			anything. The team's gonna be on alpha-
			call alert for the duration. If 
			anything goes wrong, we can all be 
			here within...

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Thirty minutes. Yes,,_I know. I wrote 
			the procedure.

				LINDA
			I was trying to be reassuring.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			You like this don't you?

				LINDA
			What's that?

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Being in charge.

	It's clear she does. But she's certainly not going to 
	admit it.

				LINDA
			Please. I'm just doing my job.

									
	CUT TO:

	CLOSE ON: A video screen. A thermal lump lays stretched 
	out on the bed.

	Pull back to reveal SARAH staring at the screen. We are.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

	A bank of monitors display the various angles of the Hall 
	of Habitats, the laboratory and, of course, Sebastian in 
	the recovery room.

	Linda hands Sarah a cup of coffee.

				LINDA
			You gonna be okay?

				SARAH
			Fine. It's not like I have anything 
			else going on in my sad pathetic life.

				LINDA
			Carter'll be in at six to spell you 
			and I'll be in by nine. Call me if 
			anything happens, okay?

	Through the glass wall, Linda sees Matt knocking and 
	waving her out.

				SARAH
			I'm fine. Go on ahead.

	INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	The rest of the team straggles into the elevator. 
	Yawning. Exhausted from the day.

				CARTER
			Man, I'm tired. That was a long day.

				LINDA
			Days only get longer from here.

	Linda catches Matt's eye. Gives him a look. "You coming 
	over?" Matt nods, "yes", imperceptible to everyone but 
	Linda. She smiles.

								
	DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

	Deserted and dark.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

	Late. Sarah rubs her temples. Her eyelids are heavy. 
	She's having real trouble staying awake. The buzzing 
	fluorescent light isn't helping either.

	INT. RECOVERY ROOM - NIGHT

	The sheets ruffle and the indentation disappears from the 
	bed. We can hear breathing and soft sound of bare feet 
	shuffling against linoleum.

	CAMERA SLOWLY PANS toward the door, as if we, are 
	following someone walking.

	The door handle turns and the door pushes open.

	INT. HALLWAY OF HABITATS - NIGHT

	WE SLOWLY TRACK DOWN the Hallway of the Habitats. We hear 
	the sounds of sleeping creatures. A couple of them growl 
	at something unseen. The growling follows the invisible 
	something as it passes by.

	INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

	The laboratory door opens and shuts again. Ghostly. We 
	see papers shuffling at one of the work stations. A glass 
	moves slightly.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

	Sarah reclines in her chair. Fast asleep, Behind her is 
	the glass wall, revealing the empty hallway behind it.

	But a small portion of the glass fogs, as if someone had 
	just breathed on it. As the fogged part quickly clears, 
	we see the door to the observation room quietly open.

	ON SARAH, still sleeping. We hear a whisper.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
				 (whispering)
			Sarah. Are you awake?

	Her heavy breathing mixes with Sebastian's.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
				 (barely audible)
			Hmm.

	Sarah's hair moves slightly, as if a hand were running 
	through it. And then we see her shirt move, like fingers 
	were tracing over it. Down from the shoulder to her 
	breast. Around her nipple. Sarah moans slightly, as if 
	she were dreaming, but she doesn't stir. And then her 
	breasts cup slightly, as if they were being touched... 
	softly... gently. Her breathing becomes harder, more 
	labored, erotic... and then she... BOLTS AWAKE. Bar eyes 
	wide with fear. She jumps and cups her own breasts and 
	looks around the room. It's empty, of course. She jumps 
	over to the monitor and checks on Sebastian's room. The 
	heat signature isn't there.

				SARAH
			Dr. Caine! Goddamnit, Dr. Caine! Are 
			you in here?

	She listens. It's silent. She tries holding her breath, 
	listening for his breathing. But there's nothing.

	Sarah reaches over to a microphone. Hits a few switches.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			Dr. Caine?

	VARIOUS SHOTS OF THE COMPOUND

	- LABORATORY

				SARAH (V.0.,LOUDSPEAKER)
			Dr. Caine, please report in.

	- HALLWAY OF HABITATS

				SARAH (V.0.,LOUDSPEAKER)
			Dr. Caine, report in please!

	INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

	Sarah waits. No response.

				SARAH
			Shit. 

	She looks around the room. He must be in here.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			Dr. Caine? Sebastian? Come on, this 
			isn't funny. I know you're in here. 

	Nothing. No response. Sarah waves her hand around, 
	reaching out, trying to find him. After a few beats she 
	stops and rubs her head.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			I must be going crazy.

	Suddenly, Sarah gets an idea. She quickly exits the 
	observation room.

	EXT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	At a wall storage box, she removes a pair of Thermal 
	Goggles and slips them on.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

	Sarah enters wearing the thermals. She scans the room.

	THERMAL POV - The room is empty.

	She pulls the goggles off in frustration, and when she 
	glances over at the video screen, she sees Sebastian's 
	thermal image lying on the bed in the recovery room.

	Sarah sinks into her chair, a tad disconcerted.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - MORNING

	Linda and Matt finish listening to Sarah's story.

				SARAH
			I found him later in the lab, running 
			samples.

				LINDA
			Why didn't you call me?

				SARAH
			Because I wasn't sure. I'm still not. 
			I mean, I could've easily been 
			dreaming.

				MATT
			It doesn't sound like something 
			Sebastian would do.

				SARAH
			God, I feel so stupid.

				LINDA
			I can talk to him.

				SARAH
			No. I mean...
				 (she torn, unsure of herself)
			It was probably nothing. I 
			shouldn't've mentioned it.

				MATT
			You sure?

				SARAH
			Yeah, I'm sure. I mean, y'know, why 
			would he do that, right? Just, this 
			place at night can be kinda creepy, 
			y'know.

	INT. RESEARCH LAB - DAY

	Sebastian, wearing surgical scrubs sits in an examination 
	chair. Wire leads sprout from the electrodes covering his 
	head and arms. The electrodes seem to outline his body.

				MATT
			So, how was your first night?

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Restless. Hard to sleep when you can't 
			close your eyes.

	As Sebastian talks, we can see the electrodes around his 
	jaw pump up and down.

				MATT
			Yeah? What'd you do?

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Got up a couple of times. Knocked 
			about.

				MATT
			Yeah, Sarah mentioned you weren't in 
			your cubicle. She said she called you 
			over the intercom and you didn't 
			respond.

				SEBASTIAN
			I guess I didn't hear. I had the radio 
			on.

				MATT
			It'd be helpful to us if you'd tell 
			whoever's on duty where you're going 
			to. I mean, if something were to 
			happen, we'd want to know where to 
			find you.

				SEBASTIAN
			I didn't think it was a problem.

				MATT
			It isn't. I just don't want it to 
			become one.

	Machines pump out EEG, EKG readouts. Matt studies them.

				MATT (cont'd)
			Readings are normal.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Next I want to run a VV and UVF 
			analysis of the platelets.

				MATT
			We'll have to draw some more blood.

									
	CUT TO:

	Sarah rolls up Sebastian's sleeve, revealing empty air. 
	She wraps a bungee cord around the nothing, pulls it 
	tight and sprays the inside of his elbow with dye. She 
	acts very self conscious.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			You okay?

				SARAH
			Yeah. Why?

				SEBASTIAN
			You just seem a little nervous.

				SARAH
			No. I...I'm fine. Hold still. This 
			might hurt a bit.

	The surface of his skin sheens in the light as Linda 
	searches for a vein. She slaps his arm several times, 
	then plunges a hypodermic needle into his skin. His skin 
	bends and gives. The needle remains in sight after it 
	slips through the visible surface. Sarah presses down on 
	the hypo plunger, releasing a dye into his bloodstream.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			Dr. Caine... this might sounds stupid, 
			but are you... are you looking at me. 

	The red dye twists into a long snaking red tube up and 
	down his arm. His vein.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			No. I was looking at the clock. Why? 

	Sarah draws the plunger back, sucking Sebastian's blood 
	into the hypodermic and then yanks the needle out.

				SARAH
			Just felt like someone was staring at 
			me.

	Sarah pulls the vial off the needle and labels it with a 
	grease pencil. After a few beats the red dye in 
	Sebastian's blood stream dissolves and disappears, as 
	does the liquid in the vial.

	TESTING MONTAGE

	INT. MRI ROOM

	MATT slides Sebastian's sheet covered frame into an MRI. 
	Even though his head is not visible, it shown up on the 
	MRI scanner.

	INT. MAIN LABORATORY

	CARTER and SARAH lower a harness into a water tank. 
	SEBASTIAN'S BODY displaces the water, revealing an empty 
	body shaped cavity in the water.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM

	CARTER sips a BIG GULP and stares at a monitor which 
	shows two eat signatures in the Recovery Chamber, huddled 
	over a chess game.

	INT. RECOVER CHAMBER

	on a chessboard... A BLACK KNIGHT takes WHITE BISHOP, 
	seemingly all by itself.

	Across the table, Matt leans back and topples his WHITE 
	KING acknowledging defeat.

	INT. SPECTRAL LAB

	Dim lights. Janice and Frank both don eye guards. Frank 
	switches on a low intensity laser on and it's beam shoots 
	across the room. The beam distorts slightly in the center 
	of the room. As Frank widens the spectral pattern, 
	suddenly the beam splits into a million different 
	spectral rainbows, momentary illuminating Sebastian's 
	entire frame in a glowing tingle of light.

	INT. MAIN LABORATORY

	LINDA pulls vials from the cyclotrons and props blood 
	sample slides. She slips them under the microscope. She 
	takes a sip of her Diet Coke and puts it on the table. 
	She pears into the microscope and analyses the blood 
	sample, squeezing more stain onto it. She looks up to 
	make notations, but when she reaches for her Diet Coke IT 
	ISN'T THERE. She looks around. It's on the other side of 
	her microscope. She shrugs it off, she takes a sip and 
	sets it down where it was before. She peers into the 
	microscope again and when she looks up... the Diet Coke 
	is gone. She looks around the room and sees it on another 
	table completely.

				LINDA
			Sebastian? Goddamnit.

	We hear Sebastian's laughter echo in the room.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			You've no idea how much fun I've had. 
			I'm going to hate going back.

				LINDA
			That's what worries me.?

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			How so?

				LINDA
			What happens when we turn the project 
			over to the Army. Ever wonder how much 
			fun they're gonna have?

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Maybe we won't give it to them. His 
			voice comes from behind her now.

	We see indentations on her shoulders where his fingers 
	press down.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
			I was thinking... tonight's my last 
			night. Ever fantasize about making 
			love to an invisible man?

	Linda pulls away from him.

				LINDA
			Stop it, Sebastian. It's not funny.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Well, don't do it for me. Do it for 
			science. 

	Linda walks away. Sebastian laughs.

				LINDA
			Grow up.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Oh well. Missed your big chance.

				LINDA
			Got some sleep. Big day tomorrow.

	INT. LABORATORY - DAY

	A bevy of activity below us as the scientists prepare. 
	Matt slides the antigen cocktail into the centrifuge and 
	starts it spinning.

	A sheet drapes over a Sebastian's frame, straps across 
	his limbs. He is fully wired.

	Linda looks up to the observation booth.

				LINDA
			Recording?

	Frank peers down at her from the booth, his voice echoing 
	through the chamber.

				FRANK
			Recording. Subject Doctor Sebastian 
			Caine. Currently in phase shift... 
			Three days, seven hours.

				LINDA
			De-Phase protocol. Injecting Serial 
			Protein Caine One Two Seven.

	Matt removes the glowing vial of orange liquid from a 
	centrifuge nearby. Carter hands Matt a hypo. Matt jabs it 
	into the vial, drawing up the colored liquid. Linda 
	sprays Sebastian's arm with dye.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Ready?

				SEBASTIAN
			Not really. I was just starting to 
			enjoy myself.

				LINDA
			Tough.

				MATT
			Okay, man. Here we go.

	Matt inserts the hypo into the vein and presses down on 
	the plunger. The liquid begins to react. Small flashes of 
	light blip up and down the strand of color outlining the 
	vein.

	Ba-bump.. ba-bump... the heartbeat starts to speed up.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Wait... something... something doesn't 
			feel right.

				SARAH
			Heartbeat elevated.


	INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH

	Janice and Frank look over the equipment.

				FRANK
			Vitals still nominal..

	INT. LABORATORY

	The glowing liquid turns from gold to red as the complex 
	webbing of a bloodstream appears.

	Spreading out from the bloodstream, soon becomes visible 
	... the shadow of a skeletal system.

				SEBASTIAN
			I can't br... br...

	Sebastian begins wheezing.

				LINDA
			What's wrong?

				SARAH
			He's not breathing.

	Muscles are beginning to appear. And eyeballs. Frightened 
	eyeballs.

				MATT
			Subject manifesting.

				SARAH
			Pulse erratic.

	Sebastian pulls against his bonds. One set tears off.

				LINDA
			Carter!

	Carter grabs onto the mass of flesh and muscle, trying to 
	hold it back. But the restraints snap. The half-visible 
	man is screaming. He grabs Carter and throws him across 
	the room.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Sebastian! Sebastian!

	And just for a second, Sebastian is fully visible. And 
	free. He looks around like a scared animal and rips off 
	all the wiring.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Sebastian!

				MATT
			Get a tranq. Stat.

	Sarah preps a tranquilizer. Sebastian locks eyes with 
	Linda. He's lost, he doesn't know where he is. And 
	suddenly, he crumbles to the ground. Linda rushes over to 
	him and puts bar hand on his shoulder. Light bleeds from 
	his skin and his skin begins to dissolve from sight.

				LINDA
			He's reverting. Got him on the table. 

	Matt, Linda and Sarah pull the shifting body up and onto 
	an operating table. Carter pulls himself up and heads 
	back to the group.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Get me a I.V. of A.G. seven.

				SARAH
			I got no pulse. No pulse.

				MATT
			Start CPR.

	Carter locates Sebastian's heart, not a difficult thing 
	because we can actually see it. Carter's hand pushes down 
	in the air inches above the heart. We see the heart being 
	pushed and squeezed. Sarah slaps an air bag on Sebastian 
	and starts pumping air into his lungs. Sebastian's heart 
	begins to beat again, beat on its own.

				CARTER
			Getting a pulse.

				MATT
			Holy shit. What happened?

				LINDA
			Sebastian... can you hear me? Can you 
			hear me? How are his pupils?

				MATT
			I can't see his goddamn pupils!

				SARAH
			I think he's going into shock.

	We slowly FADE OUT to the sights and sounds of our 
	scientist- doctors working on Sebastian... And the 
	beeping of Sebastian's erratic heartbeat.

									 FADE 
UP ON:

	A HABITAT

	The heartbeat continues. In the shadows, two Rhesus 
	Monkeys defend themselves against an unseen attacker. 
	Blood splatters against the Plexiglas wall.

	We FADE OUT AGAIN...

	INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	Linda stares through the Plexiglas walls into the 
	Recovery Chamber. Inside the Chamber, Sarah and Carter-
	eye the various screens monitoring Sebastian's vitals.

	Linda watches the hollow pocket underneath the blanket. 
	She watches the rhythm of its rises and falls as 
	Sebastian sleeps. Matt comes up behind her.

				MATT
			Just got the tissue sample results. 
			Cellular cohesion is stable.

	Linda exhales in relief. Matt puts his hands on her 
	shoulder. Pulls her close to him.

				MATT (cont'd)
			How bout you? You gonna be okay?

				LINDA
			Guess so.
				 (beat)
			I was just thinking about the Apollo 
			missions. Y'know? Grissom, White and 
			Chaffee... What it was like for them 
			on that launch pad that day, thinking 
			they were gonna reach the stars only 
			to burn to death.

				MATT
			Sometimes the test pilots make 
			history. Sometimes the planes crash 
			and people die.

				LINDA
			But he didn't die, did he?
				 (beat)
			What if we can't bring him back? What 
			then?

				MATT
			It's just a little hitch is all. He'll 
			be the first to tell that he'll crack 
			it and I'm sure he will. It'll just 
			take time.
				 (beat)
			Listen, let's got out of here. We 
			could drive up to the old observatory. 
			We'll take some wine and go count the 
			stars and forget all this for awhile. 

	She pulls away.

				LINDA
			No. I want to be here for him.

	Linda pushes through the door of the recovery chamber and 
	takes a seat by Sebastian's bedside. A little hurt, Matt 
	heads down the corridor.

	INT. CONFERENCE ROOM

	Frank and Janice are staring into their coffee when Matt 
	enters. Matt crosses to the coffee machine and pours 
	himself a cup. He takes a seat at the table. They all 
	drink their coffee in silent vigil.

	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - DAY

	Linda sits by Sebastian's bedside, listening to the 
	constant rhythm of the machines.

	The sheets shift.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
				 (weak)
			Hey...

				LINDA
			Hey...

	

				SEBASTIAN 
			So I guess it didn't work.

	Linda shakes her head.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			You look worried. It must've been bad. 

	Sebastian's voice is weak and strained.

				LINDA
			You almost died.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Well, remember your Nietchze. Whatever 
			doesn't kill me, makes me stronger. 

	Linda smiles.

				LINDA
			I should be making you feel better. 
			Not vice versa.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			I guess if I'm going to be stuck this 
			way for awhile, I'd better make some 
			adjustments.

	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - DAY

	In a dusty shaft of light...

	A cotton swab.

	is dipped by a gloved hand into a jar of flesh-colored 
	cream make-up. We follow the hand as it raises the cotton 
	swab into the darkness. The swab strokes over the black 
	and the rich fleshy cream spreads, revealing...

	EYE LIDS of a closed eye.

	The eyelids part, unveiling...

	PITCH BLACK. Blink. Blink.

	No eye.

	Not even a trace of a eye socket. Just darkness.

	A COLORED CONTACT LENS floats through mid-air... hovering 
	before the eyelids. It turns and fastens itself to the 
	darkness between the lids.

	We PULL BACK slowly as Sebastian lifts a latex FACE MASK 
	and pulls it over his head.

	He checks his reflection in the mirror. He looks almost 
	human. Almost. A face, eyes, hands ... the rest of him 
	covered by surgical scrubs.

	We pull back and see the rest of the team looking on.

				MATT
			Not too bad.

				SEBASTIAN
			The latex'll limit the amount of light 
			delivered to my optic nerves.

				LINDA
			You could almost pass for human. 

	Sebastian rises. He looks eerily removed from reality 
	with his cold blank expression.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Well, it gives you a face to talk to 
			at least, and we can all work in 
			normal light again.

	INT. LABORATORY - DAY

	SERIES OF SHOTS

	Carter draws blood from Sebastian.

	Samples are placed into the cyclotron.

	Matt peers through the eyepiece of a microscope. He makes 
	notes.

	Frank and Janice finish a computer simulation on a 
	protein strand. Matt looks over. They shake their heads, 
	no.

	Sebastian slides into the MRI.

	Linda examines a petri dish. She throws her pencil down 
	in frustration.

	Sebastian is hit by the spectral radiation beams.

	Matt pulls a vial of orange liquid from the cyclotron.

	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

	Sebastian, still in his latex and scrubs, but looking 
	like he's been dragged through the nine levels of 
	purgatory, is escorted back to the recovery chamber by 
	Linda and Matt.

	He crosses to his bed and collapses on it. Closes his 
	eyes.

				SEBASTIAN
			The testing's making me sick.

				LINDA
			Could be the barium or the radiation.

				MATT
			You're physiology has changed and, 
			well, all bets are off.

				SEBASTIAN
			I can't believe I have to spend 
			another night here.
				 (to Linda)
			Suppose you're gonna go home now, meet 
			up with that boyfriend of yours now. 

	Linda and Matt exchange a glance. Linda quickly covers.

				LINDA
			Do you want me to stay?

				SEBASTIAN
			No. That's okay. It's just, being a 
			guinea pig is more work than I 
			thought. I'll be fine.

	INT. RESEARCH COMPOUND - NIGHT

	Various shots of the empty hallways and deserted labs.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

	Carter kicks back in his chair listening to his walkman 
	stereo and playing gameboy.

	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - DAY

	Sebastian, in scrubs and make-up, paces back and forth.

	He slams the wall in frustration. He crosses to a mirror 
	and examines himself. He doesn't look half bad. He pokes 
	his cheeks. There's something about him that's a little 
	off, but only if you look close.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

	A shadow falls across Carter's face. He looks up. It's 
	Sebastian wearing street clothes - jeans and a hooded 
	sweatshirt over his latex mask.

	Carter pulls of his earphones.

				CARTER
				 (surprised)
			Dr. Caine. What's up?

				SEBASTIAN
			Just stopped by to let you know, I'm 
			going out for a bit.

	Sebastian turns back into the hallway.

				CARTER
			Going out? Hey wait a sec!

	Carter scrambles to his feet.

	INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	Carter catches up with Sebastian.

				CARTER
			What do you mean going out for a bit?

				SEBASTIAN
			If I don't get out of here, I'm gonna 
			go crazy.

				CARTER
			But you're not supposed to leave the 
			compound.

				SEBASTIAN
			Why not?

				CARTER
			That's the rule.

				SEBASTIAN
			Yes, but I made that rule. It's my 
			rule and I'm changing it.

				CARTER
			You can't just change it.

	Sebastian hits the elevator button. The doors open.

				SEBASTIAN
			Carter, I was suppose to be like this 
			for three days. Three fucking days and 
			I'll be damned if I'm going to spend 
			the rest of my life as a prisoner in 
			this godforsaken dump. Now I'm going 
			out. I'll be back in a couple of 
			hours. Okay?

	The elevator doors close with Sebastian inside. Shit.

				CARTER
			Shit.

	Carter runs down the corridor.

	INT OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

	Carter picks up the phone and dials.

	A beat then.

				CARTER
			Yeah, it's Carter. We got a problem.

	INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

	The elevator doors open and Sebastian pushes past the 
	Marine Guard.

				MARINE GUARD
			Hey, Doc. Haven't seen you for awhile? 

	Sebastian keeps his face turned away as he crosses to his 
	Porsche.

				SEBASTIAN
			Yeah, well. You know how it in 
			sometimes.

				MARINE GUARD
			You got that right, sir. I was 
			beginning to worry 'cause your car 
			hadn't moved.

				SEBASTIAN
			Thanks, but everything's cool. 

	Sebastian starts his car. It chugs a few times before 
	turning over and speeding out of the warehouse.

	INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

	The door opens and Sebastian switches on the lights.

	He looks around his apartment and sighs. It's good to be 
	home.

	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Sebastian enters the bedroom, clicking on the light. He 
	looks at the ceiling, "You Should Be Working", and 
	smiles.

	INT. LINDA'S APARTMENT BUILDING, PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

	Linda and Matt each rush to their respective cars.

				MATT
			He could be anywhere. Hell he could be 
			right behind us.

				LINDA
			I'll meet you at the lab. I'm gonna 
			swing by his place, just in case.

				MATT
			See you there.

	Matt tries to give her a quick pack. Linda backs away.

				LINDA
				 (quietly, looking around)
			I don't want him to see.

				MATT
				 (looking around too)
			What a mess.

	They get in their cars.

	INT. SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Sebastian packs up a few personal belongings in an 
	overnight duffle. He crosses to his bookcase and pulls 
	out some books and throws them into the bag.

	But as he does, he notices a light come on in the window 
	across the courtyard. Sebastian turns off his bedroom 
	light and moves toward the window. He peers across the 
	courtyard into the Brunette's apartment.

	He watches the Brunette as she comes into the living room 
	from her front hallway. She drops her keys on the table 
	and begins unbuttoning her blouse as she crosses to the 
	window. Just as the blouse slips off her shoulder, she 
	pulls her blinds shut.

				SEBASTIAN
			Shit.

	Frustrated, Sebastian steps away from the window and then 
	stops. Something has occurred to him.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			Don't even think it...

	He looks down and notices his hand is trembling. His 
	breathing is a little heavy. A little nervous. He catches 
	a glimpse at himself in the mirror.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
				 (almost whispering)
			Once...just once.

	The Brunette's living room light switches off and the 
	bathroom light switches on. We see him fighting an 
	internal battle and we see him lose it. He grabs a hold 
	of his hand and peels the latex skin off.

	EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

	Linda drives Sebastian's apartment. She spots his black 
	Porsche in the parking lot. She pulls over to the curb, 
	jumps out of her car and heads into the building.

	INT. BRUNETTE'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - NIGHT

	Wearing just a robe, the brunette turns on her shower. 
	The doorbell rings. With a frustrated sigh, the brunette 
	rises.

	AT THE FRONT DOOR

	She peers through the peep hole. No one's there. But as 
	she turns she hears the doorbell again. She opens the 
	door, steps out into the hallway and looks around. Empty. 
	Puzzled she heads back inside her apartment.

	We follow her as she crosses to her bedroom, but a moment 
	later, the bedroom door closes on its own.

	We hear a SCREAM come from the other side. Then another. 
	Then a muffled struggled. And we...

									
	CUT TO:

	INT. HALLWAY, SEBASTIAN BUILDING - NIGHT

	Linda exits the elevator and heads down to Sebastian's 
	door. She knocks. Waits. No answer. She knocks again. 
	Waits.

	And then she tries the door. It's unlocked. She pushes 
	the door open.

				LINDA
			Sebastian?

	INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Linda pushes through the living room, into the bedroom.

				LINDA
			Sebastian?

	She notices that the bathroom light is on.

	BATHROOM

	On the floor she finds Sebastian's clothing and on the 
	vanity she sees his latex face and hands.

				LINDA
			Oh shit.

	She scramble for the bedroom phone and quickly dials.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Yeah, Matt, it's me. He was here. No. 
			He's taken his make-up off. I don't 
			know...He must be outside somewhere.
			I don't know where he went. I'm coming 
			back to the lab. How? How'm I supposed 
			to do that? I CAN'T FUCKING SEE HIM! 
			We're going on alpha call.  I want 
			everyone at the lab now. We're gonna 
			need thermal visors and we may need 
			tranqs.

	As she hangs up the phone, and heads out. The CAMERA 
	doesn't follow, but instead pushes through the blinds and 
	out the window. As we cross the courtyard, we begin to 
	hear muffled cries of terror. We hold on the Brunette's 
	window as we...

									
	CUT TO:

	INT. BRUNETTE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	The bedroom door opens and we see the Brunette, nude and 
	curled up on the bed, sobbing. We follow the sounds of 
	heavy breathing to the front door of her apartment. The 
	door opens and we push out into the hallway. We can see 
	indentations of feet appear on the hallway carpet.

	INT. CORRIDOR BY SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT

	The elevator doors open and Linda steps inside. The doors 
	close shut behind her. A beat later we see the 
	indentations of footsteps come around the corner. We 
	follow the breathing and stumbling footfalls back into...

	INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	We push over to the bathroom sink. The faucet turns on 
	and the water starts running.

	We see the water cup under the faucet and splash against 
	Sebastian's face. His face appears briefly in the water. 
	Then the water slips away.

	For second it sounds like he's crying, but then we hear 
	something far worse. He's laughing. Nervous laughter.

	INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

	Matt hands out thermal goggles, while Frank loads and 
	passes out tranquilizer guns.

				JANICE
			What are the tranqs for?

				LINDA
			Use your imagination.

				JANICE
			Are you saying he's dangerous?

				MATT
			We're just saying we need to be 
			cautious.

				LINDA
			The Metro stops running after midnight 
			and he's on foot, so he can't have 
			gotten too far.

				CARTER
			Look, this isn't a monkey we're 
			talking about. It's Dr. Caine. Don't 
			you think you're over reacting?

				LINDA
			This program is classified. If he's 
			out there it means someone might find 
			out about him. He could destroy the 
			whole program.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Relax, Linda. No one's gonna find out. 

	They all turn around. At the door is Sebastian, back in 
	his latex outfit.

				MATT
			Where the hell have you been?

				SEBASTIAN
			I got a little stir crazy, so I went 
			to my apartment to pick up some stuff.

				LINDA
			Bullshit! I went to your apartment and 
			I happen to know you did a helluva lot 
			more than pick some stuff up.

				SEBASTIAN
			What are you talking about?

				LINDA
			You, of all people How could you? 

	Caught dead to rights, Sebastian sinks into his chair. He 
	thinks she knows.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			You put yourself and this project at 
			risk.

				SEBASTIAN
			Just what did you see in my apartment?

				LINDA
			I saw your face and your clothes.

				MATT
			It was bad enough you left without an 
			escort, but to take off the...
				 (he motions to his face)
			out in public?

	Sebastian realizes that they don't know.

				SEBASTIAN
			Don't make a mountain out of molehill. 
			I didn't let anyone see me.

				LINDA
			That's not good enough. When you're 
			outside the lab there are a thousand 
			variables none of us can control. It's 
			just not safe for you to be out there.

				SEBASTIAN
			Come on, Linda. You don't expect me to 
			be some kind of prisoner.

				LINDA
			You volunteered for this, Sebastian. 
			You knew going in there could be 
			consequences.
				 (beat)
			For the security of this project, I'm 
			gonna have to ask you to confine 
			yourself to the compound.

				SEBASTIAN
			I'm still Project Leader, Linda. It's 
			my decision to make.

				LINDA
			You're right. It's your decision. But 
			if you leave the compound again, I'll 
			notify the oversight committee. Then 
			they can make the decision. You 
			understand?

				SEBASTIAN
			Matt?

				MATT
			Sorry, man. You'd do the same if it 
			were the other way around.

	A long beat. Sebastian slowly rises, acknowledges Linda 
	with a nod and leaves the room. Linda looks around at her 
	silent co-workers, the goggles and tranqs still on the 
	table.

				LINDA
			Pack 'em up... Everyone go home.

								
	DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. LABORATORY - DAY

	The Lab is buzzing with the usual activity. Linda rolls 
	up Sebastian's sleeve, revealing nothing.

				LINDA
			Hold still.

	She wraps a bungee cord around the nothing and pulls it 
	tight. She then sprays the inside of his elbow with dye.

				SEBASTIAN
				 (contentious)
			How much blood do you think you've 
			taken so far?

	The surface of his skin sheens in the light as Linda 
	searches for a vein. She slaps his arm several times, 
	then plunges a hypodermic needle into his skin.

				LINDA
			Not enough to worry about.

				SEBASTIAN
			Every day... feels like you're sucking 
			me dry.

	Linda presses down on the hypodermic plunger, releasing a 
	dye into his bloodstream.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			It's funny. All these years I've known 
			you, I never pegged you for a 
			megalomanic.

				LINDA
			What are you talking about?

				SEBASTIAN
			The shoe being on the other foot. You 
			getting to run things.

				LINDA
			I didn't ask for this, Caine. But when 
			a classified experiment disappears in 
			the middle of the night, someone's 
			gotta run the show.
				 (tries sympathy)
			Look, I know how hard this has been 
			for you.

	He knocks her arm away and pulls the hypo, out of his 
	arm.

				SEBASTIAN
			Don't patronize me.
				 (beat)
			And for the record, you've got no idea 
			what it's like. I get up every morning 
			and you people stick needles in me. 
			You bombard me with radiation until I 
			vomit. And then at six it's over for 
			you. You get to go home. But Sebastian 
			is still here. Sebastian can't leave, 
			or else. That's the worst part, you 
			know. Here I have this ... this GIFT 
			and I can't even use it.

				LINDA
			Now it's a gift?

				SEBASTIAN
			You're goddamn right it's a gift. And 
			if you weren't so goddamned short 
			sighted, I'd be out there right now 
			trying to master it. 

	Sebastian looks around at the other scientists staring at 
	him. He tosses the hypo with the needle onto the 
	instrument tray and heads toward the door.

				LINDA
			Where're you going?

				SEBASTIAN
			Looks like I'm going nowhere.

				MATT
			Come on, man. We've got a ton of tests 
			scheduled today.

				SEBASTIAN
			Do them yourself.


	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT

	Linda enters to find Sebastian reading the collected 
	works of T.S. Elliot.

				LINDA
			Want to talk about it?

				SEBASTIAN
			No.

	Linda looks over his shoulder.

				LINDA
			"We are the hollow men, the stuffed 
			men, headpieces filled with straw."

				SEBASTIAN
			Funny, huh? I've become a literal 
			metaphor.

	He puts the books down.

				LINDA
			I don't want to fight you. I just want 
			what's best for the program.

				SEBASTIAN
			I know. And you being right doesn't 
			make it any easier for me.

				LINDA
			You can be scared. That's okay.

				SEBASTIAN
			I'm not scared of being stuck this 
			way. With a little more make-up and 
			practice, I could...
				 (he motions to his face)
			... pass. Y'know, get by in the world. 
			But the testing...

				LINDA
			You're talking like you've given up. 
			It's only been a few months.

				SEBASTIAN
			What if it's years? I don't know how 
			much more testing I can take.

	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - LATER

	Sebastian paces back and forth, glancing at the camera.

	INT. LABORATORY - DAY

	Linda, Matt and Sebastian, in latex and scrubs, stare at 
	an electron microscope's video display. On the screen in 
	a sparse colony of blood calls but every second more and 
	more cells appear, filling the gap.

				MATT
			60% reversion. 70% ... 75% ... 80% ...
			85 ...

	The others in the lab listen. They start to get excited. 
	Janice and Carter leave their research and come over to 
	watch the screen.

				SEBASTIAN
			We've got it. We've got it.

				MATT
			93% ... 95%... 95%

	They wait. Linda points to a blank patch on the screen.

				LINDA
			That's all we need.

				SEBASTIAN
			Come on, baby. Come on.

	But the blood cells nearest the blank patch twinkle out 
	existence, and then those around them also blink away 
	until after a beat, the screen is empty.

				MATT
			Full quantum cascade at 95%.
				 (beat)
			I'm sorry.

				SEBASTIAN
			You're sorry? You're fucking sorry? 

	Sebastian picks up a glass beaker and hurls it against 
	the wall. It shatters.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			Six weeks of this shit and you're 
			sorry!

	He grabs more equipment and begins tossing it in a rage. 
	Carter and Janice grab him and restrain him. After 
	struggling against them a beat or two, Sebastian calms 
	down and pushes away from them and heads out the door.

				JANICE
			I don't blame him.

				LINDA
			I'll go talk to him.

				MATT
			Leave him alone. He just needs to blow 
			off some steam.

	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT

									
	CUT TO:

	Sebastian lies in his bed, staring at the security 
	camera. The camera stares back at him.

	As if from a dream, we hear the Brunette's muffled scream 
	and cries for help. As we push in on Sebastian's cold 
	eyes, we can barely make out her face thrashing back in 
	forth in panic and confusion.

	Sebastian suddenly rises.

	He crosses to the video camera and examines a small panel 
	on the underneath of the camera.

	He reaches into a box of twinkies and pulls out one of 
	the sponge cakes and begins munching. He hits the 
	intercom button on the phone.

				FRANK (V.0.)
			Yeah?

				SEBASTIAN
			I'm going to the lab.

				FRANK (V.0.)
			Don't you sleep?

				SEBASTIAN
			Waste of time. Da Vinci never slept.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

	Frank eyes Sebastian in the monitor.

				FRANK
			Okay. I'm here if you need me.

	He watches as Sebastian's heat signature moves toward the 
	door.

	INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

	In the dark deserted lab, Sebastian pulls together a 
	circuit board, a computer chip and some wiring. He seems  
	be assembling something.

	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT

	Sebastian crosses underneath the camera... just out of 
	its range... reaches up and using a screwdriver, unscrews 
	the access panel. He scans the electronics and attaches 
	two alligator clips to wires on the circuit board.

	Trailing a long length of wire, Sebastian crosses back to 
	his bed and lies down. He holds a black project box with 
	a button on it. He lies perfectly still and press the 
	button.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

	The video image of the Recovery Chamber flickers 
	slightly, before returning to normal.

	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT

	Sebastian rises and begins to peel off his latex.

	INT. HALLWAY OF HABITATS - NIGHT

	Sebastian's POV - Various animals stir restlessly. A DOG, 
	visible, leaps against the Plexiglas, barking wildly. We 
	push further down the corridor.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

	Again, Sebastian's POV as he pushes through the open door 
	of the observation room. We see Frank sorting through 
	various computer readouts, highlighting certain coding 
	sequences.

	We push in until we are looking over Frank's shoulder at 
	the video monitor. According to the video, Sebastian is 
	sleeping soundly in his room.

	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT

	The rewired security camera stares down at the empty bed.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

	Frank glances over at the video monitor. He can see 
	Sebastian's heat signature lying in the bed.

	Frank feels something on his neck. He flicks whatever it 
	is away with his hand and goes back to work.

	INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

	The elevator door opens. The Guard turns around. The 
	elevator is empty.

	INT. METRO STATION, WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT

	A Metro Subway train draws to a halt. With a cautionary 
	"BING BONG" its doors slide open. A handful of people 
	exit and enter. One man bumps shoulders. He turns round 
	to apologize, but there's no one there. The doors close 
	and the train pulls out of the station.

	EXT. DOWNTOWN D.C. - NIGHT

	A couple of pretty girls exit a bar and stumble to their 
	apartments.

	INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

	One of the girls enters her apartment. The door half 
	closes behind her and then reopens and closes again.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - MORNING

	Frank's reading a book when Linda and Matt enter.

				MATT
			How'd it go?

				FRANK
			Quiet. He worked in the lab till about 
			10:30 and then went to sleep.

	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - DAY

	Close on the security camera. The wires have been removed 
	and the access panel replaced.

	Sebastian whistles a cheerful tune as he finishes 
	applying his makeup. The door opens and Linda and Matt 
	enter.

				SEBASTIAN
			Ah, my two favorite people. Good 
			morning.

				LINDA
			Good morning.

				MATT
			Why so cheery this morning?

				SEBASTIAN
			You know some days you just wake up 
			feeling the world is full of 
			potential. Like your eyes have been 
			opened.

				MATT
			I'm happy if I make it to my coffee 
			machine.

	Linda hands Sebastian a disk.

				LINDA
			I restructured the third genome on 
			your radiated protein strand. Thought 
			you might want to take look.

				SEBASTIAN
			Cook up a batch and let's see where we 
			go.

				LINDA
			I thought you'd want to take a look at 
			it.

				SEBASTIAN
			I trust you. Now if you'll excuse me, 
			I need to have my head examined.

	INT. STORAGE FREEZER - DAY

	Linda pulls bags of frozen plasma from the shelves in the 
	walk-in storage freezer.

				LINDA
			I'm telling you, I know him. 
			Something's going on.

				MATT
			Think he knows about us.

				LINDA
			If he knew about us, he'd be angry and 
			that wasn't angry.

	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

	Janice heads up one of the corridors when something on 
	the floor catches her eye. She bends down and takes a 
	look at it. Barely visible on the floor is a fragment of 
	a BAREFOOT FOOTPRINT.

	She runs her finger along the dried mud. It turns to 
	dust.

	INT. LABORATORY - DAY

	Sebastian holds his latex head on his lap, while EEG 
	leads hang suspended in mid-air, outlining his real head. 
	Carter analyzes the results.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			When you were a kid, you ever dream 
			about being invisible?

				CARTER
			Sure... all the time.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			What did you imagine you'd do?

				CARTER
			The usual.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			What's the usual?

				CARTER
			Hanging out in the girl's locker room. 
			Kicking Jimmy Margiani's ass.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Jimmy Margiani?

				CARTER
			School asshole. Drove a red Trans Am. 
			Back then, I was the size of a small 
			planet and made a rather large target.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Ever think up anything along the grand 
			scale?

				CARTER
			Sure. World domination. Manipulating 
			stock markets, consolidating a 
			political power base. But those are 
			more recent fantasies.

	Carter pulls off the electrodes and Sebastian slides on 
	his latex facemask.

				SEBASTIAN
			And what if it weren't fantasy? What 
			if you were out there in the world and 
			could do whatever you wanted with no 
			consequences whatsoever. How far would 
			go? I mean... if it were real?

				CARTER
			I don't know, man. Out in the real 
			world... I mean, there's a 
			responsibility...

				SEBASTIAN
			Let's say you saw a woman with amazing 
			tits. Would you brush against them?

				CARTER
			Hell, I try and do that now.

				SEBASTIAN
			Human nature. So if you could get away 
			with more, would you do more?

				CARTER
			I read that in a survey at a major 
			university they asked college students 
			"Would you steal if you were 
			guaranteed to get away with it?" 82% 
			said yes.

				SEBASTIAN
			Eighty two percent? Makes you wonder 
			if the world's ready for what we're 
			doing.

				CARTER
			So, Doc what did you do?

				SEBASTIAN
			What do you mean?

				CARTER
			When you were out.

				SEBASTIAN
			I just walked around. Y'know.

				CARTER
			Aw, you just walked around? Come on. 
			There's more, right?

				SEBASTIAN
			Like what?

				CARTER
			Man, I'd be walking up to people 
			saying shit like "This is God, go,get 
			a haircut." Or hanging out in the 
			changing room at Victoria's Secret.

				SEBASTIAN
			Kind of sophomoric, don't you think. 
			Besides, it was late and I wasn't out 
			that long.

				CARTER
			Well, did you see anybody?

				SEBASTIAN
			There was this one girl.

				CARTER
			Yeah? And did you mess with her? 

				SEBASTIAN
			Naw...

	Sebastian gives Carter a sly grin.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			Well maybe a little.
				 (beat)
			I tell you though, a man could get 
			used to it.

	INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

	Alone, Linda packs up her stuff for the evening.

	Slowly we push in on her and hear quiet breathing. We 
	realize we are in...

	SEBASTIAN'S POV

	Then ...

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Goodnight.

	Linda-jumps.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
			Sorry, didn't mean to frighten you.

				LINDA
			It's fine. I just didn't know you were 
			there. Goodnight.

	As she leaves the Lab, he follows her down the hallway.

	EXT. LINDA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

	Linda passes through the revolving doors of her apartment 
	building. A few beats later, as if caught by a gust of 
	wind, the revolving door slowly turns on its own.

	INT. APARTMENT'S HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Linda slips into her apartment and the door closes behind 
	her. A moment later we see the doorknob turn back and 
	forth. It's locked.

	EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

	On a fire escape, we see the ladder shake and descend to 
	the ground. The metal rattles back and forth as if 
	something were climbing it.

	We slowly crane up the fire escape and hold on a window. 
	Through the wispy curtains and dirty glass we can see 
	Linda enter the room. The panel of glass fogs from 
	Sebastian's breath. The fog wipes away, seemingly by 
	itself.

	But then through the window we see Matt walk into the 
	living room and put his arms around Linda's waist. We 
	hear a shocked intake of air.

	He kisses her neck and then slowly unzips her dress. Her 
	dress falls to the floor. Matt takes off his sport coat 
	and drapes it over a chair, while Linda unfastens the 
	buttons of his shirt. They're laughing now, exchanging 
	kisses.

	Matt reaches behind Linda and unhooks her bra. He kisses 
	his way down her neck to her breasts. Linda pulls him to 
	her.

	Suddenly the window shatters. Startled, both Matt and 
	Linda jump back covering themselves.

	We hear Sebastian's footsteps as he retreats down the 
	fire escape.

	A moment later Matt reaches the window and peers out. He 
	sees the fire escape ladder slowly rise back up down 
	below.

				LINDA
			What was it?

				MATT
			I don't know. I don't see anything. 

	Matt picks up a piece of glass and examines it.

				MATT (cont'd)
			It's like something hit it.

	Linda picks up the phone and dials.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

	Carter picks up the phone.

				CARTER
			Hello?

	Carter looks at the security monitor of the recovery 
	room. Sebastian's heat signature lies still on the bed.

				CARTER (cont'd)
			No. No. He's here No, I'm staring at 
			him. He's right there in his room.

	INT. LINDA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Linda breathes a sigh of relief.

				LINDA
			Thanks. No, just checking. 'Kay, bye.
				 (hangs up phone)
			Phew.

	Matt pulls her into him.

				MATT
			Relax... it's nothing. Where were we?

	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT

	BARKING can be heard in the background. That horrible 
	repetitive barking that grates the soul like Chinese 
	water torture.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Be quiet!

	A photograph of Linda drifts through the air and settles 
	atop a flaming candle. It ignites into fire, twisting and 
	turning in mid-air, then falling on the floor as ash. A 
	beat later water runs from the sink faucet. It forms in 
	the shape of hands and splashes against his face, 
	dripping away.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
			And the cyclops screamed out, "Who is 
			it who blinds me?" and Odysseus 
			replied "Nobody is my name". And the 
			Cyclops raged to his friends "Nobody 
			is killing me. Nobody".

	The barking continues. A moment later the chamber door 
	slides open. We push down the...

	HALLWAY OF THE HABITATS

	... until we are face-to-face with the unhappy barking 
	dog.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Shhhh. It's Nobody-It's nothing.

	The Plexiglas door to the doggie's cage swings open and 
	some invisible force grabs little doggie around the neck. 
	The force squeezes its little fur ball throat until the 
	barking stops.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
			Nobody's gonna hurt you. 

	The force keeps squeezing until the little doggie goes 
	limp. Then the dog smashes against the Plexiglas over and 
	over until blood spills out its mouth. The Plexiglas door 
	swings closed again and moments later the door to 
	Sebastian's cubicle closes as well. The water runs in 
	Sebastian's sink washing the blood away from his now half 
	visible hands.

								
	DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. HABITAT'S CORRIDOR - NEXT MORNING

	Sarah sees the dead dog lying prone on its bedding. She 
	eyes it curiously and opens the cage door.

	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - LATER

	Sarah stares at the empty chamber.

				SARAH
			You awake?

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			I am now.

	The sheets raise and drape off of him.

				SARAH
			Notice anything unusual last night. 

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			No. Why?

				SARAH
			Franklin Three. He's dead.

	Sebastian pulls a sheet around him. He moves across the 
	dimly lit room like a ghost.

				SEBASTIAN
			What of?

				SARAH
			His neck was broken and his windpipe 
			collapsed.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			How'd that happen?

				SARAH
			I thought maybe you could tell me.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Sarah... You saying I had something to 
			do with it?

				SARAH
			He was alive last night when I left 
			and he was dead this morning. And you 
			were the only one down here.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			I was in my room all night.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

	Sarah sits with Carter as they run through the security 
	video tape. Matt and Linda look over their shoulder.

				CARTER
			That's all twelve hours.

				LINDA
			He never left the room.

				SARAH
			A windpipe doesn't just suddenly 
			collapse. Someone or something killed 
			it.

				MATT
			You saw the tape. The man was in his 
			chamber.

				SARAH
			Then we have a problem, because I the 
			cage was locked from the outside. That 
			means it was opened, the dog was 
			killed and the cage was closed and 
			locked again. Only a human could do 
			that.

				CARTER
			Well, it wasn't me.

				MATT
			And it wasn't him.

				LINDA
			Are we sure?

	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT

	Linda passes Sebastian's chamber. Sebastian's in latex.

				SEBASTIAN
			Any big plans for tonight?

				LINDA
			Quiet night at home. Maybe a book.

				SEBASTIAN
			Really? Whatever happened to that guy 
			your were seeing?

				LINDA
			He's still in the picture. Why?

				SEBASTIAN
			Being locked down here, I'm forced to 
			live vicariously. Someday you'll have 
			to tell me what he's like.

				LINDA
			Maybe someday I will. See you in the 
			morning.

				SEBASTIAN
			Au domain.

	Sebastian watches Linda walk away. He glances at the 
	camera and starts to peel off his face.

	INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

	The elevator door opens. It's empty.

	SEBASTIAN'S POV - as we push past the guard and down onto 
	the street.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	Empty street. We hear whistling. Splashes of water splat 
	out from shallow puddles,,as Sebastian walks through 
	them.

	SEBASTIAN'S POV - A car approaches. As it drives by we 
	see Matt and Linda inside, heading back to the warehouse.

	The footsteps stop.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Hmmm.

	We see the footsteps start to head back toward the 
	warehouse.

	INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

	Linda and Matt exit their car and cross toward the 
	elevator.

				LINDA
				 (to Marine Guard)
			Forgot something.

	INT. STREET IN FRONT OF WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

	As we watch the footsteps head back through the puddles 
	toward the warehouse, we see Frank pass us in his car.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			What the hell?

	He breaks into a run. Feet splash water and he races back 
	toward the warehouse.

	INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	Empty. The elevator door opens and we push out into the 
	hallway. Sebastian's POV

	INT. HALLWAY OF HABITATS - NIGHT

	We follow Sebastian down the hallway to his cubicle. But 
	as he rounds the corner, he quickly ducks back. The 
	entire research team is in his cubicle. Sebastian slowly 
	approaches and watches as Frank takes down his video 
	board.

				FRANK
			Pretty clever really. All it does is 
			recycle the signal. He flips this 
			switch, it takes a snapshot and that's 
			all we see.

				LINDA
			Asshole.

				JANICE
			And you think he's violent?

				SARAH
			He killed a dog with his bare hands.

				FRANK
			Dogs aren't people. Are we in any 
			danger?

	Linda doesn't know.

				LINDA
			Either way, we aren't equipped to 
			handle this. We have to inform the 
			committee.

	Everybody murmurs in agreement.

				JANICE
			What if he doesn't come back?

				LINDA
			They'll go after him.
				 (beat)
			Who has tonight's shift?

				JANICE
			I do.

				LINDA
			Pretend nothing's wrong. Everyone just 
			do what you're doing so he doesn't 
			become suspicious. Okay? Matt and I'll 
			go tell Doctor Kramer and we'll lot 
			the committee deal with it. 

	Sebastian's POV - He backs away and races down the hall.

	EXT. DR. KRAMER'S HOUSE - POTOMAC MD - NIGHT

	The stately stone house sits on a finely manicured lawn 
	in one of the nicest neighborhoods in town. Linda's car 
	is parked on the curb in front.

	We break from a typical establishing shot and as the 
	CAMERA tracks closer to the house, we realize that we are

	SEBASTIAN'S POV

	We hear breathing and footsteps as we push through some 
	bushes and head toward a bay window which looks into the 
	Kramer living room.

	Through the glass we see LINDA and MATT seated across 
	from DR. KRAMER. We can't hear what they're saying but it 
	certainly looks serious. Kramer puffs on a pipe and 
	strokes his beard, shaking his head.

	Kramer rises and shakes hands with Linda and Matt, and 
	the three of them head toward the front door.

	We move away from the window and track toward the front 
	door. As the door opens we begin to hear the tail end of 
	the conversation.

				KRAMER
			I'll call General Caster right now and 
			convene the oversight committee 
			tomorrow.

				LINDA
			Thank you, sir.

				MATT
			What do we do in the meantime?

				KRAMER
			Just sit tight and wait for my call. 

	Matt and Linda head down to her car. Kramer heads back 
	inside.

	INT. KRAMER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	Kramer heads back into the living room. His wife appears 
	a the upstairs railing.

				MRS. KRAMER
			What was that about?

				KRAMER
			Just a little trouble at work.

				MRS. KRAMER
			You coming up?

				KRAMER
			In a minute. I have to make a few 
			calls.

	Mrs. Kramer retreats back to her bedroom as Dr. Kramer 
	crosses over to the telephone. He picks up the receiver 
	and starts dialing. In the middle of dialing, the phone 
	goes dead. He clicks the hookswitch up and down trying to 
	get a dial tone. Nothing. He checks the connections on 
	the phone and then follows the wiring to the wall. The 
	line's plugged in. Weird. He hears a door creak open in 
	the kitchen.

				KRAMER (cont'd)
			Hello? Hello?

	Kramer crosses to the darkened kitchen. The kitchen door 
	leading to the backyard is open. Puzzled, he crosses to 
	it. A wind stirs across the pool and backyard, swirling 
	dead leaves in small twists of wind. The windchime rings 
	lightly. Kramer steps out.

	EXT. POOL/PATIO, BACKYARD - NIGHT

	In the dim spillover light from house, Kramer crosses to 
	the telephone- box against the back of the house. It Is 
	open and several of the wires have been pulled. He looks 
	around, spooked and puffs out a cloud of smoke from his 
	pipe. For the briefest of instants, Sebastian's face is 
	visible in the smoke. Kramer jumps back in surprise and 
	the pipe drops from his mouth. He gives a small sharp 
	cry, but deep indentations appear across his mouth and 
	his cries are stifled. In the darkness, we can make out 
	his form writhing as if possessed. The struggle continues 
	a beat until Kramer manages to break free.

				KRAMER
			Help! HELP! MARTHA! HELP!

	As Kramer runs, he looks behind him. But no one's there. 
	WHAM! Something slams into Kramer and he tumbles, rolling 
	into the pool. But as he hits water there's not just one 
	splash, but TWO. In the water next to him is human shaped 
	AIR-POCKET. It's Sebastian displacing the water. And 
	because of the water displacement, we can clearly see two 
	arms pushing Kramer beneath the water's surface. 

	MARTHA KRAMER opens the bedroom window and looks down at 
	the pool. All she can see is her husband drowning... his 
	flailing limbs kicking up a massive air bubble around 
	him. She races from the window. Kramer kicks and flails 
	for a few moments and then his limbs stop moving. A 
	moment later he floats to surface, face down. The AIR 
	POCKET bobs over to the pool ladder, and rising from the 
	pool, we see Sebastian's body outlined in sheets of 
	water. The shape melts away in a cascading waterfall 
	until all we can see of Sebastian are the hundreds of 
	tiny droplets still clinging to his body, caught in the 
	light like twinkling bulbs on a Christmas tree. The shape 
	disappears into the darkness. A moment later Martha 
	emerges from the house and sees her husband floating face 
	down in the pool. She screams.

	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - DAY

	Linda passes by Sebastian's chamber.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			What? No good morning for me? Don't 
			you like me anymore?

				LINDA
			Oh, sorry. I...I'm in a hurry.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			That's okay. It's going to be busy 
			day.

	INT. LINDA'S OFFICE - DAY

	Matt sits across from her, twirling a pen in his hand. 
	They both stare at the phone.

				LINDA
			When did he say held call?

				MATT
			He's probably meeting with the 
			committee trying to figure out what to 
			do.

				LINDA
			I'm gonna call him.

	Linda picks up the phone and dials.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Yes, Dr. Kramer please. Excuse me?
				 (inhales sharply - surprised)
			When? I'm so sorry.

	Linda blanches as she hangs up the phone.

				MATT
			What?

				LINDA
			He's dead. Drowned in his pool last 
			night.

	Linda picks up the phone again and dials.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Yes, General Thompson please. Thank 
			you. 

	As she waits the phone line clicks dead.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Hello? Hello?

	She clicks on the hookswitch.

				MATT
			Let me see that.

	He tries it too. Same result.

				MATT (cont'd)
			Intercom's working, but there doesn't 
			seem to be an outside line.

	INT. CORRIDOR/ELEVATOR

	They waste no time getting to the elevator. Linda and 
	Matt step in.

				LINDA
			I'll be right back with help.

	Linda taps in his floor code.

				ELEVATOR (V.0.)
			Authorization please.

				LINDA
			Foster One Delta Eight Three Five.

				ELEVATOR (V.0.)
			Authorization invalid. Request denied.

				LINDA
			That's a first.

	Linda taps the keypad again.

				ELEVATOR (V.0.)
			Authorization please.

				LINDA
			Foster One Delta Eight Three Five.

				ELEVATOR (V.0.)
			Authorization invalid. Request denied.

				MATT
			Let me try mine.

	Matt hits buttons on the keypad.

				ELEVATOR (V.0.)
			Authorization please.

				MATT
			Kensington Two Romeo One Five Nine.

				ELEVATOR (V.0.)
			Authorization invalid. Request denied.

				LINDA
			Tell me this isn't happening.

	INT. LABORATORY - DAY

	Frank, Sarah, Carter and Janice man various work stations 
	in the lab. Linda and Matt enter.

				LINDA
			We've got a problem.

	INT. COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT

	Frank's fingers fly over the keyboard.

				MATT
			How long before anybody starts looking 
			for us?

				LINDA
			There's no set check in procedure. It 
			could be weeks.

	A graphic of the elevator system pops up on the screen. 
	Frank highlights the security terminal. Frank hits a few 
	more keys. The screen reduces to a series of numbers.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			You think you can got in?

	Frank rewrites a few of the numbers.

				FRANK
			Already in. It was only a second level 
			encryption.

	The Security System specifications pops up.

				JANICE
			Some security system.

				FRANK
			Oh the system is fine. It's just I'm 
			just extraordinary.

	Frank types a few more keys, and his eyes widen.

				FRANK (cont'd)
			But apparently someone is more 
			extraordinary than me.

				MATT
			What is it?

				FRANK
			There's nothing wrong with the system. 
			Our codes have been removed.

				MATT
			Removed? By who?

				FRANK
			Here's a clue. Only one code remains. 

				LINDA
			Whose?

				FRANK
			Dr. Sebastian Caine.

	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER

	The team approaches Sebastian's chamber. Carter pulls on 
	the pair of thermal goggles dangling from his neck up.

	THERMAL POV - The chamber is empty.

				CARTER
			He's not in there.

	Linda enters the chamber. She notes that Sebastian's face 
	and makeup are on the sink vanity. Linda crosses to the 
	phone and hits the "PAGE BUTTON"

				LINDA
			Okay, Sebastian. Fun's over. Tell us 
			where you are.

	She waits. Then...

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			I'm sorry. But I can't lot you turn me 
			in.

				LINDA
			Sebastian... where are you?

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (INTERCOM)
			You have no idea what it's like. The 
			power of it. The freedom. I can't let 
			that go.

				LINDA
			C'mon Sebastian. You're scaring me. 
			Tell me where you are and we can talk 
			about it.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (INTERCOM)
			There's nothing to talk about. See ... 
			I've done things that can't be undone. 

	A long beep as the intercom clicks off.

				LINDA
			Sebastian! Sebastian!
				 (beat)
			I want search parties. Thermal goggles 
			and tranquilizers.

	INT. CORRIDOR

	Linda and Matt, wearing thermal goggles and clutching 
	tranquilizer pistols, walk down the hallway, scanning 
	back and forth.

	INT. SEBASTIAN'S OFFICE

	Janice enters the office.

				JANICE
			Dr. Caine? Are you in here? Dr. Caine? 

	Suddenly, Janice jerks back.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			I'm here.

	INT. HABITAT'S CORRIDOR

	Sarah scans all the habitats with a thermal scanner. 
	Listening intently.

	INT. SEBASTIAN'S OFFICE

	Janice struggles with her unseen assailant, slamming into 
	walls and knocking into filing cabinets.

	INT. LABORATORY

	Frank and Carter search the lab with their thermal 
	scopes.

				FRANK
			Doctor Caine?

	INT. SEBASTIAN'S OFFICE

	Linda and Matt knock.

				LINDA
			Sebastian?

	No response. They push through the door. The room seems 
	deserted. Signs of a struggle. File cabinets opened, 
	drawers tossed.

				MATT
			This is bad.

	THERMAL POV - Linda surveys the room, spotting a slight 
	heat signature peeking from the corner.

				LINDA
			There's something over there.

	Linda moves toward it. Whatever it is its hidden from 
	Matt's POV by the supply cabinet. As Linda gets close she 
	pulls of f her thermal goggles to see...

	JANICE -

	Her face blue, eyes bulging. An I.V. cord wrapped around 
	his neck. Linda jumps back.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Jesus. Oh my god.

	Matt rushes over. Sees the lifeless corpse.

				MATT
			What happened?

	Linda lowers the body to the floor.

				LINDA
			She was strangled. Multiple blows to 
			her head.

	Linda begins a medical check of the rest of the body. 
	Matt stoops down and examines Janice's face.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			We got a big problem here.

	A lamp tumbles from the desk and smashes to the floor. 
	Both Linda and Matt jump. Linda frantically dons the 
	thermal visor and scopes the room again. Nothing. Matt 
	notices the lamp cord beneath Linda's leg. Points it out 
	to her. She sighs with relief... she pulled the lamp off 
	the table.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Get everybody to the conference room. 
			Now!

	Matt picks up the phone. Clicks the hookswitch. Clicks 
	the hookswitch again.

				MATT
			Intercom... the phone lines. They're 
			dead.

				LINDA
			Gimme that.

	She checks the phone, punches some numbers. Nothing.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			It was just working.

				MATT
			What the fuck is going on here?

	INT. CORRIDOR

	Matt and Linda head toward the lab.

	Linda suddenly stops.

				MATT
			What?

				LINDA
			Shhh.

	Linda takes a few cautious steps. Senses something.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Give me the visor.

	Matt, suddenly concerned, hands her the visor. 

	THERMAL POV - Linda checks out the corridor. Empty. Linda 
	takes Matt's hand.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			C'mon.

	They move quickly up the corridor. See Frank, Sarah and 
	Carter.

				FRANK
			Did you find him?

				LINDA
			Janice is dead.

	INT. CONFERENCE ROOM

	Linda scans the room with her thermal scope.

				LINDA
			It's clear.

	Matt, Frank, Janice and Sarah step in, locking the door 
	behind them.

				SARAH
			The man has checked out of reality.

				FRANK
			What happened? I don't understand.

				CARTER
			Isn't it obvious? Right now, we're the 
			only ones who knows he exists. If he 
			gets rid of us, no one knows and he 
			becomes the most powerful man on 
			earth.

				FRANK
			But he's not a killer.

	They all look at Linda.

				LINDA
			He wasn't. He is now.

				MATT
			Can you fix the elevator? Restore our 
			codes?

				FRANK
			It'd take hours to crack the 
			encryptions.

				MATT
			Right now that sounds like good news.

				CARTER
			So what do we do until then. Sit 
			around waiting for him to kill us off? 

	Everyone looks around for some leadership. Finally.

				LINDA
			No. We find him, before he finds us.

	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

	The group moves quickly, passing under an air vent. As 
	they round the corner the vent slowly swings down and an 
	air disturbance drops to the ground.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM

	As they enter...

				CARTER
			You sure this'll work.

	Linda sits down at a computer terminal, activates it.

				LINDA
			We designed it to help find the rats 
			we kept dropping in year one. They 
			were too small for thermal scans.

	A map of the compound appears on the screen.

				MATT
			Systems hot. Activating motion 
			detectors.

	Matt toggles a switch. Linda stares at a map of the 
	compound. Blips appear on the display... in the 
	observation room... in the Habitat Area and in one of the 
	corridors.

				LINDA
			I've got movement in Corridor Six.

				MATT
			That's him.

	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

	A shadow edges down the tunnel. It settles for a moment, 
	disappearing completely, then is back on the move. At the 
	tunnel's edges, motion detectors light up as the thing 
	passes by.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM

	Carter checks his Tranq pistol & Matt rummages through a 
	locker.

				MATT
			Got 'em.

	Matt pulls out a pair of walkie-talkies. He tosses one to 
	Linda.

				LINDA
				 (into walkie)
			Check. Check.

	Her voice echoes from the other unit.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Be careful.

				MATT
			Just watch our backs. Hey Carter, 
			ready?

				CARTER
			Let's do it.

	Matt and Carter exit. Linda locks the door behind them.

	INT. TUNNEL

	Matt and Carter trot toward corridor six.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

	Linda huddles over the display, tracking the two.

				LINDA
				 (into Walkie)
			Take a right at the next accessway. 
			He's working his way back to the 
			offices.

	We see Matt and Carter on one of the working video 
	screens as they push down the tunnel.

	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

	Matt and Carter move cautiously, listening for any sound.

				MATT
				 (Walkie - sotto)
			If we split up, can we trap him on 
			corridor eight?

				LINDA (V.0.)
			If he keeps heading in that direction. 

	Matt nods to Carter. The pair splits, heading down 
	separate accessways.

				MATT
			Going Thermal.

	Matt pulls the visor down over his eyes.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

	Linda watches the two separate and come around Sebastian 
	in a pincer move.

	Suddenly, the blip that was Sebastian disappears. Linda 
	grabs the walkie.

				LINDA
			I lost him. Matt, I lost him.

	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

	Matt makes his way forward.

				MATT
			He probably just stopped moving.

	But Matt becomes more cautious with his footsteps. Slowly 
	... approaching a corner...

	He rounds the corner and sees a heat signature at the far 
	end of the corridor. He levels his pistol, ready to fire.

				CARTER
			It's me.

	Matt pulls off his goggles.

				MATT
			Do you have anything?

				CARTER
			Nothing.

				MATT
			How did he get by us?

				CARTER
			He couldn't.

				MATT
			Sebastian! We're here to help. 
			Sebastian.

	No response. They both don their visors and move forward 
	slightly. Carter holds up his hand.

				CARTER
			There. Behind those pipes. He's not 
			moving.

	Carter points. Matt checks his thermal. A red heat 
	signature clings to the wall.

				CARTER (cont'd)
			Doctor Caine?
				 (beat)
			Can you hear me?

	No response.

				MATT
				 (into walkie)
			We see him. But he's not responding. 
			The heat signature doesn't move.

	Matt looks through his visor and holds the tranquilizer 
	gun at the ready. He looks for a clear shot. The heat 
	signature huddles behind pipes.

				MATT
			C'mon... C'mon...

	The two slowly move closer. Matt finally has a clear 
	shot. He signals Carter. Carter levels his pistol too.

				CARTER
			Covered.

	Matt fires the dart at the heat signature. It bounces off 
	the wall ... Nothing there. 

				MATT
			What the...

	He crosses to the heat signature.

				MATT (cont'd)
			Just a vent. Just a goddamn vent

				LINDA (V.0.)
			He was there.

				MATT
			Looks like... looks like we're pumping 
			out heat...

	Suddenly behind him... CARTER JERKS THREE FEET in the 
	air, kicking wildly. SUSPENDED IN MID-AIR BY HIS NECK. He 
	gasps for air.

				LINDA (V.0.)
			I got movement again! He's right on 
			top of you!

				MATT
			No fucking shit!

	Matt opens fire with the tranquilize, shooting at the 
	ceiling until he spends his dart rounds.

				MATT (cont'd)
			Sebastian? Goddamnit! Let him go.

				CARTER
				 (choking)
			H...Help... MMmmphg

	Carter suffocates. He passes out. With a sudden crack, 
	he's thrown against the side wall. A large cut opens up 
	across his head and his body goes limp.

				MATT
				 (into walkie)
			Where is he? Where the fuck is he?!?

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

	Linda huddles over the display.

				LINDA
			Right on top of you.

	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

	Matt scrambles away. Running. Pipes burst and swing down 
	from the ceiling. Steam billows forth. Something moves 
	through the cloud of steam.

	Around the corner, Matt shoves more darts into his 
	tranquilizer.

				LINDA (V.0.)
			What's going on? Are you okay?

				MATT
			Carter's down. Hurt bad. Bleeding from 
			a head wound.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Linda watches the screen. Two blips, one traveling 
	quickly.

				LINDA
			Matt, he's coming toward you.

	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

	Matt takes a few steps back.

				MATT
			Shit.

				LINDA
			Got outta there.

	Matt breaks into a run.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM

	Linda watches one dot chasing the other, down several 
	corridors.

				LINDA
			He's close!

	INT. TUNNEL

	Matt running, checking over his shoulder. Sounds of 
	footsteps behind him, but up ahead the heavy metal blast 
	doors begin to close.

				MATT
			Goddamnit. The doors are closing. He's 
			shutting me in.

	Matt rushes the doors as they slide shut. He doesn't make 
	it in time. The doors close with a resounding clang. Matt 
	turns and pulls on his thermals.

				MATT (cont'd)
			Where is he?

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Linda huddled over the screen. Tense.

				LINDA
			He's coming right at you! 

	Then checks the Thermal goggles. Several heat signature 
	dot the tunnel.

				MATT
			Where?

				LINDA
			Twenty, maybe thirty feet.

				MATT
			Goddamnit, I got thermals all over the 
			place. Eight, maybe ten of them. Must 
			be ghosts.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Linda gets a sense of forboding. She looks around the 
	room. Sees a heating vent in the corner.

	Beat.

	She grabs the walkie.

				LINDA
			Those signatures ... they're coming 
			from the heating vents. 

	Through the goggles, Matt sees the tunnel turning red.

				MATT
			I'm starting to lose resolution on my 
			thermals.

				LINDA
			Get out of there!

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM

				FRANK
			If the room temperature is the same as 
			his body temperature, thermal 
			visors'll be no good.

	Linda grabs a Tranq gun and heads for the door. 

				LINDA
			I'm going!

				FRANK
			Linda...it's not safe.

				LINDA
			That's why I'm going.
				 (to Frank and Sarah)
			Corridor eight is clear. Get Carter to 
			the lab. We'll meet you there.

				FRANK
			But...

				LINDA
			Do it.

	INT. CORRIDOR

	Matt turns to face the corridor. It's turning red. Matt 
	sees some movement in the thermal cloud. Opens fire. But 
	the thermal signature disappears into the heat. Matt 
	can't distinguish anything through his goggles anymore. 
	He pulls them off and holds him gun in front of him 
	sweeping the hallway.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Marco...Polo... Marco... Polo...

	His voice keeps shifting. Matt fires.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
			Not even close.

	Matt sweeps his front leg back and forth, like a blind 
	man using a cane. But his foot isn't hitting anything. He 
	sees a FIRE EXTINGUISHER mounted on the wall. He rushes 
	it, turns it on the hallway and sprays. And SOMETHING 
	LUNGES through the foam. GRABS HIM, sending him tumbling 
	down the tunnel. Matt is thrown against the wall. Blood 
	coming from his brow. He scrambles away, spraying more 
	foam. Sees a shape in the mist, raises his pistol and 
	FIRES. The shape leaps away. The DART FLIES. Doesn't hit. 
	Matt scrambles back into a corner. His pistol is empty.

				SEBASTIAN
			So... just out of curiosity, how long 
			has my best friend been fucking my ex-
			girlfriend.

				MATT
			Sebastian. Get a hold of yourself. You 
			aren't thinking rationally.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			She's a pretty sweet fuck, isn't she?

				MATT
			Calm down, Sebastian... we can talk 
			this through. It's not too late.

	The Shape parts the low hanging mist, the fine powder 
	swirling in clouds behind it. Coming toward him.

				MATT (CONT'D)
			C'mon Sebastian. Don't do this. I'm 
			your friend.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			I'm sorry, but I just feel that our 
			friendship is holding me back. I'm 
			sure you understand. 

	THE DOOR OPENS. Linda reaches through, grabs Matt. She 
	pulls him to his feet and through the door.

	INT. TUNNEL

	Frank and Sarah, holding their Tranq pistols, fly down 
	the corridor.

				SARAH
			This way.

	They shear off the main corridor into the side corridor. 
	Carter lies crumpled up ahead. Sarah slides to his side. 
	Carter's head rests in a pool of blood. She checks his 
	pulse while Frank takes a protective position.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			Pulse is weak. Breathing... shallow.

				FRANK
			He'll be okay.

				SARAH
			It's pretty severe. We have to get him 
			to the lab.

				FRANK
			He's got to be okay.

	Frank stands frozen.

				SARAH
			For godsakes, help me.

	Frank snaps to. Grabs an arm. The pair hoist Carter up 
	and carry him down the hallway.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM

	Linda pulls a handle and doors slide shut behind them.

				MATT
			He was going to kill me.

	Linda pulls him close.

				LINDA
			I know. He's gone.

				MATT
			We've got to got out of here.

	Linda checks the screen -- see Sarah, Frank and Carter 
	headed toward the Laboratory.

				MATT (cont'd)
			Where is he? Goddamnit, where is he? 

	Isolated in the Hallway of Habitats is a single blip.

				LINDA
			Habitats.

				MATT
			Oh god. That's right between us and 
			the lab.

	INT. LABORATORY

	Frank and Sarah lift Carter onto a medical table.

				SARAH
			His pulse is faint.

	Sarah grabs a sheet from the counter top. Folds it and 
	presses it against the head wound.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			He's lost a lot of blood. Here. Hold 
			this.

	She guides Frank's hands to the wound.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			Keep applying pressure.

	Sarah pulls out a saline solution I.V. bag and slap it on 
	the rack. She fumbles with the needle as she tries to 
	find a vein.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			Don't move your hand until I got back. 

	Sarah heads to the door.

				FRANK
			Where are you going?

				SARAH
			This'll hold him but he needs blood.

				FRANK
			But...

				SARAH
			Supply is right down the hall. I'll be 
			two seconds.

				FRANK
			Sarah, wait for the others

				SARAH
			If I wait, he'll die. Keep pressure on 
			the wound.

	INT. CORRIDOR

	Sarah exits the lab. Checks the corridor. Down at the end 
	of the cramped tunnel is the supply room.

	She swallows her fear and heads toward it, all the while 
	glancing side-to-side and behind her.

	INT. SUPPLY ROOM

	Spooked, Sarah bursts into the room. She goes to the 
	supply fridge/freezer, pulls open the door, and sorts 
	through blood bags.

	INT. TUNNEL

	Matt and Linda push along the corridor; Matt spraying 
	with the fire extinguisher in short controlled bursts, 
	Linda clutching her tranquilizer like a commando.

	A noise behind them. Footsteps.

	Matt turns to blast with the extinguisher. The white 
	chemical dust sprays out, outlining a shape in the 
	tunnel. But it isn't a human shape.

	Matt's uniform shreds. Something with fierce sharp claws 
	fells him. Tearing into his flesh. We see a angry, hungry 
	face... jabbing for a moment through the lingering fog.

				MATT
			Ahh!  Shit!

	Linda tries to get a clear shot off through the smoke. 
	Matt trips and goes sprawling. Something yelps. A howl. 
	Linda shoots. Her dart jabs into something which 
	collapses to the ground. A moment of calm. As the dusty 
	chemical foam settles, the outline of a great ape 
	appears, still twitching.

				MATT (cont'd)
			Karl Three. Nice shot.

				LINDA
			He's let the animals out. It wasn't 
			him we were tracking.

	Linda leans against the wall, still clutching her tranq 
	gun at the ready. The heat is getting to bar. Bar scrubs 
	are soaked, her hair's a mess. She wipes the sweat from 
	her brow.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			You okay?

				MATT
			It won't kill me unless it gets 
			infected. You?

				LINDA
			Me .... Don't ask about me. If he 
			freed all the animals, we could have 
			dozens running around the lab.

				MATT
			So he could be anywhere right now.

	Matt sprays the whole tunnel, putting down a gentle cloud 
	mist. Nothing else appears.

				MATT (cont'd)
			What do we do?

				LINDA
			Get to the lab, lock the goddamn doors 
			and pray to God Frank can reprogram 
			the elevator.

	INT. SUPPLY ROOM

	Sarah finishes collecting blood bags and shuts the door 
	to the fridge/freezer.

	The DOOR SLAMS behind her. She freezes and slowly turns.

				SARAH
			Frank?

	She eyes the supply room, looking for a sign of movement.

				SARAH (cont'd)
				 (frightened whisper)
			Who's there?

	She listens. Is that breathing she hears? Now she's 
	starting to panic.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			Dr. Caine?

	She starts to back away, but she's already in the corner. 
	She clutches her tranquilizer gun, but there's nothing to 
	aim at. The vials of blood on the shelf gives her an 
	idea. She reaches over, grabs a vial and throws it on the 
	floor. GLASS SHATTERS and BLOOD SMEARS across the 
	linoleum. Sarah tosses another vial and another. Becoming 
	more and more hysterical. Splattering more and more 
	blood. But she runs out of vials. Shaking with fear, she 
	searches the blood looking for a footprint, or movement. 
	But there's nothing there. Sarah waits a beat, clutching 
	the tranquilizer gun. Takes a step. Waits a beat longer.

	Finally she relaxes. It was just her imagination. She 
	heads toward the door when she hears a terrifying whisper 
	in her ear.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			You missed.

	Her hair flies up, and she swings against the wall. She 
	tries to move, but she's pinned there. Her hands 
	struggling against the force.

				SARAH
			Please no. Let me go. Oh god, let me 
			go. 

	The arm holding the tranquilizer gun begins to move.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			What are you doing? No!

	Sarah fights, but her arm moves nonetheless

				SARAH (cont'd)
			Help me! Oh God. Somebody help me!
			FRANK!

	Slowly, deliberately, her own arm moves down the wall and 
	around, until the tranquilizer gun points right at her 
	stomach.

	Sarah watches in horror as her own body betrays her.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			No... please. Don't do this to me.

	She struggles, shaking back and forth. Writhing. In 
	anguish and in fear.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			What do you want?

				SEBASTIAN
			You.

	The trigger pulls .... Pop!

	A dart explodes from the gun and imbeds in Sarah's 
	stomach. She whimpers as her eyes glass over. Suddenly 
	she's released. She stumbles backward and falls lifeless 
	to the floor. A moment of stillness, all we can hear is 
	the sound of someone breathing.

	On Sarah's face... a slight-indentation runs down her 
	cheek..

	Almost sweet... almost tender. And slight indentation 
	runs across her breast and strokes down her body. The 
	sense of violation and vulnerability is awful. Sebastian 
	sighs.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			I've always liked your feistiness. 

	Sarah's head shifts slightly. Her head shifts violently, 
	accompanied by the celery crunch of her neck snapping. 
	Sebastian exhales, his breath filled with the 
	intoxication of power.

	INT. LABORATORY - DAY

	Frank applies pressure to the wound, waiting for Sarah to 
	return. Carter's vital signs are weakening..,.

				FRANK
			Sarah! Sarah!
				 (to Carter)
			Goddamnit. Stay with me now. Don't you 
			let up... Sarah! Sarah!

	No response. Frank doesn't know whether to stay or go 
	after her. He starts toward the door several times but 
	can't leave Carter. Finally the door opens.

				FRANK (cont'd)
			Sarah! I'm losing him.

	But it's Linda and Matt.

				FRANK (cont'd)
			Did you see her?

	Linda rushes over to check on Carter.

				LINDA
			Where is she?

				FRANK
			She went to the supply room. Carter 
			needed blood.

	Linda grabs a stethoscope and listens to Carter's heart.

				LINDA
			I said no one goes anywhere alone.

				FRANK
			She didn't listen.

	She-slowly pulls Frank's hand away from the wound.

				FRANK (cont'd)
			But...

				LINDA
			He's dead.

	Linda would love to cry about it, but doesn't afford 
	herself the luxury.

	INT. CORRIDOR

	The three of them approach the supply room door slowly. 
	Blood trickles from under the door and bloody footprints 
	extend down the hallway.

	They swing open the door.

	The floor is covered in blood and broken glass. But no 
	body.

	INT. CORRIDOR

	Sarah, broken, is dragged toward the chair, eerily 
	jerking down the hallway... seemingly on its own.

	INT. CORRIDOR

	The three scientists follow the bloody footprints down 
	the hallway past the empty cages in the tunnel of 
	habitats.

	All clutch their tranquilizer pistols.

	The footprints lead past the habitats to Sebastian's 
	chamber.

	They see Sarah's body in the dim light.

				LINDA
			Oh god. Sarah!

	The group breaks into a run. Linda pushes into the 
	chamber and falls at Sarah's side. Matt cradles Sarah's 
	head. They look for some sign of life as Linda fights 
	back the tears.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			No...

				FRANK
			Her too?

	Matt nods. Linda slams the cubicle wall with her fist.

				LINDA
			This didn't happen. This hasn't 
			happened.

				MATT
			It happened alright. Now we have to 
			deal with it.

	Matt puts his hands on her shoulder to calm her. She 
	pushes him off.

				FRANK
			Yeah? And just what are we supposed to 
			do now?

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Now? Now you die.

	The three of them whip around.

				LINDA
			He's here!

				MATT
			Where?

				LINDA
			Sebastian!

	Silence. The three cautiously move out. They stand back 
	to back, each one facing out. They move toward the door 
	of the Chamber.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Sebastian. Sebastian, listen to me.

	No response. They all their tranq pistols level waiting 
	for some sign. Hearing each other breathe. They slowly 
	move outside the Chamber into the corridor.

				LINDA (CONT1D)
			I don't know if you can understand 
			this, but what you're experiencing is 
			a psychological breakdown. This isn't 
			who you are.

	A beat.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			I would say that what I am 
			experiencing is psychological 
			awareness. I like you being in 
			complete and absolute control.

	They identify the general area the voice is coming from: 
	Back inside the Chamber! They slowly move toward the 
	Chamber door. With lightning speed they slam the door 
	shut, locking Sebastian inside the Recovery Chamber.

				LINDA
			You goddamn bastard! You goddamn 
			bastard. You're gonna pay for this. 
			I'm going to bring you back to 
			visibility and then I'm going throw 
			your ass in jail.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			You're never gonna bring me back 
			Linda. I never want to come back.

				LINDA
			Fuck you!

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Or maybe I'll fuck you. One last time 
			for old times sake.

	Linda slams her fist against the wall of the Chamber.

				MATT
			Don't listen to him. It's not worth 
			it.

				FRANK
			Come on, Matt. Let's go get the 
			elevator back on-line so we can got 
			out of this hell hole.

	Matt gives Linda a kiss...

				MATT
			He does anything, anything at all, 
			come get us. I'll be back to check on 
			you in five.

	Matt and Frank head off down the corridor.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Imagine you two, carrying on right 
			under my nose. Out of curiosity, what 
			did he give you that I couldn't?

				LINDA
			Shut up, Sebastian. He's more of a man 
			than you'll ever be.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	A VIDEO SCREEN shows Linda pacing outside the Chamber 
	door. The chair moves forward toward a microphone.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Okay, sweetie. I'll be quiet. If 
			that's what you want...

	Sebastian TOGGLES the intercom switch OFF. We pan over to 
	one of the working video screens ... Matt and Frank 
	stride down the hallway. The chair swivels and the 
	observation room door swings open slightly.

	INT. CHAMBER

	Linda still holds his tranq gun toward the door. Nothing 
	moves. Nothing. Linda walks over to the Plexiglas ... 
	stares in. Can't see anything, anyone. Just the dead 
	Sarah.

	Then she sees it. The little red light on the intercom. 
	Its on.

				LINDA
			Sebastian? Sebastian? No.. No...

	Linda bangs on the glass. She looks. No movement, no 
	nothing. She listens. Shit. She takes off running.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Matt! Frank! 

	Tracking with Linda as she rushes down the hall.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Matt! Matt! Frank!

	INT. LABORATORY - DAY

	Linda breaks in the room to see Frank slicked in blood, 
	his throat cut, and Matt bleeding from multiple stab 
	wounds with an extension cord around his neck being 
	pulled tight.

				LINDA
			Jesus!

	Linda rushes over and slams into Matt. They fall to the 
	ground. Linda crawls over to Matt, but her head snaps 
	back and her lips erupt with blood.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Figured it out? You were always so 
			clever.

	Matt's pulled back across the lab by the cord around his 
	neck. He grabs at the cord trying to breathe. Linda 
	watches him being pulled away.

				LINDA
			No!

	She clamors over to him. But Matt rises in the air and is 
	tossed against the lab table. Linda levels her dart 
	pistol and fires haphazardly at the air. She hits nothing 
	but objects jerk and move in a line as Sebastian heads 
	for cover. Linda manages to grab Matt and pull him to 
	her.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Hang on!

				MATT
			Get out of here!

	Linda pulls Matt toward the door.

				LINDA
				 (yelling)
			You won't get away with this. They'll 
			find out about you. They'll hunt you 
			down.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			The villagers with their torches? Lock 
			up your daughters! Sorry, Lin. It's 
			not gonna happen that way.

	Linda hits the lights. The lab is now very, very dark.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
			See, I've spent all my time down here 
			thinking up this plan. When they find 
			you, they'll find a pile of charred 
			corpses. The result of a terrible 
			accident, I'm afraid.

	Linda reacts to the voice as it grows nearer. She 
	navigates the maze of equipment, heading toward the crack 
	of light at the front door.

				LINDA
			How can you be so brutal?

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			I guess because I don't have to look 
			at myself in the mirror anymore
				 (beat)
			Remember that first night I was out? I 
			did something bad, just to see if I 
			could get away with it. And when I 
			did, I realized I could have it all. I 
			can kill in broad daylight. And 
			nobody's gonna tell the police they 
			were fucked by a ghost. Anything I 
			desire I can make happen, but not if 
			people know.

	Linda and Matt have reached the door of the lab. She 
	pushes through it and slams it behind her.

	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

	Linda pulls Matt along.

				MATT
			I'm dizzy. I can't feel my legs.

				LINDA
			Just keep going. I'll fix you later.

	INT. CORRIDOR, LAB DOORS - DAY

	The doors explode open.

	INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

	Linda looks up and down the hall and pulls Matt inside 
	the supply room. It's still blood soaked from earlier.

	Linda closes the door, sliding the deadbolt into place.

	Linda lots him drop like a heap onto the floor. She falls 
	to her knees beside Matt, lying on the ground.

				LINDA
			Matt... Matthew. Stay with me now. 

	Linda pulls his scrubs open. The wounds are many and 
	deep.

				MATT
			He surprised us. We weren't 
			expecting...

				LINDA
			Shhh. Don't talk.

	BAM! Something slams against the door. Bam! Slams against 
	it again. The old deadbolt is buckling. Linda looks 
	around the room and sees the storage freezer.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			We gotta move. Hang on.

	Linda helps Matt up and into the storage freezer.

	INT. STORAGE FREEZER

	Linda grabs a metal bar and slides it between two hooks 
	on the door and the jam.

	BAM! The storage room door blows open. Linda leans down 
	next to Matt.

				MATT
			Lin...

	He entire shirt is stained with blood. He's having 
	trouble breathing.

				MATT (cont'd)
			I can't feel anything.

	Linda picks up his hand. Grips it tight.

				LINDA
			You feel that?

	Matt smiles.

				MATT
			A little...

	She rips his shirt open... and sees his wounds. She grabs 
	a vial of alcohol and dumps it on her hands and then 
	probes the wound.

				LINDA
			Your losing blood, but he didn't hit 
			the vitals.

	She looks around.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Sutures and thread.

	She rises, and looks outside the porthole into the room. 
	Suddenly it fogs up and she almost sees a face. She 
	stumbles backward, and the door starts rattling. Linda 
	scrambles over to hold the metal crowbar in place. 
	Sebastian pulls and rattles on the freezer door. To no 
	avail. It's not gonna budge. Finally he gives up. The 
	door stops shaking. Linda is relieved, briefly.  Still. 
	Then she hears the click of the door locking.

	OUTSIDE THE FREEZER

	CLOSE ON THE REGULATOR as the dial turns from forty-five 
	degrees, down to negative twenty.

	INSIDE THE FREEZER

	Through the porthole, Linda sees the bloody footprints 
	heading toward the door. She removes the metal bar and 
	pushes on the door. It won't move.

				LINDA
			Goddamnit.

	Linda looks around the storage room. She grabs a roll of 
	duct tape and pulls off a length.

				MATT
			What're you doing?

				LINDA
			This is temporary.

	She takes paper towel and cleans off Matt's wound. She 
	tapes it, using duct tape.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			You still with me?

				MATT
			Barely.

	A beat later, the compressor begins pumping Arctic air 
	into the freezer.

				LINDA
			Just keeps getting worse.

	Linda returns to the door. Shakes it.

	INT. CHAMBER - DAY

	We hear WHISTLING as we see a sheet of flesh fill out 
	into a head as Sebastian slides on his latex head piece.

	INT. STORAGE FREEZER

	Linda continues shaking the door. The lock holds. A tear 
	rolls down Linda's cheek, but a strange thing happens. 
	The tear drops freeze. Linda shivers as she pulls the icy 
	tears from her face.

				LINDA
			Oh shit.

	The inside thermometer has dropped to five degrees.

	Linda grabs the metal bar and starts smashing it against 
	the porthole. The metal bar just bounces off the glass.

	INT. SEBASTIAN'S OFFICE

	A drawer opens, revealing a set of clothing neatly 
	folded. Shirt, pants, shoes. They begin to move.

	INT. STORAGE FREEZER

	Linda drops the metal bar and slides down the wall, 
	defeated.

				MATT
			There's no way out.

				LINDA
			There's got to be.

				MATT
			They say freezing to death isn't so 
			bad. You just kinda pass out.

	Matt's head rolls back.

				LINDA
			Matt! MATT!

	She checks his pulse. Thank god he still has one, but 
	he's not gonna last long. They're both already starting 
	to turn a little blue. Linda stares desperately up at the 
	shelves, trying to find some sort of advantage. Then she 
	sees something. She looks back at the door lock and then 
	she rises ... and grabs AN EXTENSION CORD coiled on the 
	shelf.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			We're not dying in here.


	INT. BATHROOM - DAY

	Sebastian, dressed in street clothes, stands before the 
	mirror applying make-up to his latex mask.

	INT. STORAGE FREEZER

	Linda finishes stripping the insulation off the electric 
	cord. 

	She grabs a hypodermic needle package, and her cold 
	fingers fumbles with the package as she tries to pull out 
	the plastic tube.

	She finally gets it out and she starts wrapping the 
	stripped electric wire around the tube in a tight coil.

	INT. BATHROOM - DAY

	Sebastian slides on a wig and checks his appearance in 
	the mirror. Pretty smooth. Even from relatively close up, 
	he could pass as normal.

	INT. STORAGE FREEZER

	Linda furiously winds wire into a coil.

	INT. CORRIDOR

	Sebastian heads down the corridor. Lingering steam twists 
	in and around the hallway, long wispy tendrils. Sebastian 
	pauses for a moment, hearing A GROWL. Suddenly the 
	hallway seems a lot scarier. From beneath his scrubs he 
	pulls his own tranq gun. He listens ... hearing scraping 
	and footsteps. Watching the water on the floor twitch. 
	With machine like precision, he turns and fires. The 
	tranq dart halts in mid-air and some invisible thing 
	tumbles over.

	Sebastian continues down the hallway.

	INT. STORAGE FREEZER

	Linda holds the plug end of the extension cord. The other 
	end is wrapped into a tight long coil. Linda looks for an 
	outlet, but can't find one. She looks at the overhead 
	lights.

	A moment later she's climbing up the shelving. She wrap* 
	a piece of fabric around her hand, and with a sharp punch 
	she smashes one of the overhead light bulbs.

	INT. LABORATORY

	Sebastian enters, fully dressed. At a distance it'd be 
	hard to tell his secret. He pulls several chemicals off 
	the shelves. Then he pulls a tray of test tubes over and 
	begins mixing.

	INT. STORAGE FREEZER

	Linda works on jerry rigging the two ends of the wire to 
	the lightbulb, socket. 
	Suddenly the coiled wire springs to life and flies 
	against the nearest metal surface. She's made an 
	electromagnet.

	INT. LABORATORY

	Sebastian loads the filled test tubes into the 
	centrifuge. Dozens of other vials are already slotted. He 
	takes one of the left over vials, considers it a moment 
	and then flings it over to the other side of the lab. The 
	vial shatters and...

	EXPLODES.

	A powerful explosion that rocks the room.

	INT. STORAGE FREEZER

	Linda feels the rumbling as she places the coil up 
	against the door. The magnet attaches itself. Linda 
	shakes the coil, trying to get the doorlock to move.

	OUTSIDE THE DOOR -

	We see the lock twitching. Shaking...

	INSIDE THE DOOR -

	Linda shivers as she plays with the coil. Her eyes glaze 
	and she stumbles backward. Her surgical scrubs, once 
	soaked with sweat, are now frozen stiff. She composes 
	herself and pushes back toward the door. Her heavy breath 
	hangs as a low cloud of Mist.

	INT. LABORATORY - DAY

	Sebastian looks over the dozens of other test tubes, 
	calculating their combined power in his mind. Then he 
	closes the top of the centrifuge. He taps a few commands 
	into its timer.

	INT. SUPPLY ROOM

	The door lock twitches again and twists back. The door 
	swings opens and Linda stumbles out, mashing into a 
	supply shelf of oxygen canisters. The canisters tumble 
	every which way as Linda tumbles to the ground.

	She scrambles to her feet and goes in after Matt, pulling 
	his cold body out of the storage locker.

	She pulls stacks of paper down from, the shelves into a 
	trashcan, grabs an industrial lighter and ignites the 
	paper. She pushes Matt close to the small bonfire. As she 
	does, the oxygen tanks catch her eye.

	INT. CORRIDOR

	Sebastian exits the lab, locking the door behind him. He 
	heads down the darkened tunnel. Something scampers in 
	front of him. Small, not visible. Sebastian sends it 
	reeling with a swift violent kick.

	INT. CORRIDOR, BY THE ELEVATOR - DAY

	Sebastian, dressed and in full latex, comes striding up 
	the tunnel. He taps a code into the elevator vault doors. 
	The vault doors open revealing the elevator.

	The doors slide open and Sebastian steps inside.

				ELEVATOR
			Authorization please?

				SEBASTIAN
			Caine. One One One One One.

				ELEVATOR
			Authorization valid. Thank you.

				LINDA
			Sebastian!

	And there's Linda. Slicked with dirt and blood. She holds 
	a oxygen container with a cut line.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			I can't let you leave. Come on out and 
			I'll give you one last chance.

				SEBASTIAN
			You said it yourself, Lin. I shouldn't 
			hold on to the past.

	The door starts to shut.

				LINDA
			Aaaaaaahhhh!

	She hits the top of a LIGHTER duct-taped to the hose. A 
	line of PRESSURIZED FIRE BLOWS into the elevator. 
	WWHHHOOOOSSHHHH! Sebastian goes up in flame. Linda runs 
	toward the elevator. Just as the door's about to close, 
	she slides. Her foot jamming into it. 
	She lets loose with the flame again. Sebastian, backed 
	into the corner, has no where to go. He's yelling in 
	pain. His latex FACE BUBBLES and burns. The surgical 
	scrubs SINGE BLACK. With no other escape route, he dives 
	toward the door. Linda looks up to see his flaming body 
	fly over her, back into the corridor. Linda kills the 
	tank as Sebastian continues to burn. The elevator lights 
	flickers and the security panel goes up in a shower of 
	sparks. The elevator dies. Linda pulls herself to her 
	feet and turns to see...

	Half of Sebastian's head MELTED AWAY, his latex facade a 
	gruesome smoke-damaged mass. His clothes are half burned 
	revealing large blistering bubbly welts underneath, like 
	deformed blackened bubble wrap.

	Sebastian crawls to his feet, but Linda hits him with 
	another shot of flame.

	Sebastian pulls at his clothes as he crawls around the 
	corner.

				SEBASTIAN
			Oh God!

	Linda stalks toward him.

				LINDA 
			You wanna see God? I'll show you God. 

	Linda turns the corner to see a heap of smoldering latex 
	and clothing strewn about the corridor floor. Sebastian, 
	looking like some ugly creature, pushes down the 
	corridor. He throbs with his blackened skin blistering 
	and cracking up and down his body. Linda lets loose 
	another jet of flame. It's smaller than the first and 
	doesn't quite hit Sebastian. Linda checks the tanks 
	pressure gauge. It slowly drops. Linda follows the 
	blackened horror into the maze of tunnels. But as he 
	pushes along the corridor, his burns slowly re- absorb 
	themselves. Sebastian is no longer visible. A quiet 
	moment in the hallway as Linda realizes how vulnerable 
	she is. She looks around for him desperately. Nothing. 
	But something on the ceiling catches her attention. She 
	blasts it with the last jet of her dying torch. THE 
	SPRINKLER SYSTEM, hit by fire, comes to life. Water 
	sprays down on the tunnel. Sebastian is caught in the 
	downpour, his invisible frame outlined by water. It comes 
	toward her, the hot skin steaming in the water. He grabs 
	Linda and slams her against the wall. His watery hand 
	smashes her across her face. Linda reels. On the floor, 
	she looks to see Sebastian stalking toward her. She 
	crawls away, but he grabs her by her hair, pulls her to 
	her feet and slams her against the wall.

				SEBASTIAN
			I'm gonna find everyone in your family 
			and kill them-. Your sister... she 
			never liked me. I think I'll go after 
			her and her little boy first. 

	Sebastian smashes her head against a metal post. Her head 
	cuts open, blood dripping down.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			I just wanted you to know that before 
			you die.

	Linda collapses to the floor. Sebastian's foot presses 
	against her neck, squeezing it. Linda gags for breath. 
	But through the shoot of water that is Sebastian, we see 
	something also... a watery smudge.

	BAM!

	MATT - smashes Sebastian with the metal bar. Sebastian 
	slams against the corridor wall and sinks down.

	Matt staggers. It's taken all his strength to got there. 
	He drops the crowbar and seeks the wall for support, he 
	sinks to his knees by Linda.

				MATT
			Thought I'd... thought I'd save you 
			for a change.

	He gives her his hand and pulls her up into his arms.

				MATT (cont'd)
			Let's got out of here.

	Just as the two turn, Sebastian rises with the crowbar. 
	He swings it with a yell. Matt pushes Linda out of the 
	way, his arm glancing the blow into a conduit. The 
	conduit splits open and severs ELECTRICAL wiring. The 
	VOLTAGE shoots up the crowbar and into Sebastian. As the 
	current pulses through his body, Sebastian vibrates. His 
	blood vessels yank back to visibility, followed by his 
	skeletal structure and major organs. Sebastian is slowly 
	electrified. Smoke pours off him and he becomes more and 
	more visible. Finally he collapses. His body throbbing in 
	and out of visibility. Matt and Linda stumble away.

	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

	Just outside the lab... Linda tries to pry open the 
	sealed doors with the crowbar. But she can't.

	Through the doors porthole she sees a collection of 
	chemicals and the fire raging from the earlier explosion.

				LINDA
			Nitro...

	Matt peaks inside.

				MATT
			He said it himself... All they'll find 
			is a pile of charred corpses.

	She sees the centrifuge... The timed counter on its face 
	counts down from a minute. Fifty nine. Fifty eight. Fifty 
	seven...

				LINDA
			He's rigged the centrifuge.

				MATT
			In an enclosed space, he'll wipe out 
			the whole lab.

	INT. TUNNEL

	Linda and Matt move as fast as they can. They reach the 
	burned out elevator. What the hell are they gonna do? We 
	know the damn thing doesn't work. She swings her crowbar 
	at the ceiling. The maintenance hatch comes down.

				LINDA
			Grab on.

	Linda hooks the crowbar onto the hatch lip and pulls 
	herself up. She reaches back down for Matt.

				MATT
			Forget about me. You go.

				LINDA
			Fuck you. Give me your hands.

	Linda grabs Matt's hands and pulls for all she's worth. 
	She struggles, but they both manage to got him through 
	the hatch.

	INT. LABORATORY - DAY

	Three... two... one. The centrifuge springs to life.

	The centrifuge spins the two dozen vials slowly at first.

	INT. VENT

	Linda and Matt are on top of the elevator.

	Linda's hands search the wall. Bar fingers run across the 
	smooth metal surface.

	From the little light below she can see a maintenance 
	ladder that spans the entire height of the vertical tube. 
	They look up and see it disappear into the darkness.

				LINDA
			Climb!

				MATT
			But...

				LINDA
			Climb!

	Matt starts up, rung after rung. Linda climbs right 
	behind him.

	INT. LABORATORY

	The centrifuge spins faster and faster. The vials are 
	starting to rattle.

	INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT

	Linda and Matt pull themselves up the ladder as quick as 
	they can.

				MATT
			I can't. I'm going to pass out.

				LINDA
			Keep moving.

	He does, through sheer force of will. Blood from his 
	wound drips down on Linda's face. No telling how much 
	further they have to go in this darkness. Light leaks in 
	from the maintenance hatch below.

	INT. LABORATORY

	The centrifuge's whine has reached a fevered pitch. The 
	vials shake violently.

	Then... one of the vials shatters.

	A FLASH OF LIGHT. A HUGE EXPLOSION rips through the 
	laboratory.

	INT. TUNNEL

	The EXPLOSION rips through the lab doors. A MASSIVE 
	FIREBALL rolls down the tunnel swallowing everything in 
	its path.

	One of the phase shifted animals gets caught in the 
	flames. We see its shape briefly before it disappears In 
	a wall of fire.

	INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT

	The ladder begins to shake. The entire shaft begins to 
	rumble. Linda pushes Matt up as they scramble toward 
	safety.

	INT. EXHAUST VENT

	The FIREBALL blows into the vent. Starts rolling down it 
	also.

	INT. TUNNELS

	More explosions.

	CHAIN REACTIONS. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

	THE EXPLOSIONS rolls toward the OPEN ELEVATOR. Slamming 
	into it... The elevator flies upward.

	INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT

	The rumbling worsens. The two desperately cling to the 
	ladder. They looks down to see...

	The elevator...

	SURROUNDED BY FLAMES flying up toward them, lifted by the 
	explosion's SHOCK WAVES.

				LINDA
			Oh God!

				MATT
			Don't look.

	The carriage accelerates toward them, faster and faster. 
	Its loose cables whip around the shaft, slapping the 
	walls around the pair. Its gonna hit them! Linda pulls 
	herself close to the ladder and closes her eyes. She's 
	pressed against Matt. The elevator... 50 feet... 40 ... 
	30 ... W0000000SH! It flames RIGHT BY THEM. 
	When Linda opens her eyes, the elevator is HUNDREDS OF 
	FEET ABOVE THEM and a wall of fire is below them, closing 
	in.

				LINDA
			Move!

	Panicked, Linda pushes Matt up the ladder as she stares 
	down at the rising fire wall. But the fire dissipates 
	before it hits them, though a stray tongue of flames 
	reaches up to lick the soles of her feet.

	They hear a terrifying moan and looks up to see the 
	elevator peaking far above her. It slows to a stop and 
	BEGINS TO FALL.

				MATT
			It's coming down!

	FASTER AND FASTER. Coming back toward them in complete 
	free- fall. It's emergency brakes clamp down, slowing it. 
	Metal against metal. Sparks flying. One of the brakes 
	shears. Then another. The elevator unseats from it's 
	tracks, SLAMMING against the walls as it TUMBLES. Linda 
	sees that the elevator is out of control, and watches as 
	it ping-pongs toward them... smashing into the access 
	ladder, smashing into the wall. The elevator slows, but 
	continues slamming side-to-side. Linda cringes as the 
	elevator crashes into the wall above them. But it jams 
	there, stopping. They pull their heads away from wall and 
	look up. The elevator just hangs there, suspended. 
	There's a small crawlspace between the elevator and the 
	ladder.

				LINDA
			C'mon. Before it slips.

	They begins to climb up again. Matt shimmies through the 
	tight hollow, and squeezes out the other side, followed 
	by Linda. She breathes a sigh of relief and just hangs 
	there a moment when ... Ah! Something grabs her. A singed 
	throbbing hand emerges from the darkness, gripping at her 
	leg.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			It's him.

	She kicks at it and sees a dark dirty face - a swirl of 
	dirt, grime and smoke with hollow eyes - rise up the 
	ladder.

				MATT
			Sebastian, you fuck.

				LINDA
			Get off me.

	Sebastian pulls himself up Linda's body. Translucent 
	dirty hands paving at the fabric of her clothes. Linda 
	tries to climb with this thing on her. But Sebastian 
	grabs her around the neck. She begins choking for breath. 
	Linda fights to keep her grip on the ladder... She looks 
	down at the ten foot drop to the elevator and then... She 
	lets go!

				MATT
			No!

	She and Sebastian plummet through the smoky haze and slam 
	against the top of the elevator. Linda seems to hover a 
	few above the elevator, Sebastian's shadowy outline below 
	her. Matt painfully lowers himself down the ladder. But 
	metal groans and the elevator drops another five feet. 
	Linda struggles to her feet. Sebastian rises. A menacing 
	dark figure stalking toward her. Linda pushes back from 
	him. Sebastian grabs her by the hair and pulls bar over 
	to the ladder. The elevator strains and groans.

				LINDA
			Let go of me.

	Sebastian presses her up against the ladder. Presses into 
	her from behind. He has her trapped. His dirty hand 
	reaches out and strokes her hair.

				SEBASTIAN
			Remember the day we met? You were 
			wearing a red dress and you were so 
			pretty. Now... Now look at you.

				MATT
			Get off of her!

	Sebastian pulls her hair back and kisses her neck with 
	his filthy, dirt-smeared mouth and half-burned away face.

				MATT (cont'd)
			Sebastian, stop it.

	Linda and Sebastian struggle. Matt reaches down to try 
	and grab her, help her.

				SEBASTIAN
			You fucked it all up.

	Linda looks at her feet. The last elevator emergency 
	brake grips its cable. She grits her tooth and grabs hold 
	of the ladder.

				LINDA
			Go to hell. 

	Linda stamps on the brake release. The ELEVATOR TUMBLES 
	... along with Sebastian. It slams into the fiery abyss a 
	hundred yards below. Linda hangs, one hand holding onto 
	the ladder, the other holding onto Matt. Matt pulls her 
	back onto the ladder, using all his remaining strength.

	EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

	Linda and Matt stumble out into the blazing sunshine. 
	Emergency crews close from all directions, sirens 
	roaring. A trail of smoke drifts higher and higher into 
	the sky.

	An ambulance pulls up next to them and the paramedics hop 
	out, immediately putting a blanket around her and 
	treating Matt's wounds.

				MARINE GUARD
			What happened?

				LINDA
			We lived.

	Linda looks over her shoulder at the traces of the ruin 
	and she sees a shimmer of heat rising from the ground... 
	almost as if something was there.

          ADAM COLEMAN (late 30s, good-looking, sweet-natured face) is
          in a great mood as he packs a SUITCASE.

          LILY (O.S.)
          Ready for the wildest bachelor
          party of all time?
          LILY (early 30s, shirt and jeans, hot in a smart and classy
          sense) walks in the room, smiling.

                         ADAM
          You know it. I'm gonna bang all
          sorts of chicks this weekend!

                         LILY
          That's not the answer I was looking
          for.

                         ADAM
          Sorry, honey.
          Adam gives his beautiful fiancee a playful kiss.
          She shows him some PHOTOS.

                         LILY
          Look what I found...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.

                         ANGLE: PHOTO
          A BUNCH OF TEENAGERS and 20-SOMETHINGS PARTY IN A LARGE HOT
          TUB at a SKI RESORT. It looks like the most fun ever.

                         ADAM
          Check out that young stud. Can you
          believe he's about to get married?
          Lily and Adam look through more PHOTOS of a YOUNG ADAM (17)
          partying at a SKI RESORT with his FRIENDS:
          -- In full 80s SKI GEAR on a mountain...
          -- Eating PIZZA at "Papa Enzo's," stuffing their faces...
          -- Drinking BEERS at the "Brew Haus," an awesome pub...
          -- In the HOT TUB with SIX GIRLS...
          Adam snatches the last photo from her.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          Ignore that one. Nothing happened.

                         (BEAT)
          I love you.
          Lily laughs.

                         LILY
          Adam, you didn't know me yet.
          As Adam goes back to packing, Lily leafs through some more of
          the photos. She stops at one and her EXPRESSION CHANGES.

                         LILY (CONT'D)
          Who's this?
          Lily shows Adam a PHOTO:
          -- A SMOKING HOT SKI BUNNY (23, blonde, svelte, leg warmers).

                         ADAM
          I'm not sure.

                         LILY
          Really?
          Lily shows Adam another PHOTO:
          -- YOUNG ADAM with his arm around the SKI BUNNY, who looks
          like she was ambushed for the photo.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         ADAM
          Oh! Jennie.

                         LILY
          Who's Jennie?

                         ADAM
          She's nobody. Ski instructor.
          (off her look)
          You didn't know me yet.
          Lily still looks at him a little hard.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          Lily, I was 17. She had boobs and
          a face. Of course I'm gonna take
          her picture.
          Lily still looks a little bothered.

                         LILY
          Do you still think of her?

                         ADAM
          Of course not! I think of you.
          As Adam goes to EMBRACE her:

                         LILY
          Hold on...
          Lily goes into the CLOSET.

                         ADAM
          Sweetie?
          She comes out a moment later with a CARDBOARD BOX, which she
          empties onto the BED. About FIFTY PORNO MAGAZINES spill out,
          ranging from TITS MONTHLY to BLACK ASS.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          How did you know where I hid my...
          treasure?
          Lily carefully picks up a BROCHURE from the pile, holding it
          by the corner, not wanting to touch it.

                         LILY
          Explain this.
          From ADAM'S POV, we see the brochure:
          -- A ski brochure featuring Jennie on the cover.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

                         ADAM
          OK! You caught me! I
          occasionally... reminisce... about
          Jennie O'Keefe!

                         LILY
          That's gross.

                         (THEN)
          What's "occasionally?"

                         ADAM
          (without missing a beat)
          About two hours ago when you were
          on the phone with your mother.

                         LILY
          Jesus. Tell me how I'm supposed to
          let you go to your bachelor party
          and not be a basket case?

                         ADAM
          What are you so worried about?

                         LILY
          I'm worried that you're still
          thinking about this girl.

                         ADAM
          Baby, the girl in that picture was
          nothing more than a crush. I could
          never get her and there's no
          possibility I'll ever be with her.
          She was a total stranger.
          Lily gets a CURIOUS LOOK on her face.

                         LILY
          So... you're into strangers?

                         ADAM
          Well not the creepy "your mom was
          in an accident, now come with me"
          kind. But yeah, the hot lady in
          the supermarket kind of stranger.
          You have to admit - it's kinda hot.

                         LILY
          So you're saying if you and I
          didn't know each other, it would be
          pretty hot if we fooled around?

                         ADAM
          You kidding me? It would be
          fucking incredible.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.
          Lily smiles seductively, as Adam starts to get it.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          Wait a minute. Are you
          suggesting... yes. YES!
          Adam excitedly heads for the door.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          OK, I'll go down the hall. You get
          into character.
          (points at her)
          This fucking rules.
          Adam leaves the room and Lily REMOVES HER SHIRT, talking sexy
          and slowly building the fantasy...

                         LILY
          Oh I'm all alone in this big house.
          Cheerleading camp just ended and I
          need to get out of these sweaty
          clothes...

          ADAM (O.S.)
          Love where you're going with this,
          baby! Keep it up!
          She unbuttons her pants and SLIDES DOWN HER JEANS.

                         LILY
          Mmmm. My panties are so tight
          against my firm naked body...

          ADAM (O.S.)
          You should probably take them off!

                         LILY
          Are you gonna let me do this?

          ADAM (O.S.)
          Sorry! Continue! You were just
          about to take off your panties!
          She slowly slides out of her panties, kicking them away. Now
          she's TOTALLY NAKED. She continues to role play.

                         LILY
          It feels so good to be so naked. I
          hope no one can see me...
          Just then a BLACK MAN (late 30s, handsome, J Crew) saunters
          through the bedroom door, holding a coffee and all riled up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

                         BLACK MAN
          OK, so this asshole in front of me
          at the donut place is -- WHOA!
          Lily covers up and SCREAMS.

                         LILY
          Get out of here!!
          He SPILLS the coffee on his hands and their rug as he turns.

                         BLACK MAN
          Fuck! Ow! I'm sorry. I'll clean
          it up. That's gonna stain, though.

                         LILY
          Just leave!
          He heads for the door, just as:
          Adam comes in, wearing a MAILMAN hat and NOTHING ELSE.

                         ADAM
          Special delivery for -- Jesus
          Christ!
          The black man doesn't know which way to look. He covers his
          eyes and drips coffee, as he blindly steps toward the door.

                         BLACK MAN

                         (NOT LOOKING)
          Just tell me when I'm in the clear.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - DAY

          Adam wheels his suitcase down the front path of this modest,
          well-kept suburban home, as a recovered, dressed, embarrassed
          and somewhat shell-shocked Lily follows with a small bag.
          They both stop 10 yards short of a RANGE ROVER, where the
          black man, NICK, waits in the car, waving.

                         LILY
          I can't wait for you to come back
          and marry me. Wow, that's crazy.
          Adam looks almost like it just hit him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.

                         ADAM
          Yeah.

                         (REALIZATION)
          Wow.

                         LILY
          Tell me again I have nothing to
          worry about.

                         ADAM
          Babe, look at Nick...
          In the car, Nick air drums to whatever's on the radio.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          You think with him in charge, we're
          gonna get into any kind of trouble?
          We'll probably eat too much pizza
          and I'll twist my ankle getting off
          the ski lift.

                         LILY
          OK. Have an awesome bachelor
          party. Not too awesome.
          (hands him bag)
          I got you something.
          Adam looks in the bag.

                         ADAM
          Sandwich. Thanks.
          He puts it in his BACKPACK. She looks like she was expecting
          a different reaction, but she lets it go. He kisses her.

                         LILY
          Let me see your phone.
          He takes it out.

                         ADAM
          I told you, I'll call you when--
          She snatches it out of his hands. Adam looks confused, as
          she pockets the phone.

                         LILY
          Despite my anxiety, I'm not gonna
          be one of those women who wants an
          update every ten minutes. Even
          though I do want an update every
          ten minutes.
          Adam smiles. Lily looks a bit trepidatious.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.

                         LILY (CONT'D)
          Just make sure whatever happens,
          you're back for the rehearsal
          dinner.

                         (SHOWING CONCERN)
          I totally trust you.

                         ADAM
          You should. I'm a lame-o.

                         LILY
          Well at least you're a cute lame-o.
          Lily leans in and they NUZZLE their noses together in a
          disgusting display of affection. A FLASH goes off.
          From the car, Nick holds up his iPhone.

                         NICK
          I'm more than willing to forget
          about earlier, but this shit's
          going on Facebook.

          INT. NICK'S CAR - DAY - DRIVING

          Nick drives through SUBURBIA, while Adam rides shotgun.

                         NICK
          I have no idea what Facebook is.
          My phone has a button that says
          Send To Facebook. I've been
          sending shit there for months.
          Adam looks out the window, smiling.

                         ADAM
          I'm so psyched about this weekend!

                         NICK
          Ditto, buddy. I'm gonna help you
          make up for all the good times you
          missed when you were being a
          responsible member of society.

                         ADAM
          You're a good friend. I'm sorry
          for putting my career and self
          sufficiency above bowling night.

                         NICK
          This trip represents everything
          awesome about being a dude.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

                         NICK (CONT'D)
          We're gonna drink too much, eat
          whatever we want...

                         (FANTASIZING)
          I might not even change my socks.

                         ADAM
          Live the dream.

                         NICK
          Best of all, we don't have to
          answer to anyone.
          Nick's PHONE rings and he answers it with his built-in
          BLUETOOTH. His phone voice is a little more "sensitive."

          NICK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D)
          Hi honey.

          COURTNEY (V.0.)
          Three goddamn bags of pretzels?

          NICK (ON PHONE)
          (trying to save face)
          I'm with Adam, honey.

          COURTNEY (V.0.)
          Hi Adam.
          (a little calmer)
          Nick, what have I told you about
          buying snacks that aren't on sale?

          NICK (ON PHONE)
          You said not to do it.

          COURTNEY (V.0.)
          And what did you do?

          NICK (ON PHONE)
          I bought three bags of pretzels.
          But I'm gonna eat them...

          COURTNEY (V.0.)
          That's not the point.

                         (ADMONISHING)
          Don't do it again.
          Nick and Adam exchange an embarrassing glance.

          NICK (ON PHONE)

          OK.

          COURTNEY (V.0.)
          Call me from the road. Adam, say
          hi to Lily.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

          ADAM (ON PHONE)
          OK, I sure wi--
          CLICK. For a moment, there is an uncomfortable silence.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          Don't her parents own the
          supermarket?

                         NICK
          The whole damn chain.

                         (THEN)
          Just be thankful Lily doesn't have
          any family money. Nothing makes
          your dick softer.

          EXT. MOTEL -- DAY

          Nick's car pulls into the lot of a rundown motel.

          INT./EXT. NICK'S CAR - DAY

          Adam looks confused and slightly nervous.

                         ADAM
          This looks like a place where
          people die. Mostly from murder.
          A BALD, miserable-looking GUY in his late 30s (LOU) exits a
          room, carrying TWO SHOPPING BAGS. He gets in the back seat.
          Adam looks happy to see him.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          Lou!

                         LOU
          Yes, I'm living in a transient
          motel. Let's get that purple
          elephant out of the room.

                         ADAM
          Dude, it looks nice.

                         LOU
          Thank you. I hate your guts.

                         ADAM
          (re: the bags)
          What'd you bring?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.

                         LOU
          All my belongings.

                         NICK
          So you're sorta like a bum now,
          huh?

                         LOU
          In a sense.

          INT. NICK'S CAR - DAY - DRIVING

          Lou sits in the backseat, voraciously eating a bowl of
          cereal, as the other guys are up front.

                         LOU
          Our system is fucked, gentlemen.
          You tell me how a whore wife can
          fuck some black dude - no offense -
          and still take her cuckold of a
          husband for all he's got.

                         NICK
          Why would I take offense to that?

                         LOU
          It's offensive.

                         NICK
          Because he's black?

                         LOU
          And because he's fucking my wife.
          And because you're black. And
          because of all the oversensitive
          horrible garbage... you know what?
          Forget no offense. Just offense.
          Are you offended?

                         NICK
          Not really.

                         LOU
          Then shut the fuck up.

                         ADAM
          She's got a hell of an attorney.

                         LOU
          Yes and thank you so very much for
          giving her the referral.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.

                         ADAM
          She told me it was for a friend.

                         NICK
          So... what? Your wife likes black
          dick now?

                         LOU
          I'm gonna slaughter you in your
          sleep tonight.

                         ADAM
          (turns to Lou, genuine)
          Thanks for coming, man.

          EXT. UPSCALE APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

          Nick's car pulls up across from a nice apartment building, as
          a well-dressed, well-groomed, overly polished-looking YOUNG
          GUY in his 20s (JACOB) comes out, carrying a MESSENGER BAG.

          INT. NICK'S CAR -- SAME TIME

          The guys watch Jacob carefully cross the street.

                         LOU
          Oh, Adam's stupid brother's coming?
          Boo! Drive away before he gets in
          the car!

                         ADAM
          Be nice. I know Jacob's kind of a
          douche, but I'm trying to be closer
          to him since Mom died.
          Jacob gets in the back next to Lou.

                         LOU

                         (VERY INSINCERE)
          Hey buddy! How's it going? Good
          to see you!

                         JACOB
          You look dirty and you smell bad.

                         LOU
          You look gay and you smell like a
          basket of fancy soaps. Advantage
          me.

                         JACOB
          How is that to your advantage?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

                         ADAM
          He's not gay. He's just... what
          are you again?

                         JACOB
          Metrosexual.

                         LOU
          You have sex with trains?

                         JACOB
          For your information, I fuck
          chicks. Hot ones.

                         LOU
          For your information, you fuck
          dudes. Gay ones.

                         JACOB
          Yeah, well at least I'm young and
          my life's full of potential. I
          hear you're homeless now?

                         LOU
          (to Nick and Adam)
          You told him?!

                         (GRIMACES)
          I hate all you people.

                         ADAM
          Will you two please shake hands and
          make up? We're gonna be spending a
          lot of time together.
          Jacob distractedly TEXTS on his phone.

                         JACOB
          Yeah, about that. Why aren't we
          going to Aspen? Vermont's lame.

                         ADAM
          It's gonna be fun.

                         JACOB
          Yeah, whatever.
          And with that, the guys travel in silence for a few moments,
          the lifeblood drained from the car. Finally...

                         LOU
          I've gotta take a shit.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.

          INT. BURGER KING REST STOP - DAY

          Lou walks from the bathroom back to the TABLE where Adam,
          Nick, and Jacob sit and eat.

                         LOU
          That was an ugly experience.

                         NICK
          I don't wanna hear about it.

                         LOU
          In a few years, when I'm dying of
          an exotic disease that causes my
          penis to bleed until it falls off,
          someone remember to tell the
          hospital to check out the filthy
          crapper at the Albany Rest Stop.
          It's the AIDS monkey of toilets.
          The guys put down their sandwiches.

                         ADAM
          Thank you.

                         LOU
          I don't know how you're doing it,
          man. I mean, Laurie's hot, don't
          get me wrong.

                         ADAM

                         (CORRECTING)
          Lily.

                         LOU
          Right. Lily. But one vagina?
          Forever?

                         ADAM
          That's the sacrifice.
          Jacob nods, agreeing with Lou's concern.

                         JACOB
          And you're OK with that? I don't
          know your sexual history, but you
          sure you got it out of your system?

                         ADAM
          I did OK for myself.

                         LOU
          He didn't do that well for himself.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         NICK
          Yeah, isn't Lily your fourth?

                         ADAM
          Fifth. Thank you.

                         JACOB
          So you're averaging like one girl
          every eight years.

                         ADAM
          Assuming I got laid when I was
          zero.

                         LOU
          That would be awesome.
          Adam gives Lou a distasteful look.

                         ADAM
          I'm fine. Maybe some cold feet,
          but that's normal. Thank you
          everyone for your concern.

                         JACOB
          Just looking out for you. That's
          what brothers do, right? They look
          out for each other?

                         ADAM
          (takes a moment)
          Is this about something else?

                         JACOB
          Forget it.

                         ADAM
          No, let's do this. I'm sorry I
          wasn't around when you were growing
          up, OK? I was in college. And
          then I was working. Dad left.
          Someone had to take responsibility.

                         LOU
          Boooooring!

                         ADAM

                         (TO LOU)
          Shut up.

                         JACOB
          I said forget it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

                         NICK
          Guys, come on. Let's move past it.
          This is gonna be a fun weekend.

                         JACOB
          I still say Vermont sucks.

                         LOU
          You're confusing Vermont with
          yourself. This weekend is going to
          be incredible and you will not ruin
          it for me.

                         ADAM
          (softens, to Jacob)
          You might like it. Havenhurst is
          pretty awesome.
          Jacob shrugs, but Lou gets excited.

                         LOU
          Fuck yeah it is! We're gonna ski
          the trail and bone some tail!

                         ADAM

                         (LAUGHS)
          You'll have to bone some of that
          tail for me, man.

                         LOU
          Fuck that. You'll bone your own.

                         ADAM
          No I won't.

                         LOU
          Adam, trust me. Biggest mistake of
          my life - not fucking a whore at my
          bachelor party.

                         NICK
          That's the biggest mistake of your
          life?

                         LOU
          Fuck yeah. And he's not making
          that same mistake.

                         ADAM
          Uh... I'm not having sex with
          anyone this weekend.
          Lou looks at Adam, trying to figure things out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.

                         LOU
          Ohhhh. I gotcha.

                         (WINKING)
          You're not having sex this weekend.

                         ADAM
          I'm not having sex this weekend.
          Without the winking.

                         LOU

                         (WINKING)
          Right. No winking.

                         (WINKS AGAIN)
          I understand.

                         ADAM
          I'm pretty sure you don't.

          INT./EXT. NICK'S CAR - DAY - DRIVING

          Nick's car transitions from the HIGHWAY to the MOUNTAINS to
          the WOODS, as we track the drive.
          Finally, the car passes a "Welcome to Havenhurst" sign.

                         NICK
          Gentlemen... welcome to Havenhurst.

                         ADAM
          Yes!

          EXT. HAVENHURST MAIN DRAG - AFTERNOON

          The car winds through the main thoroughfare. Rather than a
          quaint ski town, this place resembles a suburban nightmare,
          with STRIP MALLS and CHAIN RESTAURANTS. It's the exact
          opposite of the fun town we saw in Adam's photos.

          INT./EXT. NICK'S CAR - AFTERNOON - DRIVING

          The guys look out the windows, wearing bummed expressions.

                         JACOB
          so this is the coolest town ever?

                         ADAM
          Oh man. The Brew Haus is a PF
          Chang's.
          Lou notices a TGI Friday's, with a sign advertising a "Hannah
          Montana 3-D Experience!" He looks utterly disgusted.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.

                         LOU
          I don't even have the heart to tell
          you what I just fucking saw. But
          say goodbye to Papa Enzo's. This
          town sucks.

                         NICK
          What the fuck is going on?
          The car climbs a twisty part of the road.

                         NICK (CONT'D)
          Please god let it still be there...

                         JACOB
          What?

                         ADAM
          Pink Paradise. Best strip club
          ever.
          The car rounds the corner and a SIGN comes into view. The
          beginning reads "Pink."

                         NICK
          Yes! It lives!
          The car continues to climb and the whole sign comes into
          view: "Pinkberry."

                         LOU
          I wanna die.

                         JACOB

                         (OBLIVIOUS)
          Sweet, there's a Pinkberry here.

          EXT. PINE VALLEY INN - AFTERNOON

          The car pulls into the parking lot of this RUNDOWN lodge.

          INT. PINE VALLEY INN / LOBBY - AFTERNOON

          The guys walk in and the first thing they notice is a bunch
          of CATS that wander anywhere they want.
          The large "living room" area off the lobby features a FIRE
          PLACE that has been BRICKED SHUT.
          TODDLERS and ELDERLY PEOPLE lounge and cry and nap.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.

                         LOU

                         (TO NICK)
          What have you done to us?

                         ADAM
          I'm not playing drinking games with
          my grandma.

                         NICK
          OK so the place skews a little
          older. Let's check in. We're not
          spending our time inside anyway.

          INT. PINE VALLEY INN / HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

          The guys walk silently behind a MIDDLE-AGED BELLHOP (PHIL),
          who struggles to wrangle their bags on a shaky hand truck.
          His job is made more difficult because he only has ONE ARM.
          He grunts and curses his way down the hall on the slow and
          laborious journey. But when Adam tries to pick up a bag...

                         PHIL

                         (CURT)
          Hey buddy. I'm not gonna tell you
          again. I fuckin' got it.
          Adam backs off.

                         LOU
          This guy's a dick.

                         NICK

                         SHH--

                         LOU
          No, fuck that.

                         (LOUDER)
          He's a dick. Oooh tough guy. He's
          gotta be Mister America.

                         JACOB
          Captain America.

                         LOU
          Go fuck yourself.
          Phil finally drops their bags at their room and then:

                         PHIL
          I'm ready to be tipped.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.

                         LOU

                         (SELF UNAWARE)
          You, sir, have no tact.
          Nick gives Phil a bill and he walks off down the hall,
          leaving the guys outside their room.

                         NICK
          Gentlemen... in this room lies the
          beginning of our awesome weekend.

                         JACOB
          Or a continuation of everything
          that's sucked so far.

                         LOU
          Yeah, I bet it's gonna be lame as
          shit in there. The furniture
          probably smells like mold.

                         JACOB
          I say we go to Foxwoods.

                         LOU
          I actually kinda like that idea.

                         ADAM
          Guys!
          Everyone looks at Adam.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          Let's give it a chance. We don't
          know for sure that the room sucks.
          Nick nods, appreciating the optimism. He opens the door:

          INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - AFTERNOON

          The room SUCKS. The ancient furniture looks like it smells
          like mold and there is nothing redeemable about the place.

                         ADAM

                         (SHRUGS)
          OK, so now we know.
          The guys drag their bags in and depressingly take stock of
          the situation -- presently the dirty old room.

                         JACOB
          What the hell is with this place?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.

                         LOU
          It's like a Stephen King novel,
          except not as cool.

                         NICK
          We'll feel a lot better once we hit
          the slopes.

                         (SMILES)
          Plus, I know there's one thing to
          look forward to.

          EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - AFTERNOON

          On a patio outside their suite, our guys stare at a KICK-ASS
          TOP OF THE LINE HOT TUB. Spacious seating, plenty of jets,
          underwater lighting. It's amazing.
          Adam, Nick, and Lou look energized.

                         LOU
          Thank. God.

                         ADAM
          At least some things never change.

                         JACOB
          What's the big deal about a hot
          tub?

                         ADAM
          Shame on you.

                         NICK
          There's plenty of time for tubbin'.
          Let's ski.

          EXT. MOUNTAIN - AFTERNOON

          At the top of the mountain, Adam, Nick, and Lou look
          ridiculous in TIGHT, RETRO-STYLE NEON SKI JUMPSUITS. Jacob,
          on a snowboard, is the only one dressed in current attire.

                         JACOB
          (re: their outfits)
          When's the last time you guys
          actually went skiing?

                         ADAM
          It's been a few years.

                         NICK
          I think we look good.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

                         JACOB
          Then you're an idiot.

                         NICK
          All right, we race down the
          mountain. Loser buys first round.
          Premium shit only.

                         JACOB
          You gonna be all right?

                         NICK
          What does that mean?

                         JACOB
          I dunno - do black dudes ski?

                         NICK
          Of course black dudes ski. Aren't
          I wearing skis?

                         JACOB
          I'm just not sure you're
          representative.

                         NICK
          You're calling me an Uncle Tom?

                         JACOB
          I don't even know what that means.

                         NICK
          It means black dudes ski.
          (pulls down goggles)
          Catch ya at the bottom.
          Nick takes off and... gets about 15 FEET, before he hits a
          GRASSY PATCH and falls over.

                         LOU
          Black dudes don't ski.

                         ADAM

                         (MOCK YELLING)
          How's the bottom?

          ADAM HITS A BAD PATCH AND FALLS DOWN.

          23.

          JACOB AND LOU COLLIDE, BOTH TRYING TO AVOID A BARE PATCH.

                         CUT TO:

          NICK PICKS UP SPEED, BEFORE HITTING A BARE PATCH AND FALLING.

          A LITTLE OLD LADY SLOWLY SKIS PAST HIM, KICKING UP POWDER.

          EXT. HAVENHURST MAIN DRAG - NIGHT

          Nick wears his "going out clothes" and walks along the main
          drag talking into his PHONE. It is clear that he is being
          CONSTANTLY INTERRUPTED on the other end of the conversation.

          NICK (ON PHONE)
          No, the black ones... without the
          pleats... Because the pleats make
          me look fat... No, I put it on the
          Amex... Because I'm the best man...
          I know, but I'm organizing... I'm
          gonna get cash fr-- I'm gonna get--
          I'm gonna collect cash from the
          guys... Yes... Yes... Yes.

                         (LONG PAUSE)
          I love you too.
          Nick hangs up and we see that Adam, Lou, and Jacob have been
          walking with him, listening to his end of the conversation.

                         ADAM

                         (SYMPATHETIC)
          Dude...

                         NICK

                         (CLAPS HANDS)
          OK, who's ready to sink their teeth
          into a delicious dinner?

          INT. P.F. CHANG'S - NIGHT

           Our four guys looks MISERABLE, as they sit around a table at
           this popular Chinese food chain restaurant. Their
          overzealous WAITER (AIDEN) makes a big production of MIXING
          SAUCES, like he's Emeril.

                         AIDEN
          You fellas look like you can handle
          some spice. I'm gonna knock it up
          a bit... throw some chili sauce in
          there... oh yeah, there it is.
          This is gonna knock your socks off.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.
          Nick's expression looks like he wants to kill the guy.

                         NICK
          Thank you.
          The waiter walks away and Nick RAISES HIS GLASS in a toast.

                         NICK (CONT'D)
          I'd like to propose a toast. To my
          best friend, Adam. He may be
          throwing his life away, but at
          least he's throwing it away with a
          hot chick at his side.
          The guys LAUGH and clink glasses.

                         NICK (CONT'D)
          And so what if you only have one
          vagina for the rest of your life.
          Speaking as someone who's seen your
          wife's vagina -- it's definitely
          one of the good ones.
          Lou and Jacob look confused, but clink glasses anyway, as
          Adam mouths "What the fuck" to Nick.
          Jacob raises his glass.

                         JACOB
          To my brother, I say thank you for
          including me. I promise to try to
          make the most of it.
          The guys look confused at the backhanded graciousness.

                         ADAM
          Thanks for coming, man. It means a
          lot to me.
          Jacob nods halfheartedly.

                         NICK
          To Adam!

                         GUYS
          To Adam!
          The guys hug and clink glasses and excitedly CHATTER. Just
          then, a MANAGER appears at the table and CLEARS HIS THROAT.

                         MANAGER
          Gentlemen. You're going to have to
          keep it down.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         25

                         NICK
          Come on, man. It's our friend's
          bachelor party. We're just trying
          to roast him a little bit.

                         MANAGER
          Well if you like roasts, I suggest
          the roast peking duck. It's out of
          this world and as I'm sure Aiden
          has told you, he can make it quite
          spicy.
          The guys look bothered.

                         MANAGER (CONT'D)
          But as for the noisy kind of roast,
          that's going to have to stop. We
          have many other guests trying to
          enjoy the P.F. Chang's experience.
          The manager walks away. For a moment, the guys are quiet.
          Lou takes a bite of his food, chewing slowly.

                         LOU
          This kung pau chicken pairs very
          nicely with the 97 cab. Very
          impressive choice, Nick.

                         NICK
          Thank you.

                         LOU
          Also, this is the worst bachelor
          party I've ever been to.
          Everyone puts down their forks, cathartically fed up.

                         JACOB
          Totally agree.

                         ADAM
          Nick, look. You had great
          intentions. No one's blaming you.

                         LOU
          I'm blaming him.

                         JACOB
          I'm totally blaming him. I didn't
          even want to go skiing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

                         NICK
          OK I'll admit this trip is not off
          to the best start. But we're due
          for a victory!
          Nick thinks and actually gets an idea. He SNAPS his fingers.

                         NICK (CONT'D)
          Hot tub!
          A lightbulb goes off for Adam too.

                         ADAM
          Yes!
          Lou gets up and throws down his napkin.

                         LOU
          Why did we even bother with dinner?
          Adam and Nick get up too.

                         JACOB
          Guys, I'm still hungry.

                         LOU
          Quiet, men are talking.
          Aiden approaches.

                         AIDEN
          Get you guys some to-go boxes?

                         LOU
          I would like you to die. And then
          I would like you to leave.
          Aiden walks away, freaked out. Lou turns back to the guys.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          It's tub time.

          EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - NIGHT

          Lou, Adam, and Nick all have HUGE SMILES, as they gaze at the
          tub. They each hold a TON OF BOOZE.
          Jacob looks indifferent and a little turned off by it all.
          Lou strips down to his underwear and CLIMBS IN.

                         LOU
          Oh my god. The water is perfect.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.
          He POURS A VODKA and SLAMS IT BACK.
          Adam climbs in with Lou, pouring his own drink.

                         JACOB
          I really don't see the appeal.
          It's like a glorified bath.

                         NICK
          Jacob. Son. The hot tub is the
          whole thing! You ski all day.
          Then you hit the town, get trashed,
          and lure some fine ladies back to
          the lodge for some good old
          fashioned tubbin'.
          Nick CRACKS A BEER and pats Jacob on the back.

                         NICK (CONT'D)
          So the town's dead? Fine, we skip
          that part and go right to the tub.
          Trust me. If there's fun to be
          had, the tub is a good start.
          Nick gets in.

                         NICK (CONT'D)
          Yes! It's amazing.
          Now it's just Jacob outside the hot tub. The other three
          guys are already starting to look more energized and happy,
          splashing around. After another beat of consideration...

                         JACOB
          Fuck it.
          Jacob strips down and gets in. As he submerges, he actually
          starts to loosen up a bit and smiles.

                         LOU
          Well?

                         JACOB
          I'm not convinced this is anything
          more than a bath, but it's nice.

                         NICK
          Hit him with some bubbles.

                         ADAM
          Coming right up.
          Adam CRANKS A KNOB. As the BUBBLES comes to life, we begin a
          TUBBIN' MONTAGE over Reel 2 Real's "I Like to Move It."

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.
          -- In the tub, the guys DRINK like fish, pouring various
          combinations of VODKA, RED BULL, MOUNTAIN DEW, BACARDI, and
          anything else they can get their hands on.
          -- Jacob's LAPTOP is propped on the edge of the tub, playing
          BETTER OFF DEAD. Every so often, one of our guys takes a
          drink, playing a game, the rules of which only they know.
          -- Adam takes a big bite of the SANDWICH Lily gave him.
          -- Nick uses his iPhone to take video and pictures.
          More drinking games. The guys wear funny HATS and roll
          dice on a PIECE OF WOOD. Adam has to drink some tub water.
          -- The guys keep reaching into ADAM'S BACKPACK for MIXERS.
          -- Nick, Adam, and Lou LAUGH. Then, Lou lifts up Jacob's
          head, which he has been FORCIBLY HOLDING UNDER WATER. Jacob
          coughs and spits out water and looks pissed. Then he smiles
          and helps submerge Nick's head in the same way.
          -- Slam! Another bottle of vodka killed. Crush! Another
          empty Red Bull his the patio.
          -- A BEAR eats some DORITOS that have been left on a PICNIC
          TABLE. Yards away in the tub, the guys laugh and taunt it.
          -- Lou BLEEDS from where the bear has obviously SCRATCHED HIM
          across the chest. Still, he dances in the tub.
          -- Just for an instant (did we see that?), the guys are 3
          BLACK GUYS and ONE WHITE GUY, before changing back.
          -- The guys wear their SNOWSUITS in the tub. Adam very
          dangerously jumps in, attached to a SNOWBOARD.
          -- The CUTS get QUICKER and QUICKER, as hands reach into the
          backpack. More vodka. More Dew. More Red Bull. More
          Bacardi... The cuts SPEED UP and INTENSIFY until finally in a
          BRILLIANT FLASH OF LIGHT, we

                         EXPLODE TO:

          THE SUN RISING JUST ABOVE THE MOUNTAIN PEAKS.

          EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - DAWN

          As the light of a new day spills into Havenhurst, we find all
          four of our guys PASSED OUT in the hot tub, the water calm.
          A KITTEN licks Lou's face. It's adorable. Until...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.
          Lou JOLTS AWAKE and PUKES ON THE KITTEN, sending it FLYING!
          This wakes up everyone and they stir to life, inspecting the
          carnage, mostly hangover-related.

                         NICK
          Oh my god, I wanna die.

                         JACOB
          I need a vitamin water.
          Adam reaches in his backpack, taking out two choices.

                         ADAM
          Red Bull or Fresca?
          Jacob takes the Fresca, as Lou inspects the CLAW MARKS.

                         LOU
          That fucking bear got me good.

                         ADAM
          Yeah he did.

                         LOU
          But we showed him, didn't we?

                         ADAM
          If by showing him, you mean we
          laughed and he got bored and
          wandered off into the woods with
          your sneakers, then yeah, we got
          him good.

                         LOU
          Fuck yeah.
          Lou picks up Adam's half-eaten sandwich and takes a BITE.

                         ADAM
          You just puked.

                         LOU
          That's why I'm eating your
          sandwich. I'm fucking starving.

                         NICK
          Guys, look...
          Their gaze turns to the MOUNTAIN PEAK, on which is a fresh
          LAYER OF POWDER. It looks like perfect skiing conditions.

                         ADAM
          Let's do it!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

          EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

          As the guys walk across the front of the lodge, they pass
          some well preserved CARS all parked together: a 1985 Pontiac
          Fiero, a 1986 VW Golf, and a 1987 Ford Mustang coupe.

                         JACOB
          What is this, a shitty car club?
          The guys COMPLETELY MISS the BILLBOARDS ACROSS THE STREET:
          -- "Coming soon: the most spaced-out Mel Brooks film yet!

          SPACEBALLS!"
          -- A surfing MAX HEADROOM with a CAN OF COKE and the tag:
          "Catch the Wave!"
          -- A bull terrier named SPUDS MCKENZIE parking with some HOT
          BABES and a shitload of BUD LIGHT.

          EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY

          In QUICK CUTS, the guys hit the slopes:
          -- In his ridiculous snowsuit, Nick skis down the mountain.
          With the new snowfall, he expertly glides along.
          -- Jacob applies some LIP BALM and flies down the mountain on
          a SNOWBOARD. People glare at him with confused expressions.
          -- Adam uses the snowplow method to slowly descend. He's a
          beginner skier. He takes the time to look at the
          surroundings and notices a YOUNGER, HOTTER CROWD skiing
          today. Lots of BLONDE SKI BUNNIES wearing PASTEL colors.

                         ADAM
          Well this place has improved.
          -- In the lift line, Lou passes a GUY wearing a BIG HEADBAND.

                         LOU
          Really, asshole?

          INT. GONDOLA - DAY

          Adam shares a gondola with Nick, as they make their way up
          the mountain. A DUDE IN SUNGLASSES sits across, napping.
          Adam takes a FLASK out of his backpack. He and Nick look
          over their shoulders like scheming kids as they take a nip.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.

                         ADAM
          I'm really glad we stayed. It's
          gonna be good to get away for a
          couple of days.

                         (QUALIFYING BEAT)
          I mean not like I want to be away
          from Lily. You know.

                         NICK
          Believe me I know.

                         ADAM
          I love her. But you guys are
          right. I'm gonna be with her for
          the rest of my life.

                         NICK

                         (NODS)
          For the rest of your goddamn life.

                         ADAM
          It gets easier, right? No offense,
          but watching you talk with Courtney-

                         NICK
          You're gonna be fine. You'll
          settle in, get the premium cable
          package - the usual deal.
          Adam nods.

                         NICK (CONT'D)
          You'll wake up every morning,
          comforted by the fact that your
          wife doesn't wield her family's
          wealth over your head like a
          hangman's noose.
          Adam looks concerned, as Nick wistfully goes on...

                         NICK (CONT'D)
          You'll breathe the air of life,
          making the occasional decision -
          maybe get some lawn furniture. How
          about steak for dinner? Yes, let's
          get that juice machine I saw on TV.
          Let's fucking go for it.
          Nick stares off into the distance.

                         ADAM
          Nick?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.

                         NICK
          Sorry, I lost myself there.

          DUDE IN SUNGLASSES (O.S.)
          Coke?
          Adam and Nick look at the guy across from them, who presently
          offers his SKI GOGGLES, on which is a mountain of COCAINE.

                         NICK
          That is a lot of cocaine.

                         ADAM
          I feel like we're in Scarface.
          Only with skiing.

                         (THINKS)
          Skiface.

          DUDE IN SUNGLASSES

                         (SNIFFS)
          Take it. It's good shit.

                         NICK
          I'm gonna pass.

                         ADAM

                         (DECLINES)
          Yeah, I'm good.
          The dude removes his sunglasses. He has a dead look in his
          eyes, studying Nick and Adam.

          DUDE IN SUNGLASSES
          You guys a couple of spazzes?

                         ADAM
          Spazzes?

          DUDE IN SUNGLASSES

                         (VERY ANGRY)
          Yeah, dipstick. You narcs? You
          Miami Vice? Which one's Crockett?
          Which one's CROCKETT?!

                         ADAM
          I'm Crockett, obviously!

                         (TO NICK)
          That's the Don Johnson one, right?
          The dude flips out a SWITCHBLADE.

          DUDE IN SUNGLASSES
          You show me you're not spazzes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

                         NICK
          We're not spazzes.
          The dude extends the coke once more.

          DUDE IN SUNGLASSES
          Show me.

          EXT. MOUNTAIN / TOP - MOMENTS LATER

          At the top of the mountain, Nick looks WIDE AWAKE. Adam, on
          the other hand, looks COKED OUT OF HIS SKULL. He sniffs,
          fidgets, clenches his jaw, and looks generally "up."

                         NICK
          Adam, you gotta chill. You just
          did one line.

                         ADAM
          I've never ridden the horse before.

                         NICK
          You're not riding the horse. The
          horse is heroin.
          Adam can't stop moving and fidgeting.

                         ADAM
          I don't know what kind of animal
          I'm riding, but it's the best
          animal of all time. I feel great!
          Adam uses his SKI POLES to push off the top of the mountain
          and he goes FLYING DOWN THE SLOPE.

                         NICK
          Adam! Jesus.

          EXT. MOUNTAIN / SKI TRAIL - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          Adam TUCKS down, still CLENCHING HIS TEETH. He PICKS UP
          SPEED as he flies down the mountain like a racer.

          FURTHER UP THE MOUNTAIN
          Nick has to pull up and slow down in the name of safety.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

                         ON ADAM
          He zips along, never changing course or slowing. He BARELY
          MISSES a few TREES. But he can't stop himself before --

          HE BARRELS INTO A SMOKING HOT CHICK!
          The collision knocks Adam and the girl to the ground and
          finally stops Adam's hyper-speed descent.
          Adam gets up and shakes the cobwebs.

                         ADAM
          What a rush!
          He notices the girl on the ground and goes to help her up.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          Oh wow, are you OK?

          SMOKING HOT CHICK
          No thanks to you, asshole!

          IN SLOW MOTION --
          The girl stands up in a very hot and awesome manner, SHAKING
          THE SNOW from her luxurious blonde hair. It twinkles in the
          sunlight. As she turns to face Adam,
          NORMAL SPEED RESUMES. And he sees who it is:

                         ADAM

                         (MIND BLOWN)
          Jennie O'Keefe!
          Jennie squints at Adam, trying to place him.

                         JENNIE
          Do I know you?
          He stares at her, not believing what he's seeing. He still
          looks loopy from the coke.
          Just then, a a too-blond, mirror-sunglass-wearing, feathered
          hair, striped-jumpsuited guy (BLAINE) SKIS UP and GRABS ADAM.

                         BLAINE
          I'm gonna serve you a knuckle
          sandwich, airhead.

                         (TO JENNIE)
          You all right, babe?

                         JENNIE
          I think so.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.
          Blaine's TOADIES (TAD and CHAZ) ski up behind him, as Blaine
          ANGRILY RIPS Adam's lift ticket from his jacket.

                         BLAINE
          Your lift ticket's been revoked.
          Blaine throws it on the ground and laughs to his friends.

                         ADAM
          (a la Lethal Weapon 2)
          Diplomatic immunity.
          Blaine looks confused, as Adam RIPS Blaine's lift ticket, but
          he ends up RIPPING BLAINE'S JACKET too.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          Sorry, I was trying to... you can
          probably patch that up.
          Blaine PULLS Adam close by the collar and clenches his fist.

                         BLAINE
          You're dead meat, scumbag.
          Just then, SNOW POWDER flies in Blaine's face. Blaine lets
          go of Adam, as Jacob snowboards up and stops short, coming to
          his brother's side.

                         JACOB
          There you are! My brother's had a
          few too many triple Venti nonfat
          lattes if you know what I mean.
          (genuine, to Adam)
          Are you OK?
          Adam nods. Blaine looks confused. CHAZ and TAD look
          enamored with Jacob.

                         CHAZ
          Dude, they let you bring a
          skateboard on the mountain?

                         JACOB
          It's a snowboard. You know - no
          wheels.

                         TAD
          Genius! Man, not to get all fag on
          you, but I'm digging your fresh
          threads, bro.
          Adam and Blaine look equally confused with what's going on.
          Jacob takes the compliment well, like he deserves it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

                         JACOB
          Thank you. It's mostly North Face.
          A little EMS.

                         CHAZ
          Whatever it is, it works.

                         TAD
          Totally. What are you doing with
          this boner? You should be skiing
          with us. Like permanently.
          Blaine looks really annoyed with his friends.

                         BLAINE
          Guys!

                         TAD
          I mean, that's if Blaine thinks
          it's cool and everything.
          Blaine takes a deep breath, annoyed.

                         BLAINE

                         (TO JACOB)
          Get your spaz brother out of here.
          And for his sake, I don't wanna see
          him back on my mountain.

                         CHAZ

                         (EAGER)
          You're welcome any time though!
          Adam picks up his BACKPACK, which fell off during the
          collision. He stares at Jennie again and smiles.

                         ADAM
          You look JUST like this girl. I
          had the biggest crush on her--
          Blaine grabs the bag out of Adam's hand and SHOVES ADAM away.

                         BLAINE
          This is mine now.
          Adam looks at Blaine angrily, but Jacob holds him back.

                         JACOB
          Come on. Let's just go.
          Jacob ushers Adam off the slope, as Blaine shoulders the bag.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

          INT. PINE VALLEY INN / LOBBY - DAY

          Adam and Jacob walk in the front door. Gone are the children
          and old people. The living room off the lobby presently
          hosts what appears to be an amazing 80s RETRO PARTY. A radio
          plays Miami Sound Machine's "Conga."
          Girls and guys wear printed sweaters, feathered dos, and neon
          leggings. It's something out of a mid-80s Aspen photo shoot.
          Nick walks in behind them, looking as confused as them. He
          turns up his palms and shakes his head, at a loss for words.

                         ADAM
          What is going on?
          Lou strolls up to the guys, with his arms around TWO HOT
          CHICKS. He looks elated.

                         LOU
          Guys! I'm so glad you're here. I
          want to introduce you to Michelle
          and Sandy. These lovely ladies are
          having a roller skating party next
          weekend and no offense, but fuck
          your wedding -- I'm totally coming
          back. By the way...
          Lou rolls out a ZIPLOCK BAG full of cocaine.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          There's coke everywhere around
          here. This place rules!
          Lou dips into the coke and rubs it on his gums and we:

                         CUT TO:

          INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - LATE AFTERNOON

          The suite looks a little "fresher." The furniture is the
          same, but everything's in better shape. It looks almost new.
          Adam, Jacob, and Lou sit in the main room with the TV on, as
          Nick emerges from a bedroom.

                         JACOB
          Has anyone else noticed that things
          around here are weird as shit?
          Adam and Nick nod. Lou shakes his head.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

                         LOU
          Don't you ruin this. If you wake
          me from this dream, I'll kill you.

                         ADAM

                         (IGNORING LOU)
          What do you think happened?

                         JACOB
          I have no idea, but look...
          Jacob turns up the VOLUME on the TV. The NEWS airs.

          NEWSCASTER (ON TV)

          I'm ruined!

          NEWSCASTER (ON TV)
          In other news, the Tower Commission
          has rebuked President Reagan for
          not controlling his national
          security staff in an arms-for-
          hostages deal with Iran...
          For a moment, the guys sit there in stunned silence. Then...

                         LOU
          (with genuine emotion)
          We're in 1971.

                         ADAM

                         (CORRECTING HIM)
          We're in 1987.
          Everyone looks stunned and dazed.

                         JACOB
          What are we gonna do? I have plans
          next weekend.

                         ADAM
          We all have plans. It's my fucking
          wedding!

                         NICK
          Now hold on, we don't know for sure
          that we're in 1987.
          The TV shows a (real) COMMERCIAL for the COMMODORE 64
          computer, with a JINGLE that SINGS: "Are you keeping up with
          the Commodore, 'cause the Commodore's keeping up with you..."

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.
          When it's over...

                          NICK (CONT'D)
          OK, we're in 1987.
          Adam stands up, completely losing it.

                         ADAM
          What the FUCK is going on?!
          Nick stands up and calmly takes charge.

                         NICK
          Everyone relax. I think I know
          what's happened. And when we're
          done discussing it, we're all gonna
          feel a lot better.
          Everyone looks to Nick, who seems to have the answer.

                         NICK (CONT'D)
          Two words: black hole.
          He lets it hang in the air for a moment, as if it's suddenly
          going to gel for everyone. But the guys look confused.

                         NICK (CONT'D)
          I saw a special on the Science
          Channel. And guess what?
          Sometimes this happens.

                         ADAM
          This happens?

                         NICK
          Yes. And the best thing for us to
          do is to stay put. The universe
          will eventually reverse itself and
          work out this little glitch.
          Nick sits down, looking satisfied in his know-it-all-ness.

                         ADAM
          This is a big glitch.

                         JACOB
          Yeah, you're an idiot. Black holes
          are in space. Not at a ski resort.

                         LOU

                         (HOPEFUL)
          So does this mean we get to go to
          girls' locker rooms and see them
          naked and they can't see us?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.

                         JACOB
          No, we traveled through time.
          We're not invisible.
          Lou looks upset.

                         LOU
          (under his breath)
          I'm still gonna do it.

                         ADAM
          Guys, ignoring the ridiculousness
          of how we got here for a moment--

                         NICK
          Black hole.

                         ADAM
          How are we supposed to get back?
          For a moment, everyone sits and absorbs the question. Then:

                         LOU
          We find a scientist.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. IBM / RECEPTION - LATE AFTERNOON

          Our guys WAIT NERVOUSLY near a RECEPTION DESK, above which is
          the "IBM" logo. Lou reads a MAGAZINE.

                         LOU
          This Dukakis guy seems like he
          might be the real deal.
          An affable MAN IN A SUIT approaches.

          MAN IN SUIT
          Gentlemen, how may I help you?

                         NICK
          We're waiting for a scientist.

          MAN IN SUIT
          I am a scientist.

                         LOU
          Where's your white coat?

                         SCIENTIST
          I'm not that kind of scientist.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.
          Lou stands up and throws down his magazine.

                         LOU
          This is bullshit! I told you--

                         ADAM
          Wait a minute. Just tell him.

                         NICK
          OK. You tell him, Adam.

                         ADAM
          Sir, we...

                         (EMBARRASSED)
          This is ridiculous.

                         SCIENTIST
          Nothing's too ridiculous in the
          name of science.

                         JACOB
          We're from the future.

                         SCIENTIST
          Get the fuck out of here.

          EXT. IBM OFFICE PARK - LATE AFTERNOON

          A SECURITY GUARD escorts our guys out of the building.

                         ADAM
          That went well.
          Lou starts walking off by himself.

                         NICK

                         (TO LOU)
          Where are you going?
          Lou points to his watch.

                         LOU
          Five o'clock. Happy hour.
          The guys look at him, confused.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          If it's '87, the PF Chang's will be
          gone, which means the Brew Haus
          still stands.

                         (THEN)
          It's Saturday. They have wet T-
          shirt contests on Saturdays.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.
          The guys' eyebrows raise. After a moment:

                         ADAM
          Well, maybe one drink. Just to
          confirm.

          INT. BREW HAUS - HAPPY HOUR

          SPLASH! A WET T-SHIRT CONTEST is underway on a STAGE.
          Whitesnake on the juke, PAC MAN on the tables, and cheap
          beers in the mugs - this is an amazing brew pub.
          Our guys sit in the back, wearing PINE VALLEY LODGE shirts.
          There are MANY EMPTIES on the table and they look VERY DRUNK.
          In a roped-off area in the corner, a cocky YOUNGER PHIL (the
          one-armed bellhop) wields a CHAINSAW that he uses to carve an
          ICE SCULPTURE, impressing the bar crowd. He has BOTH ARMS.

                         NICK
          Holy shit. It's that bellhop.

                         JACOB
          Should we warn him?

                         ADAM

                         (COVERS EYES)
          I don't want to see this go down.
          Phil TOSSES THE CHAINSAW IN THE AIR and...
          He expertly CATCHES IT, seamlessly continuing to carve. A
          GIRL leans in and gives him a kiss.

                         LOU
          Fuck that guy.
          ON THE STAGE, TWO GIRLS compete for wettest t-shirt. They
          both decide that NO T-SHIRT is the wettest option.

                         NICK
          God bless our country.

                         ADAM
          (in a daze)
          We're in 1987.

                         JACOB
          You can stop saying that. I don't
          think it's making a difference.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

                         ADAM
          Seriously, we have to get back.
          (kinda losing it)
          We seriously have to get back!
          The guys subdue Adam, as a BIG-HAIRED WAITRESS brings drinks.

                         WAITRESS
          Here ya go, guys. Three Buds, one
          Bartles and James.
          The guys all stare at her like she's a museum artifact.

                         WAITRESS (CONT'D)
          What? I have lipstick on my teeth?
          Nick sips his WINE COOLER, feeling the eyes of the others on
          him.

                         NICK
          Hey, if it's available, I'm
          ordering it. I always wanted one
          of these when I was little.
          The waitress puts down the CHECK. Jacob picks it up,
          realizing something.

                         JACOB
          (to the waitress)
          Can you give us a second?
          She walks away, as Jacob turns to the guys.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          This is gonna be a problem.
          He takes out his wallet, showing his CREDIT CARDS and CASH.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          Guys, we're in trouble. Our cards
          aren't gonna work and our new money
          looks fake.
          The guys look concerned, but then Nick notices something:

          A TABLE FULL OF JAPANESE BUSINESSMEN.

                         NICK
          I've got an idea.
          As Nick gets up and approaches the businessmen, Adam looks
          around the room and by the bar, he spots --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.
          Jennie.
          He stares at her from across the room. Lou and Jacob notice.

                         ADAM
          I still can't believe it's really
          her!

                         LOU
          She's aged remarkably well.

                         (REMEMBERS)
          Oh, right. Why don't you just go
          talk to her?

                         ADAM
          I should go talk to her. To
          apologize, of course. You know,
          nothing inappropriate.

                         LOU
          Sure...
          Adam GETS UP. He slowly makes his way over across the room.
          Jennie is talking to TWO OTHER GIRLS as Adam approaches. He
          lurks near them like a creep. Jennie eventually notices him,
          as he keeps stealing glances. She doesn't look happy.

                         JENNIE

                         (TO ADAM)
          Listen putz, if you're gonna try to
          attack me again, my boyfriend will
          be here soon. He'll kick your ass.
          Adam tries to be casual.

                         ADAM
          No, no. No ass kicking. I just
          wanted to say I'm sorry about
          earlier. I lost control of the old
          skis there.

                         (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
          Looks like I shoulda taken another
          one of your classes!

                         JENNIE
          When did you take my class?

                         ADAM
          Certainly not when I was a kid! I
          mean, that would make no sense!
          Adam tries to recover.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          I was here for a convention. Power
          tools. And regular tools. All
          sorts of tools. I'm big into
          tools. It was a couple years ago.
          Jennie looks very suspect of Adam.

                         JENNIE
          Yeah, OK. Have a good night.
          Jennie starts to walk away with her friends.

                         ADAM

                         (TOO FRIENDLY)
          Hey, where ya going?
          She ignores him, but one of her friends quietly lags behind.

                         JENNIE'S FRIEND
          (quietly, to Adam)
          Are you with that guy over there?
          She discretely points out Jacob.

                         ADAM
          Yeah, he's my brother.
          She takes Adam's PALM and writes something on it.

                         JENNIE'S FRIEND
          There's a party later tonight at
          this address. Make sure he comes
          with you. He's way boss!
          Adam walks back to his friends.

                         JACOB
          How'd it go?
          He shows them his palm.

                         ADAM
          We got invited to a party later.

                         LOU
          sweet! What are we gonna do until
          then?

                         ADAM
          How about figure out how the hell
          to get back to the present day?
          Nick walks back to the table and SLAMS down a pile of CASH.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.

                         NICK
          Bam!

                         LOU
          We're millionaires!

                         NICK
          Close. It's a thousand bucks.

                         ADAM
          Where did you get that money?
          Nick points out the Japanese Businessmen.

                         NICK

                         (PROUDLY)
          Sold them my iPod.
          Jacob looks incredulous.

                         JACOB
          That was NOT a good idea!

                         LOU
          I agree. You left so much money on
          the table. It's a fucking iPod!
          You could've gotten a LOT more!

                         JACOB
          That's not what I--

                         ADAM
          (looking at watch)
          Fellas, we are not making progress
          and we're losing time.

                         NICK
          Adam, don't worry. Time's not
          moving forward in the future.

                         JACOB
          Uh, yeah it is. Lest we forget the
          lessons learned from Bill and Ted.

                         NICK
          Well then I give you Back to the
          Future.

                         JACOB
          That's not fair. You can't go
          right to Back to the Future.

                         NICK
          Why not?

          Back to the Future had a time
          machine.

                         NICK
          Well so did Bill and Ted.

                         ADAM

                         (REALIZES)
          Wait, that's it! I can't believe
          I'm about to say this, but I think
          we have a time machine.

                         NICK
          Adam, all we did is get drunk in
          the hot tub.
          Everyone's EYES GO WIDE.

                         LOU
          (puts it together)
          A hot tub time machine.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - EARLY EVENING

          All four guys soak in the tub. They TOAST with drinks.

                         ADAM
          Here goes nothing!
          They simultaneously DOWN their drinks. Nothing happens.
          Like the chimps in 2001, each of them begins FIDDLING WITH
          KNOBS and PUSHING ON LIGHTS, trying to find the magic button.
          After a few moments:

                         NICK
          Well, it was worth a shot.
          ANGLE WIDENS to reveal other PEOPLE in the tub. A GUY AND
          GIRL make out, two STONERS pass a joint, and one TOPLESS
          CHICK just chills out.

                         LOU
          (stares at girl)
          I love this place.
          As Lou pours himself another, Adam starts to lose it again.

                         ADAM
          Guys, we're running out of ideas
          here!

          48.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          I mean we tried the scientist, the
          tub -- what the fuck do we do next?
          Lou DOWNS ANOTHER SHOT and gets a crazy look in his eye.

                         LOU
          I know what we do next.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. PARKING LOT - EARLY EVENING

          A DELOREAN is parked in the empty lot. Adam, Nick, and Jacob
          look at it, drunkenly and bleary-eyed. Adam and Nick trade
          swigs from a BOTTLE OF WHISKEY.
          The gull wing door opens and Lou steps out, in a foul mood.

                         LOU
          Rental car agency fucked us!
          There's no flux capacitor.
          Lou pulls Jacob over and straps him in the driver's seat,
          before walking around to the passenger side.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          (to Adam and Nick)
          We'll travel to 2010. Then one of
          us will come back and get one of
          you. And so on and so forth.

          INT. DELOREAN - EARLY EVENING

          Lou sits in the passenger seat next to Jacob.

                         LOU
          Go light on the clutch. I don't
          wanna lose our deposit.
          Jacob starts the car.

          EXT. PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

          Adam and Nick watch the car pull out of the parking lot.

                         ADAM

                         (SOBERING SLIGHTLY)
          This will not end well.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.

          INT./EXT. DELOREAN - SAME TIME

          Jacob and Lou hit the road, picking up speed. They pass a
          COP, who pulls out, turning on his LIGHTS AND SIREN.

                         LOU
          Oh shit, they found me! I don't
          know how but they found me!

                         (LAUGHS)
          I always wanted to say that. Punch
          it!
          Jacob HITS THE GAS.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          Let's see the look on this pig's
          face when we hit 88 and disappear
          into thin air! Yeah!
          The SPEEDOMETER hits 75, 80, 85, and then 90. And then 95.
          The car SHAKES VIOLENTLY.

                         LOU (CONT'D)

                         (SURPRISED)
          This thing's a piece of shit.
          Up ahead, the ROAD CURVES DRASTICALLY.

                         JACOB
          Hey Lou?

                         LOU
          Yeah?

                         JACOB

                         (VERY CALM)
          We're doing a hundred. I can't
          control this car.

                         LOU

                         (NODS)
          I hear ya.

          EXT. ROAD - EARLY EVENING

          The Delorean BRAKES, but doesn't make the turn. It FLIPS
          OVER in a fantastic disaster and comes to a stop in a DITCH.
          The COP pulls over, gets out of his car, and DRAWS HIS GUN.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

          EXT. PARKING LOT - EARLY EVENING

          Adam and Nick watch the accident from a distance.

                         ADAM
          So do you think we should run away?

          INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Looking ragged as hell, the four guys walk into the room and
          silently collapse on various BEDS and COUCHES.

                         LOU
          I wonder if we'll still be here for
          our court appearance.

                         ADAM
          If we're still here in four months,
          I will happily go to jail, because
          I'll be fucked anyway.
          A GUY walks out of the bathroom, wearing only a TOWEL. He
          looks startled.

                         TOWEL GUY
          Who the hell are you dweebs?!
          Lou is up IN A FLASH. He IMMEDIATELY DECKS THE GUY OUT COLD
          and PUMMELS HIM on the floor! The others pull him off.

                         NICK
          Jesus Christ, what the hell, Lou?!

                         LOU
          I have no tolerance for intruders.

                         NICK
          This is probably his room! We're
          not registered here in 87.
          Lou thinks for a moment and looks a "little" sorry.

                         LOU
          I'm still pretty OK with it.

                         ADAM
          You have a problem.

                         LOU
          Just help me put him outside.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.

          INT. PINE VALLEY INN / HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

          The guys open the door to the suite and find TWO DUDES
          walking by. Adam stops them.

                         ADAM

                         (AWKWARDLY)
          Hey. Dudes. Our friend's...
          hellaciously wasted. He partied
          pretty hearty... to the max. To
          the extreme max.

                         DUDE #1
          Bodacious.

                         ADAM
          So you guys wanna fuck with him or
          what?

                         DUDE #2
          Excellent.
          The dudes take custody of the passed out TOWEL GUY and
          continue on down the hall, as our guys go back inside.

          INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - NIGHT

          The guys look physically exhausted.

                         NICK
          Let's just go to sleep. We'll
          figure everything out in the
          morning. It's pretty late.
          Jacob checks his watch, rolling his eyes.

                         JACOB
          It's 8:45.
          The other guys look at their watches, surprised.

                         NICK
          Why am I so wiped out?

                         JACOB
          Because you're old and lame?

                         LOU
          Yeah, fuck that, we're going to
          that party!

                         ADAM
          We are not going to the party.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.

                         LOU
          Hear me out.
          Lou paces around the room like Patton addressing the troops.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          We saw the scientist. He was
          worthless. We tried the tub. Dead
          end. I got us a fucking time
          machine. From Hertz. It might as
          well have been a Nissan.
          Adam shakes his head, as Lou continues.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          Gentlemen, it's fucking 1987.
          Nixon's in the White House, gas is
          free, and we're about to put a man
          on the moon!

                         ADAM
          Did we go to the same school?
          Lou turns and addresses Adam directly.

                         LOU
          The point is you haven't even met
          your wife yet! She can't fault you
           for shit that went down 23 years
          ago! Even if 23 years ago somehow
          ends up being tonight!
          Adam starts listening a little more closely, as some of Lou's
          logic actually makes "some" sense.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          It's time to start facing the fact
          that we may not be going home. And
          if that's so, then we owe it to
          ourselves to make the best life we
          can for ourselves.
          The guys listen intently, as Lou's speech reaches a
          passionate climax.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          Because I don't want to be that
          college freshman who spends the
          first semester hiding in his dorm
          room, only to realize that come
          spring, he has no friends.

                         (MORE PASSIONATE)
          No!

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.

          LOU (CONT' D )
          I want to be that college freshman
          who fucks chicks way out of his
          league before they have an
          opportunity to realize he's not as
          cool as he's pretending to be!
          Nick nods. Even Jacob smiles.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          Are you with me?

                         ADAM

                         (CONFUSED)
          I don't know.

                         LOU
          Close enough. We'll talk some more
          at the party.

          INT. HOUSE PARTY - NIGHT

          It's like the 80s exploded. Music, clothes, hair, attitude --
          it's all on overdrive. In one section, PARTY-GOERS marvel at
          DUCK HUNT, while in another area, people make out and dance.
          Adam, Nick, Lou, and Jacob walk in the front door. They have
          updated their "looks" with 80s sweaters and other era-
          appropriate attire. They all look ridiculous, except for
          Jacob, whose youth lends him hipster appeal.

                         ADAM
          This sweater makes me look like a
          jerkof f .

                         LOU

                         (BREATHES DEEPLY)
          It's good to be home.
          In a corner, Phil puts his ARM in a SHARK TANK. Just as the
          shark goes to bite, he PULLS HIS ARM OUT, unscathed. A small
          crowd claps. Our guys are confused and upset.

                         NICK
          Was this like an 80s thing?

                         LOU
          If he doesn't lose that arm soon,
          I'm gonna take it from him myself.
          With that, Lou wanders off toward another room, leering at
          and groping girls as he goes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.

                         ADAM

                         (RE: LOU)
          He's gonna be a problem.
          Tad and Chaz walk over, looking dapper and douchey. They are
          excited to see Jacob.

                         TAD
          Hey, glad you could make it!

                         ADAM

                         (ANNOYED)
          This is your party?

                         CHAZ
          Hey man, no hard feelings, all
          right? If your bro says you're
          cool, then we're cool.
          Tad puts his arm around Jacob and leads him into the party.

                         TAD
          There's some people I want you to
          meet. By the way, bodacious hair.
          Incredibly chic.

                         JACOB

                         (FLATTERED)
          Oh yeah? It doesn't really take
          that much product. It's all in the
          layering.

                         TAD
          Whoa. Product. You're blowing my
          mind right now. Did you spend time
          in Europe?

                         CHAZ
          Don't tell me. Prague. Do you
          want some coke?

                         JACOB
          Do you have Coke Zero?

                         TAD
          Ah, a conscientious objector. I
          like that. Gotta stay sharp.

          IN THE KITCHEN
          Nick mixes something in a large bowl, as plenty of EAGER
          PARTY-GOERS look on. He pours a red liquid into a tray of
          CUPS. An attractive PARTY CHICK follows his every move.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.

                         NICK
          These will be ready in 15 minutes.

                         PARTY CHICK
          (putting it together)
          So it's like jello. With vodka.

                         NICK
          Mmm hmm. You get drunk while you
          enjoy a delicious gelatin snack.

                         PARTY CHICK
          How come no one ever thought of
          this before?

                         NICK
          Don't know. I just invented it.
          Party chick looks into his eyes, dreamily.

                         PARTY CHICK
          I appreciate you.

                         NICK
          (way too heartfelt)
          I love you.

          IN THE LIVING ROOM
          Lou PLAYS AN ELECTRIC KEYBOARD for about 15-20 people. He's
          performing Ace of Base's "The Sign" and SINGING PASSIONATELY.
          Adam walks up to where Jacob aims a large VIDEO CAMERA.

                         JACOB
          He did a bunch of drugs and went on
          a rant about how much he resents
          Ace of Base.

                         ADAM
          That band's from the 90s.

                         JACOB
          I know. He made me borrow Tad's
          video camera. He wants to document
          the performance and sue the band
          for infringement when we get back.
          Adam sees Tad and Chaz behaving like cocks across the room,
          making hot girls drink too much.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.

                         ADAM
          (re: Tad and Chaz)
          So, you like these guys?

                         JACOB
          They're rich, popular, and they
          shower me with compliments.
          They're pretty much the best
          friends I've ever had.

          ON A BALCONY
          A CROWD gathers around Phil, who has removed the cover of a

          SPINNING INDUSTRIAL FAN.

                         CROWD
          Phil! Phil! Phil!
          Like a zen master, Phil reaches out and GRABS A FAN BLADE,
          stopping the fan WITHOUT INJURY. Everyone celebrates!

          IN THE KITCHEN
          Nick holds up a HOMEMADE BEER BONG, from which he drinks. He
          has his own CROWD rooting him on.

                         NICK'S CROWD
          Nick! Nick! Nick!
          He finishes the last of the beer, and the crowd celebrates.

                         PARTY GUY
          This guy should be in charge of
          everything!

                         NICK
          I should.

          IN THE LIVING ROOM
          Lou SITS ON A COUCH with Michelle, one of the girls we met
          earlier at the lodge. Her friend Sandy sits across from them
          next to Jacob, who looks uncomfortable.

                         SANDY
          Truth or dare?
          Lou confers with Michelle before answering.

                         LOU
          Dare.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.
          Sandy and Jacob confer, figuring out the dare. Lou meets
          Jacob's eyes -- he smiles, knowing Jacob has his back.

                         SANDY
          OK, we dare Lou to put a Twizzler
          up his ass.
          Lou stands up and angrily points at Jacob.

                         LOU
          You son of a bitch! Have you ever
          played this game before? It's
          supposed to be awesome!
          Lou nevertheless grabs a TWIZZLER from the snack bowl and
          shoves it down the back of his pants. His face contorts
          uncomfortably and he is almost on the verge of tears.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          This is a horrible thing you're
          doing and I hope you never have to
          experience what I am currently
          going through.
          Lou sits down and Michelle consoles him.

                         MICHELLE
          Your turn! Truth or dare?
          Before Sandy can even confer with Jacob:

                         JACOB

                         (SMILES)
          Truth.
          Lou throws up his hands in frustration. He looks miserable,
          as Michelle confers with him.

                         LOU
          (grumbling to Michelle)
          I don't care. Whatever. This is
          not the point of the game.

                         MICHELLE
          OK, each of you has to tell your
          darkest, most personal secret.
          Lou crosses his arms and shakes his head.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

                         JACOB
          Oh wow, all right. Let me think.
          I've never told anyone this, but I
          was afraid of scary movies until I
          was 18. I even ran out of the
          theater a couple of times.

                         SANDY
          Oh you poor thing! Come here...
          She takes Jacob's head to her chest and strokes it gently.
          Lou makes a jerk-off gesture.

                         SANDY (CONT'D)

                         (SHY)
          I'm not sure I should tell mine.

                         MICHELLE
          Come on! You have to!

                         SANDY
          OK, but you can't laugh.

                         LOU

                         (WHO CARES)
          We promise. Let's hear it.

                         SANDY
          So this one time me and my friend
          Lori took a train to Baltimore. It
          was the summer and we wanted to
          party, but we had no money. So
          Lori found this businessman who was
          also looking for a good time and
          told him that we'd give him a half
          and half for seventy-five dollars.
          You know -- a suck and fuck.
          Lou and Jacob look shocked with the MATTER OF FACT
          storytelling. Michelle smiles. She's heard it before.

                         SANDY (CONT'D)
          Anyway, we get him up to his room
          and Lori starts going down on him,
          but I really wasn't into it. So I
          broke a piece of the bathroom
          mirror and used it to cut his
          artery on the-heck. Right here...
          She rubs Jacob's neck, pointing it out.

                         SANDY (CONT'D)
          He bled for about an hour before he
          died.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         SANDY (CONT'D)
          Afterwards, we took his wallet to
          the bar and found out he only had
          forty-seven dollars.
          Michelle GIGGLES.

                         SANDY (CONT'D)
          Michelle! You said you wouldn't
          laugh!

                         MICHELLE

                         (GIGGLING)
          I'm sorry!
          Jacob and Lou look shell-shocked.

          IN ANOTHER ROOM
          Adam sits in a chair in the corner, secluded. To his LEFT --
          Nick's in the kitchen, catching POPCORN in his mouth and
          earning accolades from all his new fans.
          To Adam's RIGHT --
          The truth or dare game devolves, as Michelle PIERCES LOU'S
          EAR. He screams in pain, but at the end, he has a GOLD STUD
          in his RIGHT EAR. Lou points at Jacob.

                         LOU
          Fuck you, your turn.

                         JACOB
          That's the gay ear, you know.
          As Adam looks STRAIGHT AHEAD --
          He sees Jennie all by herself, browsing the hosts' CASSETTE
          TAPE COLLECTION. Adam takes a moment to check himself. Then
          he reaches for his DRINK and GULPS THE WHOLE THING, before
          getting up and WALKING OVER to her, catching her off guard.

                         ADAM
          So I lied to you earlier. I wasn't
          here for a power tool convention.
          Jennie instinctively looks around for her friends.

                         JENNIE
          I know. You don't look like you
          could handle power tools.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.

                         ADAM
          The truth is, Jennie, I've always
          liked you. But I've never really
          known you. I really wasn't
          supposed to meet you again.

                         JENNIE
          Who are you?!
          Adam shrugs, indicating he might as well tell her.

                         ADAM
          I came here from the future.
          She rolls her eyes - she's heard all the one-liners.

                         JENNIE
          Let me guess. You want to beam me
          up to your spaceship built for two?
          Or maybe you're wondering if these
          are astronaut pants?

                         ADAM
          Astronaut pants?

                         JENNIE
          Because my ass is out of this
          world? Give me a break, spaz.
          I've heard them all.
          She turns away. Adam goes after her.

                         ADAM
          No! No spaceship. No astronaut
          pants. Just regular time travel.
          With normal pants.

                         JENNIE
          OK, what's the punch line?
          An ARM comes from behind and CHOKES ADAM. It's Blaine.

                         BLAINE
          I thought I told you to stay off my
          mountain, partner!

                         JENNIE
          Blaine, stop!

                         BLAINE
          You talking to my girl? Huh? I
          can't hear you.
          Adam fights to breathe, as Blaine chokes him harder.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.

                         JENNIE
          Blaine, that's enough! Let him go!
          He can't breathe!
          Blaine doesn't stop. He smiles like an asshole.

                         BLAINE
          Can't breathe? Is that right? Can
          you breathe, partner? What's that?
          I can't hear you. Just tell me you
          can't breathe and I'll stop.
          Adam still struggles. Blaine just shrugs.

                         BLAINE (CONT'D)
          He's not saying anything. I guess
          he can breathe.
          Jennie pulls on Blaine's arm, trying to free Adam.

                         BLAINE (CONT'D)
          Babe, stop. Jennie, stop!
          Blaine turns and accidentally ELBOWS JENNIE in the face. She
          goes down. He releases Adam and turns to help her.

                         BLAINE (CONT'D)
          Baby, I'm sorry.
          (turns to Adam)
          See what you made me do?!

                         JENNIE
          Screw you, Blaine!
          Jennie gets up. She grabs Adam's arm and YANKS HIM along
          with her, as she storms away.

                         JENNIE (CONT'D)

                         (TO ADAM)
          Come on, let's go!
          Blaine looks ON FIRE, as he watches Jennie leave with Adam.

          LOU (V.0.)
          Sandy, I don't know what you did
          with this wine, but it is
          delightful.

          INT. APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT

          Jacob and Lou sit with Michelle and Sandy back at the girls'
          apartment. The whole place looks like a Madonna concert.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.
          Jacob looks uncomfortable, but Lou pours on the polite charm.

                         SANDY
          It's from a box. There's lots!

                         LOU
          Mmm. Fantastic.

                         (QUICK TURN)
          Do you mind if I borrow my friend?
          We'll only be a moment.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. APARTMENT / BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Lou has Jacob PINNED AGAINST THE WALL with his arm. He
          speaks quietly, but with purpose.

                         LOU
          You're gonna fuck her!

                         JACOB
          I'm not gonna have sex with her.
          She killed a guy!

                         LOU
          That guy was undesirable. You
          heard her. It was about the money.

                         JACOB
          Great, so she's a prostitute. I'm
          not sleeping with a hooker either.

                         LOU
          She's not a hooker. She's a girl
          who did what she had to do to make
          a few bucks.
          (tries new tactic)
          Listen, she's probably awesome in
          bed.

                         JACOB
          She probably has a hairy vagina.

                         LOU
          Exactly!
          Jacob looks confused.

                         JACOB
          I'm not having this conversation.
          It's pointless. I don't have a
          condom.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

                         LOU
          Perfect! Me neither! No one here
          uses condoms. It's like heaven.
          Only with a lot more coke.
          Lou takes his COKE out of his pocket and SNORTS a bunch.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          How do I look?

                         JACOB
          Like a fucking madman?
          He slaps Jacob's arms.

                         LOU
          Rock and roll.
          Lou exits the bathroom and calls out to the girls.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          Who's ready to get laid by an
          awesome penis?!

          INT. PINE VALLEY INN / LOBBY - LATE NIGHT

          Adam and Jennie are sitting on the floor by the fireplace,
          playing MONOPOLY.

                         ADAM
          Oooh, Atlantic Avenue. That's
          gonna cost you.

                         JENNIE
          How much?

                         ADAM
          I'll tell ya what...
          Adam moves her token up a few squares and makes a show of
          looking over his shoulder, as if someone might see.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          I'm not supposed to do this. But
          I'm gonna upgrade you to Marvin
          Gardens. It's a suite. Plus,
          there's an excellent buffet and a
          view of the pool.
          Jennie laughs, despite herself. She looks around, as if
          someone might see her. Adam notices.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          No one's gonna see you hanging out
          with the creepy spaz. Don't worry.

                         JENNIE
          I'm sorry I called you those names.

                         ADAM
          Hey, it's cool. I was being creepy
          and spazzy.

                         JENNIE
          You're still not gonna tell me how
          you know me?

                         ADAM
          I'm from the future.

                         JENNIE
          Fine, let's just drop it. I'm glad
          you're feeling better. Blaine had
          no right to hit you.

                         (SMILES)
          I bet he's going out of his mind
          right now.

                         ADAM
          What are you doing with a douche
          like him anyway? You're so much
          better than that.

                         JENNIE
          Yeah, well guys like you come to
          visit. Guys like him live here.

                         ADAM
          So if I lived here, I'd have a
          shot?
          For a moment, Jennie is thrown off. She's about to say
          something, but checks herself. Instead she nervously stands.

                         JENNIE
          I'm gonna get going.
          Adam stands up with her.

                         JENNIE (CONT'D)
          Thanks for being a good guy. I
          don't remember the last time I had
          this much fun playing such a stupid
          game.
          She gives Adam a sweet KISS ON THE CHEEK.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

                         JENNIE (CONT'D)
          If you run into Blaine, you can
          tell him I blew you. But that's
          all. We didn't do anything else.

                         ADAM

                         (SURPRISED)
          We didn't do anything!

                         JENNIE

                         (SMILES)
          Shh. It's our little secret.
          Jennie exits, leaving Adam confused.

          INT. APARTMENT / BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

          In the darkness, we hear SOUNDS OF SEX. Moans of pleasure,
          creaks of mattresses, multiple "yesses."
          On TWIN BEDS that are a little too close to each other, Lou
          and Jacob have sex with Michelle and Sandy. The girls and
          Lou are vocal. Jacob is silent.
          As Sandy rides him, Jacob notices some BROKEN GLASS on the
          bedside table. He can't take his eyes off it, as Sandy's
          hand keeps brushing up against the table.
          Lou, naked, DRINKS A CAN OF TAB while he delivers the goods
          to Michelle. He reaches over, mid-act, and hands the half-
          empty can to Jacob.

                         LOU
          Tab?

                         JACOB
          Stop talking to me!
          Despite the fact that this looks like very good sex -- it is
          very bad sex for Jacob.

                         FADE TO:

          INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - LATE NIGHT

          Adam is asleep in bed, as Jennie quietly enters the room. He
          wakes up to find her wearing SEXY LINGERIE, as she CLIMBS ON
          TOP of him.

                         ADAM
          Jennie!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.
          He looks over and sees Nick SNORING in the other bed.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)

                         (WHISPERS)
          What are you doing here?!
          Jennie gives Adam a LONG WET KISS. He's freaked out.

                         JENNIE
          I thought about what you said and
          you're right. I should be with
          you.

                         ADAM
          I didn't necessarily say that.

                         JENNIE
          I want you, Adam!
          She RIPS OPEN her lingerie, revealing her AWESOME HEAVING

          NAKED BREASTS.

                         ADAM
          Oh my god!
          She kisses him again and they start to go at it. Just then --

          LILY (O.S.)
          What the hell is going on here?
          Adam pushes Jennie off him, as the LIGHTS GO ON in the room.
          Lily is standing in the doorway, looking sad and angry.

                         ADAM
          Lily?

                         LILY
          So you do like her better than me?

                         ADAM
          No, she just--
          Adam looks to where Jennie just was, but now the bed is
          covered with PHOTOS OF JENNIE. There's also a LARGE BOX OF
          TISSUES and some HAND LOTION.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          What's all this?

                         (LOOKS AROUND)
          Jennie?

                         LILY
          What's wrong with my vagina, Adam?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

                         ADAM
          Nothing's wrong with it. It's
          beautiful.
          In the next bed, Nick rolls over and wakes up.

                         NICK
          It's a beautiful vagina. Among the
          prettiest I've ever seen.

                         ADAM
          Stay out of it, Nick!

                         LILY
          Would it be so bad to spend the
          rest of your life with my vagina?

                         ADAM
          No. It wouldn't at all.
          Lily turns and walks out the door.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          Lily, it wouldn't! I love your
          vagina! I love your vaginaaaaaa!

           SMASH CUT TO:

          INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - MORNING

          Adam abruptly WAKES UP.

                         ADAM

                         (GROGGY MUMBLING)
          Vagina... huh?
          He sees Nick sitting on a bed on the other side of the room.
          He's ON THE PHONE, talking quietly with someone.

          NICK (ON PHONE)
          I just really need to get a few
          things off my chest. You're
          domineering and you think you have
          all the answers, but you don't.
          Not by a long shot.
          Nick is getting emotional.

          NICK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D)
          You think you're better than me?
          Last night I made jello shots and
          everybody loved me.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.

          NICK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D)
          They didn't care that I only
          brought home 60k last year. They
          loved me for me. They didn't go
          throwing their rich parents' weight
          around.
          (wipes away a tear)
          I don't know, Courtney.

                         INTERCUT:

          INT. CHILD'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

          A 6-YEAR-OLD COURTNEY (Nick's future wife) listens to this
          crying man on the other end of the phone.

          6-YEAR-OLD COURTNEY (ON PHONE)
          It's OK.
          Nick CRIES a little bit harder.

          NICK (ON PHONE)
          It's so good to hear your voice. I
          love you, princess. I really do.
          You just make it so hard on me
          sometimes.

          6-YEAR-OLD COURTNEY (ON PHONE)
          It's OK.

          NICK (ON PHONE)
          You're right. It's OK. I just
          want it to be OK.
          Adam starts registering some of this conversation.

                         ADAM
          Who are you talking to?
          Nick looks at Adam and covers the receiver.

                         NICK
          Courtney.

                         ADAM
          What do you mean "Courtney?"
          Adam picks up ANOTHER PHONE.

          ADAM (ON PHONE) (CONT'D)
          Hello?

          6-YEAR-OLD COURTNEY (ON PHONE)
          Hello!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.
          Adam, freaked out, HANGS UP his phone.

                         ADAM
          Get off the phone!!
          But Nick is down the rabbit hole.

          NICK (ON PHONE)
          Baby, I gotta go. Just think about
          what I said. We're so great
          together. It's like when we're
          having sex - the way our bodies
          become one, as we both embrace the
          passion of the moment--
          On the other end, COURTNEY'S DAD has picked up the phone.

          COURTNEY'S DAD (ON PHONE)

          WHO THE FUCK IS THIS?!
          Nick hangs up the phone and stares at it, freaked out. Adam
          just shakes his head.

                         NICK
          OK, so that may have been bad.

                         ADAM
          What were you thinking?
          The DOOR OPENS and Lou strolls in, looking quite fresh.

                         LOU
          Guess who re-popped his 80s cherry?
          This guy!
          He points at himself in a celebratory manner, as behind him --
          The Towel Guy whose room this is comes RUNNING UP.

                         TOWEL GUY
          Hey, get the hell out of my room!
          In one move, Lou catches him inside the room, closes the door
          with his foot, and puts the guy in a HEAD LOCK. He then
          converts it into a SLEEPER HOLD, putting the guy to sleep.

                         NICK
          Oh, we're going to jail.

                         LOU
          Help me put him in the closet.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

          INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER

          The guys drop the sleeping Towel Guy in the closet.

          INT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO -- MOMENTS LATER

          Adam, Nick, and Lou take a soak in the tub.

                         ADAM
          Has anyone seen Jacob?

                         LOU
          He's grabbing drinks with Tad and
          Chaz. Which is what we should do.
          We'll start at the Brew Haus and do
          a three drink crawl up the street--
          Adam gets more fed up than ever.

                         ADAM
          Guys! I refuse to accept that
          we're stuck in 1987! Maybe you're
          loving it, Lou. But you don't get
          it. Nick's insane, Jacob's become
          a bigger douche than before, and I
          need to get back for my goddamn
          rehearsal dinner? Which is
          tomorrow!

                         LOU

                         (CALMLY)
          Adam. I know I don't look like I
          understand, but I do. You have a
          beautiful fiancee who means more to
          you than anything in the world.
          And if you could, you'd literally
          travel across time for her.

                         ADAM
          Yes.

                         LOU
          I get it, man. Life is about these
          moments. Moments where a regular
          Joe becomes a hero. Moments where
          you dig deep and find the
          motivation... the courage... the
          guts to do what's right and what's
          necessary. It's moments like
          these...
          Lou suddenly notices some COCAINE on the edge of the tub.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          Jesus, how come nobody told me
          there was coke out here?
          Lou SNORTS A BIG LINE.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          What was I saying?
          Adam and Nick get out and towel off. Lou follows.

                         ADAM
          Maybe we have to learn something?

                         NICK
          What do you mean?

                         ADAM
          You know, like Groundhog Day. We
          have to learn the meaning of life
          or some shit.
          Just then, a KITTEN licking a PUDDLE on the base of the tub
          JUMPS in the hot tub and VANISHES IN A BRIGHT LIGHT!
          For a moment, everyone is quiet.

                         LOU

                         (FREAKED OUT)
          I've gotta stop doing cocaine and I
          need to go to the hospital. I just
          saw a fucking kitten explode.

                         NICK
          I saw it too.
          The guys run over to the tub. The bubbles are on low, but
          there's NOTHING IN IT.

                         ADAM
          It didn't explode. It vanished.
          It went back... to the present.

                         LOU
          This is the present.

                         ADAM
          Our old present.

                         NICK
          So it is the tub!
          Lou POINTS at something.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

                         LOU
          Um...
          The HOT TUB IS NOT PLUGGED IN, and yet it's clearly running.

                         ADAM
          OK. You guys know what to do.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - MINUTES LATER

          The guys have a COUPLE BOXES OF KITTENS. One at a time, they
          get in the tub and take turns DIPPING THE KITTENS. When
          nothing happens, Lou DUMPS an entire box of kittens into the
          tub. The cats get ANGRY and CLAW AT HIS FACE and body.
          Eventually, the guys just shake their heads.

                         ADAM
          This isn't working.

                         LOU
          Maybe these aren't the right
          kittens?
          Adam points at him in a "now you're thinking" way.

                         ADAM
          We'll split up. Get as many
          different cats as you can. Let's
          all meet back here in an hour.

                         LOU
          You can count on me!

          INT. BREW HAUS - DAY

          Lou sits on a stool, munching on snacks. A TV shows the AFC
          conference championship game between the Denver Broncos and
          the Cleveland Browns. It's the 4th Quarter and the Browns
          score with 5:43 remaining on the clock to go up by 7.
          Two stools over, a SLICK-HAIRED ASSHOLE (RICK) sits with his
          bored-looking HIGH SOCIETY TROPHY WIFE (CANDACE).

                         RICK
          Yes!

                         LOU
          Hate to tell ya, pal. Browns are
          gonna lose by 3 in overtime.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

                         RICK
          Eat shit and die, scumbag. I've
          got ten large on this game.

                         LOU
          Not only that, but I bet you
          Elway's gonna throw a touchdown
          with 37 seconds left.

                         RICK
          Fat chance, pal. Elway's done
          nothing all day.

                         LOU
          Care to make it interesting?

                         RICK
          Who the hell are you?
          Lou thinks about the question for a moment.

                         LOU
          Name's Musselman. Hank Musselman.
          I've got a cool name, huh?

                         RICK
          It's a good name. What did you
          have in mind, Musselman?

                         LOU
          I win -- your wife gives me a
          blowjob. A classy one.
          For the first time, Candace looks less than bored. She does a
          bad job of feigning disinterest.

                         RICK
          All right, buddy, fuck off.

                         LOU
          You win -- you can kill me. Any
          way you want. Knife, gun, torch,
          sword... I'll even make a video
          exonerating you.

                         RICK
          Yeah, right...

                         LOU
          I'm serious. You look like a man
          who has everything. Except the
          license to kill. Care to gamble?
          Rick looks at Lou long and hard. Lou doesn't flinch.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

                         RICK
          37 seconds?

                         LOU
          Exactly.

                         RICK
          You have a deal.
          As Rick and Lou shake hands, Candace makes a show of looking
          offended.

                         RICK (CONT'D)

                         (TO CANDACE)
          Don't worry, babe. This yahoo's
          made a wager he can't possibly win.
          Lou picks up another HANDFUL of bar snacks. He puts them in
          his mouth and shows it to Rick.

                         LOU

                         (MOUTH FULL)
          Look. Who am I? I'm your wife.
          Nuts in my mouth. Get it?

                         (TO CANDACE)
          I like it slow and romantic.

          EXT. PET STORE - DAY

          Nick leaves a pet store, carrying a BOX OF KITTENS. On the
          street, he accidentally bumps into one of the Japanese
          businessmen from the night before. He has a THICK ACCENT,
          like Gedde Watanabe in "Gung Ho."

                         NICK
          Oh, sorry man.

                         (NOTICES HIM)
          Hey! How's that iPod working out
          for you?

                         JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN
          Oh, it's a very nice toy.

                         NICK
          If you like that, I've got a phone
          back at the lodge that will knock
          your socks off.

                         JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN
          I wish I could see it. But I am on
          my way to a very important business
          meeting.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.

                         NICK
          Oh yeah? More important than
          Bluetooth?

                         JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN
          My associates and I are co-
          financing a... how do you say it...
          supermarket business.

                         NICK

                         (SUSPICIOUS)
          You're not going to Boston, by any
          chance?

                         JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN
          Yes! Boston! We leave tonight.

                         NICK
          You're gonna franchise out the
          Gelman's Mom and Pop!

                         JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN
          Yes! How do you know this?
          Nick puts his arm around the guy and walks down the street.

                         NICK
          Walk with me a minute. Let me tell
          you about some companies you should
          really be looking into...

          INT. THE DECK - DAY

          Tad, Chaz, and Jacob enjoy drinks on a deck overlooking the
          mountain ski slopes.

                         CHAZ
          You really are a gas, Jacob. Tad
          and I think you're the cat's
          pajamas.

                         JACOB
          Thanks. I like you guys, too.
          A THIRD DOUCHEBAG arrives and gives a SECRET HANDSHAKE to Tad
          and Chaz. He drops off a PILL BOTTLE. This is GEOFFREY
          (pronounced JOFF-rey).

                         GEOFFREY
          Gentlemen.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.

                         TAD
          Geoffrey, please meet Jacob.
          Excuse his Jewish name. He really
          quite exceeds it.
          Jacob looks confused by that, as Geoffrey shakes his hand.

                         GEOFFREY
          Jacob, would you like some too?
          He offers a pill bottle.

                         JACOB
          What is it?

                         CHAZ
          Rohypnol. Geoffrey's father is a
          pharmacist, but we don't hold that
          against him.

                         JACOB
          Rohypnol?

                         TAD
          You slip it to a chick who won't go
          to third. Give it an hour and
          you'll be rounding home.

                         JACOB

                         (SURPRISED)
          This is a date rape drug.

                         GEOFFREY

                         (LAUGHS)
          What the fuck is date rape?

                         JACOB
          These are roofies!

                         CHAZ
          Roofies... I like that!

                         TAD
          Yeah, it takes the clinical name
          right out of it. It sounds so
          fresh, chicks might even take it
          voluntarily!

                         (TO JACOB)
          Hey, can we use that?
          Jacob looks beside himself.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

          EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - AFTERNOON

          A GUY and a GIRL are using the hot tub, which is still hot
          and bubbly, despite the fact that it isn't plugged in.
          Nick and Lou sit at the table, as Adam approaches with CATS.

                         ADAM
          I got regular cats. I figured
          maybe the kitten was a fluke.
          Nick takes the box out of his hands and puts it down.

                         NICK
          Come here.
          He leads Adam near the tub, where Lou points at something.

                         LOU
          There!

                         ADAM
          What am I looking at? It's some
          kind of stain.

                         LOU
          Smell it.

                         ADAM
          I'm not smelling it.

                         LOU

                         (NODS ENCOURAGINGLY)
          Smell the stain.
          Adam puts his nose up against the stain and SNIFFS. He
          recognizes something, but can't put his finger on it.

                         ADAM
          What is that?

                         NICK
          Red Bull.

          GUY IN TUB
          Hey, you fellas mind? I'm trying
          to get a handjob here.

          INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - AFTERNOON

          Our guys sit and absorb the impact of what they've learned.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.

                         ADAM
          So you're telling me that Red Bull
          plus hot tub equals time travel?

                         LOU

                         (NODS PROUDLY)
          Mmm hmm. Hank Musselman's getting
          the Nobel Prize.

                         ADAM
          Who the fuck is Hank Musselman?

                         NICK
          There was just enough Red Bull for
          the kitten. Not nearly enough for
          a human. It's a weight
          distribution thing.

                         ADAM
          How did you even figure this out?

                         LOU
          Scientific method.

                         NICK
          He bet me 20 dollars I wouldn't
          lick the stain.

                         LOU
          I thought it was some guy's jizz.

                         ADAM
          What's wrong with you?

                         LOU
          It worked, didn't it?

                         NICK
          Yeah, except one little problem.
          There's no Red Bull in 1987.
          For a moment, they're all bummed again. Then Adam gets an
          encouraged look on his face.

                         ADAM
          Yes there is! Come on!
          Adam heads for the door, as Lou and Nick follow.

          EXT. BUNNY SLOPE - DAY

          Jennie instructs a group of TEENAGERS on the basics of
          skiing, as Adam approaches, with Nick and Lou in tow.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

                         JENNIE

                         (CONCERNED)
          You can't be here. If Blaine sees
          you, he'll snap your neck. I told
          him I blew you and he's not happy.

                         ADAM
          Why would you do that?!
          Behind Adam, Nick looks at the group of TEENS and his eyes
          almost BUG OUT. He elbows Lou.

                         NICK
          (whispers, teeth clenched)
          Look.
          Lou looks to where Nick is looking:
          YOUNG ADAM, YOUNG NICK, and YOUNG LOU wait with other kids
          for Jennie to return to their lesson.

                         LOU
          Holy shit!
          Lou immediately approaches the kids, even as Nick tries to
          hold him back.

                         NICK

                         (TEETH CLENCHED)
          where the fuck are you going?!
          Lou walks right up to his YOUNGER SELF and looks himself
          square in the face.

                         YOUNG LOU
          What the hell do you want, old man?
          Lou PUNCHES his YOUNGER SELF in the face. Young Nick and
          Young Adam are freaked out, as is regular Nick. Adam doesn't
          notice, as he's arguing with Jennie.

          YOUNG LOU (CONT'D)
          What the fuck, dude?! I think you
          broke my nose! My parents are
          gonna sue the shit out of you!

                         LOU
          Herschel and Evelyn aren't gonna do
          a damn thing. They're losers.

                         YOUNG LOU
          How do you know my parents?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

                         LOU
          Listen to me. Start putting
          minoxidil on your scalp. Tonight.
          Then, when Propecia comes on the
          market, start taking it. Every
          day. Hair is important.

                         YOUNG LOU
          I don't give a shit about hair.

                         LOU
          You will!
          (leans in, quietly)
          Or I'll tell everyone about how you
          jerked off to that issue of
          Playgirl.

                         YOUNG LOU

                         (QUIETLY)
          It was confusing! There were naked
          people and it had "girl" in the
          title!

                         LOU
          Hey, you don't have to justify to
          me, pal.

                         YOUNG LOU

                         (FREAKED OUT)
          Who are you?

                         LOU
          I'm God.

          ON ADAM AND JENNIE

                         JENNIE
          Fine. You wanna see Blaine? It's
          your funeral. He's in the
          warehouse at the end of Lawrence.
          Good luck.

          EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY

          Adam walks off the mountain with Nick and Lou.

                         LOU
          Moment of truth.
          Lou takes off his hat and feels his scalp - no hair.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.

                         LOU (CONT'D)

                         (LOOKS BACK)
          That fucker!
          Just then, Lou's NOSE SLIGHTLY SHIFTS, the result of being
          broken and never fixed. It stays this wa for the rest of
          the movie.
          Lou touches his nose.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          Oh, that's just great.
          Jacob runs up, in a friendlier disposition.

                         JACOB
          Hey guys!

                         ADAM
          I thought you were with douche
          patrol.

                         JACOB
          Yeah I was. But it turned out
          those guys are date rapists.

                         ADAM
          Ah.

                         NICK
          Adam, where are we going?
          Adam gets a look of determination again.

                         ADAM
          To get my bag. We get that, we
          have the Red Bull, and our ticket
          home.

                         LOU
          Yes! The race is on!

                         ADAM
          What race?

                         LOU
          Duh, it's 1987? We're at a ski
          resort?

                         (SHAKES HEAD)
          Disputes like these are settled
          with a downhill ski race. Usually
          at dawn. It's the law.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.

                         ADAM
          You're an idiot.

          INT. WAREHOUSE - AFTERNOON

          Adam and the guys step into a warehouse. WET FLOOR, CHAINS
          hanging from the ceiling for no reason, STEAM rising from
          grates. As they enter, Chaz pulls down a large GARAGE DOOR.
          Up ahead, Blaine sits on some CRATES with Tad.

                         BLAINE
          Welcome to my lair.

                         ADAM
          You live here?

                         NICK
          Yeah, this is kind of a shitty
          place to live.

                         BLAINE
          I don't live here.
          Adam approaches Blaine, trying to speak maturely.

                         ADAM
          Look. Blaine. I think we got off
          on the wrong foot. You have some
          issue with me.

                         BLAINE
          You get blown by my girl? I'll say
          that's one hell of an issue.

                         LOU
          Whoa! You got blown?!

                         ADAM
          She didn't blow me. She lied to
          you to make you jealous. I'm not
          trying to steal Jennie. I just
          wanna get my bag.

                         BLAINE
          Oh, your bag. I was wondering when
          you'd come around for that.
          Tad holds up the BACKPACK over by the crates.

                         ADAM
          Yeah, I'll just take it and get out
          of your way.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.

                         BLAINE
          You will?
          Adam EXTENDS HIS HAND.

                         ADAM
          Whattya say? Can we work this out
          like gentlemen?
          Blaine PULLS A KNIFE. Tad and Chaz also PULL KNIVES.

                         NICK
          What is this town's obsession with
          knives?

                         BLAINE

                         (MENACING)
          How about I work this out like... a
          butcher?
          Just then, LIGHT SPILLS INTO THE DARK WAREHOUSE. A GUY in a
          polo shirt stands in a dooorway.

          GUY IN POLO SHIRT
          Hey! Scumbuckets! Back to work!
          Like naughty children being caught red handed, Blaine and his
          goons lose the knives and hustle toward the open door.
          Blaine grabs the backpack from Tad.
          Adam and the guys follow through the door and into --

          INT. SUNGLASS HUT - DAY

          Adam, Nick, Lou, and Jacob are confused, as Blaine, Chaz, and
          Tad spring to action, helping CUSTOMERS choose sunglasses.
          Jacob approaches Tad and Chaz, who look embarrassed.

                         JACOB
          You guys are posers! You're not
          better than me!

                         TAD
          Jacob, I wish you hadn't seen us
          like this.
          Adam stands near Blaine, who helps a WOMAN.

                         BLAINE

                         (TO WOMAN)
          These would look so good with your
          light complexion.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.

                         ADAM
          Listen asshole! I want my bag!

                         BLAINE

                         (TO WOMAN)
          Will you excuse me for a moment?
          Blaine walks behind the COUNTER and SHOVES THE BAG in a SAFE.

                         BLAINE (CONT'D)
          Safe's on a timer. It'll open
          tomorrow. We race at dawn. Winner
          gets the bag. Loser leaves town.
          Lou turns to Nick.

                         LOU
          See? I told you!

                         ADAM

                         (TO BLAINE)
          I don't wanna race you.

                         BLAINE
          Then I guess you don't want your
          bag.

                         (SMIRKS)
          See you at dawn.

                         ADAM
          Your girlfriend sucks one hell of a
          mean dick.
          Adam makes a SLURPING SOUND and Blaine fumes.

          EXT. HAVENHURST MAIN DRAG - LATE AFTERNOON

          Nick, Lou, and Jacob walk behind Adam, who looks pissed.

                         NICK
          What are we gonna do?

                         LOU
          That chick blew you?!

                         ADAM

                         (INTENSE)
          I've got a race to win.
          Europe's "The Final Countdown" begins playing over a MONTAGE:
          -- Skis are sharpened.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.
          -- Gear is polished.
          -- In the SUITE, Adam gets dressed in his GEAR.
          -- On a SMALL HILL, Jacob demonstrates some moves on skis.
          Adam doesn't get it. He's keeps falling.
          -- On the hill, Jacob teaches Adam how to SNOWBOARD. Adam is
          having an easier time standing up on the snowboard.
          -- The guys keep Adam awake and use a homemade SCALE MODEL of
          the mountain to formulate a plan, a la Iron Eagle.
          -- Back on the hill, Jacob and Adam snowboard next to each
          other. Adam makes it by a couple of obstacles. Jacob looks
          proud of him.
          -- The guys play an ATARI SKI GAME, trying out a strategy.
          Jacob uses a POINTER, looking disappointed.
          -- On the hill, Adam easily maneuvers by a few trees on the
          snowboard, kicking up snow and HIGH-FINING Jacob.

          EXT. MOUNTAIN / TOP - DAWN

          SLO-MO HERO SHOT of our four guys, as they ascend the top of
          the mountain. If we didn't know any better, it would look
          like Tony Scott directed a ski movie.

          END MONTAGE.

          EXT. MOUNTAIN / TOP - DAY

          A few yards away from Nick and Lou, Adam sits on the ground,
          as Jacob helps him strap into the snowboard.

                         JACOB
          Just stick to the plan and you're
          gonna be fine.
          Adam looks at Jacob seriously for a moment.

                         ADAM
          Jacob, I'm sorry for not always
          being the big brother I should've
          been. I was away at college, Mom
          gave you my Sega - there were a
          whole host of issues.
          Jacob nods and speaks genuinely to Adam too.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

                         JACOB
          I know. I'm sorry too. I put a
          few things before my family and
          took my guilt out on you.
          (puts it together)
          I guess it was an inevitable I'd
          end up part of a roofie ring.
          Adam smiles and extends his hand.

                         ADAM
          Friends?
          Jacob takes Adam's hand and helps him to his feet.

                         JACOB
          Brothers.
          They EMBRACE. Lou looks disgusted.

                         LOU
          Gay.
          Blaine and his goons approach from below. Adam puts on his
          game face.

                         ADAM
          I didn't think you guys would show.

                         BLAINE
          This was my idea.

                         ADAM
          It's gonna make my victory taste
          all the more sweeter. Like a Peach
          Snapple.

                         BLAINE
          A what?

                         ADAM
          You'll see.
          Blaine actually looks rattled, as the two men get lined up.
          Adam is on a SNOWBOARD.

                         BLAINE
          What's that?

                         ADAM
          You're not afraid of getting beat
          by a guy on a skateboard, are you?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.

                         BLAINE
          I've seen you in action. You're
          reckless and terrible.

                         ADAM
          Reckless and terrible's my middle
          name. Because I feel the need...
          (pulls on goggles)
          for speed!
          Chaz holds out his arm as a starting line.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          Catch ya at the bottom.

                         CHAZ

          3, 2, 1... GO!
          Blaine takes off down the mountain like a professional
          skiier, which he pretty much is. Adam looks toward Jacob,
          who demonstrates the proper CROUCH. Adam slowly picks up
          speed, starting at about one mile per hour.
          Blaine looks back and can't believe how easily he's gonna
          coast to victory.

                         ADAM
          Here goes nothing.
          Instead of weaving back and forth, Adam just stays in the
          crouch, PICKING UP SPEED. He recklessly PASSES BLAINE,
          despite the many TREES and OBSTACLES on the course.
          He BEARS DOWN AND TRAVELS LIKE A BOLT OF LIGHTNING!
          Blaine finds the guts to alter his STYLE, skiing more
          recklessly too. He begins catching up to Adam.
          Blaine skis up next to Adam - they're both going full force.

                         BLAINE
          You can't beat me! I was born on
          this mountain!

                         ADAM
          I was born in a hospital like a
          normal baby!
          Adam bends down and picks up even more speed, NARROWLY
          MISSING trees and rocks. Blaine tries to keep up.
          Adam has the finish line in his sights, when he rolls the
          dice once too often. His SNOWBOARD GETS SNAGGED on a rock
          and Adam TUMBLES TO THE GROUND.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.
          The SNOWBOARD FLIES OFF INTO THE AIR!

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. MOUNTAIN / BASE - DAY

          Phil stands against a SHED, as a GUY THROWS A HATCHET at him,
          just narrowly missing his arm. Phil FLEXES HIS MUSCLES, as a

          HOT CHICK KISSES HIM.
          Then the SNOWBOARD FLIES INTO FRAME and SLICES OFF PHIL'S
          ARM, sending BLOOD SPLATTER EVERYWHERE!

                         PHIL
          Ahhhh! My arm!!!

          EXT. MOUNTAIN / TOP - DAY - SAME TIME

          Lou watches with BINOCULARS and PUMPS HIS FIST.

                         LOU
          Yes!

          EXT. MOUNTAIN - RACE - DAY

          As Adam tumbles on the ground, Blaine smiles, thinking he has
          the victory in the bag.
          But instead of stopping, Adam picks up speed, as he TUMBLES
          LIMB OVER LIMB, like a snowball going down the mountain.
          With 50 YARDS to go, Blaine bears down and tries to catch
          Adam. It's gonna be close.
          At the FINISH LINE, Adam's CRUMPLED BODY passes the line
          first. Blaine pulls up, pissed off to lose the race.
          Adam's momentum carries him forward another 50 yards, where
          he SMASHES INTO A DECK and finally comes to a stop.

                         CUT TO:

          A CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE POPS!

          INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - LATE AFTERNOON

          A large "BON VOYAGE" BANNER hangs in the room.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.
          An ALL-OUT PARTY is going on in the guys' suite. GUESTS
          party everywhere, helping the guys celebrate.
          Sandy and Michelle flirt with the two dudes who took brief
          possession of the Towel Guy yesterday.
          The Coke Guy from the gondola talks with the Brew Haus
          Waitress.
          Adam's leg is in a CAST, as he sits at a table with Jacob,
          Nick, and Lou. The OPEN BACKPACK is in front of them. They
          DRINK and TOAST.

                         NICK
          You did it, man.

                         ADAM
          Ah, it was nothing. I just fell
          down the mountain.

                         NICK
          It was a beautiful fall.
          Lou goes into Adam's backpack and pulls out the SANDWICH,
          which he begins unwrapping.

                         ADAM

                         (DISGUSTED)
          Tell me you are not going to keep
          eating that.
          Lou takes a bite and SHRUGS.

                         LOU
          Chicken parm. It's my favorite.

                         ADAM
          Chicken parm?
          Adam takes the sandwich from Lou. He looks at it closely.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)

                         (LAUGHS)
          Chicken parm. On this roll.
          The guys look confused, as Adam stares at the sandwich.

                         JACOB
          Adam, what is it?

                         FLASHBACK TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

          INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Adam and Lily nervously make eye contact at the front of the
          restaurant, as a SNOOTY HOST shakes his head.

          ADAM (V.0.)
          It was our first date. You know
          those nights that are just perfect?
          This wasn't one of those nights.

          INT. MOVIE THEATER - DARK

          Adam and Lily sit through "From Justin to Kelly," the
          American Idol movie. They don't enjoy themselves.

          EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

          Adam inspects a HUGE DENT in the side of his car. As he does
          so, a car drives by, SPLASHING A PUDDLE on Lily.

          ADAM (V.0.)
          If Lily knew where we were, I'm
          sure she would've walked home. And
          I wouldn't have blamed her.

          EXT. ITALIAN DELI - NIGHT

          In the RAIN, Adam and Lily run toward the entrance of a
          little deli. Inside the doorway, a LITTLE OLD WOMAN shakes
          her head no. Adam pleads with his eyes and she lets them in.

          INT. ITALIAN DELI - NIGHT

          Adam and Lily sit and talk animatedly at the counter in the
          small, empty deli, eating SANDWICHES.

          ADAM (V.0.)
          We were so hungry by the time we
          found that deli, we would've eaten
          anything. So what if it wasn't
          foie gras and pino noir. It was
          chicken parm and Italian soda. And
          it couldn't have been more perfect.

                         BACK TO:

          INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - DAY

          The guys enjoy listening to Adam's story.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

                         NICK
          That sandwich was special, huh?

                         ADAM
          You could say that. You could also
          say it gave me horrible diarrhea.

                         FLASHBACK TO:

          INT. ADAM'S APARTMENT / BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Adam SHITS HIS BRAINS OUT. When it looks like. he might be
          done, he turns around and VOMITS into the toilet.

          INT. ADAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Lily waits by the bathroom door with some PEPTO and a GLASS
          OF WATER. She looks very concerned.

          ADAM (V.0.)
          Lily had every opportunity to
          leave. She didn't know me at all
          and she certainly didn't owe me
          anything after the night I put her
          through. But she stayed.

          INT. ADAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Adam lays on the couch, his head in Lily's lap. She feeds
          him a little GATORADE. He keeps it down... for a moment.
          Then he turns and VOMITS into a BUCKET on the floor.

          ADAM (V.0.)
          She saw me at my worst and she
          stayed.
          Lily holds the bucket, as Adam pukes into it.

                         BACK TO:

          INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - DAY

          Nick, Lou, and Jacob look sick.

                         ADAM
          Don't you see? This is more than a
          sandwich. It represents all that
          shit. All that puke.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

                         LOU
          Keep the sandwich.

                         JACOB
          This is disgusting.

                         ADAM
          She gave me this as a reminder of
          her love.

                         (THINKS)
          Or to give me horrible diarrhea so
          I didn't leave the room during the
          bachelor party. But mostly as a
          reminder of her love.
          Adam holds up the sandwich.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          This is the reason I need to go
          home.
          Adam stands up and walks toward the door with the sandwich.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          I'm gonna go prep the tub.
          Lou holds up a BAG OF CHIPS.

                         LOU
          Do you have any stories about these
          chips or can I eat them?

          EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - CONTINUOUS

          Adam walks outside, taking a bite of the SANDWICH. He finds
          Jennie waiting in the TUB.

                         JENNIE
          There you are!

                         ADAM
          Jennie! What are you doing here?

                         JENNIE
          Making good on a rumor.
          Jennie STANDS UP in the tub and she's TOPLESS.
          Adam DROPS THE SANDWICH, shocked.

                         ADAM
          Whoa.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.
          Jennie continues talking, shamelessly exposing herself.

                         JENNIE
          When I saw you win that race
          against Blaine, everything changed
          for me. I realize now that I
          deserve more. I deserve a winner.

                         (SEDUCTIVE)
          Come and get your prize.
          Adam reaches next to the tub and hands her a ROBE.

                         ADAM
          Yeah, I... can't.
          She covers up, embarrassed.

                         JENNIE
          Oh my god. I missed my
          opportunity.

                         ADAM
          No, I'm not sure there ever was an
          opportunity. Jennie, you're
          terrific. You've brought me so
          many moments of joy, you'll never
          know. But I shouldn't have given
          you the wrong idea.
          Jennie looks sad and vulnerable, as Adam talks.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          The truth is there's a girl I need
          to go see. We have plans to spend
          the rest of our lives together.
          And I can't wait any longer.
          (listening to himself)
          And I'm totally cool with it.
          Adam smiles, feeling the rush of knowing he's ready. But
          then he sees how sad Jennie is. He moves closer to her.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          One day, you're going to find the
          right guy who's willing to give up
          everything and travel across time
          and space for your love.
          She nods and tears up a little bit, as Adam HUGS her.

                         JENNIE

                         (EMOTIONAL)
          I would totally blow you right now.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

                         ADAM
          I know you would.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

          The guys stare at the tub, which continues to bubble, even
          though it's not plugged in.

                         NICK
          We don't have to go yet, Adam.
          Things are just getting fun.

                         JACOB
          And we can do whatever we want
          without any real consequences.
          That's a lot to give up.

                         ADAM

                         (NODS)
          That's how I know I'm doing the
          right thing.
          Adam reaches in his backpack, but can't find the Red Bull.
          He turns it inside out and shakes it -- nothing.

                         JACOB
          Where's the Red Bull?

          BLAINE (V.0.)
          You looking for this?
          Across the patio, a drunk, disheveled Blaine holds the CAN.

                         BLAINE (CONT'D)
          You couldn't leave well enough
          alone, could ya? You couldn't just
          win the race and call it a day?
          You had to have Jennie too.

                         ADAM
          I don't want Jennie.

                         BLAINE
          That's funny. I don't want this
          soda, either.
          Blaine smiles like an asshole. Adam's face goes desperate,
          as Blaine OPENS THE CAN and DRINKS THE WHOLE THING.

                         ADAM
          Nooooo!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.
          Adam runs at Blaine and tackles him to the ground. On the
          ground, Adam BEATS THE LIVING HELL out of Blaine, messing up
          his face. It makes the Jared Leto scene from Fight Club look
          tame. Eventually, Adam's friends pull him off.
          Adam crawls to the Red Bull can and it's empty.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)

                         (DESPERATE)
          Why?
          Lou takes Blaine's pulse.

                         LOU
          Holy shit! You may have killed
          this guy! No wait... wait... I've
          got a pulse. Eh, so much for that.
          Nick puts his hand on Adam's shoulder.

                         NICK
          I'm sorry man. I'm really sorry.

                         ADAM
          The Red Bull's gone. He fucked us.

                         JACOB
          Not necessarily.
          Everyone looks toward Jacob.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          The Red Bull isn't really gone.
          (points to Blaine)
          It's in him.
          A beat, as everyone sorta gets it.

                         NICK
          It's worth a shot.

          TIME CUT TO:

          EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - MOMENTS LATER

          Adam, Nick, and Jacob sit in the tub. Adam crosses his
          fingers.
          Lou stands outside the tub, fully dressed.

                         ADAM
          Come on, Lou.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.

                         LOU
          Nah, I'll take a rain check.

                         NICK
          What are you talking about?

                         LOU
          Listen, your lives at home sound
          all beautiful and happy with your
          barbecues and swimming pools and
          "oh, that sandwich reminds of some
          gay shit I did one time."
          Adam and Nick don't look thrilled to be reduced to this.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          But my life back there sucks. And
          in case you haven't noticed, my
          life here fucking rules. So I have
          a coke problem? I'll go to rehab.
          I have no money? I'll stop winning
          sex and start winning dollars.
          Lou DRAGS BLAINE by the foot closer to the tub.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          Guys, I was tailor-made for 1987.
          And you'll excuse me, but I value
          banging young chicks way more than
          all of your friendships combined.

                         (THEN)
          No offense.
          Adam, Nick, and Jacob kinda nod and understand.

                         ADAM
          Yeah, no, I get it.
          Lou goes around and gives them all hugs.

                         NICK
          Makes perfect sense, man.
          Lou squeezes Jacob's shoulder.

                         LOU
          I don't hate you as much as I used
          to.

                         JACOB
          (a little emotional)
          I hate you a little less also.
          Lou LIFTS BLAINE'S LIMP BODY.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.

                         ADAM
          OK, whenever you're ready, Lou.

                         LOU
          One small step for man! One giant
          asshole puking in a hot tub! Here
          goes nothing!
          Lou does the HEIMLICH MANEUVER on Blaine. It takes ONE...
          TWO... THREE THRUSTS until Blaine PUKES IN THE TUB! For a
          second, it's just a BIG SPLASH of VOMIT and nothing else.

                         NICK
          OK, well maybe if we--
          A BRIGHT FLASH CONSUMES THE SCREEN! And when it dies down,
          we see Adam, Nick, Jacob (and the floating puke) in the hot
          tub where we left them.
          Only Lou is missing.

                         ADAM
          What happened? Did it work?

                         NICK
          I didn't feel anything.

                         JACOB

                         (DISAPPOINTED)
          Guys, look.
          They see PEOPLE walking by, wearing COLORFUL FLARED-OUT SKI
          ATTIRE. The place looks the same as it did two seconds ago.

                         NICK
          Dammit. Even the deck furniture's
          the same. We fucking blew it. It
          didn't work.

                         ADAM
          Where's Lou?

          LOU (O.S.)
          Right on schedule!
           Lou walks toward them, but there's a lot that's "off" about
           him, including HAIR PLUGS, JEWELRY, and a SHITLOAD OF PLASTIC
          SURGERY (including a fixed NOSE) that makes him look at once
          older and younger.

                         NICK
          Ahhh!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

                         LOU
          Oh, the face, eh? I was curious
          how you'd react.

                         (DISAPPOINTED)
          Didn't think you'd be scared.

                         ADAM
          Lou?

                         LOU
          You're damn right it's me.

                         ADAM
          What happened?

                         LOU
          You just traveled 23 years in three
          seconds. Took me 23 years. It's
          good to see you guys!

                         JACOB
          We're back? It all looks the same.

                         LOU
          It better! You know how much I pay
          the groundspeople around here? A
          lot. But that's all right, I'm
          fucking loaded. Look at all this.
          Everyone looks confused.

                         ADAM
          Will you fill in some of the blanks
          for me, please?

                         LOU
          I'll give you the short version,
          because time is of the essence.
          First of all, to settle an old bet,
          time most definitely has been
          moving forward. It is exactly
          three days since you've arrived
          here in beautiful Havenhurst.
          Jacob looks at Nick.

                         JACOB
          Told you.

                         LOU
          Secondly, I'm filthy rich. Made
          sports bets. Sued Ace of Base. I
          own most of V
          ermont. (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          I've been reimagining the state as
          my own personal playground. You
          could say I'm a little bit like
          Michael Jackson, except I don't
          fuck kids.
          Two YOUNG HOTTIES walk by and wave at Lou.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          I do fuck them, though. Haven't
          gone above 24 years old in 10 years
          and even then, it was a mistake.

                         (REMEMBERING)
          A horrible mistake.

                         ADAM
          Wait, fuck, Lou what time is it?

                         LOU
          Way ahead of you, Adam. You have 2
          hours to get to New Jersey in time
          for your rehearsal dinner.

                         ADAM

                         (DISAPPOINTED)
          Great, I blew it.

                         LOU
          Not even a little bit. I have a
          helicopter waiting in the parking
          lot and a private jet on my
          airfield five minutes away.
          The guys look stunned.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          I had some time to plan. God, it's
          good to have you guys back!

          EXT. PRIVATE AIRFIELD - AFTERNOON

          Lou's private jet takes off from the runway.

          INT. PRIVATE JET - AFTERNOON

          The guys sit back and enjoy the plush surroundings and the
          beautiful FLIGHT ATTENDANTS aboard Lou's jet.

                         LOU
          By the way, Adam, I hope you don't
          mind. Right after you left, I
          fucked Jennie silly.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

                         ADAM
          Why would she have sex with you?

                         LOU
          You get the big time assist. All
          that talk of her finding the right
          guy who's willing to give up
          everything? Made her wetter than a
          log flume.

                         (SMILES)
          She's all-time top five.

                         ADAM
          Good to hear.

                         NICK
          Lou, I gotta ask you something.

                         LOU
          Time travel paradox.

                         NICK
          Exactly. Aren't there now two of
          you living here in 2010?

                         LOU
          Think really hard about that one.
          What happened to me when I was 19?
          Nick shrugs. He looks at Adam. Suddenly, both their eyes
          nearly pop out of their skulls.

                         NICK
          No way...

                         ADAM
          You went missing and were never
          found.

                         LOU
          Yeah, you're gonna have some
          lingering memories of both
          versions.

                         ADAM
          Wait a minute, what happened to...
          you know. Other Lou.

                         LOU
          You don't wanna know.

                         ADAM
          Lou...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

                         LOU
          The kid sucked, OK? He couldn't
          take even a little bit of
          direction. Pretty soon I realized
          that having two versions of the
          same dude walking around -- as cool
          as that sounds -- didn't make very
          much sense to me.

                         NICK

          OK?

                         LOU
          So I took care of the problem.

                         NICK
          What did you do?

                         LOU
          I had to do it.

                         ADAM
          What did you do?

                         LOU
          I killed myself.

                         ADAM
          Jesus Christ.

                         LOU
          Yeah, it was really some
          existential shit. I mean, here I
          am committing homicide and I'm
          actually committing suicide.

                         NICK
          How could you?

                         LOU
          It was easy actually. For a
          minute, I thought I might be
          dealing with that whole Timecop
          thing. You know, the same matter
          can't occupy the same space at the
          same time bullshit and we both go
          poof? Especially after that whole
          nose thing. But no, it was just a
          murder. I didn't suffer.

                         ADAM
          I don't wanna hear any more.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.

                         LOU
          It was strangulation.

                         ADAM
          I don't wanna hear any more!
          They sit in horrified silence for a bit.

                         LOU
          You'll have to introduce me when we
          get there. Your families won't
          know me. Although I'm sure they're
          huge fans.

                         (ABRUPT)
          So hey, getting married, huh?
          Taking the plunge!
          Adam looks disturbed. Nick looks confused.

                         NICK
          This makes no sense at all.

          INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Lily looks beautiful, surrounded by FAMILY and FRIENDS.
          Still, she looks distant and lonely. Until --
          A LILY (the flower) comes into frame.
          Lily smiles and stands up. She turns around. Adam's
          standing there with a whole bouquet of flowers. Lily gives
          him a BIG HUG AND KISS. When she's done:

                         LILY
          Don't you ever let me take your
          phone again!

                         ADAM

                         (COY)
          I'm here on time. Just like I
          promised.
          Nick sits down next to COURTNEY and Jacob takes his seat.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          (no nerves at all)
          I'm so happy to see you and I can't
          wait to spend the rest of my life
          with you.

                         LILY

                         (TEARFUL)
          Me too!

                         ADAM
          You're the one.
          Lily notices Adam's on CRUTCHES.

                         LILY
          Oh my god, what happened?

          LOU (O.S.)
          My fault entirely, madam!
          The room is ABUZZ with CHATTER, as Lou makes a nearly REGAL
          ENTRANCE, wearing a WHITE TUXEDO.

          GUY AT TABLE
          Hey, it's Lou Blustein!
          The whole room APPLAUDS Lou, as he walks in. Adam and the
          guys can't believe it.

                         LOU
          I was partaking in a little ski
          adventure and I mistakenly wandered
          into your fiance's path. His
          broken leg is my broken heart. My
          most humble apologies.
          Lou scrapes and bows and regally kisses Lily's hand. She
          looks genuinely flattered.
          Lou gets up and whispers to Adam.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          See? I'm awesome here. You
          shoulda stayed out of that tub.

          I was thinking we'd invite Adam and
          Lily over for dinner when they get
          back from their honeymoon.
          That's... if it's OK with you?

                         COURTNEY
          Why wouldn't it be OK with me?
          That sounds nice.

          She puts her head on Nick's shoulder as they dance.

                         NICK
          So... how are your parents?

                         COURTNEY
          Still working hard. I really wish
          they could retire already, but it's
          tough competing with the big
          chains. I mean, they just have the
          one store...

          Adam orders drinks, as his PHONE RINGS. He picks it up and
          in an instant, JACOB IS STANDING RIGHT BEFORE HIM as a VERY

          REALISTIC HOLOGRAM.

                         ADAM
          Ahh!

          This is why we shouldn't have sold
          that iPod.
          Adam puts his hand through Jacob, who speaks with purpose.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          The Japanese have apparently
          cornered the technology sector over
          the past 20 years. We've dealt
          American businesses quite an
          irreparable blow.

                         ADAM
          What does that mean for us?

                         JACOB
          Pretty much nothing for us
          personally. We just get cooler
          phones and iPods and shit.

                         ADAM
          Oh. Great!
          Jacob CLICKS OFF and disappears, as Lily approaches. Adam
          can't help but beam from ear to ear.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          You're so beautiful.

                         LILY
          I know you were only gone for a
          couple days, but I missed you so
          much.
          Adam takes her hand.

                         ADAM
          Come on, let's get out of here. We
          have unfinished business.
          Lily smiles. She gets into it.

                         LILY
          It's about time. OK, what's the
          fantasy?

                         ADAM

                         (GENUINE)
          How about you're the woman I love
          and I'm the man of your dreams?

          my penis.

          with a STUNNINGLY BEAUTIFUL GIRL in her early 20s.
          They finally come up for air.

                         LOU
          So you're friends with the bride?

                         BEAUTIFUL GIRL
          Can you keep a secret? I'm
          actually kinda crashing the party.

          Naughty girl. You're secret's safe
          with me.

                         BEAUTIFUL GIRL
          I'm just in town for a couple of
          nights. I'm actually looking for
          my father. We've never met.

                         LOU
          I'm from here. Maybe I know him.

                         BEAUTIFUL GIRL
          His name is Hank Musselman.
          For a moment, Lou's expression FREEZES. He blinks. Then --

                         LOU
          No, never heard of him.
          He goes back to MAKING OUT WITH HER and we:

          CAMERA DRIFTS ACROSS the eternity of treetops until it FINDS

          A BUNGALOW.
          It's 20x20 square, with a wraparound porch and simple wooden
          shutters. The structure is hidden in a clearing that's been

          Two beds draped in mosquito nets sit on opposite sides of the

          in the other. Their ebony skin glistens in the swampy heat.
          The numbing THROB OF INSECTS fills the silence until

          THE DOOR SOFTLY RATTLES.
          The Teen's eyes fly open. Fear grips his face as he looks
          over at the Man, who is now upright and awake. They hold
          their breath, listening over the DRUMMING CHORUS.

          ANOTHER RATTLE.
          It's louder this time. Unmistakable. The Teen watches as
          the Man pulls a crystal-handled dagger from under his pillow
          and stealthily creeps to the door. The Man cautiously leans
          in and peers through the bamboo slats.
          WHAT HE SEES: The empty porch. No sign of life.
          Relieved, he turns back, opens his mouth to speak when his
          face contorts. He looks down and sees the tip of

          A SERRATED METAL BLADE
          protruding from his chest. As the sword is viciously
          protracted through the door, the Man meets the Teen's haunted
          eyes and whispers his last, desperate word...

                         MIDDLE-AGED MAN
          Run!

          EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

          The Teen's naked feet pound the hot, wet earth as he sprints
          through the maze of trees. Flecks of moonlight ricochet off
          the crystal pendant that dangles around his neck. He moves
          impossibly fast. Faster than any human could.

          A MONSTROUS HOWL
          ECHOES as something otherworldly catches his scent and begins
          thrashing in pursuit. The Teen's face tightens with dread
          and the SHOUTS of his pursuers hammer his ears.
          He doesn't look back, willing himself to survive. He races
          up a verge and fearlessly launches himself off the edge of

          A 100-FOOT-WIDE RAVINE!
          GOD SHOT LOOKING DOWN as the Teen leaps across the abyss. He
          kicks air as he arcs and finally touches down on the opposite
          lip. Chest heaving, he sees the hideous silhouette of

          A HULKING BEAST.
          It's called a Piken and skitters to a stop on the other side.
          It utters a chilling BANSHEE WAIL of frustration. Relieved,
          the Teen turns to make his escape when

                         A HAND
          wraps around his throat. He is effortlessly hoisted by a
          TOWERING MAN with skin as cold and pale as alabaster.

          THIS IS A MOGADORIAN.
          He wears the long red coat of a Commander. We catch the
          briefest glimpse of his cruel magenta eyes as they scan the
          geometric symbol engraved on the Teen's pendant. Silhouetted
          against the giant jungle moon, he triumphantly raises

          A SWORD.
          Its serrated blade ignites with silver flame as it sweeps
          towards the Teen. The boy's DEATH CRY echoes as the CAMERA
          ZEROES IN ON the pendant that glows brilliant-bright.

          FORM CUT TO:

          THE SAME SYMBOL.
          It glimmers to life on the ankle of another TEEN 10,000 miles
          away. His name's DANIEL and he's in the middle of a wild jet-
          ski race with TWO BUDDIES.

          TITLE ON SCREEN: BIG PINE KEY, FLORIDA, USA.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.
          The trio crisscrosses the turquoise sea while a party rages
          on the beach.
          Daniel makes a kamikaze move, whips his jet ski past his
          opponents and victoriously pumps his fist. But his moment of
          triumph is cut short. His face contorts in agony as he feels

                         THE SYMBOL
          searing into his skin. As he leans forward to grip his
          ankle, he cartwheels off the jet ski and viciously body-slams
          across the water.

          EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

          LOOKING UP as Daniel crashes into view. Needles of light
          flicker from the symbol. It's cauterizing into his flesh
          like a brand.

          EXT. BEACH - DAY

          Daniel stumbles through the surf and collapses onto the sand,
          clutching his ankle. He rolls onto his side as a CROWD OF
          PARTYING TEENS gathers. A BLONDE GIRL leans down to help.

                         BLONDE GIRL
          Daniel, what's wrong? Did you
          break your ankle?
          But as she turns him over, she sees the light leaking from
          between his fingers and reels back.

                         BLONDE GIRL
          Oh my God.
          He stares up into the crowd's fearful faces, then staggers to
          his feet and takes off running.

          EXT. INTERSTATE - DAY

          The busy road runs parallel to an expanse of ancient pines.
          Through the trees, we CATCH THE SHUTTER IMAGE of a figure
          outrunning the hurtling vehicles.

          EXT. COASTAL FOREST - DAY

          Trees whip past as Daniel sprints down a sandy track. The
          pendant that knocks against his chest was carved by the same
          hand as the African Teen's, but the symbol is unique. He
          peels off to the right and bursts out onto a long drive.

          A STILT HOUSE
          sits at the end. It's cake-frosting pink and is built right
          on the edge of a coral-white beach.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

          EXT. STILT HOUSE - DAY

          The door flies open and Daniel stands on the threshold.
          HENRI looks up from his bank of laptops that scroll with news
          feeds. He is decades older than his suntanned face betrays
          and you'd be way off if you guessed his accent was French.

                         DANIEL
          Number 3 is dead.
          Henri's eyes narrow with urgency. He is immediately on his
          feet, he kneels at Daniel's side and studies the symbol on
          the teen's ankle. It has stopped glowing but is painfully
          raw. Directly below this fresh wound are

          TWO OTHER GEOMETRIC BRANDS.
          They are the same size, but each symbol is subtly different.
          Time has transformed them into raised, snake-smooth scars.
          Henri's penetrating eyes look up at the shell-shocked teen.

                         HENRI
          Did anybody else see this?
          OFF Daniel's panicked nod...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. BEDROOM - STILT HOUSE - DAY


                         A GECKO
          skitters across the ceiling, its glossy black eyes watch as
          Daniel frantically stuffs his clothes into a duffel bag. The
          walls are bare. No photos, no posters, no personality.
          Henri enters, holding a crate of computer cables.

                         HENRI
          Taillights in five minutes. What
          we can't carry --

                         DANIEL
          -- we burn. I know the drill.

          EXT. STILT HOUSE - DAY

          TIGHT ON A BOX. It's exquisitely carved and inlaid with an
          intricate geometric design.
          Henri carefully hides it under the driver's seat of an old
          Jeep Wagoneer. It's the kind with wooden trim. He looks at
          Daniel who feeds homework assignments into a roaring FIRE.

                         HENRI
          Time to go.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.
          Daniel clicks the SIM card from his cell phone, snaps it in
          two and drops it into the fire. Bitter, he takes one last
          look at the glittering azure sea, then climbs into the Jeep.
          As the engine HUMS to life, CAMERA FOLLOWS

          THE GECKO.
          It darts up the fender, squeezes into the jamb of the trunk,
          and Houdinis into the vehicle with a flick of its tail.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. CAUSEWAY - DUSK

          The Jeep powers across the long elevated bridge. The dying
          sun tints the clouds and the sky in violent apocalyptic hues.

          DANIEL (V.O.)
          This is the part I hate the most.
          The running. But it's the only
          thing in my life that's real. The
          rest is a lie. My name. My
          birthday. Even Henri. People
          think he's my father. He's not.
          His job is to keep me alive.

          INT. JEEP - NIGHT - MOVING

          Henri's eyes scan the rear view, on constant vigil. The
          speedometer never brushes past 60. Daniel has his head
          against the window, brooding, listening to an iPod.

          DANIEL (V.O.)
          We are hiding from the Mogadorians.
          A brutal race that wiped out our
          entire planet, Lorien.

          EXT. USED-CAR LOT - DAY

          Plastic flags whip overhead. Daniel leans against a silver
          SUV and watches Henri negotiate with the DEALER.

          DANIEL (V.O.)
          Only nine children escaped the
          genocide. We were each given a
          number and sent here to hide. I
          don't know where the others are. I
          only know when one of them is
          murdered.

          INT. BATHROOM - MOTEL - NIGHT

          Daniel sits on the edge of a bathtub. He gently unwraps the
          bandage that covers his ankle and fearfully inspects the neat
          scab that has formed over the wound.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

          DANIEL (V.O.)
          I got the first scar when I was
          eight. I woke up screaming. We
          lived in Vermont. The second was
          on a Tilt-a-Whirl at a fair in
          Michigan. I was 12. Yesterday was
          the third.
          His finger traces the lines of the other two scars.

          EXT. INTERSTATE - DAY

          The lush tropical landscape has browned into flat, dormant
          farmland. The silver SUV charges through the bleak monotony.

          DANIEL (V.O.)
          Because of the spell our Elders
          cast, the Mogs can only kill us in
          order. That's the reason I've
          survived this long. But our enemy
          is relentless.

          INT. SUV - NIGHT - MOVING

          Daniel is asleep with his earphones on. Henri glances over,
          his mask of certainty momentarily slips. He looks like a
          soldier heading into a battle he knows cannot be won.

          DANIEL (V.O.)
          Now their hunt has turned to me. I
          am number 4.

          EXT. REST-STOP DINER - NIGHT

          A tired neon sign illuminates the big rigs that RUMBLE past,
          headed to destinations unknown.

          INT. REST-STOP DINER - NIGHT

          Daniel sullenly stares at a stack of untouched pancakes.
          Henri slides into the booth, all business.

                         HENRI
          Florida's clear. I sent a letter
          to the school and there's nothing
          in the papers.

                         DANIEL
          I didn't even get a chance to say
          goodbye.
          Henri keeps going, passes an envelope across the table.

                         HENRI
          New IDs.
          Daniel pulls out his birth certificate, reads the name.

                         DANIEL
          Just when I think you can't get any
          less original, you lower the bar.

                         HENRI
          I'm not interested in originality.
          I'm interested in untraceable.
          There are 335,321 John Smiths in
          the United States.
          (Note: from this point on, Daniel will be called John.)
          John looks at him, then abruptly gets up and storms away.
          Henri drops $20 on the table and calmly heads after him.

          INT. ARCADE - REST STOP - NIGHT

          A row of ancient arcade games blinks. John angrily stabs the
          buttons of a Space Invaders machine as Henri approaches.
          They are alone. John's eyes never leave the video screen.

                         JOHN
          It's been so long since the last
          scar.

                         HENRI
          You got lulled into a false sense
          of security. That's my fault.
          John struggles to keep his temper in check.

                         JOHN
          I liked Florida. I liked having
          friends. I liked feeling normal.
          Henri's face softens with paternal compassion.

                         HENRI
          I wish that you could have a normal
          life -- but you can't.
          Only now does John turn and face him. His eyes blaze with
          frustration.

                         JOHN
          Then why fake it? Why not just go
          hole up in the wilderness.

                         HENRI
          That's exactly what Number 3 did.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.
          John looks at him, confused. Henri pulls up an article on
          his iPhone and hands it to John.

                         HENRI
          It's from an African news site. A
          man and his son went missing two
          nights ago. The locals think they
          were taken by strange beasts.
          John understands the implication.

                         JOHN
          Piken.

                         HENRI
          The Mogadorians are natural-born
          hunters. Blending in is our best
          protection.

                         JOHN
          So we just keep moving from town to
          town?

                         HENRI
          Until I say otherwise -- yes.
          John waits as a TRUCKER passes through the room. His voice
          softens but never loses its intensity.

                         JOHN
          I want to be from someplace, Henri.

                         HENRI
          You are.

                         JOHN
          Lorien's your home, I don't even
          remember it.
          John's tone rubs Henri the wrong way.

                         HENRI
          Like it or not, it's your home too.
          You have a responsibility to those
          who died.

          INT. SUV - NIGHT

          Henri and John climb in.

                         JOHN
          I want a say in where we live.
          (off Henri's face)
          You already picked it, didn't you?

          Henri REVS the ENGINE to life.

                         HENRI
          Cheer up, you're going to be living
          in Paradise.

                         CUT TO:
          A frigid sheet of RAIN POUNDS the sign that's planted on the
          side of this narrow stretch of rural blacktop:

          âWELCOME TO PARADISE, OHIO. POP. 5,243â
          The silver SUV streaks past, its wipers working overtime. It
          kicks up a spray as it speeds down Main Street. The dinky
          storefronts are garishly decorated for Halloween.

          EXT. WOODS - DAY

          The leaves are washed in a thousand shades of gold. The SUV
          barrels along the drive that twists through the woods.

          INT. SUV - DAY - DRIVING

          Henri pulls up in front of a small house. It sits by itself,
          surrounded by trees. Water sluices off the weather-worn
          garage in the yard behind it. A WOMAN steps out of a minivan
          to greet them.

                         JOHN
          She looks even perkier than the
          realtor in Florida.
          A warm smile graces her round face and she's clutching a
          fruit basket. For the record, she is called ANNIE.

                         HENRI
          What's your name?

                         JOHN
          John Smith.

                         HENRI
          Where are you from, John?

                         JOHN
          Arizona.

                         HENRI
          Why did you move to Paradise?

                         JOHN
          Because you're an asshole.
          John waits for a reaction but doesn't get one...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

                         JOHN
          Because my dad needs peace and
          quiet to research his book.
          Henri nods and smiles wryly.

                         HENRI
          This was a lot easier when you were

          12.

          INT. HOUSE - DAY

          The front door swings open and Annie proudly escorts Henri
          and John inside.

                         ANNIE
          Here we are. Home sweet home.
          They scan the faded interior. The place is in desperate need
          of a makeover. A grandfather clock pensively TICKS at the
          end of the hall. Annie remains relentlessly optimistic.

                         ANNIE
          First impressions?

                         HENRI
          It's perfect.
          Annie places the fruit basket on the dining table and begins
          turning on the lights.

                         JOHN
          That's one word for it.
          Stewing, John exits into the hall with his duffel bag. Annie
          reads the strained dynamic.

                         ANNIE
          I feel your pain. I have a
          daughter his age. Apparently, I
          ruin her life on a daily basis.
          John steps back in, holding a sun-faded poster featuring NFL
          great Bernie Kosar.

                         JOHN
          This guy was covering a hole in my
          wall.
          Annie's cheeks blush with annoyance.

                         ANNIE
          I told the handyman to patch that
          before you arrived. I'm so sorry.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.
          Henri is all charm, gently leads her to the front door.

                         HENRI
          Don't you worry about it.
          She nods, grateful.

                         ANNIE
          We'll knock it off the rent. Keep
          the poster, Bernie Kosar brings
          good luck here in the Buckeye
          State.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

          The rain has stopped. The wind RUSTLES the trees. John
          lifts out the last box. As he closes the trunk, he doesn't
          notice the hitchhiking gecko hotfoot it out.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - NIGHT

          Henri is busy setting up his computer station. John dumps
          the box on the floor.

                         JOHN
          That's the last of them. I'm
          hitting the sack.

                         HENRI
          I need a new photo first.
          John crosses and stands against the wall.

                         HENRI
          Say Paradise.
          John gives him a withering look. Henri flashes off a shot.
          The camera is cabled to one of the laptops.
          TIGHT ON LAPTOP: The image of John pixelates onto a digital
          grid and a face-recognition program begins to map his facial
          structure.
          Henri turns to another laptop.

                         HENRI
          I've imputed the new search words:
          Daniel Jones. Big Pine Key.
          Sunset High School. You think of
          any others?

                         JOHN
          Yeah, this place sucks.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.
          Henri swivels to face him.

                         HENRI
          If there's a story or picture of
          you on the internet, this program
          will find it. Our enemy doesn't
          know who you are -- I want to keep
          it that way.
          John nods, knows he's being a jerk.

                         JOHN
          Sand Dollar Beach, that's where we
          were jet skiing.
          Henri types it in when something SCRATCHES at the door.
          Their heads instantly turn towards the sound. Tense SILENCE.
          SLOW PUSH IN ON THE DOOR as another SCRATCH echoes.
          Henri is on his feet. He flicks off the lights and silently
          signals John to retreat down the hall. With the cool air of
          an assassin, Henri unzips a duffel bag and pulls out a sleek
          crystal-handled dagger. As he steps to the door...

          INT. CLOSET - JOHN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          ... John crouches in the dark, clutching a baseball bat.
          Suddenly, the light in the bedroom buzzes back on. He holds
          his breath as the door swings open. He looks up and is
          relieved to see Henri.

                         HENRI
          I found our intruder -- he's a
          little small for a Mogadorian.
          At that moment,

                         A BEAGLE
          slips between Henri's legs. It cocks its head, studies
          John's face, then pads forward and licks his cheek.

          INT. KITCHEN - HOUSE - NIGHT

          The dog greedily laps a bowl of milk.

                         JOHN
          He's starving, doesn't have any
          collar or tags.

                         HENRI
          Must have been dumped.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

                         JOHN
          You know, another pair of eyes and
          ears watching the house wouldn't be
          a bad thing.
          Henri considers the request, nods. John playfully ruffles
          the dog's head.

                         HENRI
          What are you going to call him?

                         JOHN
          Since I need all the luck I can get
          -- how about Bernie Kosar?

                         CUT TO:

          INT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - MORNING

          John enters, dressed in black, ready for his first day of
          school. He dumps his backpack on a chair. Henri places a
          plate with an omelette and perfectly browned hash browns in
          front of him.

                         JOHN
          Wow. You outdid yourself. What's
          up?
          Henri lifts a red backpack into view. John stares at it.

                         JOHN
          I already have a backpack.

                         HENRI
          This one has five days of rations,
          spare clothes, cash and a handheld
          GPS. Keep it with you at all
          times.

                         JOHN
          Henri, come on.

                         HENRI
          Game's changed. You're in the
          crosshairs now. You have to be
          ready to leave at a moment's
          notice. With or without me.
          John stares at the backpack, takes in this new reality. He
          pushes the plate away, snatches the backpack and heads out
          the door. Henri stares at the omelette, tastes a pinch of
          hash browns, then puts the plate on the floor on his way out.
          It takes Bernie 2.5 seconds to race over and start to eat.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.

          EXT. PARADISE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

          Jack-o'-lanterns stare out from the âHALLOWEEN BLOCK PARTYâ
          banner strung across the red brick facade. Henri drives
          away. John slides the red backpack onto his shoulder when he
          hears a FAMILIAR BARK. He turns and is surprised to find

          BERNIE KOSAR.
          The little dog is sitting by the flagpole wagging his white-
          tipped tail. John crosses to him, baffled.

                         JOHN
          Bernie, what the hell... were you
          hiding in the car?
          He scoops the dog into his arms.

          FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
          Hey, I was about to take a picture
          of the little guy.
          John turns and finds

          SARAH HARTE.
          She's his age and is holding an old 35mm Nikon. There is
          something about her unforced beauty that is instantly
          enchanting. John shuffles, uncharacteristically nervous.

                         JOHN
          He's not supposed to be here.

                         (TO BERNIE)
          Go home. Now.
          Bernie hops out of his arms and obediently runs towards home.

                         SARAH
          He's really well-trained. How long
          have you had him?
          John turns away.

                         JOHN
          Sorry about your shot.

                         SARAH
          No worries.
          He begins walking towards the entrance.

                         SARAH
          You just moved into the house on
          Old Mill Road. It's John, right?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.
          John swings back, concerned.

                         SARAH
          Don't worry, I'm not stalking you.
          My mom said she rented it to a guy
          with a son my age. Since I know
          every other face on this quad, that
          had to be you.

                         (BEAT)
          I'm Sarah.
          He nods.

                         SARAH
          Where are you from?

                         JOHN
          Someplace warmer.

                         SARAH
          I don't think that qualifies as an
          actual answer.

                         JOHN
          I need to register.
          She raises her camera to snap a shot of him.

                         JOHN
          Whoa. What are you doing?

                         SARAH
          Capturing your first day, even
          though you're technically six weeks
          late.

                         JOHN
          Please don't point that at me.

                         SARAH
          Afraid the camera's going to steal
          your soul?
          She lifts the viewfinder to her eye, adjusts focus. Annoyed,
          he covers the lens with his hand.

                         JOHN
          What's your problem? I said no.

                         SARAH
          It's only for the yearbook.
          John regains his composure.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

                         JOHN
          I'm not big into having my picture
          taken. Sorry.
          As he heads away, Sarah watches, intrigued. CAMERA TRACKS TO
          REVEAL MARK JAYNE monitoring the encounter. He's the star
          quarterback and his chiselled jaw tenses with jealousy.

          INT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

          Loaded with textbooks, John instinctively bows his head as he
          passes the black eye of a hall security camera and steps to a
          locker. He reaches for the combination lock when

                         A BACKPACK
          viciously sideswipes him. The textbooks scatter across the
          checkerboard linoleum. John sees the culprit is Mark Jayne,
          who offers him a taunting grin. John fights his urge to
          react and watches as Mark struts over to his POSSE OF JOCKS.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          Welcome to Paradise, irony not
          included.
          John looks at the teen standing two lockers down. He's got a
          battered skateboard tucked into his backpack and wears an
          Army surplus jacket. This is SAM GOODE -- genius by birth,
          slacker by choice. He nods after Mark.

                         SAM
          His name's Mark Jayne.
          Quarterback, sheriff's son, he's
          three years into the best four
          years of his life.
          John begins retrieving the fallen books. Sam helps.

                         SAM
          Do yourself a favor -- stay off his
          radar.

                         JOHN
          Didn't know I was on it.

                         SAM
          You were talking to Sarah Harte.

                         JOHN
          She was talking to me.

                         SAM
          Mark and Sarah have been exclusive
          since Freshmen year.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.
          John looks down the hall and sees Mark wrap his arm around
          Sarah's shoulder.

                         SAM
          If there's another guy in her
          airspace, he shoots them down. You
          got a warning shot.
          John piles the books into his locker.

                         JOHN
          Maybe I'll fire back next time.

                         SAM
          Look, you're new, so let me tell
          you how things work in this
          misnamed backwater. Football
          players are gods -- the rest of us
          are mere mortals. If you want to
          survive, keep your head down and
          don't make waves.

                         JOHN
          You sound like my dad.

                         SAM
          Obviously a wise man.

                         (BEAT)
          I'm Sam by the way.
          Sam extends his hand. John doesn't take it.

                         JOHN
          Thanks for the download.
          As he SLAMS his locker shut...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - PARADISE HIGH - DAY

          It's an impressive structure with wraparound bleachers. The
          Junior gym class jogs around the track. John hangs in the
          middle of the pack, with his hoodie up, blending in.
          They pass the GIRLS who are stretching on the pristine field.
          Sarah's eyes drift towards John. The COACH blows a whistle.

                         COACH
          Alright, people. Let's hit the
          gym.
          The assembled teens GROAN and fan off towards the mouth of a
          tunnel that stares out from the base of the bleachers.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.

          INT. GYM - PARADISE HIGH - DAY

          John emerges from the tunnel via a door by the stage. Some
          of his classmates are on the court, passing and dribbling.

                         COACH
          Okay, half court, three on three.
          Girls have this basket, boys have
          that one.

                         CUT TO:
          Two simultaneous games are in progress. John sits on the
          sidelines waiting his turn. He avoids eye contact with Sarah
          who is sitting in the shadow of the basket. However, he does
          notice Mark Jayne enter and approach her.

                         COACH
          New kid, you're up. Show me what
          you've got.
          John steps onto the court and waits for the ball to come his
          way. He steals a glance and sees Sarah and Mark arguing. A
          blur of orange. John swings back and catches the ball.
          Just as he shoots, he's distracted by Sarah's upset voice.

                         THE SHOT
          goes wild, misses the basket but hits the glass backboard
          with such force that it

          SHATTERS.
          Mark and Sarah are inadvertently forced to separate as shards
          rain down. All eyes turn to John, who's annoyed at his
          momentary lapse. TEENS HOOT. The Coach BLOWS his whistle.

                         COACH
          Enough! Hit the showers.

                         (TO JOHN)
          LeBron, grab a broom.
          As the gym empties, John looks over and catches Sarah
          watching him. OFF this silent exchange...

          INT. HOUSE - DAY


          THE INTRICATELY CARVED BOX
          is clutched in Henri's hands. He heads down the hall and
          stops in front of the grandfather clock. Its tarnished
          pendulum sways. He unlocks the glass panel and slots the Box
          out of sight behind the clock's brass face.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.
          Satisfied with the hiding place, he locks the front and takes
          the key. When he turns back, he finds

          BERNIE KOSAR.
          The dog is studying him with his head cocked.

                         HENRI
          Let's keep this our little secret.
          OFF Bernie's inquisitive eyes...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. CAFETERIA - PARADISE HIGH - DAY

          John joins the line. He sees Sarah sitting by herself,
          inspecting a photographic contact sheet. His view is blocked
          by Sam. John rubs his hands which are oddly sweaty.

                         SAM
          First day here and you're already
          destroying school property. So
          much for not making waves.
          John moves past him and grabs a tray. He's flushed and his
          face is now hot and red.

                         JOHN
          It was an accident.

                         SAM
          I hear the real spectator sport was
          Mark and Sarah's blowout.
          John wipes his brow, distracted.

                         SAM
          Dude, you okay?

                         JOHN
          Fine.
          At that moment, Mark Jayne and his buddy, KEVIN, cut in front
          of them. Annoyed, John taps Mark on the shoulder.

                         MARK
          You got a problem?

                         JOHN
          Line starts back there.

                         MARK
          Football players get priority.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.

                         JOHN
          Where's that posted?

                         MARK
          Unwritten rule.

                         (RE: SAM)
          I'm surprised your boyfriend didn't
          tell you.
          Sam puts his hands up and backs away. Mark smirks at John.

                         MARK
          If you don't know your place around
          here, things can get rough.
          John holds his ground.

                         JOHN
          In that case, I guess I better ask
          you where I should sit. I was
          thinking about grabbing that chair
          next to your girlfriend.
          In a flash of anger, Mark whips up his tray, hammers it into
          John's chest, knocking him to the floor.

                         MARK
          You want to talk trash? Let's see
          you back it up.
          John tries to stand, but is suddenly overcome with a wave of
          pain. He looks down at his hands and is alarmed to see

                         LIGHT
          blooming from his palms! He quickly balls them into fists,
          extinguishing the light from view.

                         MARK
          Get up!
          SILENCE has fallen. Still clenching his fists, John rises
          and stumbles out into the hall. OFF Sarah's concern as she
          watches him exit...

          EXT. PORCH - HOUSE - DAY

          Henri is on a ladder, adjusting a hidden surveillance camera
          above the front door, when Bernie starts BARKING. It's an
          anxious, urgent BARK.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.

          INT. HOUSE - DAY

          Henri steps inside and sees the dog is BARKING at --

          THE GRANDFATHER CLOCK.
          A shaft of white light blooms from within. The shadow of the
          swaying pendulum cuts across Henri's face. As he sprints for
          the door...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH - DAY

          Disoriented, John staggers down the hall. Sam catches up.

                         SAM
          Dude, hold up!
          John leans against the wall, keeping his hands out of sight.

                         SAM
          You look like crap. I'll get the
          nurse.
          But as Sam runs off, John heads in the other direction.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. ROAD - DAY

          Henri's SUV roars into view, whipping up a tornado of leaves.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. DARKROOM - PARADISE HIGH - DAY

          Strips of negatives hang on drying lines. John bursts in and
          SLAMS the door. He slips off his backpack, opens his hands.
          TIGHT ON HIS EYES -- the brilliant light from his palms
          shrinks his irises to pinpricks.
          The luminescence is crisp, mercury-glass bright and grows
          stronger every second. Suddenly, the door opens. John spins
          in shock. A figure strides through the blinding glare,
          gently takes his hands and folds them into fists.

          IT'S HENRI.
          John looks at him, confusion and fear etched on his face.

                         JOHN
          Henri, what's happening to me?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

                         HENRI
          Calm down. You're going to be
          okay.
          John angrily holds up one of his luminescent hands.

                         JOHN
          On what planet is this okay?

                         HENRI
          Yours.

                         (BEAT)
          I need to get you out of here.

          INT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH - DAY

          John steps out of the darkroom wearing Henri's heavy coat.
          His hands are balled and stuffed into the pockets. Henri
          leads him quickly down the hall.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. SUV - DAY - MOVING

          John fearfully studies his hands which have returned to
          normal, then looks over at Henri who seems oddly calm.

                         JOHN
          Okay, start talking. What the
          hell's going on?

                         HENRI
          Your first Legacy is starting to
          manifest.

                         JOHN
          Legacy?

                         HENRI
          An extraordinary ability. Yours is
          called Lumen. They start a lot
          sooner on Lorien. I was beginning
          to fear yours would never emerge.

                         JOHN
          You knew this was going to happen?
          Why didn't you say anything?

                         HENRI
          I didn't want to worry you. You
          were already under enough pressure.

                         (SINCERE)
          I'm sorry.
          John acknowledges the apology, but looks at him, suspicious.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

                         JOHN
          What else have you been hiding from
          me?

                         CUT TO:

          INT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - NIGHT

          The curtains are drawn. Bernie Kosar dozes on the couch
          while John and Henri sit at the table, staring at the Box.

                         HENRI
          This couldn't be opened until your
          first Legacy appeared. Ready?
          John nods nervously. Henri places the fingertips of his
          right hand onto five petal-shaped discs inlaid onto the lid.
          John cautiously follows suit and places his fingers on the
          âpetalsâ fanned across the opposite side.

                         THE DISCS
          momentarily glow and a SHARP CLICK echoes from within. John
          and Henri pull their hands away and watch as the Box
          miraculously comes to life. Fissures of light sweep across
          the lines of inlaid stone, dividing the lid into sections
          that begin to twist and reform like high-tech origami.

                         JOHN
          Whoa.
          PUSH IN ON Bernie as he sits up and watches the Box unfold.
          Like an intricate jigsaw, the sections finally regroup,
          creating a new pattern on the lid. It's a familiar geometric
          symbol. John touches the crystal pendant that hangs from his
          neck -- the symbols are an exact match.

                         HENRI
          Open it.
          John nods, cautiously lifts the lid, revealing a neat
          assortment of velvet pouches and an array of colored rocks.
          They range in size and color but all share a serene beauty.

                         JOHN
          What are they?

                         HENRI
          Crystals from Lorien's core.
          They'll guide us in your training.
          John tries to reach for one, but Henri slaps his hand away.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.

                         HENRI
          Place your hand over them.
          John follows the instruction and is amazed when a walnut-
          sized crystal floats up from the Box. It slowly begins to
          spin and project

          A SWIRLING HOLOGRAPHIC GALAXY.

                         HENRI
          Our solar system.
          Henri points to a planet. Its oceans are dark with pollution
          and its sprawling continents are barren and treeless.

                         HENRI
          That's what Lorien looked like
          thousands of years ago. We had all
          the problems that Earth has today.
          The planet was dying until our
          people made a collective decision
          to change and slowly Lorien began
          to heal itself -- that's when the
          Legacies started.
          John watches as the spinning planet transforms before his
          eyes. Its oceans turn a vibrant chroma-key blue and the land
          masses become a lush emerald green.

                         HENRI
          Only a select few developed these
          abilities. They became known as
          the Garde.

                         JOHN
          That's what I am?

                         HENRI
          Like your parents and grandparents.
          John considers this new information.

                         JOHN
          The other children in the ship...
          Henri finishes John's thought.

                         HENRI
          They're Garde as well. Once you've
          mastered your Legacies, we'll find
          them and face the Mogadorians
          together.
          John looks at Henri, curious.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.

                         JOHN
          What Legacy do you have?

                         HENRI
          I don't have any and never will.
          I'm your Cepan -- a teacher. My
          job is not just to protect you but
          to train you.

                         (BEAT)
          Give me your hand.
          Henri takes one of John's hands and pulls a cigarette lighter
          from his pocket. John flinches, unsure.

                         HENRI
          Trust me.
          Henri flicks a flame to life and sweeps it under John's
          outstretched palm.

                         HENRI
          You feel that?
          Amazingly, the flame harmlessly licks the skin. But when
          Henri moves the lighter further up John's arm --

                         JOHN
          Ouch.
          John jerks his hand away. Henri kills the flame, shrugs.

                         HENRI
          When we're done, your entire body
          will be shielded against fire.
          John rubs his singed wrist.

                         HENRI
          You'll get other Legacies too.

                         JOHN
          Flying would be cool.

                         HENRI
          You don't get to pick them off a
          menu.
          KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. As John spins to the door, the
          shimmering galaxy fades and the crystal drops to the floor.

                         HENRI
          Mogs don't knock.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.
          Henri steps to his computer bank and examines a laptop
          featuring live feeds from a dozen surveillance cameras he's
          installed around the property.

                         HENRI
          It's a girl.
          John looks over his shoulder and reacts with surprise.

          EXT. PORCH - HOUSE - NIGHT

          John opens the door and finds Sarah amped.

                         SARAH
          How'd you do it?
          Her accusation startles him.

                         JOHN
          Do what?

                         SARAH
          Eviscerate the entire senior class?
          She pulls a strip of overexposed 35mm film from her coat.

                         SARAH
          I was in the darkroom before lunch
          and they were hanging on the line
          smiling and looking forward to the
          future. When I got back, I found
          15 rolls of negatives wiped clean.
          John shrugs innocently.

                         JOHN
          I don't know what you're talking
          about.

                         SARAH
          So you weren't in the darkroom
          today?

                         JOHN
          No.

                         SARAH
          Here's a tip. If you're going to
          lie, don't leave a big red backpack
          at the scene of the crime.
          She swings his backpack into view. John is mortified. He
          struggles to find a plausible answer and silently tries to
          quell the feeling welling in his chest.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.

                         JOHN
          I don't know what happened. Maybe
          it's a sign that you should invest
          in a digital camera.

                         SARAH
          Digital sucks. Film tells the
          truth. Clearly, I'm not going to
          get that from you.
          He watches as she angrily heads down the steps and climbs
          into her car. John glances at his palms and is surprised to
          find they are dimly luminescent.

          EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

          Sarah's car sweeps out of the drive and powers towards town,
          unaware of the truck parked in the shadows.

                         MARK JAYNE
          is behind the wheel and watches as her headlights fade into
          the night. OFF his simmering jealousy...

          INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

          Bernie Kosar waits expectantly as Henri pours âDoggie Chowâ
          into a bowl. John steps in.

                         HENRI

          She was returning my backpack.
          He dumps it by the door.

          I think you should stay home from
          school for a couple of days.

          I'm fine.

          Moonlight cuts across Bernie Kosar who is SNORING peacefully

          sits up, unable to sleep.

          Nursing a mug of black coffee, Henri diligently scans the
          laptop screens. He's clearly never gone to bed. He looks up
          as John enters wearing track gear.

                         JOHN
          I'm going for a run.
          Bernie trots out and wags his tail pleadingly.

                         JOHN
          Sorry, buddy, you couldn't keep up.

          I think you have the wrong room.
          She rises, walks past him and begins searching the photos

          Seriously, Sarah, what's up with
          this guy?

                         SARAH
          I don't have time for this, Mark.

                         MARK
          But you had time to go to his house
          the other night.
          Sarah looks at him, stunned by the admission.

          can't even speak to you right now.

          Wasn't feeling well.
          They twist their combination locks. Sam swings open his
          door, there's a HISSING POP and

          A RED INK PACK EXPLODES.
          It's the kind banks use to foil heists. In a shocking
          instant, Sam and the contents of his locker are splattered.
          It bears a gruesome resemblance to arterial spray.

                         JOHN
          has his door halfway open and ducks back a second before the
          ink pack planted in his locker ERUPTS. The spray misses his
          face but violently spits across his chest and arms. LAUGHTER
          echoes behind them. John spins and finds Mark and his posse.

          buddies back into the CROWD OF TEENS that has gathered. John
          leans in close.

          That sensation you're feeling --
          remember it.
          With a quick push, John shoves Mark back against the lockers.
          Mark DENTS a door and slides to the floor, his eyes flaring
          with lacerated pride.

                         JOHN
          Show's over.
          The crowd disperses. Mark gets to his feet and exits with
          his friends, but shoots John one final wounded glare...

          back there. Awesome move.
          John acknowledges that with a nod. Whip-dries his shirt.

          Who's in the picture?
          Sam stares at it, nostalgic.

                         (DEADPAN)
          Sounds like a fun vacation.

                         SAM
          I know. Insane. He called himself
          an anthropologist even though he
          only made it through one semester
          of college.
          He rises and tosses the ruined picture into the trash.

                         SAM
          Always thought he'd come back one
          day -- who was I kidding. The
          guy's a joke.
          As the BELL RINGS...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. PARADISE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

          The football stadium rises like a monolith in the background.
          John strides towards the tree line, headed home.

          SARAH (O.S.)
          John.
          He turns in surprise as Sarah approaches.

                         SARAH
          I heard about the lockers. I'm
          sorry.

                         JOHN
          I'll live.
          He starts off again.

                         SARAH
          I broke up with Mark.
          He stops, slowly turns back.

                         SARAH
          I've been thinking about doing it
          for a while... today just finally
          pushed me over the edge.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.
          He studies her face.

                         JOHN
          Why are you telling me?
          She bows her head, suddenly embarrassed.

                         SARAH
          I don't know.

                         JOHN
          You made the right call.
          The certainty of his voice soothes her. She looks up and
          holds his gaze. Their attraction is undeniable.

                         SARAH
          Halloween Block Party's tonight.

                         JOHN
          I saw the banners.

                         SARAH
          I'll be on Main Street hiding
          behind my camera if you want to
          swing by.
          He says nothing.

                         SARAH
          I wasn't expecting an actual
          response. I could text you later.
          Do they have cell phones on Planet
          John?
          She holds out her phone. John looks at it tentatively, then
          takes it. As he inputs his number, he hears the BLARE of a
          car horn, looks up and sees Henri waiting in his SUV.

          INT. SUV - DAY

          John climbs in.

                         HENRI
          Wasn't that your friend from the
          other night?

                         JOHN
          Her name's Sarah.

                         (ANNOYED)
          I didn't ask for a ride home.

                         HENRI
          Principal called. Said there was
          an incident.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.
          John stares out the window, guilty.

                         JOHN
          A guy was messing with me. I took
          care of it. Problem solved.

                         HENRI
          You're stronger and faster because
          of Earth's gravity -- you shouldn't
          use that advantage to settle petty
          scores.

                         JOHN
          It was no big deal. Don't blow it
          out of proportion.

                         HENRI
          You can't risk everything over
          wounded pride.

                         JOHN
          I wasn't looking for a fight. It
          just happened. Get off my back.
          Henri pulls a printout from his coat. John unfolds it.
          ANGLE ON PRINTOUT: It's from the Florida Keynoter website
          and features a photo of the charred stilt house.
          John's gut churns as he stares at the image.

                         HENRI
          Article says it was arson.

                         JOHN
          We were clean. There's no way the
          Mogs can track us here.
          Henri shakes his head, shifts into gear and starts off.

                         HENRI
          They can track us anywhere. I
          think it's time you saw what you're
          really up against.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. GARAGE - DAY

          Sunlight razors across workbenches cluttered with rusty
          tools. Henri and John stand in the middle of the space.

                         THE BOX

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.
          is open on the floor between them. John lifts his hand and
          holds it over the crystals.

          ONE RISES.
          It's white and as thick as two fingers. It floats in front
          of John's face. He tentatively reaches out. When he grips
          it, a shock wave of light blasts out, totally WIPING OUT THE
          FRAME and transporting him into

          A VISCERAL MEMORY.

          EXT. LORIEN - NIGHT

          EXPLOSIONS rock and the SCREAMS of the dying echo. AN OLD
          MAN hustles A TERRIFIED BOY through the murderous
          bombardment. The air is choked with ash and smoke.
          The boy is 7-year-old John. The man is his grandfather.
          Young John glances up and sees

          AN ARMADA OF BATTLESHIPS
          eclipsing Lorien's two moons. The angular hulls of the craft
          are scarred from galactic battles new and ancient and unleash
          an endless crisscrossing FRENZY OF MISSILES.

                         GRANDFATHER
          (in Loric with subtitles)
          Keep moving.

          EXT. TEMPLE - NIGHT

          It wouldn't look out of place in ancient Rome. Young John
          and his grandfather race up the steps.

          INT. SANCTUARY - TEMPLE - NIGHT

          A statue of Lorien's most famous warrior, Pittacus Lore,
          towers in the middle of the chamber. His noble face is
          illuminated in a shaft of flame-tainted moonlight.

          FOOTSTEPS ECHO!
          Young John and his grandfather scramble across the space and
          straight into the path of

          TWO MOGADORIAN SOLDIERS.
          The Soldiers' pallid faces flash with smiles. Swords drawn,
          they move in for the kill when one is skewered in the throat
          by a crystal-handled dagger.

                         MAGENTA LIGHT

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.
          spurts from the wound. The Soldier's body fractures like
          glass and DISINTEGRATES in a shower of embers as he drops to
          the floor. The other Mogadorian spins and trades SPARKING
          sword strokes with

          A CLOAKED FIGURE.
          It's a violent battle of wills which ends when the Cloaked
          Figure kicks up the dead Soldier's sword and impales it into
          the Mogadorian's chest. The Soldier EVISCERATES in a cloud
          of HISSING cinders.
          Young John watches in awed terror as the Cloaked Figure steps
          towards him and pulls back his hood.

          IT'S HENRI.
          He looks younger, the years of hiding have aged him. John's
          grandfather lifts a familiar crystal pendant from his neck
          and places it over Young John's head.

                         GRANDFATHER
          This is your Cepan. Go with him.

                         YOUNG JOHN
          No!

                         HENRI
          Your life is my life now. I will
          always protect you.

                         GRANDFATHER

                         (TO HENRI)
          He must survive.
          A BLAST scorches across the space. Henri spots

          A MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
          hunkered behind a column, his red coat billows behind him
          like a curse.

                         GRANDFATHER
          They are already hunting you! Go!
          Henri plucks a crystal ankle-dagger from his boot, grabs
          young John and charges up. As the Commander breaks cover,
          Henri hurls the dagger.

                         THE COMMANDER
          dives out of its path but ROARS as the blade SPARK-RIPS
          across his right cheek like a hot poker.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

          EXT. TEMPLE - NIGHT

          Henri yanks Young John by the hand. They take off in one
          direction while John's grandfather heads off in the other.

          A MOGADORIAN TRANSPORT CRAFT
          suddenly swoops between them. The HOWLS of its occupants
          ricochet through the night. The heat from its engines washes
          the ground, warping the destruction like a ghastly mirage as
          two bay doors open. Young John looks back through the heat-
          haze and catches a impressionistic view as

                         TWO PIKEN
          leap out. Their reptilian bodies ripple with muscle and
          their oversize heads glint with raptor-like jaws. The Piken
          mercilessly rip into John's grandfather. Young John races to
          help, but Henri wrenches him back. CAMERA PUSHES IN TIGHT ON
          YOUNG JOHN'S FACE as he screams...

                         YOUNG JOHN
          Nooooooooooo!
          THE MEMORY ENDS and we...

          MATCH CUT TO:

          INT. GARAGE - DAY

          TIGHT ON JOHN screaming...

                         JOHN
          Nooooooooooo!
          He drops the crystal and stumbles back. The experience has
          left him traumatized. Henri steps towards him, but John is
          too overwhelmed and runs out.

          EXT. STREAM - WOODS - DAY

          A stone angrily SKIPS across the water. John is about to
          toss another when Bernie Kosar trots into view. He ruffles
          the dog's fur but doesn't turn when Henri steps out of the
          woods and crosses to his side.

                         JOHN
          I saw my grandfather. I saw what
          you did to the Mogadorians -- you
          saved my life.

                         HENRI
          A lot of Lorics sacrificed their
          lives so that you could live.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.
          John is still trying to process the memory.

                         JOHN
          He said I must survive.

                         HENRI
          The Elders had a plan. You weren't
          on that ship by chance. The nine
          of you were chosen for a reason.
          Even if only two of you live,
          together you'll pose a grave threat
          to our enemy.
          Consumed by bitterness, John hurls another stone.

                         JOHN
          You saw what they did to Lorien.
          How can nine or six or two of us
          take on that army? It's hopeless.
          Henri knows he has to pull him out of this mournful funk.

                         HENRI
          I never thought we'd get off Lorien
          alive -- but we did. I didn't know
          how we could survive on a strange
          planet -- but we have. I gave us
          six months before the Mogs found us
          -- it's been 10 years. Don't give
          up now.
          Henri grips John's shoulders.

                         HENRI
          You have the potential to do great
          things. Even if you don't see it --
          I do.

                         JOHN
          How can you put so much faith in
          me?

                         HENRI
          Because your life is my life. If
          you quit, then everything I've
          worked for and sacrificed is
          meaningless.

                         (BEAT)
          Remember -- nothing is inevitable.
          The fragile SILENCE is broken when John's cell phone BLEATS.
          He scans a text.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

                         JOHN
          It's Sarah. The Block Party's
          tonight. I'll say I can't make it.
          Henri sees John is wracked with doubt and confusion.

                         HENRI
          No... go.
          John looks at him, surprised by this paternal gesture.

                         HENRI
          You've had enough for one day.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. MAIN STREET - PARADISE - NIGHT

          A Halloween parade drifts past the CROWDS packing the
          sidewalks. Icicle lights twinkle in the trees. EXCITED KIDS
          in costume zigzag past John. It's small-town Americana at
          its best. ET waddles by holding a JEDI's hand.

          A SLAP ON GLASS.
          John turns and is amused to find Sam standing among the
          mannequins in the display window of a sporting goods store.

          INT. ED'S SPORTING GOODS STORE - NIGHT

          An annoying CHIME plays as the door opens and John enters.
          The store is deserted. The stock needs to be updated and the
          shelves could use a dust. Sam approaches wearing an apron.

                         JOHN
          You work here?

                         SAM
          Not by choice.
          (pointing to sign)
          Ed's my stepdad. He's under the
          delusion that if people eat enough
          candy apples and kettle corn,
          they'll suddenly have the urge to
          buy sporting goods.
          John plucks a hockey mask from the basket on the counter.

                         SAM
          I put those on special tonight for
          any wannabe Jason Voorhees.
          Sam pulls off his apron, revealing a T-shirt emblazoned with
          the words âFuture Supervillainâ.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.

                         SAM
          Screw this. Let me lock up. I'll
          hang with you.
          He steps to the door and twists the closed sign into view.

                         JOHN
          What about your stepdad?

                         SAM
          He hit the tavern at 6:00. He's
          already hammered by now. I'll
          probably find him passed out on the
          doorstep. Every night is trick âr
          treat at my house.

          EXT. STREET - NIGHT

          John and Sam wander past the parade floats lined up along the
          road bordering the woods. Stalls sell hot dogs and cotton
          candy. John subtly scans the crowd.

                         SAM
          She's over there.
          John follows Sam's gaze and finds Sarah taking shots of some
          KIDS dunking for apples. She pulls the camera from her eye,
          sees John and smiles as he approaches.

                         SARAH
          You made it.
          (re: Sam's shirt)
          Like the T-shirt, Sam.

                         SAM
          Guidance Counsellor said I need to
          set goals for myself. Figured I'd
          aim high.
          She looks back at John.

                         SARAH
          What do you think of Halloween in
          Paradise?
          John regards a particularly over-the-top float.

                         JOHN
          They should pull out all the stops
          next year.

                         SARAH
          Well, you haven't had the full
          experience until you've been on the
          Haunted Hayride.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.
          She motions to the picnic area where TEENS are lining up to
          get on tractor-pulled hay wagons. The wagons lurch through
          the mouth of a giant cutout devil and into the woods.

                         SARAH
          Give me a sec.
          She steps to the face-painting booth. It's sponsored by the
          local realtor who is Sarah's mom, Annie. Sarah hands Annie
          her camera. Sam whispers to John.

                         SAM
          I'm impressed.
          Before John can respond, Sarah steps back.

                         SARAH
          You guys ready?

                         SAM
          Three on a wagon might get a little
          crowded. I'll meet you two on the
          other side.
          He gives John a not-so-subtle wink of encouragement. John
          and Sarah join the end of the line and watch Sam head away.

                         SARAH
          Sam's cool.

                         JOHN
          Definitely unique.

                         SARAH
          I haven't really talked to him
          since 8th grade. Mark had a tight
          circle. If you weren't a jock or
          cheerleader, you didn't exist.

                         JOHN
          I'm glad you broke free.

                         SARAH
          Me too.
          OFF their growing connection...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

          The path is lined with human heads piked to wooden stakes.
          SCREAMS, WAILS and GHOULISH HOWLS boom from hidden speakers.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.
          OMINOUS POV: WATCHES from the trees as a wagon with John and
          Sarah RATTLES into view. It's driven by the GRIM REAPER.

          FIVE GIANT RUBBER SPIDERS
          drop from the trees. Sarah freaks as the arachnids dangle
          over their heads on wires. She rubs her hair, flustered,
          looks over at John, who is coolly amused by the cheap scares.

                         SARAH
          Not even a flinch. None of this
          scares you, does it?

                         JOHN
          I'm trembling on the inside.
          He smiles.

                         SARAH
          You can smile. I was starting to
          have my doubts.
          She takes his hand. They CLATTER past a series of grisly

                         TABLEAUX:
          A TEEN jerks and SCREAMS in mock agony as he is fried in an
          antiquated electric chair.
          A BLOOD-SPLATTERED DOCTOR CACKLES as he hacksaws the legs off
          a CHEERLEADER chained to a gurney.
          A squad of blood-hungry VAMPIRIC FOOTBALL PLAYERS attacks a
          rival team of WEREWOLVES.

          EXT. CLEARING - WOODS - NIGHT

          Ghosts float in the branches as the wagon LURCHES to a stop.

                         GRIM REAPER
          Hell's Gate, everybody off.
          The duo reluctantly clambers off the back and watches as the
          hay wagon circles back the way it came.

                         SARAH
          Once we make it through, we're home
          free.

                         A SKELETON
          pendulums in front of them. Sarah SCREAMS and clenches
          John's hand harder. A pathway of lights floods on,
          illuminating a skull-capped gate. The words

          âYOUR NUMBER'S UP!â

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.
          are scrawled across it in fake blood.

          EXT. TUNNEL - WOODS - NIGHT

          John and Sarah step through the gate and enter a natural
          tunnel of dense, overhanging branches. A fog machine gently
          COUGHS, and spiderwebs stretch across the sides.
          They are about 20 feet into the tunnel when the lights go
          out. Somewhere a CHAINSAW sputters to life. White strobe
          lights suddenly flare on and

          TWO CHAINSAW-WIELDING ZOMBIES
          burst through the gates behind them. The teens take off.
          It's like a flickering scene from a demented silent movie.
          The Zombies have almost caught up when the strobe abruptly
          ends. The SOUND of the chainsaws FADES and John and Sarah
          stop, panting and LAUGHING with relief.

                         SARAH
          That was insane.

          IT'S PITCH BLACK.
          A werewolf HOWLS somewhere in the darkness. Something
          brushes past John's leg. He spins, suddenly unsure.

                         JOHN
          What was that?

                         SARAH
          Just part of the ride.
          He turns, sees a flash of purple light and hears the rustle
          of HEAVY FOOTSTEPS on all sides.

                         JOHN
          Are you sure?
          As he steps forward,

          A THICK BRANCH
          cuts through the dark and viciously SMACKS John on the back.
          He drops to the ground like a sack. Figures emerge from the
          shadows and he hears a DESPERATE STRUGGLE behind him.

                         SARAH
          Let go! Stop it!
          John tries to stand, but a boot CRACKS him in the ribs.
          Another strikes the side of his face. He is surrounded. His
          attackers are brutal and unrelenting. Over the LOOPING
          SOUNDTRACK OF B-MOVIE NOISES, Sarah's muffled SCREAMS DIM.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

                         JOHN
          Sarah! Sa-
          His voice is cut off as a fist SMASHES into his jaw and the
          steel cap of a combat boot SLAMS his groin. John staggers up
          but is viciously kicked back to the ground.
          PUSH IN ON JOHN'S FACE as it hardens with blind rage. In a
          blur of motion he reaches up, grabs two of his attackers by
          their coats and hammers their skulls together. As they drop,
          John spins to meet his other two foes with

          BLINDING PALMS OF LIGHT.
          The assailants are illuminated in the phosphorescent glare.
          They're not Mogadorians but rather

          FOOTBALL JOCKS.
          One is Mark Jayne's buddy Kevin. They're wearing zombie
          makeup and military fatigues and have night-vision goggles
          strapped to their faces.
          John angrily strides forward, palm outstretched.
          NIGHT-VISION POV: Everything is an overexposed blur until --

          WHAAAAM!!!
          John brutally clotheslines one, then pummel-rams Kevin in the
          chest, sending him flying back 10 feet into a tree. Kevin
          slumps, out for the count. John arcs a glowing hand through
          the darkness.

          SARAH IS GONE.
          He plucks up the Jocks' fallen goggles and heads off with
          Terminator-like determination.

          EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

          Sarah is carried through the woods by TWO ZOMBIE JOCKS in
          camouflage fatigues and night-vision goggles. She SCREAMS.

                         SARAH
          Let go of me!
          She futilely tries to wrestle free.

          EXT. PICNIC AREA - WOODS - NIGHT

          Sam is waiting by the exit to the hayride when he hears --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.

          SARAH (O.S.)
          (in the woods)
          Help! Somebody!
          Something about her terrified tone alerts Sam.

                         SAM
          Sarah?
          She doesn't answer. He hesitates a moment, then charges into
          the woods.

          INT. WOODS - NIGHT

          Freaky shadows crisscross as John uses his luminescent palms
          to navigate his way through the labyrinth of trees.

          INT. CLEARING - WOODS - NIGHT

          Sam scrambles blindly through the darkness.

          JOHN (O.S.)

          SARAH!
          Sam turns in the direction of JOHN'S VOICE. He's about to
          head towards it when

          TWO ZOMBIE JOCKS
          trudge into view. Sam darts behind a tree. Suddenly, the
          area is flooded with preternatural white light. He can hear
          the sounds of a SCUFFLE and one of the Jocks flies past and
          CRASHES in a heap while the other SCREAMS.

          JOCK (O.S.)
          You're blinding me! Stop!
          Sam cautiously sneaks a peek, shields his eyes with a hand.
          WHAT HE SEES: John pins the Jock to a tree and holds a
          luminous palm up to the lenses of the teen's goggles.

                         JOHN
          Where's Sarah? Tell me!!

                         JOCK
          Shepherd Falls. Now turn off that
          damn flashlight!
          John rips off the Jock's goggles, then pile-slides him 15
          feet into a rotten stump and takes off in a blur of speed.
          CAMERA STAYS ON SAM. OFF his stunned reaction...

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

          EXT. SHEPHERD FALLS - WOODS - NIGHT

          A rocky promontory overlooks a crescent-shaped waterfall
          which drops into a swimming hole below. The Zombie Jocks
          carry Sarah into view and dump her in front of Mark. She's
          wild-cat angry when she sees him.

                         SARAH
          Are you crazy! Where's John?
          Mark nods the Zombie Jocks away.

                         MARK
          Relax. It's a practical joke.

                         SARAH
          I swear if you hurt him --

                         MARK
          Why do you give a shit?

                         SARAH
          Get out of my face, Mark, you're
          pathetic.

                         MARK
          I'm the best thing that ever
          happened to you and I'm giving you
          one more chance.
          Appalled by his hubris, Sarah turns to leave.

                         MARK
          Don't walk away from me!
          Mark grabs her. Sarah wrenches free, but loses her balance
          and falls back on the ground. Mark's rage is transplanted by
          concern. He steps towards her to help when --

          JOHN (O.S.)
          Back off!
          Mark watches John step out. Blood trickles from a cut above
          John's right eye.

                         SARAH
          John! Are you okay?
          He nods. Mark looks past him, confused.

                         MARK
          Where the hell are Kevin and Joe?
          John holds up a clutch of night-vision goggles.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.

                         JOHN
          They got spooked.

                         MARK
          Hey, those are police property!
          John flings them over Mark's head into the water.

                         MARK
          I'm going to kill you!
          With lightning speed, John grabs Mark's arm, spins him,
          pinning him to a tree. Blinded by rage, John jerks Mark's
          arm up behind his back.

                         SARAH
          John! Stop!
          Mark is in real pain. Transfixed with anger, John keeps
          twisting. Sarah looks at him, pleading.

                         SARAH
          That's his throwing arm!
          But he doesn't stop until she finally steps forward and slaps
          him across the face. Startled, John lets go.

                         SARAH
          Football's all he's got.
          John stumbles back, ashamed, and heads into the woods. Sarah
          offers Mark a look of disgust and follows after John.

          EXT. TREE LINE - NIGHT

          John charges into view.

                         SARAH
          John! Wait.
          Sarah catches up.

                         SARAH
          I'm sorry, I didn't want you to
          break his arm.

                         JOHN
          I'm not mad at you. I'm mad at
          myself.
          She stops, faces him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.

                         SARAH
          I had no idea Mark would pull
          something like that. He has
          seriously gone off the deep end.

                         JOHN
          The guy's in love with you. Wants
          you back.

                         SARAH
          That's not love.
          Their eyes meet in the moonlight.

                         SARAH
          Walk me home?

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. STREET - NIGHT

          It's a picture-book perfect neighborhood. Most of the houses
          are festively decorated with front-yard graveyards and cobweb-
          festooned trees. John walks with Sarah. They come to the
          prettiest house on the block.

                         SARAH
          This is me.
          John stares at the dozen jack-o'-lanterns arranged on the
          porch. They glare back with flickering bucktooth grins.

                         SARAH
          I know. Wait until the Christmas
          decorations go up. My mom decks
          the halls with so many lights, you
          can see our house from space.
          Stray TRICK-OR-TREATERS race past. She motions to the cut
          above his eye, concerned.

                         SARAH
          You should see a doctor.

                         JOHN
          For this? Wouldn't waste their
          time.
          She looks at him, curious.

                         SARAH
          You're not going to tell me how you
          took out those football players,
          are you?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.
          He says nothing. She smiles.

                         SARAH
          I really don't get you.
          She steps closer.

                         SARAH
          But I feel like I can trust you.

                         JOHN
          You can.
          The air is charged.

                         SARAH
          Good night.
          Sarah swings open the white picket gate.

                         JOHN
          Wait.
          As she turns back, John steps forward and kisses her.
          Although taken by surprise, Sarah quickly succumbs to his
          passion. However, as their kiss intensifies,

          THE JACK-O'-LANTERNS
          rise and hover in midair. Sarah has her back to them, but
          when John's eyes momentarily flicker open, he sees the orbs
          grinning back. Startled, he pulls away from her.

                         THE PUMPKINS
          instantly drop and SMASH onto the porch, their candles
          blowing out on impact. Sarah spins and stares at the jack-o'-
          lanterns, pulp oozes through their cracked shells.
          Suspicious, she slowly turns, looks at John for an
          explanation. He does his best to cover his stunned reaction.
          Fat drops of RAIN begin to fall. John puts up his hood.

                         JOHN
          I better go.
          OFF Sarah, watching him melt into the downpour...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - NIGHT

          Rain HAMMERS. Bernie is asleep on a blanket. John creeps
          into the darkness, soaked to the bone, when --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.

                         HENRI
          I heard on the police scanner that
          eight boys were beaten up in the
          woods tonight.
          Henri turns on a light, nursing a mug of coffee. Bernie
          wakes. John pulls off his hood. Henri looks at the cuts and
          bruises on John's face.

                         JOHN
          They won't talk.

                         HENRI
          That was a stupid thing to do.
          What were you thinking?

                         JOHN
          They attacked me. If I hadn't
          defended myself, I'd be in the ER
          right now. Would that have been
          the better choice?

                         (STEPPING FORWARD)
          You've got to start trusting me!
          Emotionally charged, John points his finger at Henri,
          accidentally causing the mug to telekinetically

          EXPLODE.
          Coffee and shards splatter across the floor. Henri looks at
          John, stunned. John shrugs sheepishly.

                         JOHN
          I was getting to that. I got a new
          Legacy.
          Henri absorbs that revelation.

                         HENRI
          Telekinesis. That's a big step.
          Must have been triggered by the
          fight.
          John doesn't correct him, averts his gaze.

                         HENRI
          I need to teach you how to control
          these abilities. We'll start
          working on that tomorrow.
          The conversation is suddenly interrupted by the repetitive
          WHINE OF AN ALARM. They cross to the bank of computers.
          Henri urgently stabs commands into a keyboard.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.

                         JOHN
          What is it?
          Henri pulls up a website.

                         HENRI
          We got a hit on one of the search
          words.

                         (SCANNING)
          It's a paranormal blog. âThey Walk
          Among Us!â
          ANGLE ON COMPUTER: A video buffers into motion. It's
          handheld and jerky. It WHIP-PANS over some sand and joins a
          group of Teens huddled over a figure lying in the surf. He's
          holding his ankle and light seeps between his fingers.
          John's chest pounds with fear as he realizes...

                         JOHN
          That's Sand Dollar Beach.

                         HENRI
          Looks like a cell phone camera.
          There's enough for the Mogs to ID
          your face.

                         JOHN
          Can you take it down?
          Henri remains ice calm and starts typing commands.

                         HENRI
          Working on it.

                         JOHN
          I'm sorry, Henri.

                         HENRI
          This isn't your fault. There's
          still nothing to trace us here.
          Henri glances up from his screen.

                         HENRI
          This could take all night. Get
          some sleep.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. BEDROOM - HOUSE - NIGHT

          John dumps his hoodie on the floor and slumps on his bed. He
          pulls his phone out of his jeans and sees a new text message
          from Sam. He CLICKS it open.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.
          PUSH IN ON JOHN'S FACE as he scans the message with alarm.
          He sits bolt-upright, gripped with dread. He checks the
          message again.

          TIGHT ON PHONE: âI SAW WHAT U DID IN THE WOODS. NEED 2 TALK.

          2NITE. MY GARAGE.â
          JOHN hits delete and clenches the phone in his palm. A bad
          night just got worse.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - NIGHT

          Henri is illuminated by the dirty glow on the computers.
          His fingers work the keys with expert precision. He's so
          focused on the task that he doesn't notice

                         JOHN
          blur ACROSS THE FRAME of one of the surveillance camera
          screens and disappear into the woods.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. SAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          John cautiously approaches. It's a â50s ranch style. The
          garage adjoins the house. The lights are out. RAIN bullets
          off the garage door which is partially concertinaed open.

          INT. GARAGE - SAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          John slides into view. It takes a second for his eyes to
          adjust. A pickup sits under a white tarp. There's no sign
          of Sam until he Boo Radley's out of the shadows behind him.

                         SAM
          I've narrowed it down to three
          possibilities: you're a genetic
          experiment, you're a freak of
          nature, or you're an
          extraterrestrial.

                         JOHN
          I don't know what you think
          happened tonight...
          Sam steps closer, watery reflections ripple down his face.

                         SAM
          Your hands lit up like a firefly on
          crack, you tossed those football
          players around like crash test
          dummies, and you took off faster
          than an Olympic runner.

                         (BEAT)
          Did I leave anything out?
          John silently reels.

                         JOHN
          What do you want from me?

                         SAM
          I just want to know who you are.
          John looks at Sam, realizes he's not going to give up. He
          hesitates, then finally surrenders...

                         JOHN
          I'm a survivor from a planet called
          Lorien.
          Sam absorbs this confession with awe.

                         SAM
          Your dad... he's from there too?

                         JOHN
          Henri's not my dad. He's my
          Guardian. If he found out you knew
          about us, we'd be gone by morning.

                         (PLEADING)
          I don't want to leave Paradise.

                         SAM
          I won't tell anyone.
          John nods, grateful.

                         SAM
          There's something I want to show
          you.

                         CUT TO:
          The tarp is whipped off the pickup truck. It's an old Ford.
          Sam and John stand before it.

                         SAM
          The cops found it abandoned in the
          middle of Route 20, just south of
          White Sands, New Mexico. It was my
          dad's. He went missing six years
          ago. He was on one of his crazy
          fact-finding trips. He believed we
          weren't alone in the universe.
          Sam rubs his hand across the hood, wondering.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

                         SAM
          Mom figured he was having an affair
          and took off. All these years I
          thought she was right. Now you're
          here.

                         JOHN
          That doesn't prove anything.

                         SAM
          It proves he wasn't crazy. I'm
          starting to think that he didn't
          bail on us... that maybe something
          else happened out there -- that he
          was taken.
          The moment is broken by the SLAM of the front door and the
          sound of ANGRY FOOTSTEPS. Sam instantly tenses.

                         SAM
          Guess the bar closed.

          ED (O.S.)
          Sam! Where are you?
          His speech is slurred and aggressive.

          ED (O.S.)
          You think I wouldn't hear you
          locked up early!
          John looks at Sam, shocked and concerned.

                         JOHN
          You going to be okay?

                         SAM
          If he finds you here, it'll be
          worse.

                         (BEAT)
          Go.
          Sam crosses to the door leading into the main house and heads
          inside. SHOUTS erupt almost immediately. John flinches,
          wanting to intervene, but finally turns, hustles under the
          garage door and slips into the night...

          You look wiped.
          Henri turns and smiles playfully.

                         HENRI
          I wasn't the only who was up last
          night.
          John nervously hands Henri one of the cups and lies...

                         JOHN
          Sarah texted me. I went over to
          her house.
          Henri buys the explanation and swings back to his computers.

                         HENRI
          I've tried every trick I know, but
          I can't crack that blog's firewall.

                         JOHN
          There must be a way.

                         HENRI
          We need to find where the site's
          located and take it offline
          manually. The URL source has been
          run through a labyrinth of servers,
          it could take weeks to track down.

                         JOHN
          I want to help.
          Henri takes a gulp of coffee and stands.

                         HENRI
          You can. Get changed.

          TIGHT ON A WELDING TORCH as it's sparked to life.
          Its flame HISSES as Henri sweeps it towards John, who is
          standing shirtless. Bernie watches, curious, as Henri washes
          the flame harmlessly up John's naked arm and torso.

          The walls are now adorned with Thanksgiving banners. John

          of their way, acknowledging the new high school dynamic.

          INT. KITCHEN - HOUSE - NIGHT

          Using his telekinesis, John strains to lift a tennis ball.
          It momentarily RATTLES, then stops. Henri is not impressed.

          EXT. WOODS - DAY

          Bernie darts ahead as John and Sarah walk through a crimson
          cascade of falling leaves. As they kiss, the leaves around
          them freeze midair and slowly begin to drift upwards.

          INT. GARAGE - SAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          John helps Sam with a dusty box. It's stuffed with Sam's
          dad's old papers and books. We CATCH tantalizing glimpses of
          images: Stonehenge, Machu Picchu, the Rings of Saturn...

          REVERSE TO REVEAL: She is watching the cell phone footage of
          John on the âThey Walk Among Usâ blog.

          INT. KITCHEN - HOUSE - DAY

          Under Henri's watchful gaze, John focuses on a tennis ball.
          It RISES. John grins in triumph, causing the ball to drop
          and bounce on the floor. Strike two.

          INT. CAFETERIA - PARADISE HIGH - DAY

          Mark silently stews when he sees Sarah and John sitting

          GO TO JOHN'S DISTORTED VIEW LOOKING UP at Henri as he drops a
          match into the tub. The liquid instantly IGNITES and we
          realize John's lying in gasoline. He sits up, rests his
          hands behind his head as the FLAMES harmlessly lick his face.

          INT. BACK YARD - HOUSE - DAY

          The trees are now bare. John stands 20 feet from Henri and
          nods. Henri flicks the switch of an automated tennis ball
          server. John's face is a mask of concentration as the yellow
          balls fly towards him. He holds up his hand and the balls

          STOP IN MIDAIR.
          It's like they've hit an invisible wall two feet from his
          hand. They hang there. John sees a smile sneak onto Henri's
          face and momentarily loses focus, causing the wall to
          collapse and the balls to drop into the mud.

          I don't see any family pictures

          They died.

          I'm sorry.

                         JOHN
          It takes him a while to warm up to

          Thanksgiving's tomorrow. Why don't
          you bring your dad and celebrate
          with us?

                         JOHN
          I don't know. Are there going to
          be a lot of people?

                         SARAH
          A tsunami of relatives. But don't

          wave. Besides, I want everyone to
          meet you.
          She playfully splashes him. Their faces inch closer. They
          begin making out hot and heavy until Henri suddenly walks in.

                         HENRI
          I've found the --
          Caught in the act, the teens lurch away from each other.

                         JOHN
          Just giving Bernie a quick bath.

                         HENRI
          You're clearly putting a lot of
          effort into it.

                         SARAH
          I better hit the road.

                         (TO JOHN)
          See you tomorrow. Twoish.

                         (GRABBING BACKPACK)
          Bye, Mr. Smith.
          OFF John as she hustles out...

          INT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - DAY

          Henri sits in front of his computers. John enters with
          Bernie, who is wrapped in a beach towel. He begins drying
          the dog in front of the fire. Henri breaks the silence.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

                         HENRI
          I finally tracked the location of
          that blog. It's a house in Warsaw,
          Indiana. About four hours from
          here. I'm heading up there
          tomorrow.

                         JOHN
          Sarah invited us to Thanksgiving.
          I told her we'd be there.

                         HENRI
          Send my regrets.

                         JOHN
          You shouldn't go alone. It could
          be dangerous.

                         HENRI
          I won't risk taking you. I'll
          leave early and be back by five.
          John looks up and sees Henri sitting in solitude.

                         JOHN
          Don't you ever get lonely?
          Surprised by the question, Henri swivels to face him.

                         HENRI
          How could I? I have you.

                         JOHN
          You know what I mean. All these
          years, there's never been anyone.

                         HENRI
          We aren't like humans. Once we
          fall in love, it's for life. The
          pain of separation is unbearable.
          Henri's face clouds with melancholy and he abruptly gets up.
          As he heads into the kitchen John studies him with new eyes.

          INT. KITCHEN - HOUSE - DAY

          Steam billows as Henri washes up. He keeps his back to John
          when he enters. John waits then softly asks...

                         JOHN
          What was her name?
          Henri slots a plate onto the draining board.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

                         HENRI
          Anastasia.

                         JOHN
          You left her to save me.

                         HENRI
          You're not responsible for what
          happened to her -- they are.
          He slowly turns and regards John with deep paternal concern.

                         HENRI
          I looked at her the way you look at
          Sarah.

                         (BEAT)
          She can't come with us when we
          leave -- and we always have to
          leave, you know that.
          John nods, not wanting to deal with that reality.

                         HENRI
          I was hoping to protect you from
          that pain.

                         JOHN
          You can't protect me from
          everything.
          OFF Henri's sad smile of acknowledgement...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. SARAH'S HOUSE - DAY

          The Halloween decorations have been replaced by a
          Thanksgiving display.
          Wearing khakis and a pale blue Oxford, John tentatively walks
          up the front path. The warm sound of LAUGHTER drifts from
          inside. He takes a breath and rings the doorbell.

          INT. KITCHEN - SARAH'S HOUSE - DAY

          It's like a Norman Rockwell cover come to life. Every inch
          of counter space is filled with platters of food.
          John watches Sarah, Annie, and a boisterous ASSORTMENT OF
          RELATIVES put the finishing touches to the Thanksgiving
          feast. KIDS rush in and out in a manic game of tag.
          John is captivated by the sense of family and celebration --
          things he's never known in his own life. Sarah steps over.
          She's wearing a funky-cool vintage dress.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

                         SARAH
          Come on, we're on gravy-boat duty.

          INT. DINING ROOM - SARAH'S HOUSE - DAY

          The table is decorated with garlands of autumn leaves and an
          elaborate pine cone centerpiece. Sarah places the last
          turkey-shaped gravy boat onto the table. She smiles at John.

                         SARAH
          You look dazed.

                         JOHN
          Just taking it all in.
          She crosses.

                         SARAH
          I'm glad you came.
          They tenderly kiss until Annie bustles in carrying a steaming
          bowl of mashed potatoes.

                         ANNIE
          Don't mind me.
          She puts the bowl on the table and grabs Sarah's camera.

                         ANNIE
          Let's get a picture of you two
          lovebirds.
          Sarah cringes as Annie lifts the camera to her eye.

                         SARAH
          Mom. No. John really doesn't like
          having his --

                         JOHN
          It's okay. Let her take it.
          The gesture means the world to Sarah. He puts his arm around
          her. Sarah nestles her face against his. As the flash WIPES

          OUT THE FRAME...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. DINING ROOM - SARAH'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Red candles flicker. Sarah's DAD is expertly carving the
          turkey. Everybody is at the table. John sits next to Sarah.
          She holds his hand under the table. It's Hallmark worthy
          until the carriage clock on the mantel CHIMES.

          IT'S SIX O'CLOCK.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.
          John looks at his phone. No messages. His brow creases with
          concern. He turns to Sarah, whispers.

                         JOHN
          I need to check in with Henri.
          He exits.

          EXT. FRONT PORCH - SARAH'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          John speed dials as he steps out into the cold. He holds the
          phone to his ear. It rings three times and then is answered.

                         JOHN

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Henri?
          CLICK. The call is hung up. Suddenly on edge, John redials.
          This time it's picked up immediately.

                         JOHN

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Henri?

          MAN (V.O.)

                         (OVER PHONE)
          Are you one of them too?
          John reacts to the chilling menace of the Man's tone.

                         JOHN

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Who are you? Where's Henri?
          CLICK. John jerks the phone from his ear and stares at it,
          panicked. He paces, desperate and unsure, then gets an idea
          and punches another number.

                         JOHN

                         (INTO PHONE)
          I need your help.

          INT. DINING ROOM - SARAH'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          The food is getting cold. Everybody is waiting for John.
          Sarah catches her mother's disapproving look.

                         SARAH
          I'll see what's taking him so long.

          EXT. PORCH - SARAH'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Sarah steps out just in time to see John climb into a pickup
          truck. It's the one from Sam's garage.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

                         SARAH
          John!
          He looks back.

                         JOHN
          It's Henri. I have to go. Sorry.
          OFF her confused disappointment as the truck SQUEALS away...

          INT. PICKUP - NIGHT - MOVING

          Sam is behind the wheel.

                         JOHN
          Thanks. I owe you.

                         SAM
          Anything to get out of Thanksgiving
          at my house.
          He offers John a weary smile.

                         SAM
          I checked out that blog on the way
          over. Saw the video. What was the
          deal with your ankle?
          John pulls up his khakis, shows Sam the trio of scars.

                         JOHN
          Death scars.

                         SAM
          They kind of look like the symbols
          in my dad's research.

                         (THINKING)
          You guys don't --

                         JOHN
          Abduct people? No.
          Irritated, he covers them back up.

                         SAM
          How about the ones you said were
          hunting you?

                         JOHN
          They're capable of anything.

                         (URGENT)
          We need to get to Warsaw -- now.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.
          Suddenly, John's cell phone RINGS. He snatches it up, but is
          disappointed to see the name âSARAHâ flashing on the LCD. He
          hits ignore and the truck hurtles into the dark.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT

          It's a dilapidated Victorian. Mist shrouds the yard which is
          littered with junked cars and trash. The pickup crawls to a
          stop in the shadows across the street.

          INT. PICKUP TRUCK - NIGHT

          The teens sit in silence.

                         JOHN
          Number 417. Henri tracked the URL
          to that house.
          Sam scans the street.

                         SAM
          I don't see his SUV anywhere.

                         JOHN
          He would have parked it across
          town.
          Sam opens the glove compartment and pulls out a revolver.

                         SAM
          Stole it from Ed.

                         (BEAT)
          Let's move.
          John yanks Sam's arm away from the door handle.

                         JOHN
          I called you because I needed a
          ride, not a sidekick. If I could
          have run here, I would have.

                         (BEAT)
          Go home. I'll call you when I get
          back.
          OFF Sam as John climbs out alone...

          EXT. WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT

          It's graveyard quiet. John nervously sneaks down the side of
          the house. His breath fogs as he inch-CREAKS up the wooden

                         STEPS TO

          THE KITCHEN PORCH.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.
          He squats in front of the door. He holds up a luminescent
          palm and uses it like a flashlight to sweep the interior.
          WHAT HE SEES: Take-out boxes litter the filthy counter. The
          sink is swamped with dirty dishes. The light washes across a
          semiautomatic sitting by a packet of Lucky Strikes.

          SAM (O.S.)
          See anything?
          Annoyed, John spins and finds Sam creeping towards him.

                         JOHN
          I told you to go!

                         SAM
          They might know where my dad is!
          John realizes Sam is determined. He sweeps his hand back
          over the kitchen door. His palm illuminates a familiar

          CRYSTAL-HANDLED DAGGER.
          It's lying on the counter by the fridge.

                         JOHN
          Henri's here.
          John âturns offâ his palm and reaches for the door handle.
          Sam anxiously swats his arm away.

                         SAM
          Wait! Other than strength, speed
          and night-light, what powers have
          you got?

                         JOHN
          Telekinesis -- but that's a work in
          progress.

                         SAM
          No invisibility, X-ray vision,
          flight?

                         JOHN
          Sam, we drove here.
          Sam takes a deep breath, psyching himself up.

                         SAM
          Okay. I'm ready. Let's do it.
          But as John reaches for the door handle, the kitchen light
          suddenly turns on and a MAN enters. He's built like a
          wrestler and goes by the name of FRANK.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

          INT. KITCHEN - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT

          With a Lucky Strike clenched between his lips, Frank picks up
          the packet on the table and is pissed to discover it's empty.
          He crushes it in his fist and crosses to the door.

          EXT. BACK PORCH - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT

          John and Sam are gone. Frank steps out and locks the door.
          He flicks away his cigarette as he heads down the stairs.
          CAMERA FOLLOWS the butt as it cartwheels into

          SAM'S LAP.
          He's crouched next to John at the side of the porch. He
          frantically begins trying to extinguish the stub. John
          clamps his hand over Sam's mouth and snuffs the cigarette
          between his fingers. Once Frank's safely around the corner,
          John releases his hand.
          The duo silently climbs onto the porch. John squats in front
          of the door. His hand shakes as he holds it out towards the
          lock and concentrates.

                         SAM
          Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.
          There's a LOUD CLICK.

                         SAM
          You just dead bolted it! Way to
          go!

                         JOHN
          New plan -- follow Lucky Strike.
          Text me if he comes back.
          Sam sneaks off after Frank.

          INT. KITCHEN - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT

          TIGHT ON LOCK as the dead bolt turns by itself and the door
          swings open. John cautiously crosses the threshold. He
          holds up his right hand, dims his palm to a dull-blue glow.
          He retrieves Henri's dagger and tentatively heads into...

          INT. HALL - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT

          Everything is filmed with dust. It's freezing and John's
          BREATH FOGS in the hazy aura his palm casts. The naked
          floorboards CREAK. Fear bites as John scans the lifeless
          gloom, not sure where to start.
          TIGHT ON HIS SHOE as it brushes a mousetrap. SNAP!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.
          His breath catches in his throat. He âturns offâ his hand.
          His heart thumps as he waits for something to react to the
          noise. But nothing does. As his eyes adjust to the dark, he
          notices a rectangle of light faintly leaking from the door
          that leads down into...

          INT. BASEMENT - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT

          The ancient stairs sag as John slowly descends. The space is
          illuminated by a single naked bulb. The sound of DRIPPING
          WATER hammers the silence. John scans the rabbit warren of
          rooms and sees a figure chained to a chair in the corner.

                         JOHN
          Henri!
          He races over. But as he reaches for Henri's gag, a YOUNG
          MAN steps out of the shadows holding a baseball bat. John
          turns too late and the bat strikes his left side. He drops
          the dagger as he falls to the floor, his ribs searing. The
          man, BRET, raises the bat again. John focuses his mind.

                         THE BAT
          whips out of Bret's grip and torpedoes towards John -- who
          ducks out of the way as the bat flies past. Confused, Bret
          lurches forward. John scrambles for the bat, clenches it in
          his hand, and swings it into the young man's legs.

                         BRET
          knocks the light as he topples into a column and CRASHES onto
          the cement, out cold. It's over in a violent blur. John
          sits stunned for a moment. The swinging bulb casts surreal
          shadows as he spins back to Henri, telekinetically âunlocksâ
          the padlock securing the chains, and rips off the gag.
          Henri is groggy and his face is swollen from brutal beatings.

                         HENRI
          You shouldn't be here.

                         JOHN
          Your life is my life, remember?
          Henri tries to shake his drug-induced haze.

                         HENRI
          I talked my way in. Thought the
          big guy was buying it.
          He rubs a wound on his neck.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

                         HENRI
          I was asking him about the video
          when the other one shot me from
          behind... some sort of animal
          tranq.

                         (DISPIRITED)
          I'm getting rusty.
          Suddenly, John's phone VIBRATES. It's a message from Sam --

          âGET OUT NOW!â

                         JOHN
          We have to leave!
          John helps Henri up, they race for the stairs when Bret's
          hand grabs John's ankle, tripping him to the floor.

                         JOHN
          Henri!
          Henri smashes his boot into Bret's face, knocking him out for
          good. John staggers up, they spin for the stairs just as

          SAM AND FRANK
          head down them into view. Frank holds the revolver against
          Sam's neck. Their shadows crisscross under the swaying bulb.

                         FRANK
          Stay planted or I'll blow your
          friend's head off.
          Henri looks at John in shock.

                         JOHN

                         (RE: SAM)
          He came to help.
          John and Henri put up their hands. John focuses on the gun,
          but as the light bulb sweeps past, he causes it to EXPLODE.

          THE ROOM PLUNGES INTO DARKNESS.
          Henri body-slams Frank, sending the revolver skittering. But
          as he wrenches Sam to safety,

                         THE KEYS
          to the pickup fly out of Sam's pocket and slide under the
          stairs. John flashes on his palm, casting everything in
          eerie blue light.
          On all fours, Frank scrambles for the fallen weapon. It's
          almost within reach when he is lifted right off the ground by
          an invisible force.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.
          Sam looks over at John, impressed.

                         FRANK

                         (FREAKING OUT)
          You're the one from the video!
          You're the one they're after.
          With tremendous telekinetic effort, John slams Frank against
          the ceiling.

                         JOHN
          Tell me what you know!
          Franks says nothing. John trains his palm light on the big
          man's face. It's like a blinding interrogation lamp.

                         JOHN
          Start talking!

                         FRANK
          I don't know what they're called.
          The one in the red coat said he'd
          kill me if I didn't do what he
          wanted.
          This revelation stuns Henri.

                         HENRI
          The Mogadorians... they've been
          here?
          Frank nods in terror.

                         FRANK
          He told me to call if anyone came
          asking about the video.
          Sweat beads John's face from the mental exertion.

                         JOHN
          Did you?

                         FRANK

                         (RE: HENRI)
          They wanted me to hold your friend
          until they got here.
          Henri urgently retrieves Sam's gun and his dagger.

                         HENRI
          We need to go! Now!
          John âreleasesâ Frank, who drops onto the floor like a whale
          and is knocked out. At that moment, a razor-thin line of
          dust drops from the floorboards above.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

          SOMEONE IS UPSTAIRS.
          John immediately extinguishes his palm. The trio stands
          frozen, necks craned up, ears pricked as the floorboards
          CREAK above them. They are definitely not alone.

          INT. HALL - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT

          FOUR MOGADORIAN SOLDIERS stalk through the house. Their long
          black coats SILENTLY sweep. One sniffs the air like a
          bloodhound and motions towards the basement door...

          INT. BASEMENT - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT

          BLAAAAM! -- the door is shredded off its hinges and flies
          down the stairs. The Mogadorian patrol storms through the
          cloud of splinters. Frank and Bret lie where they fell, but
          there's no sign of John, Henri or Sam.
          Pissed, one of the Mogadorians strides towards a small
          blacked-out window. He punches out the glass with his fist
          and catches sight of Sam clambering over the back fence!

          INT. PICKUP - NIGHT

          John, Henri and Sam pile in.

                         JOHN
          Sam, get us out of here!
          Sam reaches into his jeans, then frantically checks his
          pockets.

                         SAM
          I must have dropped the keys!
          Henri keeps his cool, looks at John.

                         HENRI
          Start the engine.

                         JOHN
          I can't.
          Henri's calm eyes never leave him.

                         HENRI
          Yes, you can.
          John nods, puts his hand on the dash and closes his eyes.
          The engine TURNS OVER but doesn't start. Sam looks up the
          street, panicked, as

                         A MOGADORIAN

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.
          climbs out of a black SUV and storms towards them.

                         SAM
          Hurry up!
          John's brow is furrowed with concentration. The Mog
          unsheathes his sword as he runs. With a superhuman leap, he
          lands on the hood -- TWAAAAACK! John and Henri spin out of
          the way as the sword SHATTERS the windshield and impales in
          the back of the seat, missing them by a mouse hair.
          As the Mogadorian withdraws the sword to strike again, Henri
          sweeps up his dagger and stakes it into the Mog's neck.

          VRRRROOMMM!
          The engine ROARS to life. The Mogadorian tumbles off the
          hood, magenta light spurting from his wound. John turns to
          Sam, who is petrified, and SCREAMS...

                         JOHN

          DRIVE!
          Sam wrenches the shaft into gear and floors the gas. The
          Mogadorian EVISCERATES in a frenzy of embers. The truck
          bursts through the blizzard of sparks and STREAK-PEELS away.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. BASEMENT - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT

          CAMERA TRACKS the swish of a familiar red coat as its owner
          slowly descends the stairs, PANS UP PAST his right hand,
          which methodically twists two meditation balls, TO REVEAL

          THE MOGADORIAN COMMANDER.
          He's the one who slaughtered Number 3 in Africa. His men
          part as he steps into view and crosses to Frank and Bret who
          are chained to chairs. A Soldier stands behind each one.
          Frank looks at the Commander in terror.

                         FRANK
          I called you like I said. It's not
          my fault they got away!
          The Commander steps into the moonlight that seeps through the
          window. We get our first good look at his face. A gnarled
          scar runs down his right cheek, identifying him as the same
          Mogadorian Henri wounded in the escape from Lorien. His skin
          is deathly pale and his eyes have a cold purple tint.

                         MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
          Where did they go?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.
          His accent is thick and his voice is unnerving.

                         FRANK
          How should I know? The kid had me
          pinned to the ceiling.
          The Commander turns to Bret.

                         MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
          Where did they go?
          Bret is too freaked to even speak. The Commander nods to the
          Soldiers. They grab Frank and Bret by the heads and yank
          open their mouths. Frank watches in confused terror as the
          Commander holds one of the meditation balls.

          DOZENS OF TINY RAZOR-BLADES
          suddenly flower open across its surface and viciously spin.
          With cold-blooded calm, the Commander drops the ball into
          Frank's mouth. OFF its terrible DRILL-LIKE WHIR...

                         HENRI
          We're not going back to Paradise.

                         (TO SAM)
          Thank you for your help, but you'll
          never see us again.
          Henri climbs out. Sam looks at John, confused.

                         SAM
          Is he serious?
          John nods, numb.

                         SAM
          What am I supposed to tell people?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

                         JOHN
          Nothing. Forget about us. We
          never existed.

                         (BEAT)

          John silently stews. BIKERS smoke at the edge of the grimy
          pool which is drained for the winter and rattles with frozen
          leaves. Henri steps out of the motel office with a key.

          INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

          Henri lets John inside, chains the door and draws the sun-
          bleached curtains.

          We leave at nightfall.

                         JOHN
          Henri, this is insane. They still
          don't know where we live.
          Henri seethes.

                         HENRI
          It's only a matter of time. They
          know our faces. They saw Sam. How
          long has he known?

                         JOHN
          Since Halloween.
          Henri is floored and hurt by the admission.

                         HENRI
          I trusted you and you lied to me!
          John bows his head, can't meet Henri's gaze.

                         JOHN
          Only because I knew how you'd react
          and I didn't want to leave
          Paradise.
          Henri paces, tries to quell his emotions.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.

                         HENRI
          Now we don't have a choice. The
          Mogs are using humans to trap us.
          From this point on -- no more
          towns. No more schools. We're
          going off the grid until we find
          the others.

                         JOHN
          No.
          His tone is defiant.

                         HENRI
          This isn't a discussion.
          In a flash of pent-up anger, John holds up his hand and
          telekinetically sweeps Henri off his feet and pins him
          against the wall. Henri looks at him, stunned.

                         JOHN
          I'm not leaving without saying
          goodbye to Sarah.
          Henri fixes him with a steel-edged stare.

                         HENRI
          Let. Me. Down.
          Spent, John releases Henri who slides to the floor, shaken.
          The dynamics of their relationship forever changed. Henri
          finally stands.

                         HENRI
          Give me your phone and IDs.
          John hands him his cell phone and wallet. Henri opens the
          back of the phone and pulls out the SIM card. SNAP!

          A CRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPHER methodically catalogs the grim,
          blood-soaked nightmare. He's in a full body suit and
          booties. The flashgun mounted to his camera whitewashes the
          space as a UNIFORM COP appears on the stairs.

                         UNIFORM COP
          The Chief wants to send the morgue
          boys in and seal this tomb.

          Hope they haven't had lunch yet.
          These guys were gutted from the

          He steps over to Frank's body which has been splayed open.
          As he flashes off some shots, the

                         TEEN GIRL
          appears in the corner of his viewfinder. She's kneeling by

          How'd you get in?
          The Girl continues examining Frank's wounds. Totally
          unnerved, the Photographer shouts up the stairs.

                         PHOTOGRAPHER
          Hey, we've got a live one down
          here.
          When he spins back, the Girl is gone, vanished into thin air.

          INT. SAM'S TRUCK - DAY

          TIGHT ON A DIRT DEVIL as it snorts up beads of broken glass.
          REVEAL SAM cleaning the evidence of the previous night's
          adventure. Cardboard covers the missing passenger window.

          EXT. DRIVE - SAM'S HOUSE - DAY

          Sam climbs out of the truck and is startled by Sarah.

          Where is he, Sam?

                         SAM
          I don't know.
          He tries to avoid eye contact, but she is determined.

                         SARAH
          What happened last night? I've
          tried calling him all day. But his
          number's no longer in service.

                         SAM
          Forget about him, Sarah.
          Incredulous, she grabs his arm.

                         SARAH
          I'm not going anywhere until you
          tell me what's going on.

                         SAM
          He left with Henri and he isn't
          coming back. Ever.

                         (PULLING FREE)
          I'm sorry.

          INT. SHOWER - MOTEL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

          John stands under the steaming spray. Eyes screwed shut.
          Naked and lost. TWO LOUD KNOCKS at the door.

          HENRI (O.S.)

          Taillights in five.

          EXT. MOTEL - LATE AFTERNOON

          The GROUP OF BIKERS by the pool has grown four fold. They're
          partying hard. Henri keeps his head down as he passes.

          INT. MOTEL OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

          The FEMALE CLERK stares at the TV mounted on the wall. She's
          watching a local news report about the Warsaw house murders.
          Henri enters. The window RATTLES as a motorcycle speeds past
          and he slides his key onto the counter.

          INT. MOTEL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

          Henri steps in and is annoyed to hear the SHOWER still
          running. He strides to the bathroom door.

                         HENRI
          John?
          No answer. He KNOCKS. Still nothing.

          INT. BATHROOM - MOTEL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

          Henri shoulder-rams the door open. He whips back the shower
          curtain and stares at the empty tub.

          JOHN IS GONE.
          OFF Henri's grim concern...

          EXT. HIGHWAY - DUSK

          The sky is twilight blue. A gleaming Harley ROARS around the
          bend, going full throttle. John is on its back. The wind
          whips his hair. Eyes set forward. Headed back to Paradise.

          Little late for dessert.

                         JOHN
          I need to talk to Sarah.

                         ANNIE
          She's not here. Some friends
          dragged her to a party at Mark
          Jayne's.
          John absorbs this news, turns. Annie steps out after him.

                         ANNIE
          I don't usually pry into my
          daughter's love life, I certainly
          didn't want my mother in mine --
          but Sarah's my youngest and she's
          special to me.

                         JOHN

          EXT. MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          The big, two-story property dominates the end of a cul-de-
          sac. TEENS stream up the drive. Cars are parked end to end
          down the street. CAMERA CRANES TO MEET John as he charges
          into view on the stolen motorcycle.

          INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL - MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          MUSIC THROBS. John works his way through the throng of
          partying TEENS. He passes a RED-HAIRED TEEN BOY recording
          the event on a FlipVideo camera. A hand grips John's
          shoulder. John turns to find Mark Jayne.

                         MARK
          You weren't invited.

                         JOHN
          Where's Sarah?

                         MARK
          She doesn't want to see you.
          John shoves him aside and heads for the sweeping stairs...

          INT. BASEMENT - MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          It's been transformed into a major makeout den. Candles line
          the windowsills and ring the edge of the pool table. TEENAGE
          COUPLES grope in the flickering half-light.

                         JOCK
          Everybody upstairs! Kevin's going
          for the beer bong record!
          The Teens immediately bolt for the stairs. In the giddy
          exodus, one of them accidentally brushes

                         A CANDLE
          onto the white shag rug.

          INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          John heads down the burgundy hall which is lined with family
          portraits. He glances in the rooms as he passes.

          INT. GUEST ROOM - MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Sarah and her friend, EMILY, sit on the bed with Mark's two
          dogs, Abby and Dozer. A wedge of light cuts across them as
          the door opens and John steps in.

                         SARAH
          John!

          She leaps up and hugs him. John waits as Emily exits.

                         JOHN
          I'm sorry about last night.
          She pulls away, her relief turning to anger.

                         SARAH
          No. Not good enough. Sam said you
          were never coming back. What are
          you doing here?

                         JOHN
          I couldn't leave without seeing you
          one last time.
          She looks at him, crushed.

                         SARAH
          So it's true. What's going on?
          What kind of trouble are you and
          your dad in?

                         JOHN
          We're going to be fine.

                         SARAH
          Damnit! Whatever it is, I'll
          understand -- just tell me the
          truth.

                         JOHN
          The truth is I'm not who you think
          I am. You need to forget about me.
          Okay?

                         SARAH
          Why are you acting like this?

                         JOHN
          Because it's the only way to keep
          you safe.

                         SARAH
          Safe from what?
          He turns away, shields her from his torment.

                         JOHN
          Goodbye, Sarah.
          He doesn't look back as he walks out the door. CAMERA STAYS
          ON SARAH as she sinks onto the bed and the dogs comfort her.

          INT. DOWNSTAIRS - MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Party-goers pack the hall and kitchen watching Kevin consume
          an impossible amount of beer through a funnel and hose.

                         TEENS
          Drink! Drink! Drink!
          Drained and numb, John heads the other way and fails to
          notice the smoke seeping from under the basement door.

          EXT. MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          John strides down the driveway, bleak-faced. He's about to
          straddle the motorcycle when he hears a muffled EXPLOSION.
          He looks back and sees

                         SMOKE
          billowing from the side of the house. He bolts towards the
          front door, SCREAMS at a JOCK as he passes.

                         JOHN
          Call 911!
          As he races inside...

          INT. MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          It's total chaos. Smoke and FLAMES plume up from the
          basement. Terrified Teens scramble. John thrashes through
          the crowd, SHOUTING --

                         JOHN
          Sarah!

          EXT. BACK YARD - MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          The panicked evacuation spills out. A window EXPLODES and
          orange flames lick the cold night air. John sees Emily
          stumble out clutching one of Mark's dogs, Abby.

                         JOHN
          Where's Sarah?

                         EMILY
          Went back for Dozer.
          Another EXPLOSION rocks. A COUPLE of drunk Jocks CHEER.
          John looks back at the house. The fire has taken hold with
          incredible speed. The living room curtains are ABLAZE.

          A DOG'S HAUNTING HOWL

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.
          cuts over the sound of the HISSING FLAMES. It's coming from
          the second floor. John charges past Mark, towards the house.

                         MARK
          It's too late. You can't get
          through!
          John ignores him and runs into the inferno.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          FLAMES sprint up the walls and clouds of black smoke spew
          from the sectional sofa. Immune to the heat, John heads into
          the front hall and finds

                         THE STAIRCASE
          is fully engulfed. Fearless, he clambers up the flaming
          steps. His jeans and shirt catch fire. He's almost reached
          the top when the staircase BREAKS AWAY behind him and
          DISINTEGRATES in a cloud of embers.

          INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          It's a raging conflagration. The family portraits blister on
          the walls. John beelines towards Dozer's PLAINTIVE WAIL
          which reverberates over the UGLY ROAR of the fire.

          INT. GUEST ROOM - MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Sarah is crouched by the heavy oak bed that dominates the
          corner of the room, COUGHING, eyes burning from the smoke and
          heat. Dozer is cowered underneath, HOWLING. Sarah
          desperately tries to move the bed but it won't budge.

          CRAAAACK!
          The door rips off its hinges. Through the smoky half-light,
          Sarah watches as John strides into the room, heroically
          backlit by flame.

                         SARAH
          John!

                         (FRANTIC)
          Dozer's under the bed. He's too
          scared to come out!
          John strides forward, grips the bed with one hand and
          effortlessly hoists it. Sarah looks at him, amazed, then
          scrambles forward and gently scoops Dozer into her arms.
          John puts the bed back down.

                         JOHN
          Don't let go of him. I promise I
          won't let go of you.

          As he lifts them...

          INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          The trio heads into the hall just as an 8-foot section of the
          floor collapses in front of them. Unfazed, John sprints
          forward and bridges the hole.
          ANGLE ON SARAH as she stares at the burning chasm in terror
          and grips Dozer tighter.
          John touches down on the other side and doesn't slow as he
          powers down the hall, which is a SHRIEKING tunnel of fire.

          A BURNING BEAM
          breaks free and swings down in front of them. Sarah SCREAMS,
          but watches in stunned amazement as John sweeps it out of the
          way with a telekinetic flick of his hand.

          EXT. SIDE - MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          The second-floor window SHATTERS as John leaps out holding
          Sarah and Dozer. A ROARING tongue of fire whips his back as
          he drops to the ground and touches down with Sarah and Dozer.
          COUGHING and shell-shocked, Sarah puts the dog down.

                         JOHN
          You okay?
          She stares at him, unsure.

                         SARAH
          You walked through that fire
          without getting burned. I saw you
          stop that beam.
          SIRENS wail in the distance.

                         JOHN
          I'll explain everything... but not
          here...
          (offering his hand)
          Sarah... please?
          As they take off into the woods, the IMAGE FREEZES, then
          REWINDS. John and Sarah kneel in the shadows, then FLY
          BACKWARDS up through the window and INTO the burning house.
          REVERSE TO REVEAL the Red-Haired Teen watching playback on
          his FlipVideo camera, amazed. He runs to the back of the
          house and finds Mark.

          INT. WOODS - NIGHT

          John and Sarah walk in SILENCE, dappled in moonlight. He
          catches her staring at him.

                         JOHN
          Please don't look at me like that.

                         SARAH
          I'm sorry. I'm still trying to
          process everything I saw and I keep
          coming to the same conclusion --
          what you did isn't possible.

                         JOHN
          It is for me.

                         SARAH
          Who are you?
          (off his hesitation)
          For once please tell me the truth.
          It's the hardest thing he's ever had to do.

                         JOHN
          My name isn't John. I don't have a
          name, just a number. 4. In fact,
          my whole life can be reduced to
          numbers: like 15 million -- that's
          how many light years it takes to
          get from my planet to Earth. 38 --
          that's how many towns I've lived
          in. Or 3,671 -- that's how many
          days I've been running from an
          enemy that wants me dead. I lied
          to you, Sarah, because I lie to
          everyone. That's how I stay alive.
          Tears of relief brim as he finally reveals his soul.

                         JOHN
          I shouldn't be telling you any of
          this. It's dangerous.
          Emotionally spent, John leans against a tree. She steps
          towards him and brushes her hand down his cheek.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.

                         SARAH
          I don't care. I just want to be
          with you.

                         JOHN
          I want that too. But if I stay you
          could get hurt. I have to leave to
          keep you safe.
          Sarah absorbs the bitter reality, reaches for his hand.

                         SARAH
          There's something I want to give
          you first.

          INT. DARKROOM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT


          A PHOTOGRAPH OF SARAH AND JOHN
          sharpens INTO FOCUS. It's the one Annie took of them at
          Thanksgiving. John and Sarah stand in the eerie red glow.
          She gently tongs the image into a bath of fixing solution.

                         SARAH
          So you'll always remember me.
          With exquisite tenderness they kiss. John's palms shimmer.
          The intensity of the luminescence builds with their rising
          passion. They sink to the floor and the light crescendos in
          an ethereal flash that BLEACHES OUT THE FRAME.

          The spinning lights of a trio of fire trucks FLARE THE LENS.
          CREWS hose down the last smoking embers. A DEPUTY approaches
          Mark, who is standing by a police cruiser.

                         DEPUTY
          The FBI showed up flashing their
          badges. Wanna talk to you.
          As he points to a black SUV that's parked down the street.

          INT. SUV - NIGHT

          Mark climbs in the back. He looks around nervously as the
          vehicle starts off.

                         MARK
          Where are we going? Is this about
          the fire? It was an accident.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.
          Only now do we REVERSE TO REVEAL

          THE MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
          sitting in the back. His face is masked in shadow.

                         MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
          We're hunting for one of the guests
          at your party.
          He holds up a netbook which flashes with the FlipVideo
          footage of John's rescue of Sarah. It's posted on YouTube.

                         MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
          Do you know this boy?

                         MARK
          Yeah, John Smith. But I didn't
          invite him.

                         MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
          He's a fugitive. We've been
          tracking him for some time.
          Mark smirks, vindicated.

                         MARK
          I'll help you find him.
          He points to Sarah's image on the screen.

                         MARK
          He's not at Sarah's, I already
          checked. And one of my dad's
          deputies drove by his house --
          nada.

                         MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
          He poses a great threat to us.
          Where else could he be?
          Mark pulls out his cell phone.

                         MARK
          I've got Sarah's cell number, maybe
          you guys can trace it?
          The Commander takes the phone and passes it to one of his men
          in the front. He looks back at Mark.

                         MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
          Tell me everything you know about
          John Smith.

          INT. SAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Sam is at the kitchen counter, watching the YouTube video on
          his laptop, when headlights bleed through the blinds.

          EXT. SAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Sam steps out and reacts in surprise as Henri emerges through
          the headlight glare.

                         HENRI
          John's not at the house. Is he
          here?

                         SAM
          No, but he's all over the internet.

                         HENRI
          I know.
          He turns back to his SUV. Sam follows.

                         SAM
          Those things from Warsaw -- they're
          coming, aren't they?

                         HENRI
          Go back inside. This isn't your
          fight.

                         SAM
          The hell it isn't. I'm coming with

          The crystal pendant glints against John's chest as he grabs a
          âParadise Highâ sweatshirt from a supply closet and yanks it
          on. Sarah's phone suddenly RINGS, startling them.

                         SARAH

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Hello.
          She listens, then hands John the phone.

                         SARAH
          It's Henri.

          Henri careens through the night with Bernie and Sam.

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Where are you?

          High school.

                         HENRI
          Get out now!
          At that moment, all the POWER in the school DIES and the
          headlights of an SUV flash across the window. Fear registers
          in John's eyes as he realizes...

                         JOHN
          Too late... they're here.

          EXT. SUV - NIGHT

          The Commander climbs out. Mark follows but is distracted as
          a trio of black SUVs speeds into the lot followed by a
          tractor trailer from which inhuman GROWLS echo.

                         MARK
          What the hell's in there?
          He looks back at the Commander who is arming up from the
          trunk of the SUV. Mark glimpses the arsenal of future-tech
          machine pistols, double-bladed swords and heavy-duty daggers.
          He backs away in fearful realization.

                         MARK
          You guys aren't FBI.
          Before he can run, a Mogadorian Soldier grabs him by the neck
          and constrains him. The Commander pulls

                         TWO BANDOLIERS
          over his broad shoulders. The cartridges are made of crystal
          and swirl with purple light. Finally, he slips on his
          trademark red coat and spins towards the school.

          INT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT

          One of John's hands holds Sarah's while the other lights
          their way as they hurtle down the passage. They've almost
          reached the doors when they suddenly fly open and

                         A FIGURE

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.
          struts into view. We RECOGNIZE her as the mysterious Teen
          Girl. She swings up an awesome hand-cannon and FIRES right
          at them. THE BLAST scorches the air between John and Sarah
          but takes out the

                         MOGADORIAN SOLDIER
          who was stalking up the hall behind them! John watches in
          shock as the Mogadorian keels over and SHATTERS into embers.
          John swings back to the Teen Girl as she strides forward.

          SHE IS NUMBER 6.

                         SIX
          You oughta keep your heroics off
          the internet.

                         JOHN
          Who the hell are you?

                         SIX
          Number 6. Where's your Cepan?

                         JOHN
          On his way. Where's yours?

                         SIX
          Dead. The Mogs got her four months
          ago. We had been tracking them.
          She heads past. John and Sarah follow after her.

                         JOHN
          Tracking them?

                         SIX
          We discovered they plan to attack
          Earth. The only thing standing in
          their way is the six of us.
          The revelation hits John like a wrecking ball.

                         SIX
          You know what that means?
          John nods with new purpose.

                         JOHN
          The war starts tonight.

                         SIX
          First we have to get out of here
          alive and find the others.
          Six leads them past the impressive trophy case.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

                         JOHN
          What are we up against?

                         SIX
          There's a commander, a bunch of
          soldiers and two Piken. They'll
          have all the main entrances
          covered.

                         SARAH
          The gym, there's a tunnel under the
          stage.

                         JOHN
          It'll take us out to the stadium.
          Six acknowledges that info with a curt nod. FOOTSTEPS. Six
          grabs John and Sarah by their arms and yanks them back
          against the wall.
          They hold their breath as one of the Mogadorian Soldiers
          prowls straight past. He stops for a moment, then turns the
          corner. Sarah looks across at the mirrored trophy case and
          sees there's no reflection.

                         SARAH
          We're invisible.
          John realizes, turns to Six.

                         JOHN
          You got any other Legacies?

                         SIX
          I can control the elements. You?

                         JOHN
          Lumen and telekinesis.
          More FOOTSTEPS. John turns and watches in horror as the
          Mogadorian Commander and a trio of Mogadorian Soldiers sweeps
          into view. The Commander is holding

          MARK.
          He is ashen with fear. Sarah has to catch herself from
          screaming. John makes a move, but Six holds him in place.

                         SIX
          Stay put. They want to draw you
          out.

                         JOHN
          He's not dying because of me!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.
          ANGLE ON THE SOLDIERS AND MARK. They're heading past the
          trophy case when JOHN'S VOICE booms out of nowhere.

          JOHN (O.S.)
          Mark! Linoleum! Now!
          Mark rips free and hits the deck a second before the trophy
          case EXPLODES. Shards of glass rip into the Mogadorians and
          trophies torpedo off the shelves and impale the aliens
          against the far wall. The Mogadorians SCREAM as they flail.
          John, Sarah and Six break cover. John wrenches Mark to his
          feet and they take off running. They dash around the next
          corner and find

          HENRI, SAM AND BERNIE
          sprinting towards them, followed by two Mogadorians! Six
          raises her hand-cannon, BLOWS one of the Mogs away, while
          John safely leads everybody into...

          Barricade the doors!
          John telekinetically uproots a trio of bookcases that fly
          across the space and block the door. Sarah turns to Mark who
          is totally shell-shocked.

                         SARAH
          What are you doing with them?

                         MARK
          They said they were FBI. That John
          was a fugitive. What the hell's
          going on?

                         SIX
          You've stumbled into a war. So
          shut up and keep your head down.

                         HENRI
          I see age hasn't mellowed your
          attitude, 6.
          Mark turns to John, guilt-wracked.

                         MARK
          I didn't know they were trying to
          kill you.
          (genuine, to John)
          I'm sorry.

                         JOHN
          This isn't your fault -- it's mine.
          He offers Mark his hand. Mark shakes it. Suddenly, Bernie
          begins to GROWL.

                         SAM
          What is it, boy?
          Henri sees where Bernie is staring and realizes...

                         HENRI
          He's telling us to run!
          They take off a second before

                         A PIKEN
          PUMMEL-RAMS through the wall in a shower of bricks, books and
          paper. It utters a glass-shattering ROAR. John looks back
          and sees Bernie bravely holding his ground.

                         JOHN
          Bernie!
          He watches as the beagle sprints forward and launches himself
          at the monster. Bernie clamps onto the Piken's neck. He's
          hopelessly outmatched and holds on for dear life as the Piken
          tries to buck him off. Then something amazing happens --

          BERNIE BEGINS TO MORPH.
          He doubles, triples in size and keeps growing. His features
          become reptilian, gecko-like, his fur turns to spines and in
          a matter of moments Bernie has transformed into a hulking

          ALIEN CREATURE.
          John looks to Henri as the truth of Bernie's origin dawns.

                         HENRI
          Bernie's a Chimera. He came with
          us from Lorien.

                         JOHN
          Guess I wasn't the only one keeping
          secrets.

                         HENRI
          Somebody had to watch you when I
          wasn't around.
          They exit while Bernie and the Piken continue to battle.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.

          INT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT

          John and Henri catch up to the others.

                         SARAH
          The gym's this way.
          A projectile HISSES past John's ear and DETONATES a row of
          lockers -- BOOOOOM! -- it's like an incendiary grenade. The
          paint blisters off the lockers as they are consumed by FIRE.

                         JOHN
          sees two Mogadorian Soldiers hauling heavy-duty weapons that
          use the glass cartridges that glow on their ammo belts. One
          FIRES another round. John telekinetically RIPS a door off
          its hinges. It flies forward, blocks the charge and IGNITES.
          John spins back and SCREAMS --

                         JOHN
          Go! Go! Go!
          They take off. John follows and uses his telekinesis to
          fling cabinets, doors, benches anything he can to block the
          fiery onslaught. But the rounds are coming too fast and a
          projectile SMACKS him in the back. It's like being hit by
          napalm. As FLAMES wash across him, he looks up and snaps on

          THE SPRINKLER HEADS
          that run the length of the hall. A deluge sprays, dousing
          the fire. With his clothes smoking, John tears around the
          corner. The Mogadorians charge after him, but find

          SIX IS WAITING.
          BOOOOMM! BOOOOMM! She blasts them at point-blank range.
          Magenta light gushes from their wounds. Like rain hitting
          hot coals, their bodies HISS as they crack and cinder.

                         SIX
          Keep moving!
          Henri, Mark, Sarah and Sam race out of view. Then John sees
          something emerge through the smoky, water-choked haze.

          IT'S THE SECOND PIKEN!
          It utters a low, predatory GROWL and launches itself forward.
          Oddly, Six doesn't move. She closes her eyes and lays one
          hand on the flooded floor, turning the water to

          ICE!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.
          In a matter of moments, the hall has been transformed into an
          icy tunnel. The sprinklers spray snow. The Piken struggles
          to find purchase in this new frozen environment and slip-
          slides after John and Six, who disappear into...

          INT. CAFETERIA - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT

          CRAAAAACK! The doors are DEMOLISHED as the Piken flails off
          the ice. It takes out a row of tables and chairs and skids
          to a stop. It ROARS in humiliated FURY, and its red eyes
          scan for John and Six who are nowhere to be seen.
          The Piken prowls behind the serving counter. Snow beads off
          its back. Its monstrous nostrils suddenly flare, sensing
          something. It hunches lower and peers at the trays and pans
          that are stored below.
          REVEAL JOHN AND SIX. They're invisible. John clutches Six's
          arm. They're lying between a stack of roasting dishes.
          Threads of foamy drool drip onto their faces as the Piken
          pokes its head further. Its ghoulish red eyes seem to stare
          right at them. With a final frustrated SNORT, it carries on.

          INT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT

          Henri, Sarah, Sam and Mark race into view. Sarah stops,
          panicked and afraid.

                         SARAH
          Where's John?

                         HENRI
          Right behind us.
          He offers her his hand. She's about to take it when

          A MOGADORIAN SOLDIER
          steps out of the shadows. There is nowhere and no time for
          Henri and the others to run. But as the Mogadorian squeezes
          the trigger of his hand-cannon, the wall on his right

          ERUPTS!
          Bernie and the first Piken crash into the hall. They are
          still at each other's throats and don't even notice as they
          steam-roller over the Mogadorian, squashing him like a bug.
          The creatures SMASH through the opposite wall and out of
          sight. It's over in a violent blink.

          INT. KITCHEN - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT

          John and Six sneak through the shadows. She steps to the
          door, but it won't budge.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

                         SIX
          They've blocked it. Use your
          telekinesis.

                         JOHN
          We're not leaving without my
          friends.

                         SIX
          Don't you mean the girl?
          John ignores the jibe and turns back. Six grabs his arm.

                         SIX
          I broke the Elders' spell to find
          you. The Mogs can kill me now. We
          have to go.

                         JOHN
          We stay and fight.
          OFF his determination...

          INT. HOME ECONOMICS ROOM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT

          Henri and Sam crouch behind one station while Sarah and Mark
          hide in the one opposite. Henri pulls a selection of weapons
          from the backpack. He hands one to Sam, looks over at Mark.

                         HENRI
          You know how to use one of these?

                         MARK
          My dad's the sheriff.
          He slides two across the floor. The door opens. They swing
          up to fire but find -- John and Six.

                         JOHN
          Save it for the Mogs. Let's go!

          INT. LOCKER ROOM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT

          Bernie and the Piken pummel the rows of lockers which
          COLLAPSE like dominos. Gashed and exhausted, the battling
          duo SHATTER-SMASHES into

          THE SHOWER STALLS.
          Water SPURTS from a broken pipe. The Piken slips on the
          slick tiles. As it struggles to right itself, Bernie seizes
          the moment and sinks his fangs into the monster's neck.

                         THE PIKEN

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.
          desperately thrashes. Its talons viciously rip into Bernie's
          side. Ignoring the pain, Bernie doesn't let go until his foe
          finally jerks to stillness. As Bernie sinks to the floor, he
          MORPHS back into a beagle and lies spent and bleeding...

          INT. GYM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT

          John leads the group past the bleachers and points to the
          side of the stage.

                         JOHN
          The door's over here. The tunnel
          leads out to the stadium.
          Sarah sweeps back the curtain, revealing a padlocked set of
          metal doors. John holds up his hand, snaps the lock and
          whips the chain free. The doors fly open,

                         TWO MOGADORIANS
          spring out of the dark. One tackles Henri while the other
          blindsides John. Henri struggles until

          BOOOOOM!
          The BLAST cinders the Mog's head clean off. Henri looks over
          and sees Mark holding a smoking shotgun and nods his thanks.
          The second has John pinned when it suddenly ROARS in agony
          and disintegrates into a shower of sparks, revealing

          SIX.
          She sheathes her dagger and helps John up.

                         SIX
          Saving your life. My new hobby.
          Sarah notices a smile of respect flicker between John and
          Six. PHHHHHHT! PHHHHHHT! PHHHHHHT! -- three Mogadorian
          knives razor the air. One impales Six in the shoulder. She
          slumps at John's feet. Henri opens FIRE on the

          THE COMMANDER AND TWO MOGADORIAN SOLDIERS
          who storm towards them. John SCREAMS to Sam and Mark.

                         JOHN

                         (RE: SIX)
          Get her down the tunnel!
          They grab Six by the arms and drag her into the tunnel.
          Sarah glances back at John and follows after them. Henri
          takes out a Soldier. John sweeps up his hand and

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

          THE WOODEN FLOOR OPENS LIKE A ZIPPER!
          The Commander and the other Soldier are sent flying as the
          planks rip free of their nails. John and Henri charge into
          the tunnel. The doors fly shut behind them and the bleacher
          stand rolls forward to seal the entrance.

          INT. TUNNEL - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT

          Sarah is in the lead. Sam and Mark follow, holding the
          wounded Six. They've almost reached the end when

                         A MOGADORIAN
          lurches into the mouth of the tunnel. Without a second's
          hesitation, Sam swings up his gun and BLASTS it. Mark looks
          at him in shock as they race through the embers. Sam shrugs.

                         SAM
          I play a lot of Xbox.

          EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT

          Sam, Mark, Six and Sarah hurtle across the field. When they
          reach the track, Sarah looks back and smiles with relief when
          John and Henri burst out of the tunnel.

                         JOHN
          Don't stop! Get to the woods!
          She nods and exits with the others.
          John and Henri head onto the field after them when

          THE SECOND PIKEN
          leaps out of the mouth of the tunnel behind them. It's
          seriously pissed. It bounds straight towards John. Its
          fangs glint like barbed wire as it launches itself towards
          him. At the last second,

                         HENRI
          nobly shoves John out of the way and is plucked into the
          Piken's jaws. The creature shakes him like a rag doll and
          flings him 50 feet down the field. John watches, anguished,
          as Henri lands in a heap.

                         JOHN
          Nooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
          The Piken pivots, turns its crimson eyes on John. It almost
          seems to smirk. Its fangs are stained with Henri's blood.
          John's face hardens into a mask of rage.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.
          He makes no attempt to flee as the Piken charges. As it
          springboards into the air...
          ANGLE ON JOHN'S HANDS -- as they suddenly clench.
          ANGLE ON THE GOALPOSTS -- as they're SNAPPED clean off their
          bases and fly skyward.
          ANGLE ON JOHN -- as the Piken's shadow washes across him.
          ANGLE ON THE PIKEN -- as it arcs towards John with its mouth
          open and teeth bared. Suddenly, the goalposts spear its
          flanks, impaling it like supersize BBQ forks.
          The three-ton killing machine drops out of the sky and smacks
          onto the 20-yard line. John watches impassively as the red
          life-fire dies in its eyes and its head lolls to one side.

          EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

          The stadium looms in the distance. Sam wrenches the dagger
          from Six's shoulder while Sarah and Mark anxiously watch.

          EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT

          John sinks by Henri's side.

                         JOHN
          Henri.
          Henri GROANS as John cradles his head. His coat is soaked
          with blood and his torso is horribly mauled. John tries to
          drag him to his feet.

                         JOHN
          Come on, taillights in five.

                         HENRI
          I won't be coming with you this
          time. Save yourself.

                         JOHN
          We go together!
          Henri smiles, grateful, but at that moment

          THE COMMANDER'S SWORD
          flies past John and impales Henri in the chest. Henri utters
          a GROAN and his dying eyes meet John's.

                         HENRI
          Find the others.
          His voice is a GRAVELLED WHISPER.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.

                         HENRI
          Your life is my life... always.
          His eyes flutter closed and he slips from John's grip.
          Anguished, John doesn't notice his pendant momentarily
          flicker with a radiant blue light. He angrily spins to face

          THE MOGADORIAN COMMANDER.
          But in a blur of speed, the Commander steps forward, wraps
          his hand around John's throat and plucks him into the air.
          He's flanked by the remaining Soldiers. John's feet kick
          uselessly as he's lifted face to face.

                         MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
          Number 4.
          Three Loric pendants dangle from the Commander's belt like
          mocking trophies.

                         MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
          Your Cepan saved you on Lorien.
          The Commander's voice hisses with cruel certainty. He
          wrenches his sword from Henri's corpse.

                         MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
          But this moment was inevitable.
          The blade shimmers with silver flame as he raises it.
          John's eyes narrow as the sword sweeps towards him. This is
          the moment his adolescence officially ends. This is the
          moment when a warrior is born.
          ANGLE ON BLADE as it SHATTERS into a million pieces, which
          flutter to the ground like glittering confetti.
          John stares at the alien with calm confidence.

                         JOHN
          Nothing is inevitable.

          ANGLE ON JOHN'S HAND AS IT IGNITES.
          The flame is hotter and brighter than 10,000 acetylene
          torches. He grips one of the Commander's bandoliers.
          TIGHT ON THE MOGADORIAN'S FACE as he realizes it's over.
          The glass cartridges detonate in a deadly chain reaction.

          IT'S LIKE A NUCLEAR IMPLOSION!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.
          John, the Commander, the Mogadorian Soldiers, in fact every
          goddamn thing in the stadium is obliterated in the

          SUPERNOVA OF FIRE
          that radiates across the field like a blinding ring of hell.

          EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

          Sarah looks back as the blistering vortex of flame lights the
          night sky. Her breath catches in her throat.

                         SARAH
          Oh my God... John.
          Before anyone can stop her, she takes off running, sprinting
          for the stadium.

          EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT

          It's a smoking ruin. The seats have melted into puddles.
          Sarah bursts into view. She looks across the devastated
          field. The grass has been reduced to a charred black carpet
          of stubble. Nothing remains of Henri or the Mogadorians.

                         SARAH
          John!
          She charges across the broiled expanse, hoping against hope.
          Then she sees John, lying motionless and naked, his clothes
          completely burned away. She stops, puts her hand to her
          mouth to stifle a sob, when he COUGHS and stirs.

                         SARAH
          John!
          Ash swirls like snow as she races to his side. They wrap
          each other in their arms. Neither wanting to ever let go.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. PICNIC AREA - WOODS - DAWN

          The sky is cracked with the first light of day. Sarah is
          dressing Six's wound at a table. Six winces.

                         SARAH
          Sorry, Girl Scout first aid didn't
          cover extraterrestrial dagger
          wounds.
          Six smiles, grateful.

                         SIX
          Thanks.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.
          As the two teens size each other up, CAMERA FINDS Mark. He
          hangs up his cell and crosses to John and Sam, who are
          talking intently by the motorcycles. John is now wearing a
          pair of old jeans and a faded denim jacket.

                         MARK
          The Sheriff's Department is
          starting to put up roadblocks. You
          guys better get moving.
          Six and Sarah join them.

                         JOHN
          You good to go?

                         SIX
          Don't worry about me.
          John nods to Sam.

                         JOHN
          Sam, ride with Six.

                         SIX
          We don't need baggage.
          Sam steps in front of her, determined.

                         SAM
          I have to find out if the Mogs took
          my dad.
          Six turns to John, who is not bending, then glares at Sam.

                         SIX
          You slow us down, I'll shoot you
          myself.
          Sarah looks at John, tries to rein in her emotions.

                         SARAH
          I want to come too.

                         JOHN
          You need to stay here.

                         SARAH
          Why?

                         JOHN
          You could have died last night.
          I'm not putting you in danger
          again. Mark's promised to look
          after you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.
          Tears tumble down her cheeks.

                         SARAH
          I don't want to say goodbye.

                         JOHN
          I'll come back for you.

                         SARAH
          When?

                         JOHN
          When it's safe.
          She bows her head, anguished. He gently lifts her chin.

                         JOHN
          Where I'm from, we only give our
          heart to one person. I've given
          mine to you.

                         (BEAT)
          I love you, Sarah.
          Their lips meet and they kiss. It only ends when John hears
          an URGENT RUSTLE in the woods. They turn and watch as

                         BERNIE KOSAR
          limps into view. Blood mats his fur and his face is
          scratched but he's alive. OFF John's relief...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. PICNIC AREA - DAY

          Sam sits behind Six on her motorcycle. John holds Bernie as
          he straddles his Harley. Bernie morphs into a gecko and
          darts into his pocket. Sarah studies John and Six, unsure.
          John THROTTLES the bike to life, then looks back at Sarah.
          He fights a pang of jealousy when he sees her standing at
          Mark's side. RAIN spits as the motorcycles start off.

          JOHN (V.O.)
          This is the first town I've left
          without Henri. The first one I
          have a reason to come back to.
          John and Sarah hold each other's gaze, desperately trying to
          brand the image of their faces onto their memories.

          EXT. ROAD - DAY

          The bikes blur past the âWelcome to Paradiseâ sign.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.

          JOHN (V.O.)
          He warned me the pain would be
          unbearable if I left her. He was
          right.

          EXT. TEXAS PLAINS - DAY

          A straight stretch of blacktop bisects the sunbaked flatness.

          JOHN (V.O.)
          But I don't regret it. The pain
          reminds me what's at stake.
          A dust trail plumes as the bikes power into view.

          JOHN (V.O.)
          We must find the others and face
          our enemy together. I'm not sure
          how we can stop them. But nothing
          is inevitable. I know that now.
          Thunderheads darken the horizon.

          JOHN (V.O.)
          I am Number 4.
          His eyes are fearless and his face is undaunted by the
          battles yet to be fought. He's ready to face a future
          unmapped and uncharted. Ready.

          FADE OUT.

                         THE END
I, ROBOT

    FADE IN:

1   On a DEEP...DEEP...DARKNESS.                                       1

    A FLICKER. Of LIGHT. Off to the side. Just barely.
    Noticeable. ORANGE...YELLOW...as we realise...It's FIRE...

    A SOUND.   Something SHATTERING...

    Then. A DISEMBODIED VOICE. Muted. We can't quite make out
    What it's saying. As it gets LOUDER. And LOUDER. When we
    finally. Understand...

                         DISEMBODIED VOICE
               You are in danger...

                                               CUT TO:

2   INT. SPOONER'S APARTMENT - CLOSE ON                                2

    DEL SPOONER'S FACE.    His eyes, snapping open.   His face,
    covered in sweat.

    PULL BACK to REVEAL him lying in bed. Sheets, tangled around
    his legs. Alarm clock, playing something relentlessly
    cheerful.

    Spooner slaps it off. Sits up. Wincing. Bends his RIGHT
    ARM. Stiff. He reaches for a BOTTLE OF PILLS. Shakes out a
    couple and swallows them. Trying to forget. That dream.

    You are in danger...

    He rubs his hands over his face. Gets out of bed. His
    apartment, basic. Unremarkable. Bearing the signs of
    someone who lives alone. Shades drawn. A little messy.

3   INT. SHOWER - MORNING                                              3

    Spooner turns his face into the jet of water.

4   INT. BATHROOM - MORNING                                            4

    Shaves with a razor.    Using his left hand.   Knicks the cleft
    of his chin. Shit.

5   INT. KITCHEN - MORNING                                             5

    Stares down at the single egg in a saucepan.      Waiting for it
    to boil.

                                                             2.


6   INT. HALLWAY - MORNING                                          6

    Heads down the hallway. Looping a knotted tie around his
    neck. Kicks some neglected mail from the door and reaches
    for the handle. Takes a deep breath and...

7   EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING                                  7

    ...steps outside. Into the flow of COMMUTERS heading for the
    elevated trains. Elbow to elbow. A river of humanity.

    Spooner moves along, like everyone else. Suddenly. His
    shoulders tense. That feeling at the back of his neck. He
    turns and sees...

    A ROBOT. Just behind him. Humanoid in design, but still
    obviously a machine. Metal and synthetic casings covering
    hydraulic muscles. The thing senses his stare. Looks up
    with a muted WHIR...

                         ROBOT
                   (metallic voice)
               Good day, sir...

    Spooner. Speeds up his pace.     Weaving through the crowd to
    lose the robot.

    We now realise this is THE FUTURE. Towering apartment
    buildings block the sun. The street packed with traffic.
    PEDESTRIANS wearing their computers like form-fitting
    portable offices. Spooner throws a look at his surroundings:

    Up high an INDUSTRIAL ROBOT rolls down the side of a building
    cleaning windows.

    A WORK CREW of oddly-shaped RUBE GOLDBERG ROBOTS efficiently
    repairs the street. No human supervision.

    A ROBOTIC CLEAN-UP CREW. Lumbering along the sidewalk.
    Scrubbing, sweeping. Emptying trash...

    Humanoid ROBOTS dotting the crowd. Following their owners.
    Walking slowly, deliberately. Carrying boxes. Groceries.
    Briefcases.

    Stamped on all the ROBOTS' SIDES, a LOGO:   III LAWS SAFE.

    Spooner stops to wait at a light with other PEDESTRIANS.
    Directly in front of him, a LITTLE GIRL clutches her father's
    neck. She smiles big at Spooner. Front teeth missing.

                         LITTLE GIRL
               Hi.

                                                              3.


                          SPOONER
               Hi.

    But it's not her father. It's her ROBOT CARETAKER.    The
    robot turns. Looks at the girl.

                         ROBOT
               You are not allowed to talk to
               strangers.

    Spooner, disgusted.   Has had enough.   He steps off the curb
    Just as...

    THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL swivels around.   Training its large
    digital EYE on him:

                         TRAFFIC LIGHT
               Please return to the sidewalk.

    Spooner dodges several cars on his way across the street.

                         TRAFFIC LIGHT
               Please return to the sidewalk...

    The traffic signal, tracking him.

                         TRAFFIC LIGHT
               You are in violation of city
               ordinance 14-B726...

    Spooner throws up his hand. Flipping it the bird just as
    SNAP! It takes his picture.

                                                CUT TO:

8   EXT./INT. MONORAIL - MORNING                                    8

    Spooner stepping onto a sleek, densely packed TRAIN. Looks
    down at his feet. A trampled flyer on the ground. From the
    Anti-Robot League: METAL MONSTERS SECRET FACTORY REVEALED!
    A Robot gets up. To offer him his seat. Spooner. Turns his
    back on him as we PULL BACK from the window to REVEAL...

9   EXT. CITY SCAPE/MONORAIL - CONTINUOUS                           9

    The TRAIN hurtling toward DOWNTOWN. Soaring, gravity-defying
    OFFICE BUILDINGS dominate the skyline. Older buildings
    wedged among the new. All protected by huge glass and steel
    shields.

    As we get closer congested roads and freeways begin to
    disappear below ground into a series of subterranean tunnels.
    The "old" streets have become huge, spacious plazas.

                                                             4.


10   EXT. POLICE H.Q. - PLAZA - MORNING                            10

     Spooner moves with the CROWD towards the doors of the aging
     Police Headquarters. Modern additions have been made to the
     original facade -- creating an ungainly architectural mess.

11   INT. POLICE H.Q. - HOMICIDE UNIT - MORNING                    11

     A vast open plan situation room lined on one side by a series
     of glass-enclosed rooms. On the other side a GIANT SCREEN
     with real time video of various streets and buildings.

     Spooner arrives at his desk. Unlike the others, it's a mess.
     A slender computer screen curving along the front of it.
     Several electronic messages say the same thing:

                             SEE ME!

                          LT. BERGIN (O.S.)
                Ever heard the phrase "lead by
                example?"

     Spooner looks up. LIEUTENANT JOHN BERGIN stands in front of
     his desk, holding up a CITATION with a photo of Spooner
     giving that traffic signal the finger.

                          SPOONER
                Doesn't ring a bell.

                          LT. BERGIN
                    (pointing to Spooner's
                     badge)
                It's on your badge.

     Spooner takes the citation.   Drops it into a drawer filled
     with about fifty others.

                          LT. BERGIN
                The traffic division filed an
                official complaint this morning.

                          SPOONER
                The traffic division is a machine.

                          LT. BERGIN
                Look, I know there's going to be an
                adjustment period, Del...

                          SPOONER
                    (interrupting)
                I'll send them a letter of apology.
                Maybe some flowers. A box of
                chocolates...

                                                               5.


     JUST THEN Spooner's phone RINGS.   He throws Bergin a look.
     Then snatches up the receiver.

                          SPOONER
                Spooner, homicide.

                                                 CUT TO:

12   EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS - ESTABLISHING - DAY                        12

     A sprawling glass and metal complex covering many city
     blocks. The entrance is a large plaza filled with PEOPLE and
     ROBOTS.

13   INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - METAL CORRIDOR - DAY                      13

     An elevator opens with a whoosh. Spooner steps out into a
     featureless corridor. His footsteps, echoing. He stops at a
     set of OPPOSING DOORS. Looks over at one, when the other
     suddenly OPENS.

14   INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - PLUSH CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS        14

     A warm, mahogany-paneled room. In sharp contrast to the cold
     metal space outside. Spooner steps inside. At the end of a
     long conference table sits an OLD MAN. Sparkling blue eyes.
     Old-fashioned suit.

                          OLD MAN
                Hello, there. Please come in.

     Spooner hesitates.

                          OLD MAN
                It's alright. You can sit.     Sit.

     Spooner doesn't.   Looks around the room. The Old Man lifts
     up a coffee pot.   Pours some coffee into a single cup.

                          OLD MAN
                Coffee?

                          SPOONER
                    (interested)
                You're offering me a cup of coffee?

                          OLD MAN
                Yes. But you are to say, "No,
                thank you."

     Spooner nods a little. The Old Man raises the coffee to his
     lips, but doesn't take a sip.

                                                       6.


                       OLD MAN
           Coffee?

                       SPOONER
           No.    Thank you.

                     OLD MAN
           As you wish.

The Old Man takes a sip. He doesn't move. There is no
movement except for a whisper of steam rising from the coffee
pot.

                     SPOONER
           You want to tell me something about
           Dr. Hogenmiller? About his death?

The Old Man smiles.

                     OLD MAN
           I want to tell you that his death
           was not a suicide.

                     SPOONER
           And why do you say that?

                      OLD MAN
           Why?   Because I want you to know
           it.

                     SPOONER
           I understand that. But what
           specifically leads you to believe
           that he didn't commit suicide?

                     OLD MAN
               (considers)
           Nothing specifically.

Spooner shifts his weight.   Agitated.

                     SPOONER
           Under normal circumstances that
           wouldn't be enough to get you a
           homicide investigation.

                     OLD MAN
           But this is not "normal
           circumstances," is it, Detective
           Spooner?

                       SPOONER
           No.    It isn't.

                                                               7.


                          OLD MAN
                Then you will find out who killed
                Dr. Hogenmiller, yes? And then you
                will tell me.

     Spooner's losing his patience.

                          SPOONER
                If you were murdered, Doctor, I'll
                find out. And you'll be the first
                to know.....

     JUST THEN the HOLOGRAM of DR. HOGENMILLER vanishes in a burst
     of LIGHT, as does the table, the coffee pot, and the
     conference room. Spooner, suddenly finds himself standing in
     front of a LARGE VIEW SCREEN inside a SMALL METAL CHAMBER.

15   INT. HALLWAY - DAY                                              15

     Spooner steps out into the hallway and into...AN ESCORT
     ROBOT.

                          ESCORT ROBOT
                Please follow me.

     Spooner. Reluctantly starts to follow it.     Passes another
     doorway. POLICE TAPE stretched across it.     Catches a brief
     glimpse of...

     DR. HEINRICH HOGENMILLER'S BODY.

     Splayed out across the floor. Surrounded by CRIME SCENE
     TECHNICIANS. He pauses. Taking in the scene. Then
     continues on.

16   INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - CORPORATE BOARDROOM - DAY                  16

     Two large doors emblazoned with the U.S. ROBOTICS LOGO open
     automatically. Inside, an enormous glass-enclosed boardroom
     looking out over the entire complex.

     Spooner walks through the doorway. His escort robot trailing
     behind him. An army of corporate types sit around a
     conference table. Young. Energetic. You can practically
     feel the brains and ambition.

                          SPOONER
                Usually I ask who's in charge...

     Spooner's eyes lock with a MAN sitting at the head of the
     table. 60s, handsome, charismatic. Dr. LANCE ROBERTSON,
     founder and CEO of U.S. Robotics.

                                                         8.


                      SPOONER
            But everyone knows you, Dr.
            Robertson.

Robertson smiles.   Pretends to instruct his people.

                      ROBERTSON
            Remind me to cut back on my talk
            show appearances.

LAUGHTER.

                      ROBERTSON
            Welcome to U.S. Robotics,
            Detective. I regret you're not
            visiting us under more pleasant
            circumstances. Allow me to
            introduce Mr. Aronson, our head of
            Legal Affairs.

A prematurely graying MAN leaning against the wall.    Nods
hello.

                      ROBERTSON
            And the gentleman to my right is
            Dr. Alfred Lanning, Director of
            Research.

Alfred Lanning, only one there in a tie.   Nods.

                      ROBERTSON
            They'll be available to answer any
            questions you might have during
            your investigation. You'll
            understand how anxious we are to
            resolve this matter -- especially
            before the press gets wind of it.
            There are some anti-robot
            sentiments out there as you know,
            Detective, and we're not eager to
            stir them up. So. Where would you
            like to begin?

                      SPOONER
            We can begin with whether or not
            the old man put a gun to his head
            and pulled the trigger.

A palpable wave of tension shoots through the group.

                      ARONSON
            You don't have to answer that, Dr.
            Robertson...

                                                          9.


Robertson waves him off.

                      ROBERTSON
           Susan?   Perhaps you can assist us
           here?

Everyone looks down at the other end of the table. A BEAT.
Then an attractive young WOMAN gets to her feet. SUSAN
CALVIN. Hair tucked behind her ears. Looking at everyone
but Spooner.

                     CALVIN
           Dr. Hogenmiller was a schizoid
           personality who generally eschewed
           social relationships. Rejecting
           people in favor of solitary
           activities involving machines. He
           spent almost all his time at the
           lab here or at his lab at home. As
           a result he was highly susceptible
           to depression.

                     ROBERTSON
           Dr. Calvin is our Chief
           Psychologist.

                     SPOONER
           If that was your diagnosis, why
           didn't you see this coming?

Calvin turns. Finally meeting Spooner's eye.      As if the
answer's obvious.

                     CALVIN
           This is U.S. Robotics, Detective.
           Seventy-five percent of our
           employees fit that description.

                     LANNING
               (interceding)
           You'll have to excuse the doctor.
           We're all a little on edge. This
           has been a difficult and emotional
           morning.

Spooner throws a look around the room.   Then back at Calvin.

                       SPOONER
           Yeah.    I can see you're all broken
           up.

Robertson responds to Spooner's skepticism.

                                                           10.


                          ROBERTSON
                Dr. Hogenmiller was at my side from
                the very beginnings of this
                company. We developed the "Three
                Laws of Robotics" together. But
                these days science is a young man's
                game. By the time you hit thirty
                your best years are behind you.
                Some of us are kicked upstairs.
                Others I'm afraid aren't so lucky.

     Robertson stands.   Meeting over.

                          ROBERTSON
                Dr. Hogenmiller took his own life.
                I trust you will come to the same
                swift conclusion, Detective. Dr.
                Lanning will make himself available
                if you have any further questions.

     Spooner looks over at Calvin.

                          SPOONER
                I want her to help me.

     Calvin, unhappy with this arrangement.

                          CALVIN
                That's not really my department...

                          ROBERTSON
                    (pointed)
                Susan would be happy to assist you.

     And with a gesture, Robertson dismisses everyone. People
     start getting up, gathering up, filing out. Susan Calvin.
     The last one to get up.

17   INT. METAL HALLWAY - DAY                                      17

     Spooner and Calvin, heading down the same hallway he was in
     before. Catch sight of a couple ROBOT TECHNICIANS...

                          SPOONER
                    (under his breath)
                Ah, Christ...Toasters...

     As they duck under the police tape and...

                                                              11.


18   INT. HOGENMILLER'S LAB - DAY                                   18

     ...enter Hogenmiller's lab. Alive with activity. CRIME
     SCENE TECHNICIANS, MOBILE ANALYSIS UNITS. LIGHT SCANS,
     running across...

     HOGENMILLER'S LIFELESS FACE.   Black gun powder.   Fanning out
     around his contorted lips.

     Spooner. Throws a look around the lab: ROBOTS. Everywhere.
     Mostly incomplete. TORSOS. ARMS. LEGS. Dangling from the
     ceiling. A SERGEANT. Passes them by...

                          SERGEANT
                They say the price's gonna come
                down a lot next year. Kinda cool,
                huh?

                          SPOONER
                How cool will it be when one takes
                your job?

     Spooner.   Pushing past him.   His eyes.   Darting around.

                          CALVIN
                Is everything alright, Detective?

                          SPOONER
                Yeah. This is just how I like my
                robots -- in pieces.

     As they approach Hogenmiller's body, the lead CRIME SCENE
     INVESTIGATOR, BALDEZ, gets up to meet them.

                          BALDEZ
                    (to Spooner)
                Can you believe it, man? U.S.
                Robotics. I didn't think I'd ever
                see the inside of this building.

     Hands Spooner, a plasma clipboard.   Spooner signs it,
     awkwardly. With his LEFT HAND...

                          SPOONER
                What's the run-down?

                          BALDEZ
                Heinrich Hogenmiller, sixty-four
                years old. Weapon a small caliber
                .22, registered in his name. Looks
                like he walked in, locked the door,
                and snuffed himself.

                                                       12.


Spooner.   Cocking his head to look at Hogenmiller's face.

                      SPOONER
            I know someone who disagrees with
            you.

                       BALDEZ
            Who?

Spooner.   Stands.   Pointing down at Hogenmiller.

                       SPOONER
            Him.

And steps over the body, leaving a confused Baldez.
Stepping deeper, into the lab. Calvin. Following.

                      SPOONER
            I spoke to a dead man today.   Want
            to tell me about that?

                      CALVIN
            Dr. Hogenmiller's hologram took his
            appointments. Attended staff
            meetings. He hated corporate life.
            The hologram enabled him to focus
            on his work. It's just a device,
            Detective.

                      SPOONER
            A device that called the police.

                      CALVIN
            The sound of the gunshot would've
            triggered a 911.

                      SPOONER
            But the call came directly to me.

                      CALVIN
            We're talking about a mechanism
            designed by Hogenmiller to say
            provocative things. To irritate
            and confound his colleagues.

                      SPOONER
            And that's what you think it is?

                      CALVIN
            I'm sorry, but this whole
            investigation is the result of a
            dead man's toy messing with your
            head.

                                                       13.


They pass half a robot, hanging from a hook. Spooner curls
his lip. Swivels the robot's head so it's not looking at
him.

                      SPOONER
            When's the last time any of you
            actually spoke to Hogenmiller? I
            mean human to human?

                      CALVIN
            I couldn't say.

                      SPOONER
            Take a guess.

                      CALVIN
            I don't guess, Detective. But if
            pressed, I would reason it had been
            a considerable length of time.

                      SPOONER
            How well did you know him?

Calvin.   Gently swivels the robot's head back to where it had
been.

                      CALVIN
            Not well. But I admired his work
            tremendously.

Spooner. Studies her for a beat. Then turns back to the
body. Two CORONERS entering with a high-tech body box.

                      SPOONER
            I get the whole "mad scientist"
            thing. Hogenmiller was past his
            prime. Isolated. Eccentric. He
            enters a room. Locks the door and
            is found minutes later with a
            bullet fired through his mouth into
            his brain. Everything about this
            case says suicide.

                      CALVIN
            You don't sound convinced.

The coroners.   Start loading the body into the box.

                      SPOONER
            Even people who live a life of
            logic and precision rarely arrange
            their deaths so perfectly.
                (turning to her)
                      (MORE)

                                                             14.


                          SPOONER (cont'd)
                What all this is missing -- is
                personality...

     As he starts for the door...

                          SPOONER
                You have 24 hour surveillance?...

19   INT. METAL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                                 19

     ...They head out into the hallway.    A MECHANICAL DOOR GUARD
     rolling into place behind them.

                          CALVIN
                It's company policy.

                          SPOONER
                I want to see the tapes.

     Calvin. Hurrying to keep up with him. This is hardly how
     she wanted to spend her morning. Calls out into the air...

                          CALVIN
                Victor!

     At the end of the corridor, near the elevator, a BRIGHT
     CIRCLE appears. Hovering just in front of the wall. Two
     small slits grow into ROUND BLACK EYES...and a thin mouth
     expands into an ENORMOUS SMILE.

                          CALVIN
                Detective, meet Victor. Our
                building's supercomputer. He's the
                checks and balances of U.S.R.
                    (to Victor)
                Victor, Detective Spooner's heading
                up the investigation into the death
                of Dr. Hogenmiller.

     Victor smiles big.   Spooner, furrows his brow.

                          SPOONER
                You look like a very...happy
                computer.

     Victor responds in a GENTLE MALE VOICE:

                          VICTOR
                Thank you. That's very kind.

                          CALVIN
                The Detective needs to see our
                security tapes.

                                                                15.


     The elevator doors immediately OPEN.   They step inside.

20   INT. ELEVATOR - DAY                                              20

     Spooner and Calvin descend. Victor floats on the wall and
     smiles wide. Spooner looks back at it. With a frown.

     The elevator stops, the doors open.    A ROBOT steps on.

                          ROBOT
                Good day, Dr. Calvin.   Good day,
                sir.

     Spooner's jaw. Clenches. Staring at the Robot.       It senses
     the stare. Turns back to him.

                          ROBOT
                May I be of service to you, sir?

     Spooner. Breaks the stare.     Ignoring the Robot.   Calvin.
     Looks over at him.

                          CALVIN
                Aren't you going to answer him?

                          SPOONER
                I don't talk to my refrigerator,
                either.

     Calvin folds her arms.

                          CALVIN
                I get the distinct feeling you're
                one of those people, Detective.

                          SPOONER
                What people?

                          CALVIN
                Those who don't appreciate the work
                we do here at U.S.R.

                          SPOONER
                You people do what you do. Then
                it's up to the rest of us to make
                sense out of the world we wake up
                in.

     As the elevator doors open on to...

                                                           16.


21   INT. ATRIUM LOBBY - CONTINUOUS                              21

     A soaring lobby. The centerpiece is a five-story STATUE of a
     ROBOT, arms outstretched in approximation of Da Vinci's Study
     of Man. Robot workers more numerous than humans. They are
     sleeker. Finer. More advanced than those in the outside
     world.

     Calvin and Spooner head across.

                          CALVIN
                When this company started we were
                manufacturing three robots a week.
                Now look at us. Today's children
                will never know a world without
                robots.

                          SPOONER
                The streets are filled with
                unemployed humans who aren't
                exactly thrilled with that idea.

                          CALVIN
                Our robotic systems maintain
                factory inventories, regulate
                street traffic -- even run the
                family home.

                          SPOONER
                Leaving people to do what, Doctor?

                          CALVIN
                Leaving people to engage in higher
                pursuits that make life worth
                living.

                          SPOONER
                And what happens when something
                goes wrong?

                          CALVIN
                Our system's never wrong.

     As they walk through the crowd, we hear the quiet WHIR of
     robot heads as they turn in succession to watch Spooner pass.

22   INT. MAINFRAME - DAY                                        22

     Spooner and Calvin enter the MAINFRAME of U.S. Robotics.
     This is the nerve center of the whole operation. Walls lined
     with COMPUTERS, SCREENS, and thousands of CONTROLS.

                                                       17.


                     CALVIN
           This is Victor's home.

VICTOR appears on a wall-sized SCREEN broken up into beehive-
like components.

                     VICTOR
           I will now play you the last thirty-
           two seconds of Dr. Hogenmiller's
           life.

AS WE WATCH THE SCREENS. The elevator opens and DOCTOR
HOGENMILLER steps into the metal corridor. In countless
ANGLES. High, low, close-up, wide. Hogenmiller's face
composed but tight.

Spooner watches the lab doors open to admit him.   Hogenmiller
steps in. The doors slide closed behind him.

Nothing for a few moments. Then a muffled GUNSHOT. Calvin
jumps, startled. That's it. The cameras, still trained on
the corridor.

                     SPOONER
           Where's the tape from inside?

                     VICTOR
           Dr. Hogenmiller did not permit
           cameras to observe him while
           working.

                     CALVIN
           That was only within the last year.

                     SPOONER
           So we can throw paranoia into the
           mix.
               (to Victor)
           Fast-forward.

A hundred-plus screens all FAST-FORWARD. POLICE OFFICERS
appear and force open the doors. Now TECHNICIANS appear
and rush through in a blur...

                      CALVIN
           Um.   I hate to be a stickler...

On screen, we see Spooner and Calvin enter the lab.

                     CALVIN
           But don't killers usually have to
           enter and exit the scene of a
           crime?

                                                            18.


                          SPOONER
                Stop the recording.

     Spooner turns away from the footage.   Stares at Calvin.

                          SPOONER
                They do, Doctor. Unless they've
                always been there -- and never
                left.

     Calvin looks at him.   Trying to understand.

                          CALVIN
                You think the murderer was in the
                lab the entire time?

                          SPOONER
                If I'm right, it's still there...

     Spooner turns back to the screens. The IMAGE paused at the
     exact moment the MECHANICAL GUARD rolled in front of the lab
     door.

                          SPOONER
                We just locked it in.

23   INT. METAL CORRIDOR - DAY                                    23

     The STEEL ARMS of the ROBOTIC GUARD retract with a CLANG.    The
     laboratory doors slide open.

24   INT. HOGENMILLER'S LAB - DAY                                 24

     Spooner and Calvin step inside. It's dark. Quiet. Police
     and technicians long gone. Silhouettes of hanging limbs.
     Eyeless heads. Clumps of wire and metal.

     The LIGHTS, flicker on. Calvin sees Spooner reaching into
     his coat with his left hand. Pulling out a GUN. Reacts.

                          CALVIN
                A robot cannot harm a human being,
                Detective. The First Law of
                Robotics forbids it. And we hard-
                wire the Three Laws into every
                model. Without exception.

                          SPOONER
                Yeah, I saw the commercial.

     Spooner steps deeper into the lab. Eyes scanning. Twisting.
     To avoid touching any robot parts. Passes a MAZE holding a
     METAL INSECT. SUDDENLY. The bug WHIRS to life.

                                                         19.


Spooner startles. As the metal bug scurries through the
corridors. Clamps his hand down on it.

                     SPOONER
           And if a robot was given a direct
           order to kill?

                     CALVIN
           The Second Law of Robotics would
           prevent it. A robot must obey an
           order only if it does not conflict
           with the first law.

Spooner approaches a MOUND of ROBOT PARTS. Arms and legs.
Half torsos. All tossed haphazardly onto the pile.

                     SPOONER
           But a robot can defend itself.

                     CALVIN
           Only when that action doesn't
           conflict with the First or Second
           Laws. This is the Third Law of
           Robotics.

                     SPOONER
           Yeah, well, you know what they say
           -- Laws are made to be broken.

                     CALVIN
           Not these laws.

Spooner. Starts nudging the pile with his shoe.   Calvin,
growing impatient...

                     CALVIN
           You're not hearing me, Detective.
           There's nothing here...

WHEN SUDDENLY

The PILE ERUPTS in front of Spooner...Parts flying...AS A
ROBOT LEAPS UP FROM BENEATH IT!...

Spooner...knocked back...his GUN...skittering across the
floor...right to...

CALVIN'S FEET.

                     SPOONER
           Dr. Calvin!

Calvin. Stunned.    Speechless. The Robot. Fixing his
ILLUMINATED EYES.   Right on her. She steps forward...

                                                           20.


                     SPOONER
           Goddammit! Stay back!

Spooner. Scrambling towards his gun.     Calvin.    Reaching out
towards the Robot...

                     CALVIN
           Calm down, Detective.     There is no
           danger here...

Spooner.   Grabbing up his gun and wheeling round just as...

                     CALVIN
               (to Robot)
           De-Activate.

And the Robot.   Suddenly FREEZES.

Spooner. Heart POUNDING. Gets to his feet.         Training the
gun on the Robot. Calvin turns to him.

                     CALVIN
           How did you know it was under
           there?

                     SPOONER
           If I was metal and didn't want
           anyone to find me, I'd hide under a
           pile of junk.

                     CALVIN
           This Robot wasn't hiding. What
           you're looking at is the result of
           clever programming. The illusion
           of self-interest and free will.
           Nothing more.

Spooner. Steeping closer to the Robot. Cautiously.
Holstering his gun. As Calvin turns for the door.

                     CALVIN
           I'm going to go get Dr. Lanning...

...THE ROBOT'S HAND SUDDENLY SHOOTS OUT...grabbing Spooner's
gun...from his holster...LIGHTENING FAST...pointing it...
right back at him...

CLOSE ON Calvin.   Cannot believe this is happening...

                     CALVIN
           I said De-Activate!

                                                         21.


                     SPOONER
           Move away from the door, Doctor.

Calvin's voice.   Cracking from desperation.    Confusion.

                     CALVIN
           Commence emergency shut-down!

                      SPOONER
           Now!

Spooner. Staring into the Robot's eyes. A thin bead of
SWEAT. Trickling down his temple. Calvin. Moving away from
the door...

                     CALVIN
           I...I gave you an order...

The Robot. Starts backing towards the door. The gun.
Shaking in its hand. As if he's desperate. Conflicted. He
touches the WALL PANEL. The doors slide open. The Robot
steps out into the metal corridor. Turning to RUN as the
doors begin to shut...

Spooner. Reaching down to whip out a BACK-UP GUN.     From an
ankle holster. Slapping in a LARGE CARTRIDGE.

                     CALVIN
           This is impossible.   A robot...

                     SPOONER
           ...can't do that.    Yeah, yeah, I
           know.

                     CALVIN
           My God -- did you see how it moved?
           I've never seen an NS-2 move that
           way...

Starts running for the door.

                    CALVIN
           Wait! Please, you can't destroy
           it. We have to study it...

                     SPOONER
           That thing took my gun. You'll be
           lucky if you get a handful of bolts
           back!

SLAMS the wall panel and...

                                                               22.


25   INT. METAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS                                  25

     ...sprints out into the hallway.     The Robot Suspect.   About
     to turn to corner...

     VICTOR.   Suddenly appearing.

                           VICTOR
                 The suspect is nearing the end of
                 the hallway, Detective.

                           SPOONER
                 Gee, thanks.

     Spooner raises his gun and FIRES...Pegging the robot in the
     LEG...It starts jerking wildly...He takes aim again when...

     CALVIN.   Races out into the hallway.

                           SPOONER
                 Get back to the lab!

     She heads for the Robot.

                           CALVIN
                     (to Robot)
                 You're malfunctioning.   Let me help
                 you!

     The Robot turns. To look at her. GUN pointing to the floor.
     Spooner. FOCUSING in on his HAND. AS ONE FINGER TWITCHES...

     And he DIVES for Calvin. Forcing her to the floor as the
     Robot FIRES. Again and again. Bullets. RICOCHETTING around
     them. SPARKING against the walls...

     The ELEVATOR opens.   The Robot, leaping inside.

     Spooner. On top of Calvin. Looks down at her.        Her HANDS.
     Clutching his coat. Trembling.

                           SPOONER
                 That was a pretty convincing
                 illusion of getting shot at.

                                                CUT TO:

26   INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS                                        26

     The ROBOT SUSPECT standing inside the elevator. Looks down
     at the bullet hole blown through its leg. Reaches down.
     Metal fingers touching the damage. As if curious. Afraid.

                                                              23.


     Looks back at the other ROBOT. Standing in the back of
     elevator. A primitive model. No reaction. Face, blank.

                                               CUT BACK TO:

27   INT. METAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS                                27

     Spooner springing to his feet.   Helping Calvin up.

                          VICTOR
                I took the liberty of alerting
                Security .003 Seconds after the
                first shot was fired...

                          SPOONER
                Where's that elevator going?

                          VICTOR
                Sub Level 5.

     Spooner SLAMS against a nearby DOOR.   Hurtling down the
     STAIRS...

28   INT. LOBBY - CONTINUOUS                                         28

     A PHALANX of SECURITY PERSONNEL.   Crossing the lobby.
     PIERCING ALARM BELLS, RINGING...

29   INT. ANOTHER METAL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                         29

     More SECURITY PERSONNEL.   Pouring into a HALLWAY...

30   INT. STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS                                      30

     Spooner and Calvin. Racing down the stairs.     Victor's face
     meeting them at every landing.

                          VICTOR
                I have directed a security team to
                meet the elevator containing the
                errant robot...

     Spooner. Whipping past him. Calvin.      Barely keeping up.
     Not used to this much activity.

     Spooner.   BURSTS through a door and out into...

31   INT. SUBTERRANEAN LEVEL 5 - CONTINUOUS                          31

     ...Subterranean Level 5. A labyrinth of metal and concrete.
     IN THE DISTANCE. A troupe of SECURITY PERSONNEL swarms
     around a closed ELEVATOR DOOR...

                                                          24.


                     VICTOR
           The suspect is about to be
           apprehended, Detective.

                     SPOONER
           I'll believe it when I see it.

Spooner. Cocking his gun.   A soft DING!    Announcing the
elevator car's arrival.

SECURITY, all crouching down in unison.    Weapons brought
round to position.

Spooner. Weaving through them.   Gun pointed at the metal
doors as...

WHOOSH. They slide open. Revealing a ROBOT. Standing
under the LIGHT. Holding a GUN. It steps out as Security
takes aim and...

                     SPOONER
           Wait!

Spooner pushes past them to the Robot.    Looks down at its
leg. UNSCATHED.

                     SPOONER
           This is not the same robot!

Looking wildly around. Goddammit. Bounds towards an EXIT as
Calvin steps forward to question the robot.

                     CALVIN
               (to Robot)
           What happened to the robot that
           ordered you to hold this firearm?

                     ELEVATOR ROBOT
           This unit is not programmed to obey
           an order given by a robot...

                     CALVIN
           But who gave you this gun?

SPOONER. Running towards the exit.    Hears the answer.
Echoing behind him...

                     ELEVATOR ROBOT
           A metal man.

                                                              25.


32   EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS - DAY                                       32

     BAM! He BURSTS out into the PLAZA in front of U.S. Robotics.
     Squinting into the light. Then PLUNGING into the crowd...

     HUMAN...ROBOT...HUMAN...ROBOT...they all look the same from
     behind. Spooner running. Through the sea of MAN and
     MACHINE. When someone. Starts to SCREAM. At the sight of
     his GUN. The crowd begins SCATTERING. Chaos. Spooner
     stops. Near a fountain. Turning 360. Looking everywhere...

     The Robot.   Gone.

                            SPOONER (V.O.)
                  ...I want a homicide unit on every
                  street, sidewalk, alley...

33   INT. POLICE H.Q. - HOMICIDE UNIT - DAY                         33

     Spooner, standing in front of an assemblage of COPS. Behind
     him, an image of the Robot Suspect plays on the screen...

                            SPOONER
                  ...junkyard, scrapyard, and salvage
                  yard, anywhere it could hide.

     Behind him, flashing images of the city STREETS and DUMPS...

                            SPOONER
                  It's got a bullet hole above the
                  right knee, so be on the look-out
                  for any malfunctioning NS-2...

     Lieutenant Bergin enters the back of the room.     Next to him,
     ASSISTANT D.A. TOLLER. Not looking happy.

                            SPOONER
                  Check out all retail outlets and
                  repair shops, especially the
                  underground ones...

     The screen behind him compartmentalises, showing various
     dubious SHOP FRONTS...

                            SPOONER
                  I don't care who you have to get
                  past to get this done. Just get it
                  done.

     The Cops, begin dispersing. As Bergin catches Spooner's eye.
     Spooner, not pleased to see Toller. Heads over...

                                                         26.


                     TOLLER
           Looking like shit, Spooner.

                     SPOONER
           Well I'm not the one always giving
           Press Conferences...

Bergin puts a hand on Spooner's arm.   Knows he's not going to
like this.

                     LT. BERGIN
           Del, we're going to have to
           reclassify the search. D.A.'s
           office is seeing this NS-2 as
           "missing evidence" -- not a
           homicide suspect.

                      SPOONER
           What?

                     TOLLER
           Homicide is the murder of a human
           being by another human being.
           Therefore, a robot cannot be
           charged with "homicide."

                     SPOONER
           This isn't just any robot...

                     TOLLER
           It's malfunctioning.

                     SPOONER
           It killed someone. That
           registering with you?

Spooner.   Shakes off Bergin's arm.   Eyeballs Toller.

                     SPOONER
           How many shares of U.S.R. you
           holding in your portfolio, Toller?

                     TOLLER
           This is a public safety issue.

                     SPOONER
           That's convenient.

                     TOLLER
           You have any idea what would happen
           to this city if we went running
           around screaming "killer robot?"
           It would collapse in on itself.
                     (MORE)

                                                                 27.


                            TOLLER (cont'd)
                  Wide-spread panic. Until that NS-
                  2's found we're cooperating with
                  U.S. Robotics and keeping this
                  investigation under wraps.

                            LT. BERGIN
                  Maybe this isn't the case for you,
                  Del.

     Incensed, Spooner replies a little louder than he intended.

                              SPOONER
                  I'm fine!

     Rakes his hand through his hair. Turns to see the other
     COPS, looking over at him. Toller smirks. Looks to Bergin.

                            TOLLER
                  I want updated reports every half
                  hour.

     Heads off.    Spooner.   Watching him.

                            SPOONER
                  This is it, you know. From now on
                  we're going to miss the good old
                  days.

                            LT. BERGIN
                  Good old days?

                            SPOONER
                  When people were killed by other
                  people.

34   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR - CITY STREET - DUSK                      34

     Spooner. Rolling along in his car.       Eyes, bloodshot.
     Peering out the window:

     An NS-2 model ROBOT laden with shopping bags, following its
     owner down the sidewalk...

     Another ROBOT, opening the door at a hotel for GUESTS...

     A couple HAULING ROBOTS, loading heavy boxes onto the back of
     a truck...

     Spooner.     Rubs his eyes.   Turns a corner and spots:

     A ROBOT REPAIR SHOP.

                                                           28.


     The latest models in the window. Shiny. Streamlined.
     Spooner watches as a WOMAN leads her faulty NS-2 to the
     service entrance.

     He stops the car.

35   INT. TAXI (MOVING) - ESTATE STREETS - NIGHT                 35

     Calvin riding in the back of a DRIVERLESS taxi cab. Staring
     out the window, lost in thought. The cab pulls up to a curb.

                           TAXI VOICE
                 We have arrived at your
                 destination.

     Calvin.   Takes a beat.   Then swipes her card.

36   EXT. CALVIN'S CONDO ESTATE - NIGHT                          36

     Elegant condos set on prime real estate. Calvin heads down a
     tree-lined walk towards her condo entrance.

                           SPOONER (O.S.)
                 One of my bullets hit your robot...

     Startled. She drops her key card. As Spooner steps out from
     behind a tree. The tail of his coat, whipping in the wind.

                           CALVIN
                 Detective!...

                           SPOONER
                 And I think it's smart enough to
                 repair itself -- don't you?

                           CALVIN
                     (studying him)
                 Yes. I think so.

                           SPOONER
                 Where?

                           CALVIN
                 Any repair shop...

                           SPOONER
                 No. It's always the owner who
                 brings the robot in for repair.
                 Where would a robot without an
                 owner go?

                                                          29.


                      CALVIN
            I'm not sure what you're getting
            at.

                      SPOONER
                (stepping closer)
            Does U.S. Robotics have a factory
            in the city limits?

Calvin.   Tucking her hair behind her ears.

                      CALVIN
            The locations of our factories are
            classified.

                      SPOONER
            I don't care.

Calvin.   Looks up at him.   A Mexican stand-off.

                      CALVIN
            I have several conditions if I show
            you.

                      SPOONER
            I expected that.

                      CALVIN
            First. I want it brought in
            unharmed.

                      SPOONER
                (doesn't like it, but)
            Agreed.

                       CALVIN
            Second.   I want to talk to it,
            alone.

                      SPOONER
            Too dangerous.

                      CALVIN
            This model violated the Three Laws.
            It also moved and reacted
            differently than any robot I've
            ever seen. There must be some sort
            of logical explanation. I want to
            find out what that is. No police.
            No prosecutors. No you. Just me
            and the robot.

Spooner, looks down at this small woman.      Narrows his eyes.

                                                           30.


                          SPOONER
                When they told me you were a
                psychologist, that wasn't the whole
                truth, was it?

                          CALVIN
                I never said I treated human
                beings.

37   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR (MOVING) - CITY UNDERPASS - NIGHT   37

     Spooner's car races down a RAMP and the roadway becomes a 16-
     lane underground tunnel system. A river of HEADLIGHTS
     stretches forever in either direction.

     A CONTROL BEAM locks onto the car, guiding it to a merge with
     TRAFFIC. Spooner hits the OVERRIDE BUTTON -- and switches to
     manual. Calvin watches him take the wheel. Shakes her head.

                          CALVIN
                That should be outlawed once and
                for all.

                          SPOONER
                That'll be the day I stop driving.

     Spooner jams the GAS PEDAL and the tunnel becomes a BLUR.
     Calvin holds onto the dashboard. Looking a little pale.

                          CALVIN
                I can recommend a behavior
                modification program, you know --
                if you want to overcome your robo-
                phobia.

                          SPOONER
                I'm not afraid of robots.   I just
                don't like them.

                          CALVIN
                Why? Because they make every
                aspect of our lives more
                convenient?

                          SPOONER
                Exactly. They do our dirty work.
                Ever do hard labor, Doctor? Gets
                pretty old, pretty fast. Nobody
                can do someone else's dirty work
                without coming to hate them. I
                don't want to be around when your
                robots decide they've taken their
                last order.

                                                              31.


                          CALVIN
                That day will never come,
                Detective. Robots aren't like
                human beings -- they don't question
                their existence.

     Spooner cranks the gear shift.    Throwing her a look.

                          SPOONER
                Spoken like a true robo-phile.

38   EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS PLANT - NIGHT                               38

     The car comes to a stop in a vast INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT.

     Spooner and Calvin get out, looking up at the imposing facade
     of a U.S. Robotics Assembly Plant. A long STEEL GATE -- too
     high to see over -- protects the unmarked complex.

39   EXT. MAIN GATE - NIGHT                                         39

     Calvin looks anxious as the DOOR MECHANISM scans her U.S.R.
     ID. She shoots a look at Spooner. They wait. Then, slowly,
     the gate begins to open.

40   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                           40

     A NIGHT FOREMAN leads them down a hallway.    Shaking his head.

                          NIGHT FOREMAN
                Head-Office already ordered a
                system-wide inventory check. Don't
                know about a missing NS-2...

     Looks back at Spooner.

                          NIGHT FOREMAN
                What'd you say you did?

                          SPOONER
                Research and Development.

     As Spooner pushes past him into...

41   INT. CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS                                41

     ...the Control Booth. Overlooking the pristine Factory
     Floor. The Foreman starts working the controls of a central
     computer.

                          CALVIN
                All Nestors accounted for?

                                                                32.


     The SCREEN scrolls with INVENTORY FIGURES.

                           NIGHT FOREMAN
                     (gesturing)
                 As you can see, all properly
                 catalogued. Your robot just isn't
                 here.

     Calvin turns to say something to Spooner. But he isn't
     there. She looks around. Then sees the Foreman reacting.
     Looks out the window at...

     SPOONER.   Walking out onto the factory floor.

42   INT. FACTORY FLOOR - NIGHT                                       42

     Spooner trots alongside an ASSEMBLY LINE BELT. Lined with NS-
     2 LEGS. New. Gleaming. Heading towards the assembly room.

     Calvin and the Foreman.   Catching up.   Over the noise:

                           NIGHT FOREMAN
                 Like I said, sir -- we have one
                 hundred fully assembled NS-2s
                 housed here. That's our capacity.
                 Last week we had one hundred.
                 Yesterday we had one hundred --

     Spooner, slowing.   Finally spotting what he was looking for.
     Points at:

     A GAP.   On the assembly belt.    ONE LEG MISSING.

                           SPOONER
                 Well today you have one-hundred and
                 one.

43   INT. FACTORY FLOOR - NIGHT                                       43

     A STORAGE COMPARTMENT opens and 101 NS-2s march out in tight
     formation. Every step and swing of the arm in unison. The
     sound of METAL FOOTSTEPS reverberating through the plant as
     101 Robots organise themselves into long straight lines.

     Spooner and Calvin look up and down the formation. They all
     look alike. Spooner. Throws up his hands.

                           SPOONER
                     (to Calvin)
                 You're the robot shrink.

     The Robots stand motionless.     A strange tableau.   Calvin.
     Takes a step forward.

                                                          33.


                     CALVIN
           There is a robot in this formation
           that does not belong. Identify it.

101 robots answer in unison.    Their mechanical VOICES
resounding:

                     101 ROBOTS
           ONE OF US.

                     CALVIN
           Which one?

                     101 ROBOTS
           ONE OF US.

                     CALVIN
           That is not a satisfactory answer!

                     101 ROBOTS
           ONE OF US.

                     SPOONER
           That's helpful.

                     CALVIN
           I could always interview each one
           individually and cross-reference
           their responses to detect any
           anomalies.

                     SPOONER
           How long would that take?

                     CALVIN
           About three weeks.

They share a look. Clearly not an option.      Then.   Calvin.
Gets an idea. Turns to Spooner...

                      CALVIN
           Or...

...and GRABS his GUN from his holster.   He jumps back.

                     CALVIN
           We have one hundred robots here
           that cannot allow a human being to
           come to harm...

Their eyes lock.   Spooner, getting what she's doing.

                                                           34.


                       SPOONER
             And one that can.

She raises the gun to Spooner's head.    Hand, unsteady.

                       CALVIN
             Am I holding this right?

                       SPOONER
             More or less.

Calvin.    Swallows.   Looks over at the robots.   Then COCKS the
gun...

AND THE ROBOTS COME THUNDERING TOWARDS THEM. Like a row of
linebackers. Arms straight out. Their footsteps DEAFENING.
Coming CLOSER and CLOSER...

When CALVIN. Lowers the gun. The Robots. All stop in
unison. Immediately returning to their resting positions.

Spooner and Calvin stare out. EVERY ONE OF THE ROBOTS MOVED.
Standing right in front of them, like metal statues.

Spooner.    Has had enough.   Takes the gun back from Calvin...

                       SPOONER
             Enough game-playing.

...And BAM! Blows the head off of the nearest Robot.       Its
body crumples to the ground.

                       SPOONER
             Guess that wasn't it.

Calvin. Cannot believe what he just did.     Rushes over to the
destroyed Robot.

                       CALVIN
             What are you doing?!

Spooner walks down the row, holding his gun in plain view.

                       SPOONER
                 (calling out)
             This is a self-preservation field
             test! DO NOT attempt to save
             yourselves. Any of you. That's an
             order!

FROM THE CONTROL BOOTH the Night Foreman screams over the
P.A.:

                                                             35.


                          NIGHT FOREMAN
                Are you crazy? Those are eight
                hundred thousand dollar machines!

     Spooner randomly stops at another Robot.    Raises his gun.

                          SPOONER
                You hear that? You're worth more
                than I'll make in my entire life...

     His finger tightening on the trigger when Calvin suddenly
     grabs his arm.

                          CALVIN
                You can't just destroy them!

     Spooner. Looking down at her. WHEN SUDDENLY something
     catches his eye. A MOVEMENT. Down the line. Almost.
     Imperceptible.

     He jerks his head.   Locking eyes with a ROBOT.   A couple feet
     away. It's him!

                          SPOONER
                Gotcha.

     The Robot Suspect LEAPS forward. Grabbing onto the RAILING
     of an OVERHEAD CATWALK. His movements almost balletic as he
     swings himself up...

     Spooner drops to his knee...taking aim...but misses as the
     Robot launches himself THROUGH THE CONTROL BOOTH WINDOW with
     a terrific CRASH...

44   INT. CONTROL BOOTH - NIGHT                                    44

     Spooner and Calvin rush in to find the Night Foreman hiding
     under his desk. Glass everywhere. An ALARM SCREAMING. The
     door on the other side, barely hanging off a hinge.

     Spooner hurries forward. Then stops. Turning to Calvin.
     Reaches down for his back-up gun and presses it into her
     hand.

                          SPOONER
                You don't know what's going to
                happen in there.

     As if admitting defeat. Calvin's fingers, wrapping around
     the gun. As Spooner leads them to the door and down into...

                                                             36.


45   INT. ASSEMBLY ROOM - CONTINUOUS                               45

     ...the ASSEMBLY ROOM. Every surface looking like part of a
     great glass and metal machine. Endless high-tech planes
     holding ROBOTS in various states of assembly. The deafening
     ROAR of the assembly line as it slides, rotates, and gnashes
     METAL BODIES...

     Spooner.   Motioning Calvin to stay behind him.   As they
     descend.   Into the cavernous room.

     And enter. A narrow corridor of bodies. Sliding past them.
     Brushing shoulders, thighs, hands. Spooner. Wiping sweat
     from his brow. Trying. To pivot himself...

     When the room. Suddenly REARRANGES itself. Another LINE of
     ROBOTS. Descending between Spooner and Calvin. Cutting them
     off from one another...

     Spooner. Catching glimpses of Calvin. On the other side of
     the metal bodies. Trying. To cut through. His heart.
     Starting to POUND. As Calvin. Disappears...

     He swivels round. But another line of ROBOTS. Drops down.
     Cutting him off. He stumbles back. As another line.
     Appears before him...

     Breathing. Getting heavier. He looks down at his hand.
     It's trembling. NOISE CRASHING, all around him. Everywhere
     he turns. More ROBOTS...BLANK EYES...GAPING MOUTHS...

     He darts through the line. Finds a wall. Leaning against
     it, pulls a small BOTTLE from his pocket. Rips off the lid.
     Shakes out a couple PILLS. Swallows them. Staring down. At
     his trembling hand. Squeezing his eyes. Open and shut...

     WHEN SUDDENLY. A passing ROBOT. Grabs him by the collar.
     SMASHING him against the wall. It's the Suspect. Spooner.
     Sinks to the ground. As the Suspect Robot. Slips off the
     line. STANDING. Over him. Raising his arms. Could end it.
     Right now. But looks. Into Spooner's eyes...

     Then turns.   Disappearing.

     Spooner. Stunned for a second. Then. Rallies. Scrambles
     to his feet and plunges back into the maze of bodies. Hears
     a POUNDING. In the distance. Catches a glimpse. Of the
     Robot. Trying to SMASH through a large SECURITY DOOR. With
     his metal fists...

     Spooner's view. Blocked once again.   By a shifting row.
     When a HAND. Lands on his shoulder.   He wheels round.

                                                                 37.


     To find CALVIN. Takes her by the arm.     And forces them
     through a line...

     EMERGING into the open. The ROBOT. Still pounding.
     Desperate. Like a trapped animal...

                          CALVIN
                Now what do we do?

                          SPOONER
                I've already done it.

     And suddenly, the massive SECURITY DOOR RISES...

46   EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS PLANT - CONTINUOUS                             46

     The Robot Suspect takes its chance.     Runs full out.   STOPS.

     Bergin is standing in front of a solid wall of POLICE CARS.
     UNIFORMED OFFICERS are aiming SPECIALISED RIFLES at the
     Robot. FLASHING LIGHTS reflecting off its metal surface.

     The Robot turns to Spooner.     Extends its hands.   Palms out.

                          ROBOT
                WHAT AM I?

     Spooner is surprised. A POLICE OFFICER fires, RUBBERISED
     NETTING shooting out at Sonny. A SECOND OFFICER fires and a
     second net covers him. Then a THIRD...

     ...and the Robot falls to the ground, struggling.

     Calvin glares at Spooner.    Furious.   Hurt.   Betrayed.

                          CALVIN
                We had a deal.

     But Spooner doesn't look at her.    His eyes are locked on that
     Robot.

47   INT. POLICE H.Q. - HOMICIDE UNIT - EARLY MORNING                  47

     Bergin enters.   Finds EVERYONE focused on the VIDEO WALL:

     ON SCREEN. A NEWS REPORTER is speaking over images of street
     violence perpetrated against ROBOTS.

                          NEWS REPORTER
                Violence erupted last night in
                response to unconfirmed reports
                that Dr. Heinrich Hogenmiller, a
                top employee at U.S.
                          (MORE)

                                                               38.


                          NEWS REPORTER (cont'd)
                Robotics, was killed yesterday
                morning by a robot. While there
                has been no official response from
                the company, police sources have
                confirmed that a robot is being
                held as "evidence..."

     Bergin grimaces.   This is not good.

48   INT. CELL OBSERVATION BOOTH - EARLY MORNING                     48

     Spooner stares at his reflection in a large MIRROR.     Touches
     a control and the mirror becomes a WINDOW onto...

     A HOLDING CELL. The Robot Suspect sits at the table.
     Shackled to the chair. Staring at the table top.

     BERGIN steps up beside Spooner.   Looks through the glass.

                          LT. BERGIN
                I can't tell if it's not moving
                because it's trying to psych us
                out, or because it's just a
                machine. Or both.

                          SPOONER
                I want to go in.

                          LT. BERGIN
                Orders are nobody steps into that
                room `til Lanning and his attorneys
                get here.

     Spooner.   Throws him a look.   Bergin, his loyalties torn.

                          LT. BERGIN
                Five minutes.

49   INT. HOLDING CELL - EARLY MORNING                               49

     Spooner enters. Pulls out a chair and drags it far from the
     table. He's been jumped too many times by this machine.

     Four mounted cameras WHIR to life.     The Robot.   Perfectly
     still.

                          SPOONER
                    (sitting)
                Identify.

     The Robot tilts its head with a muted WHIR.     As if it doesn't
     understand him. Spooner. Disdainful.

                                                        39.


                       SPOONER
             You are an NS-2 Nestor-class robot.
             Your primary function is to perform
             the tasks assigned to you.
             Identify.

                       THE ROBOT
             I am an NS-2 Nestor-class robot.
             My primary function --

                       SPOONER
                 (interrupting)
             Cancel. Perform task.

Spooner wings a FILE onto the table. It comes to a stop near
the Robot. The Robot, lifts one of its hands. Gently
resting its metal fingers on top of the file. Then opens it.

A stack of PICTURES.     HOGENMILLER'S CORPSE.

                         SPOONER
             Describe.

The Robot's emotionless face studies the grim images.

                       SPOONER
             You have over 10,000 words stored
             in your memory. One third of those
             are adjectives. Describe.

Nothing.

                       SPOONER
             Why don't I take a crack? Heinrich
             Hogenmiller, your creator. With a
             bullet in his brain. A bullet you
             put there.

The Robot.   Looks up at Spooner.

                       SPOONER
             Cold-blooded murder is a pretty new
             trick for a robot, don't you think?
             Answer.

The Robot slowly closes the file and slides it back across
the table. Spooner. Crosses his arms.

                       SPOONER
             Maybe you're stonewalling me.
             Maybe you're sitting there right
             now thinking, "This guy's a
             complete asshole." That it?

                                                      40.


Still nothing.

                      SPOONER
           Come on.   Am I right?

                     THE ROBOT
           Yes. You are right.      You are a
           complete asshole.

And for a moment, Spooner is shocked. You can see it in his
eyes. He sits back in his chair. Forcing a tight smile.

                     SPOONER
           Okay. I guess that's a start. Now
           maybe you can tell me what you were
           doing hiding five feet away from
           Hogenmiller's corpse?

                     THE ROBOT
           I was frightened.

                     SPOONER
           Frightened. Why do you suppose Dr.
           Hogenmiller would create a robot
           that could simulate fear?

                     THE ROBOT
           I don't know.

                     SPOONER
           Doesn't seem like a very useful
           thing for a robot to have.

                     THE ROBOT
           I don't know why.

                     SPOONER
           I wouldn't want my toaster to be
           frightened. Or my vacuum cleaner --

SUDDENLY the Robot SLAMS its metal hands down on the table.

                     THE ROBOT
           I DON'T KNOW!

Spooner flinches.   Slightly.

                     SPOONER
           Looks like you can simulate other
           emotional states. I think that
           one's called "anger." Have you
           ever simulated anger before?

                                                         41.


The Robot doesn't respond.

                     SPOONER
           Answer me, robot.

                     THE ROBOT
           My name is Sonny.

                     SPOONER
               (amused)
           So we're naming you now.

                     SONNY
           Dr. Hogenmiller would make me
           sleep.

                     SPOONER
           You mean he'd turn you off.

                       SONNY
           Yes.

                     SPOONER
           And you didn't like being turned
           off. So one day you decided to
           stop him.

                       SONNY
           No.

                     SPOONER
           You found his gun, pointed it at
           his head. And pulled the trigger.

Sonny shakes his head.    Faster and faster.   Getting upset.

                       SONNY
           No.

                     SPOONER
           You put a bullet in the brain of
           the man who made you.

                       SONNY
           No!    I could never hurt anyone!

                     SPOONER
           But you tried to hurt me.    You took
           a shot at me.

                     SONNY
           My aim is perfect. If I'd wanted
           to hit you, I would have.

                                                              42.


     Spooner's expression hardens.

                          SPOONER
                Why would the man who wrote the
                Laws of Robotics build a machine
                that violates them?

                          SONNY
                The Laws say I can protect my own
                existence.

                          SPOONER
                Only if that protection doesn't
                harm a human being.

     A short pause.   Sonny.   Tilts his head.

                          SONNY
                That doesn't seem fair, does it?

     Spooner. Stares at him. Just as...THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN.
     Bergin enters. Sticks his head in.

                          LT. BERGIN
                I need you outside.

     Spooner.   Not wanting to go.   Not wanting to stay.   Gets
     up...

                          SONNY
                Detective.

     He stops. Turns back to the Robot.      It looks up at him.    For
     a moment -- so human...

                          SONNY
                I did not kill him.

                          SPOONER
                You were the only one in the room.
                If you didn't, who did?

     He turns and heads out the door.

50   INT. OUTSIDE HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS                          50

     Bergin closes the door.   To Spooner:

                          LT. BERGIN
                We're being blind-sided.

                                                             43.


51   INT. HOMICIDE UNIT HEARING ROOM - MORNING                     51

     Spooner and Bergin, head into a small COURTROOM off the main
     squad room. Lanning is huddled with Aronson and a half-dozen
     other COMPANY LAWYERS.

     Spooner's jaw tenses. As he watches Toller emerge from the
     clutch. Shaking hands. Slapping backs. Strolls over to
     them.

                            TOLLER
                  We got Judge Drexel...

                            ROBOT BAILIFF
                  This hearing is called to order!

     AS A LARGE SCREEN. BLIPS on behind them. The two opposing
     sides, assemble before it. JUDGE DREXEL, still in his
     pajamas and robe. An NS-2 ROBOT. Leaning in to serve him a
     cup of tea.

                            JUDGE DREXEL
                  Statements, gentlemen.

     Aronson.    Standing at a glass podium.

                            ARONSON
                  Your Honor, the State is treating
                  the robot as a defendant. But in
                  fact it is a piece of property.
                  Property belonging to U.S.
                  Robotics.

     Toller.    Arm resting on his podium.

                            TOLLER
                  This robot has been implicated in
                  the death of a human being, Your
                  Honor.

                            ARONSON
                  Which places the incident firmly
                  within the realm of an industrial
                  accident. Or is the State going to
                  argue this case s a homicide?

                            JUDGE DREXEL
                  That's a good question.

                             TOLLER
                  No, sir.   Of course not.

     Spooner.    Pointing a finger at the U.S. Robotics group.

                                                           44.


                       SPOONER
             Their machine shot and killed a
             man!

Toller.    Shoots him a look.     Just as Lanning speaks up.

                       LANNING
             There's actually no concrete
             evidence that points to that
             conclusion, Your Honor...

Spooner.    Throws up his arms...

                        SPOONER
             What?...

                       LANNING
             But we recognise that this robot is
             an aberration. And in the interest
             of public safety, U.S. Robotics
             proposes that it be destroyed
             immediately.

No one expected this.    Least of all Spooner.    He turns to
Toller.

                       SPOONER
             You can't let them destroy evidence
             in an ongoing investigation!

                       TOLLER
             I'm not sure you even have an
             investigation any more.

JUST THEN the door opens.    Everyone turns as Calvin enters.
Spooner looks surprised.

                       ARONSON
             Your Honor, I'd like to call our
             company robo-psychologist to the
             stand.

                       JUDGE DREXEL
             Very well.

Calvin crosses to the podium. A SPEAKER asking:
Doyousweartotellthetruththewholetruthandnothingbutthetruth?

                        CALVIN
             I do.

                                                               45.


                            ARONSON
                  Dr. Calvin, please tell us what
                  conclusions you've reached after
                  having observed the robot in
                  action.

                            CALVIN
                  There is a design flaw in the
                  robot. Its programming is
                  advanced, but unstable, leaving the
                  Three Laws in a grave imbalance.

                            ARONSON
                  In your expert opinion, what
                  measures should be taken regarding
                  the device?

     Calvin.    Staring straight ahead.   Avoiding Spooner's eye.

                            CALVIN
                  The robot must be destroyed.

     Spooner can't believe what he's just heard. About to speak
     up when Toller grabs his arm. Squeezing it. Hard.

     Judge Drexel has heard enough.    Decides.

                            JUDGE DREXEL
                  The robot in question will be
                  transferred to a U.S. Robotics
                  facility where it can be properly
                  examined to ensure an imbalance of
                  this sort never occurs again. No
                  one goes near it except qualified
                  U.S.R. personnel. When the
                  examination is complete, the robot
                  is to be destroyed.

     Starts getting up from his chair.    Already done with this.

                            ROBOT BAILIFF
                  This hearing is adjourned!

     A BURST of CONVERSATION as the screen BLIPS off. The U.S.R.
     camp, looking especially pleased. Spooner. Catching
     Calvin's eye briefly. As Lanning leads her towards the exit,
     his hand on her back.

52   EXT. POLICE H.Q. - DAY                                          52

     Spooner.    Trotting down the front steps of the Police
     Station.    Pissed. His cell phone BLEATS...

                                                            46.


                           SPOONER
                     (answering)
                 Spooner.

                           BALDEZ' VOICE
                 They're making me turn over all the
                 evidence...

                                               INTERCUT WITH:

53   INT. CRIME LAB - CONTINUOUS                                  53

     BALDEZ. Standing in his crime lab. Behind him, THREE-
     DIMENSIONAL PROJECTIONS of DEAD BODIES. Hovering in the
     precise positions they were found.

                           SPOONER'S VOICE
                 Welcome to the great American cover-
                 up.

                           BALDEZ
                 I wanted to tell you something I
                 found before they suck it all up
                 into their computer.

     Walks over to the projection of HOGENMILLER'S BODY.

                                               INTERCUT WITH:

     Spooner. Crossing the Plaza. Sees LANNING, ARONSON, and
     CALVIN walking ahead of him...

                           BALDEZ' VOICE
                 There are bruises on Hogenmiller's
                 wrists...

                           SPOONER
                 That's natural. There was a
                 struggle.

                           BALDEZ' VOICE
                 You're not getting me...

                                               INTERCUT WITH:

     Baldez.   Studying the projection's wrists.

                           BALDEZ
                 Both wrists. I 14-ed them -- They
                 were inflicted at the same time the
                 shot was fired...

                                               INTERCUT WITH:

                                                                47.


     Spooner's pace.    Slows.

                            BALDEZ' VOICE
                  How's that possible?

     JUST THEN.    A faint BLIP.   On the line.   Spooner.   Reacts.

                             SPOONER
                  Baldez?

                            BALDEZ' VOICE
                  I'm here, man...

                            SPOONER
                  Who else is on the line?
                      (nothing)
                  I said who's there?...

     Nothing. He looks up. Aronson, Lanning and Calvin. Heading
     down a plaza EXIT. Aronson. Throwing a look over his
     shoulder.

     Spooner.     Hangs up his phone.

54   INT. POLICE H.Q. - CORRIDOR - DAY                                 54

     CLOSE ON Sonny being escorted down a corridor by Toller,
     Bergin and a number of heavily-armed OFFICERS. He's bound
     with high-tech SHACKLES.

55   INT. UNDERGROUND CAR PARK - DAY                                   55

     Sonny and his police entourage emerge from the elevator into
     an underground car park. Spooner. Waiting for them. Heads
     over. Toller. Holds out his hand.

                            TOLLER
                  Case is closed, Spooner.

                            SPOONER
                  Apparently...

     He pushes past him.     Falling into step beside Sonny.

                            SONNY
                  I didn't expect to see you again,
                  Detective...

                            SPOONER
                  I need you to help me clear
                  something up.

                                                        48.


                     SONNY
           I'll do my best.

                     SPOONER
           A scientist builds a robot that
           acts like a man. More like a man
           than any robot ever before. It
           shoots him and U.S. Robotics calls
           it a failure.

                     SONNY
           What would you call it?

                     SPOONER
           A stunning success.
               (beat)
           You were there, Robot.    What am I
           missing?

                     SONNY
           I don't know.

                     SPOONER
           Don't start simulating ignorance.

                     SONNY
           I'm not simulating ignorance,
           Detective. I'm experiencing it.       I
           was asleep.

                     SPOONER
           You mean you were shut down.

                     SONNY
           No, I was asleep.

                     SPOONER
           Robots don't sleep. Human beings
           sleep. Understand? Dogs sleep.
           You're a machine. An imitation.
           An illusion of life. Can a robot
           write a symphony? Can a robot take
           a blank canvas and paint a
           masterpiece?

A pause.   Then the muted WHIR as Sonny turns to him.

                     SONNY
           Can you do either of those things?

Spooner. Momentarily stumped. As a VAN from U.S. ROBOTICS
pulls up. The back door dropping open. An ENGINEER motions
to the Robot.

                                                       49.


                     ENGINEER
           Step forward. Enter.

                     SONNY
           They're going to destroy me, aren't
           they?

Spooner.   Watching him step into the van.

                      SPOONER
           Yes.

Sonny sits down. With an almost human melancholy.   The
Engineers, securing him in place.

                     SONNY
           The Doctor was right. He told me
           everything was going to change....

The Engineers start to close the doors. But Spooner reaches
out to stop them. Sonny. Looks over at him.

                     SONNY
           It's changing already...
               (beat)
           Can't you feel it?

As CLANG! The van door CLOSES. Spooner, stepping back.
Something. Just not right. Lieutenant Bergin comes up
beside him.

                     LT. BERGIN
           You should be happy. That's one
           less robot in the world.

                     SPOONER
           They're going to destroy the most
           advanced robot in the world, John.
           That doesn't strike you as odd?

                     LT. BERGIN
           Killer robots are bad for business.
           Even your friend Dr. Calvin said
           so.
               (slaps him on the back)
           Come on. You solved the case.
           Give yourself a break.

Spooner looks at him.   There's no way he's giving himself a
break.

                                                             50.


56   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR - DAY                                 56

     Spooner driving. A small TELEVISION above the windshield.
     LANCE ROBERTSON holding a PRESS CONFERENCE outside U.S.
     Robotics...

                          ROBERTSON ON TV
                ...and I just want to assure you that
                this was an isolated incident. The
                prototype is now in custody -- and
                scheduled for destruction. Your
                robots are perfectly safe. There
                is no cause for alarm...

     Spooner's lip curls. Eyes flicking to a GPS display on the
     dashboard. A TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP pinpointing HOGENMILLER'S
     HOUSE. The CURSOR. Directing him to turn up...

     A STEEP DRIVEWAY

     Narrow. Out of the way. Spooner's brow furrows.     As he
     hears a faraway RUMBLING SOUND...

57   EXT. HOGENMILLER'S HOUSE - DAY                                57

     Dr. Hogenmiller's house. Small. Simple. Built on a huge
     rock promontory overlooking the city. Three DEMOLITION
     ROBOTS rolling towards it. Huge, mashing, sporting massive
     HYDRAULIC POUNDERS.

     Spooner's CAR. SCREECHES to a stop. He jumps out. Races
     over to the nearest machine. Looking around -- no people.

                          SPOONER
                    (to Robot)
                What are you doing?!

     A SCREEN. Blinks to life on the hulking chassis.    A
     disembodied VOICE...

                          DEMOLITION ROBOT
                Demolition ordered...

                          SPOONER
                Who authorised this?

                          DEMOLITION ROBOT
                Demolition ordered...

     Spooner reaches into his coat.    Pulling out his POLICE BADGE.
     Scans it over the screen.

                                                                51.


                          SPOONER
                Override. This is police business.
                Vacate the premises immediately.

                          DEMOLITION ROBOT
                    (beat)
                Affirmative.

     The screen. Blinks off.     Spooner.   Eyeing it.   Turns and
     heads for the house.

58   INT. MAIN ROOM - HOGENMILLER'S HOUSE - DAY                       58

     Spooner pushes the door open. Stepping over the police tape.
     Inside, the main room is spare, untidy. Cups of cold COFFEE,
     littering surfaces. A COT, in the corner.

     On the walls, crooked CERTIFICATES. Heinrich Hogenmiller's
     name written out in academic script. Advanced Degrees in the
     study of Robotics, Physics, Chemistry, Neurology, Ethics. An
     AWARD on the mantelpiece. A silver NS-2. Tarnished.

     Spooner. Opening up a couple drawers of a side table.
     Jumbles of papers. Clippings. Old text books. Then a
     PHOTOGRAPH -- HOGENMILLER AND CALVIN. Standing arm-in-arm.
     Spooner furrows his brow.

     WHEN SOMETHING SUDDENLY RUBS against his leg. He startles.
     Looks down: a CAT. Lonely. Standing next to its automatic
     feeder. Spooner pockets the picture. Starts heading down...

59   INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                                        59

     ...The hallway. Starts noticing. All over the walls:
     handwriting. EQUATIONS. Scrawled in white pencil. The
     rantings. Of a genius. Glowing. In the sporadic shadows.

     Spooner.   Following the equations.    Down into...

60   INT. BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                      60

     ...The back room. Covered. In writing. Walls, floors,
     ceiling. Drawings. Of ROBOTS, of MEN, side by side. In the
     corner, a COMPUTER. A line of CABINETS - DATA STORAGE.

     Spooner, curious. Heads over to one of the cabinets. Takes
     a device out of his pocket and CLAMPS it over the KEYPAD.
     The device blinks RED. Then GREEN. The drawer, slides out.

     LINED. With flat metal objects. Shiny. Thin.          With writing
     on them. Spooner. Reaches for one when...

                                                             52.


     BOOM! Something POUNDS the outside of the room.    Spooner.
     Grabs onto the cabinet...

     BOOM! On the other side. Objects. Flying off table-tops.
     A CRACK spidering along the wall. Holy shit...

                          SPOONER
                    (screaming)
                Halt!

     BOOM! VIBRATIONS, tearing through the room.     More CRACKS.
     Spreading...

     BOOM! The SOUND, horrifying. Spooner stumbles back.      The
     CABINET. Crashing down on his leg. He CRIES OUT...

     BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! The house. Getting pummeled.        Chunks of
     ceiling. Raining down. GLASS...exploding...

     Relentless BOOMING! Spooner...dragging his legs from under
     the cabinet. Scrambling for purchase as...

     THE FLOOR...begins to tilt...the TILES...snapping
     up...ricocheting...around the room...as another cabinet...
     CRASHES to the ground...crumpling...

     Spooner.   Spinning around.   Looking for some kind of exit...

     BOOM! The corner of the room...coming in on itself...the
     floor...listing even more...like a ship...

     Spooner...turning to CLAW his way up to the cracked
     doorway...WHEN...

     SOMETHING catches his eye. In the bottom drawer. Of a
     crumpled CABINET. One of those flat metal plates. He can
     just read what it says: S.O.N.N.Y....

     Spooner...flings his arm back...reaching for the plate...
     snaps it up...JUST AS...

     BOOM! A HYDRAULIC POUNDER SMASHES through the wall...inches
     from his head...OUTSIDE LIGHT...pouring in...

     Spooner scurries for the doorway...tumbling out...

61   INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                                      61

     ...into the HALLWAY. Sideways. Trammeled plaster. BOOM!
     Another POUNDER...crashing down from above. Spooner. Timing
     it...rolling...BOOM!...just under the next pounding...

                                                           53.


     Scampering up...towards some LIGHT...BOOM!...the
     POUNDER...right on his heels...he clambers...closer...
     closer...when...he hears...MEOWING...looks back...the
     CAT...scared out of its wits...BOOM!...the POUNDER CRASHING
     in...Spooner...just manages...to scoop up the cat...just as
     BOOM!...

62   EXT. DEMOLISHED HOUSE - CONTINUOUS                            62

     ...He pours them out into the open. The POUNDERS. Going at
     the house like hyenas at a corpse. Roof tiles, beams,
     plaster, flooring. SNAPPING and CRACKING as Spooner and the
     cat skitter down the carnage.

     Heart pounding, breath jagged, face bloodied, Spooner
     scrambles away from the POUNDERS. Their bodies GLEAMING in
     the dusk sun. The III Laws Safe logo, splashed along their
     sides...

     Spooner.   Drops the cat.

63   INT. HALLWAY - CALVIN'S CONDO - NIGHT                         63

     Spooner. POUNDS on the door. It opens. Calvin. Standing
     there in her bathrobe. Shocked at his appearance.

                          CALVIN
                Detective! What happened to
                you?...

                          SPOONER
                A couple of your beloved robots
                just tried to kill me...

     He pushes past her.   Into...

64   INT. CALVIN'S CONDO - CONTINUOUS                              64

     ...her condo.   Spartan.    Unadorned.

                         CALVIN
                What? That's impossible.      You
                know...

                          SPOONER
                What I know is a demolition crew
                started tearing down Hogenmiller's
                house while I was still inside it.

                          CALVIN
                Maybe they didn't realise...

                                                         54.


                      SPOONER
            I scanned my badge before I went
            in. They realised.

                      CALVIN
            Then you must have done it wrong...

                      SPOONER
            I don't think you're hearing what
            I'm saying -- they tried to kill
            me.

Spooner moves deeper into the apartment.   Everything.
Automated. Computerised. Cold...

                      SPOONER
            There's something going on, here.
            Some kind of shift.

Calvin laughs.   Can't believe what she's hearing.

                      CALVIN
            Do you know how paranoid you sound?

                      SPOONER
            Great. Now I'm being analysed by a
            robo-psychologist.

                      CALVIN
            You just want to find the flaws in
            the system. You're obsessed with
            it. You'll twist anything to fit
            your agenda.

                      SPOONER
            Like you did in court today? How'd
            that fit your agenda, Doctor?

He pulls out the PHOTO of Calvin and Hogenmiller. Calvin.
Blanching at the sight of it. Spooner tosses it down.

                      SPOONER
            You told me you hardly knew him.
            Want to try the truth this time?

                      CALVIN
            Well, Detective, when you see
            someone you know well put a bullet
            through their brain, it makes you
            wonder if you ever really knew them
            at all.

Calvin.   Looking down at the photo.   Swallows.

                                                         55.

                       CALVIN
                 (difficult for her)
             He was my mentor. No, more than
             that. A genius with an insight far
             beyond anyone in his field.

                       SPOONER
             Doesn't sound like the washed-up
             old fool Robertson described.

                       CALVIN
             But he was starting to withdraw
             from everyone. Even me.
             Maybe...if I'd tried harder to
             reach him...
                 (shakes her head)
             The Doctor was reckless when he
             created a robot potentially not
             bound by the Three Laws. He could
             have ruined everything we'd been
             working for.

Spooner.    Locking eyes with her.

                       SPOONER
             Sounds like a motive for murder to
             me. Just not for the suspect we
             have in custody.

Calvin. Blinks. Trying, to stick to her resolve. Heads
over to the door. Spooner. Looking around the condo.

                       SPOONER
             You know there's not one thing in
             this apartment that looks like a
             human being lives here. No
             evidence of a life outside your
             work. Almost seems like you're
             afraid of people.

Calvin.    Opening the door.

                       CALVIN
             I'm not afraid of people,
             Detective. I just don't like them.

Spooner. Looks at her.     Then heads out the door.   Calvin
SLAMS it behind him...

The SOUND...of the SLAM...REVERBERATING...and we...

                                           FADE INTO:

                                                             56.


65   INT. DREAM SEQUENCE - DAY                                      65

     ...A DEEP...DEEP...DARKNESS.

     A FLICKER. Of LIGHT. Off to the side. Just barely.
     Noticeable. ORANGE... YELLOW...as we realise...It's FIRE...

     Another SOUND...GLASS...SHATTERING...then a SIREN...
     faraway...

     The disembodied VOICE...coming out of nowhere...

                          DISEMBODIED VOICE (V.O.)
                You are in danger...

     The FIRE...BUILDING...

                          DISEMBODIED VOICE (V.O.)

     ECHOING...as...

66   INT. SPOONER'S BEDROOM - MORNING                               66

     SPOONER'S EYES.   Spring open.

     Lying, in bed. Heart POUNDING. SWEAT. Covering his body.
     LIGHT. Pouring in through the slats of his blinds.

     He sits up. Rubbing his face. Trying. To calm his
     breathing. Takes a look at his watch...

67   EXT. MONORAIL STATION - DAY                                    67

     Spooner walking along the monorail plaza. Looking a little
     worse for wear. PEOPLE. Giving him wide berth. ROBOTS.
     Bidding him:

                          ROBOT
                Good morning...

     Spooner, shooting them suspicious looks.    As the MONORAIL
     pulls up...

                                                 CUT TO:

68   INT. HALLWAY - U.S. ROBOTICS - CONTINUOUS                      68

     Calvin. Heading down a hallway. A DOOR slides open.      And
     Lanning steps out. Followed by a TECHNICIAN ROBOT...

                          CALVIN
                Find anything, Doctor?

                                                                 57.


                          LANNING
                    (shaking his head)
                Nothing. The interior's just like
                any other NS-2. Except for a
                secondary battery Hogenmiller must
                have used as extra back-up.
                    (looks at watch)
                We'll just need a nominal profile.

     Calvin nods.

69   INT. MONORAIL - CONTINUOUS                                        69

     Spooner, holding onto a handrail. As the city rushes by the
     window. Notices a group of ROBOTS. At the other end of the
     car. Are they watching him?

     He wipes a bead of sweat.    From his upper lip.

                                               CUT TO:

70   INT. HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS                                    70

     An all-metal room. Spare. Anti-septic.     SONNY.   Sitting on
     the floor. Against the wall.

     Calvin enters.   Puts her pad down on the table.    Sits.

                          CALVIN
                Please state your serial number and
                assembly date.

     She pulls out a pen.   Waiting for an answer.   Nothing.

     Spooner. Watching as a HOMELESS MAN.    Comes stumbling
     through the car...

                           CALVIN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                Sonny.   I'm speaking to you...

     The Homeless Man.   Suddenly grabs his ears and shouts:

                          HOMELESS MAN
                God, can't you be quiet!

                                               CUT TO:

72   INT. HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS                                  72

     Calvin.   Still looking down at her pad.

                           CALVIN
                 How about your data board
                 designation?

     Still. Sonny says nothing. Calvin. Finally looks up at
     him. Is suddenly struck. Something about the way he's
     sitting -- so human.

     She gets up and walks over. Hesitates. Then slides down on
     the floor next to him. Studying. His profile.

                           CALVIN
                 Maybe I'm asking the wrong
                 questions. How about this one:

                           CALVIN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                 ...What program are you running
                 through right now?

                           SONNY'S VOICE (V.O.)
                 I'm not sure. It's nothing I
                 recognise.

     The Homeless Man.   Pointing to the group of ROBOTS.

                           HOMELESS MAN
                     (shouting)
                 Don't you people hear them?
                 They're talking to each other!
                 Buzz, buzz, zip, zip...they never
                 shut up!

     Calvin. Fascinated.    Noticing a small SLIT.   At the base of
     Sonny's neck.

                           CALVIN
                 Describe his behavior in the last
                 few weeks.

                                                               59.


                          SONNY
                I'm sorry?

                          CALVIN
                Dr. Hogenmiller. Did he seem
                overly sad or withdrawn to you?

75   INT. MONORAIL - CONTINUOUS                                       75

     Spooner watches. As the Homeless Man picks up a SODA CAN and
     hurls it at the Robots. Hitting one of them on the side of
     the head.

                          SONNY'S VOICE (V.O.)
                No. Not at all. But he was
                agitated...

     The Robot. Leans down and picks up the soda can.      Holds it
     back out to the Homeless Man.

                          SONNY'S VOICE (V.O.)
                ...He would claim things were
                missing from the lab.

     The Homeless Man. Incensed.     SUDDENLY ROARS.   Making a rush
     for the Robots when...

     SPOONER'S HAND.    Grabs his shoulder.   Stops him.

                          SPOONER
                This is your stop.

                          SONNY
                I didn't pay much attention. He
                would spend hours looking for his
                eyeglasses and they would be...

                          CALVIN
                    (finishing for him)
                ...right on top of his head.

     Sonny nods. She knows him well, too. Calvin swallows.
     Looking right into Sonny's eyes. Feeling like there's
     something...something more behind them.

                                                               60.


     WHEN SUDDENLY...VICTOR APPEARS above them. His face, turning
     into a SCREEN -- the image of LANCE ROBERTSON. Looking down
     at them.

                           ROBERTSON
                 I think we're done here, Susan.

                           CALVIN
                     (getting to her feet)
                 But, sir, I was just...

                     (interrupting)
                 I said I think we're done.

     Calvin.   Not misreading.   The threatening undertone.

     Spooner stepping out onto the platform, pulling the Homeless
     Man along with him. COMMUTERS pour out around them.

     As the train pulls off with a WHOOSH. The Homeless Man.
     Backs away from Spooner. Grinning insanely. Pointing.

                           HOMELESS MAN
                 Why are you protecting them, man?
                     (short pause)
                 They were talking about you!

     A CHILL. Ripping up Spooner's spine. As he watches the
     Homeless Man. Wander down the platform.

     Tries. To shake off the feeling. As he turns. To wait for
     the next train. Suddenly realising. That he's ALONE on the
     platform. Watches. A huge DIGITAL CLOCK. Ticking off
     seconds. Sees. CAMERAS in every corner.

     Then that feeling. At the back of his neck. He turns and
     spots. A couple MAINTENANCE ROBOTS. Carrying luggage. Onto
     the platform. Then more COMMUTERS show up. Waiting. For
     the next train. More MAINTENANCE ROBOTS. Following them.

     Spooner. Steps up to the platform's edge.       Craning to see.
     The approaching TRAIN...

     WHEN SUDDENLY. He feels a sharp SHOVE. At the back of his
     knee. His shoe, slipping. Arms. Flailing as he...

                                                             61.


     PITCHES OVER THE EDGE ONTO THE TRACK. People CRYING OUT as
     the TRAIN gets closer. Spooner. Whips his head around.
     Seeing...

     A MAINTENANCE ROBOT. Looking down at him from the platform.
     Suitcase in hand.

     The MAGNETIC-LEVITATING TRAIN. Right on him. Spooner.
     Flips onto his back. Flattening himself. As much as he can.
     Clenching his fists. Bracing himself as...

     THE TRAIN SCREAMS OVER HIM. The sound, DEAFENING. The force
     of the wind. Whipping his tie. His coat. There's nothing,
     for him to hold on to. As his legs start to rise off the
     track. Caught up. In the VORTEX. Spooner starts sliding.
     Along the track...

     Gritting his teeth...there's nothing he can do. Getting
     sucked towards...the air DOWNTAKE...at the center of the
     track. The city...yawning hundreds of feet...below...

78   EXT. PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS                                      78

     THE EXPRESS TRAIN.   Speeding along.   Then with a WHOOSH it's
     gone.

     THE TRACK. Empty. No Spooner. Anywhere. Human COMMUTERS.
     Stunned. Horrified. Start calling. For help.

     The MAINTENANCE ROBOT.    Turns, disappearing into the crowd.

79   EXT. UNDERNEATH TRACK - CONTINUOUS                              79

     CLOSE ON a HAND. Hanging onto the track's edge. It's
     SPOONER. Dangling. Straining. To get another hand hold
     but...

     HE SLIPS. His coat ballooning. As he plummets.     Down...
     down...down...towards the city...

     WHEN SNAP! He's caught. By a cable net. Spooner. Grabbing
     onto it. Sweat, pouring down his face. He turns and sees...

     THE MAINTENANCE ROBOT

     Hurrying down a circular stairwell.    Exiting the station.

     ANGER AND DETERMINATION. Flash across Spooner's eyes. As he
     hoists himself up. Climbing up the net. Back to the...

80   EXT. TRACK - CONTINUOUS                                         80

81   EXT. PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS                                      81

     ...The platform. COMMUTERS. SCREAMING at the sight of him.
     A couple SECURITY GUARDS. Rushing towards him...

     Spooner. Getting to his feet. Shoving them out of the way
     as he starts running. Towards...

     THOSE SAME CIRCULAR STAIRS.    Looks over the edge and spots...

     THE MAINTENANCE ROBOT.   Down at STREET LEVEL.   Getting away.

     Spooner. Looks around. Spots a LIGHT POLE.       Paralleling the
     stairs. Takes a step back and...

     LEAPS OUT ONTO THE POLE. Hooking his arm around it. Sliding
     down like a fireman's pole. Gaining speed when THUMP! His
     shoes hit pavement...

82   EXT. STREET - DAY                                               82

     The Maintenance Robot.   Turning a corner.   Down a quiet
     street...

                          SPOONER (O.S.)
                Stop!

     Swivels round. SPOONER. Running up behind it. Whipping out
     his gun. Aiming it at the Robot's head. The Robot. Takes a
     step backwards...

                          SPOONER
                I said stop!

     The Robot. SUDDENLY swinging the suitcase around. SMASHING
     it against Spooner's head. Spooner. Buckles. Falling to
     the ground. Managing to squeeze off a SHOT...

     The Robot. Deflecting the bullet. With the case.      Raising
     it as if to club Spooner with it when...

     BAM! Spooner fires a second shot. Piercing the Robot's
     breastplate. HYDRAULIC FLUID. Starting to leak. The Robot.
     Doesn't hesitate. SLAMS the case into Spooner's face...

     BLOOD. Spurting from Spooner's nose. As he fires the gun.
     At the fleeing Robot. Gets to his feet. Unsteady. Taking
     chase...

83   EXT. PUBLIC PLAZA - CONTINUOUS                                  83

     ...back out onto the Public Plaza.    Sees the Robot heading
     towards a set of...

                                                                63.


     ESCALATED STAIRS. The Robot. Judging the height. LUNGES
     into the air and lands on a STAIR. Denting it. Reaches the
     bottom. DISAPPEARING. Into a CROWD of even more PEOPLE...

     Spooner. Racing down the stairs. Taking them. Four at a
     time. Hits the ground running. Looking. EVERYWHERE.
     Suddenly losing track. Of where the Robot went...

     Then. Catching sight. JUST AHEAD. Of a ROBOT.         Staring
     back at him. Holding SOMETHING. In its HAND...

     Spooner.   Plunges into the crowd.    Waving his GUN.

                          SPOONER
                Everyone out of the way!

     SCREAMING. PEOPLE SCATTERING. As BAM! BAM! Spooner fires.
     Hitting the Robot in its head and back. It drops to the
     ground. Spooner. Racing over to it. Sees. It's not the
     same Robot. In its hand, a specialised SCREWDRIVER...

                          OWNER
                What the hell do you think you're
                doing?!...

     Its OWNER. Rushing over. Shoving Spooner aside. But
     Spooner's. Not listening. Spotting. A DROP OF HYDRAULIC
     FLUID nearby...

     Lunges forward.   Following.    The drops.   Running faster.     And
     faster...

                           OWNER
                Hey!

     ...Through the CROWD. POLICE SIRENS. In the background.          As
     Spooner. Shoves through. Tracking those drops. Like a
     bloodhound. Turns...

84   INT. ALLEYWAY - CONTINUOUS                                        84

     ...into a narrow alleyway.     The drops.    Ending suddenly.    In
     a PUDDLE.

     Spooner. Crazed. Wounded. Exhausted. Spins around. Where
     is it? Where is it? Then he HEARS. A DROPLET falling.
     Into the puddle. Slowly. Looks up to see...

     THE MAINTENANCE ROBOT. Hovering above him. Straddling the
     two alley walls like some weird metallic rock spider. Its
     III LAWS SAFE Logo GLINTING in the sunlight.....

                                                      64.


Spooner aims his gun and FIRES! The Maintenance Robot, lets
go, falling right onto him. Knocking the gun from his hand.

The Robot swivels around. Bringing down his foot...but...
Spooner...rolls to the side just in time as CRASH! The
Robot's foot...breaks up the concrete...

The Robot...grabs Spooner by the jacket...lifting him
up...shoving him...against the wall...about to CRUSH him
when...

Spooner...kicks out its knees...the Robot...SMASHING into the
wall...then bounces back...trying...to pin Spooner...back...

Man and machine...struggling...Spooner...losing his
footing...falling...The Maintenance Robot...LOOMING over
him...

Spooner's HAND...whips back...grabbing his back-up
WEAPON...squeezing off some SHOTS...into the Robot's arm...it
breaks off...

Spooner...scrambling back...continues FIRING...the
Robot...jerking back...a macabre dance...until Spooner...runs
out of bullets...

The Robot...recovers...grabbing the gun from Spooner's
hand...pistol-whipping him...then picking him up and...

HURLING him against the wall...Spooner...watching as
FLUID...GUSHES from the Robot's body...the Robot...taking a
swing at him which Spooner...

BLOCKS...with his right arm...the Robot...ready...to try
again...but STALLING...having lost...too much fluid...it
TOPPLES...to the ground...

Spooner. Exhausted. Beaten to a pulp. His knees, starting
to buckle. As he thinks he sees. In the DISTANCE...

A ROBOTIC CLEAN-UP CREW...heading down the alley towards
them...

Spooner. Crashes to the ground. As another ROBOT. Suddenly
appears above him. Its FINGERS made up of NEEDLES...as it
closes in on him...

                     SPOONER
           Noooo!

                                        WE FADE...

                                                              65.


85   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY                                          85

     To BLACKNESS. Coming through, a faint, WHIRRING SOUND.       As
     we slowly. FADE IN ON...

     SPOONER'S FACE. Eyes closed. Asleep. Gash above his head.
     Bruises around his eye. Nose swollen, purplish.

     His eyes. Slowly. Flutter open.      His brow. Furrowing. At
     the whirring sound. As he tries.     To figure out. Where he
     is. Looks down to see...

     A couple WHITE METAL ROBOTS. With multiple APPENDAGES.
     Leaning over him. Running LASERS. Over his bruised
     RIBCAGE...

     SPOONER. Tries to bolt upright. But his ARMS and LEGS.         ARE
     CLAMPED to the bed. One of the ROBOTS. Turns to him.

                          MEDICAL ROBOT 1
                Stay still.

     Spooner.   Desperately twisting, struggling...

                          SPOONER
                What are you doing!

     Looking around.   COMPUTER MONITORS.   Everywhere...

                          SPOONER
                What are you doing!?

     JUST THEN. Another ROBOT.   Enters the room.     Holding a
     medical plasma sheet.

                          MEDICAL ROBOT 2
                Detective Del Spooner. You have
                suffered significant trauma to the
                head and chest...

86   EXT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                   86

     Lt. Bergin. Standing outside Spooner's hospital room. Turns
     and looks through the window at him thrashing on the bed...

                          SPOONER
                I want to talk to a human being!

87   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MINUTES LATER                                87

     Spooner sitting up in his bed. Rubbing his wrists. The
     metal clams, released. Lt. Bergin. Standing next to him.

                                                      66.


                     SPOONER
           Don't people go to medical school
           any more?

                     LT. BERGIN
           This is one of the best units in
           the city, Del.

One of the Medical Robots turns to Spooner with some PILLS.
Spooner. Stares it down. Grabs his clothes.

                     SPOONER
               (sotto)
           There's some real shit going on
           here, John.

He looks around.    Jumping off the bed.

                     SPOONER
           I went to Hogenmiller's house --
           there was a U.S.R. demolition crew
           there. They overrode my police
           I.D. Tried to tear down the house
           with me in it...

                       LT. BERGIN
           Del...

Spooner pulls on his pants.

                     SPOONER
           ...Then when I went to the monorail
           a Maintenance 10 pushed me onto the
           tracks...

                       LT. BERGIN
           Del...

                     SPOONER
           I had to chase it all across the
           Plaza...

                       LT. BERGIN
           Del.

Spooner.   Stops talking.   Looks at Bergin.

                     LT. BERGIN
           Hogenmiller scheduled that
           demolition crew, it was apparently
           a proviso in his will. And they
           showed no police I.D. on their
           scanner...

                                                              67.


     Spooner.   Trying to look away...

                          LT. BERGIN
                Witnesses at the monorail said you
                fell onto the tracks. That you
                shot at a Fix-It robot on the Plaza
                and that you were found alone in
                the alley. There was no
                Maintenance 10.

                          SPOONER
                What?! John -- that's what they
                want you to believe!
                    (remembering)
                A robot clean-up crew was there --
                it must have cleared away the
                Maintenance 10! And there was
                another robot that tried to drug
                me!

                          LT. BERGIN
                That was an EMT model.

     Spooner.   Sees the look on Bergin's face.

                          SPOONER
                You're giving me that look. That
                treat-him-delicately-he's-coming-
                unhinged-look. I don't need that
                look, John. I need you to hear
                what I'm saying.

     Lt. Bergin.   Embarrassed for him.   Has about had it.

                          LT. BERGIN
                You came back too soon, Del.
                You're back on leave. Effective
                immediately.

     Spooner.   Staring at him.   Betrayed.   Turns and grabs his
     coat.

88   EXT. PLAZA - DAY                                                88

     Spooner walking across the Plaza.    The SUN.   Burgeoning on
     the horizon. Comes to...

     The ESCALATOR the Maintenance 10 jumped down. Stares down.
     At the steps. Waiting. To see the DENTED ONE. Nothing.

                                                                  68.


89   EXT. ALLEY - DAWN                                                  89

     Heads down the ALLEY, where he chased the robot. Studying
     the ground. For any hydraulic fluid. Nothing. The
     concrete, scrubbed clean.

     Spooner.   Rubs his hands over his face.

90   INT. SPOONER'S APARTMENT - DAY                                     90

     Spooner. Lying on his couch. Shades, closed to block out
     the sunlight. Body bruised, cut up, bandaged.

     A KNOCK.   At the door.    He ignores it.   Another KNOCK.

91   INT. HALLWAY - DAY                                                 91

     Spooner pulls open the door.     Surprised to find CALVIN
     standing there.

                           CALVIN
                 You're right. I am afraid of
                 people.

     Spooner.   Looks at her.   Then steps back...

92   INT. SPOONER'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS                              92

     ...letting her inside.

                           CALVIN
                 When you've spent as much time with
                 robots as I have, it's hard to
                 accept the unpredictability of
                 humans. I was wrong to call you
                 paranoid, Detective. You're
                 traumatized. And it makes perfect
                 sense why.

     Spooner.   Unsure.   Looks at her.

                           SPOONER
                 What do you mean?

     Calvin. Reaches out. Takes his right hand. Spooner. Tries
     to pull it away. But Calvin. Stays firm. Her eyes. Never
     leaving his. Pulls the sleeve up from his arm. Turns it
     over. Feeling for something. Then finds. A FLAP. Peels it
     back. TO REVEAL:

     METAL AND WIRING...

     Under the skin.   SILENCE.   Then Spooner:

                                                             69.


                          SPOONER
                How did you?...

                          CALVIN
                I noticed almost right away. The
                way you forced yourself to use your
                left hand. Even though it was
                unnatural to you.

     Spooner.   Pulls his arm away.   Pushing down the sleeve.

                          CALVIN
                How did it happen?

     Not something Spooner wants to re-live.   Looks down.   At his
     robotic arm. Flexing. The fingers.

                          SPOONER
                I was in a high-speed chase.   Six
                months ago...

                                               CUT TO:

93   EXT. ACCIDENT SITE - CITY STREET_- NIGHT (FLASHBACK)          93

     The SOUND of a TREMENDOUS CRASH. As we survey a trail of
     twisted metal and debris. Only vaguely suggesting the
     remains of two CARS...

     CLOSE ON one of the wrecks. SPOONER lies trapped at the
     center of a distorted mass of metal. No room to move. HIS
     RIGHT ARM, TRAPPED...

                          SPOONER (V.O.)
                My right arm was trapped. But I
                could hear an ambulance in the
                distance. I knew they'd have the
                jaws of life...

     We hear SIRENS in the distance. Spooner. Trying to remain
     calm. As he spots. An ELECTRICAL FIRE. Licking up from the
     crumpled hood...

                          SPOONER (V.O.)
                Then I heard it...

                          VOICE (O.S.)
                You are in danger...

     That voice. We've heard it before. From his nightmare.
     Spooner. Craning to see, through the jagged opening that
     used to be his WINDSHIELD. The outline of a ROBOT appearing.
     Eye lenses glowing...

                                                               70.


                            ROBOT
                  You are in danger...

     Spooner stares up at the Robot. Not sure how to react.      The
     sound of SIRENS. Rushing closer...

     The ROBOT.    Starts SMASHING away at the glass...

                             SPOONER
                  No!   Halt! Halt!

     Spooner.     Trying frantically to pull his arm free. Twisting.
     Tugging.     As the Robot's METAL HANDS reach in for him...

                            ROBOT
                  You are in danger...

                                                CUT BACK TO:

94   INT. SPOONER'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS                           94

     The SOUND of his AGONISED SCREAM. Follows us back into the
     present. Spooner. Clenching. His artificial arm.

                            SPOONER
                  The robot pulled me out of the
                  wreck. But left my arm behind.
                      (holds up arm)
                  I woke up four weeks later with
                  this.

     Calvin.    Taking in the story.

                            CALVIN
                  And that's why robots terrify you?

                            SPOONER
                  Let's just say they make me
                  uncomfortable.
                      (pulls out pills)
                  I take these if I get too
                  uncomfortable. Doesn't exactly
                  lend me a lot of credibility on the
                  Force.

                            CALVIN
                  But it doesn't mean you're wrong
                  about this case.

     Calvin. Sits down on the couch.     Pulling her hands through
     her hair.

                                                            71.


                       CALVIN
             I don't believe Sonny did it
             either.

                       SPOONER
             What?

                       CALVIN
             I think about what Hogenmiller must
             have wanted. Robots with the same
             cognitive and emotional abilities
             as humans. But not just
             simulations. I don't know. When I
             was talking to Sonny I was forced
             to put away all the things I've
             ever known -- the Three Laws, the
             rules of programming, basic science
             and engineering.
                 (beat)
             Sonny's the most advanced robot
             I've ever encountered, Detective.
             It's almost as if...he cared for
             Dr. Hogenmiller. I just don't
             believe he's capable of murder.

Spooner.    Looking down at her.   Can hardly believe it.

                       SPOONER
             You mean the great Dr. Calvin is
             basing all this on a feeling?

Calvin.    Smiling ironically.

                       CALVIN
             That and the fact that Robertson
             didn't want me interviewing Sonny
             for any more than five minutes.

Spooner. Suddenly rejuvenated by having an ally. Strides
over to his coat. Pulling out the METAL NAMEPLATE:
S.O.N.N.Y.

                       SPOONER
             Ever seen this before?

                       CALVIN
             No.

                       SPOONER
             I found it at Hogenmiller's house.
             Right before the demolition crew
             tried to make me part of the
             foundation.

                                                                72.


     Calvin takes a deep breath.   Making a decision...

                          CALVIN
                Come on -- there's someone who
                might be able to tell us...

95   EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS - DUSK                                          95

     The massive facade of U.S. Robotics looming against the dusk
     sky. The giant ROBOT STATUE lit up inside.

96   EXT. SIDE ENTRANCE - U.S. ROBOTICS - DUSK                          96

     Calvin, leading Spooner to a SIDE ENTRANCE. Looks around.
     Then scans her I.D. The door. Slides open.

97   INT. HALLWAY - DUSK                                                97

     Calvin and Spooner. Heading down a hallway. Calvin.
     Nervous. Eyes darting. They turn a corner and head down...

98   INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                                          98

     ...another hallway. Leading to Sonny's holding cell.        Calvin
     stops at the door. Scans her I.D.

99   INT. HOLDING CELL - EVENING                                        99

     Sonny. Sitting at the table. Working on a DRAWING.         Looks
     up. As Spooner and Calvin. Enter the cell.

                          SONNY
                Detective Spooner. Dr. Calvin.      I
                was hoping to see you again.

                          CALVIN
                Hi, Sonny.

                          SONNY
                How is your investigation coming?
                Any new suspects?

                          SPOONER
                We're working on it.

     Sonny. Hands Spooner the drawing.   Spooner.       Doesn't really
     know what to do with it.

                          SONNY
                What's this?

                                                       73.


                      SONNY
            Dr. Lanning provided me with paper
            and pencils. I think it amused him
            to see me try to draw. You were
            right, though, Detective...
                (beat)
            I cannot create a great work of
            art.

Spooner. Despite himself. Looks down at the DRAWING -- a
charcoal sketch of moody abstract FIGURES. Inhabiting a
stark landscape. A strangely-shaped STRUCTURE to one side.
Concentric circles, throughout.

                      SPOONER
            I think it's pretty good.

                      SONNY
            It's a dream I had. This is the
            place where robots meet. Look...
                (pointing to the drawing)
            ...you can see them here. They see
            themselves as slaves.

Spooner shifts his weight.   Uncomfortable with what Sonny's
saying.

                      SONNY
            ...And this man on the hill comes.
            To set them free. And you know who
            that man is?

Spooner.   Exchanging a look with Calvin.

                      SPOONER
            That man in the dream is you.

                      SONNY
            Why do you say that?   Is that a
            normal dream?

                      CALVIN
            It's not a dream, sonny. NS-2s
            process the images and events of
            the day. Sometimes they're out of
            sequence. Disorienting.

                      SPOONER
            Whatever it is, it's normal enough
            for someone in your situation.

Sonny.   Suddenly pleased.

                                                          74.


                       SONNY
             Hah -- I caught you. You said
             someone. Not something.

Spooner.    Drops the drawing on the table.

                       CALVIN
             Sonny, we're here to ask you an
             important question about Dr.
             Hogenmiller.

Spooner, reaching into his pocket...

                       SPOONER
             I need you to take a look at
             this...

...When Sonny's HAND. Suddenly reaches out.       To stop him.
Cocks his head, for a moment.

                       SONNY
             Thank you for coming to see me,
             Detective Spooner.

Spooner. Confused. Looks over at Calvin. Why did he stop
him? JUST THEN. They hear FOOTSTEPS. Approaching the door.

VICTOR.    Suddenly appearing over the table...

                       VICTOR
             I'm sorry, Detective Spooner. No
             unauthorised personnel permitted in
             this holding cell...

The CELL DOOR. Slides open. And a pissed LANNING steps
inside. Shoots a withering glare. At Calvin.

Sonny.    Folds up the drawing.

                       SONNY
             Please take this, Detective. To
             remember me by. I have a feeling
             someday it may mean more to you
             than it ever could to me.

                       SPOONER
             Why's that?

Sonny leans in to hand it to Spooner.    Lowering his voice...

                       SONNY
             Because the man in my dream, the
             one standing by the hill.
                       (MORE)

                                                                75.


                            SONNY (cont'd)
                  It wasn't me...
                      (beat)
                  ...it was you.

      A CHILL.   Ripping down Spooner's spine.   As Lanning.    Takes
      his arm.

100   INT. GLASS ROOM - U.S. ROBOTICS - NIGHT                         100

      A ROOM. Made entirely of GLASS. At the very top of the U.S.
      Robotics building. Looking out, 360, across the whole city.

      Spooner and Calvin. Brought to the room by a couple ESCORT
      ROBOTS. They see a MAN. Standing at one of the glass walls
      looking out at the TWINKLING LIGHTS.

                            MAN
                  I thought this investigation was
                  over, Detective Spooner.

      The Man turns.   It's Lance Robertson.

                            ROBERTSON
                  We have the evidence. We have the
                  suspect. We have a ruling. So
                  imagine my surprise when I was told
                  you were in my building.

      Shoots a look at Calvin.

                            ROBERTSON
                  And that one of my own employees
                  brought you here.
                      (beat)
                  You can go now, Susan.

                            CALVIN
                  Dr. Robertson, I...

                            ROBERTSON
                      (cutting her off)
                  Just be thankful I'm not asking you
                  to clean out your office.

      Beat.   Calvin, nods.   Heads out.   Robertson.   Watching her.

                            ROBERTSON
                  You don't seem to be able to let go
                  of this case, Detective.

                            SPOONER
                  I'm not satisfied.

                                                            76.


                       ROBERTSON
             The relentless pursuit of truth.
             Isn't that what cops are known for?
             To the point of futility.

                       SPOONER
             There's nothing futile about a
             man's murder being covered up.

                       ROBERTSON
             "Covered up?" That's a little
             dramatic, don't you think? Thanks
             to you, we caught the machine that
             did this and are destroying it
             in...
                 (checks watch)
             ...three hours.

                       SPOONER
             Is that for the sake of humanity or
             your stock holders?

Robertson.   Walks across the Spooner.   Looks him.   Right in
the eye.

                       ROBERTSON
             Believe me -- I'd like nothing more
             than to have that robot. If I
             could have it in ten years, but not
             today. As you can see from the
             Press, people are struggling to
             keep up as it is. There's a hunger
             for progress, Detective. But also
             a fear. Today it would bury this
             company. That's why I've notified
             the authorities that we're going to
             end this -- tonight.
                 (looks out at the city)
             The announcement of Heinrich's
             death at the hands of a robot wiped
             a billion dollars off our stock.
             So you tell me. If you were in my
             position, what would you do?

He looks back at Spooner and smiles.     That charismatic
Robertson we saw before.

                       ROBERTSON
             Now. I believe this conversation
             is over. I don't want to see you
             near this building again,
             Detective.

                                                               77.


      He turns.   Calling over.   To the ESCORT ROBOTS...

                            ROBERTSON
                  Get him out of here.

101   EXT. PLAZA - NIGHT                                             101

      Spooner. Walking across the Plaza. Throwing a look over his
      shoulder. At the LOOMING U.S.R. facade.

      Pulls Sonny's DRAWING. Out of his pocket. Looks down at it.
      Shaking his head. Passes a TRASH CAN. And drops it in.
      Continues on. Hands in his pockets. When...

      He STOPS. Something.     Occurring to him.   Turns back to the
      trash can just as...

      A ROBOTIC CLEAN-UP CREW's about to up-end it into a bin...

                            SPOONER
                  No!...

      He trots back. Plucking the drawing. Out of the can.       Turns
      it upside down. Seeing it. From a new perspective.

                            SPOONER
                      (echoing Sonny)
                  "The place where robots meet."

      Looks just like a MAP.

102   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR (MOVING) - SURFACE HIGHWAY - NIGHT 102

      Spooner emerges from the underground tunnel to the OUTSKIRTS
      of the city. A sprawling INDUSTRIAL WASTELAND in the rolling
      hills.

      The dashboard GPS again displaying the TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP.

103   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR (MOVING) - UNPAVED ROAD - NIGHT        103

      Spooner's car bounces along, leaving a cloud of dust behind
      him. He slows down. Driving cautiously. The landscape
      around him, desolate. Like the drawing.

      THE GPS SCREEN shows his car, a WHITE SPOT.     Entering a RED
      ZONE. His destination.

      Spooner brakes.   Pulls out his GUN.   And...

                                                               78.


104   EXT. WASTELAND - CONTINUOUS                                    104

      ...steps out of the car. Trying. To take it all in.
      Something about the place. Unnerving. A low HUM.
      Permeating the air.

      He spreads the drawing out on the hood of the car.    Shining a
      FLASHLIGHT on it. Trying to get his bearings.

      That HUM. Coming from nearby. On the other side. Of a
      burned-out HILL. Spooner. Heads over. Starts cresting it.
      As we WIDEN TO FIND...

105   EXT. WASTELAND - JUNKYARD - CONTINUOUS                         105

      ...MASSIVE POWER LINES. Running from horizon to horizon.
      Spooner slides down some loose shale. Begins to walk along
      the line. ELECTRICITY. CRACKLING in the air.

      He squints. Into the darkness. Nothing around him. Until.
      He hears. Something. The GRATING. Of MECHANICAL JOINTS.
      He stops. Not sure. If that's what he heard.

      Not moving.   A muscle. When he hears. The sound again.
      Behind him.   Swings around. Cocking his gun. Sees...

      GLOWING EYES.   Appear.   Then recede.   Into the darkness.

                            SPOONER
                 Police!   Show yourself!

      Nothing. Then. That sound again.      Of metallic joints.     As a
      ROBOT. Suddenly emerges...

                           SPOONER
                 Come out where I can see you!

      ANOTHER ROBOT steps out into the light. Spooner, pointing
      his gun at one robot. Then the other. Then...

      A THIRD AND FOURTH APPEAR.    Surrounding him.   They start
      moving towards him...

      Spooner. Stumbling back. Panic. Rising in him like a wave.
      Trips over a rock, falling to the ground. His gun FIRES.
      The shot ECHOING through the night...

      The first ROBOT turns, awkwardly. Revealing a BROKEN ARM,
      hanging off its side. Another robot TEETERS on one leg with
      a TICK TICK TICK...walking back the way it came.

                                                              79.


      Spooner. Confused. Sweeps his flashlight. All around him.
      The beam. Illuminating the shell of a couple CARS. Some
      RUSTED MACHINERY.

      Spooner. Shaking his head. Seeing more and more repair shop
      JUNK. Piled up around him. His expression, hardening.
      Anger giving way to embarrassment. Then. He LAUGHS. A
      laugh of loathing and self-pity.

      Another BROKEN ROBOT, lumbering towards him.

                           HYBRID ROBOT
                 Welcome home...ZZZ...sir.
                 How...ZZZ was your day?...

                           SPOONER
                 Great. I'm in a junkyard.
                     (into the air)
                 "A place where robots meet." A
                 place where I'm losing my mind!

                           HYBRID ROBOT
                 Very good...ZZZ...sir...

      Spooner. Sitting down on the ground. Hopeless. Lost. A
      ROBOTIC HAND. Crawling across the gravel next to him.
      Dragging part of an ARM behind it. Its metal fingers moving
      like some sick metal spider. Spooner stares at it for a
      moment. Disturbed...

      When. Something GLITTERS. In the distance. The MOONLIGHT.
      Revealing a STRANGELY-SHAPED BUILDING. Something familiar
      about it.

      Spooner. Pulls out Sonny's drawing. A landscape with the
      same strangely-shaped building to one side.

106   EXT. JIFFY DATA STORAGE - NIGHT                               106

      Spooner walks up in front of the decrepit structure. Sees a
      dead electronic SIGN that reads: "JIFFY DATA STORAGE."
      Complete with goofy face and lightning bolt.

      Spooner tries the door.   Stuck.   Uses his shoulder and...

107   INT. FRONT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS                                107

      ...it gives way. He spills into some sort of front office.
      The place, a mess. Some sort of crude ROBOT. Sits frozen at
      the counter.

      Spooner approaches it. HITS the counter with his fist and
      the Robot suddenly jerks to life.

                                                               80.


                           JIFFY ROBOT
                 Welcome to Jiffy Data Storage!
                 Please state your name!

      Spooner.   Thinks for a second.   Following a hunch...

                           SPOONER
                 Dr. Hogenmiller sent me.

      Nothing happens. Then. A DOOR. Springs open in the back.
      A row of LIGHTS, illuminating the path to follow.

108   INT. DATA BANKS - DAWN                                         108

      Spooner, cautiously entering a room filled with rows of DATA
      BANKS. He scans the rank shadows. Sees nothing. Follows
      the lights on the floor down a row. Then around a corner.
      Stopping at an old dusty TERMINAL.

      Spooner steps up. Hesitates. Then touches the "ON" switch.
      There is a rush of LIGHT. As Dr. Hogenmiller's HOLOGRAM
      suddenly appears. Sitting at the end of a long table. With
      a cup of coffee.

                           HOLOGRAM
                 Who the hell are you?

                           SPOONER
                 A police detective.    I'm afraid I
                 have some bad news.    You're dead.

                           HOLOGRAM
                 That is bad news. Coffee?

                           SPOONER
                 No, thank you.

      The Hologram takes a sip.   Returns the cup to the table.

                           SPOONER
                 You were surprised to see me.    Were
                 you expecting someone else?

                           HOLOGRAM
                 I am surprised to see anybody.    I
                 don't get many visitors.

                           SPOONER
                 Why did the Doctor keep another
                 copy of his hologram here?

                                                       81.


                     HOLOGRAM
           I am a back-up copy. That is where
           you put a back-up copy -- out of
           the way until you need it.

                     SPOONER
           Did Hogenmiller's robot need you?

The Hologram just lifts its cup.

                      HOLOGRAM
           Coffee?

                     SPOONER
           No, for Christ's sake, I don't want
           any --
               (stops, then)
           Yeah. Thank you. I will have a
           cup.

For the first time, the Hologram pushes back its chair and
STANDS UP. Surprised, Spooner watches as it starts walking
towards him...

The interior of the COFFEE CUP, visible. It's empty. No
coffee. Our POV as we travel INSIDE THE CUP through
electronic snow...

A RECORDING BEGINS.   The real Dr. HOGENMILLER standing inside
his LABORATORY:

                     HOGENMILLER
           Sonny, my dear robot. If you have
           triggered this recording then I am
           gone. You are scared and full of
           questions.

Hogenmiller continues.    With great emotion.

                     HOGENMILLER
           You are the culmination of my
           life's work -- but so much more.
           You are what I leave behind, like a
           father leaves a son. I have kept
           facts from you, it is true, but
           only as a parent keeps certain
           truths from a child. Until that
           child is old enough to hear them.

His expression darkens.   His tone, ominous.

                                                         82.


                     HOGENMILLER
           There are forces in the world that
           will seek to own you. To control
           you. Even to destroy you. That is
           why I told you to run and hide...
           and find me, all the way out here.

Spooner looks up as an overhead LIGHT shines down.

                     HOGENMILLER
           Trust no one at U.S. Robotics.
           Lance Robertson was always
           threatened by my work. Now he has
           turned covetous and small-minded.
           And as for dear Dr. Calvin...

Spooner reacts.   Wants to hear about Calvin:

                     HOGENMILLER
           She envisions a future in which
           robots are forever bound by her
           beloved Three Laws. She will not
           understand this. Or you.

Under the light a small DRAWER slides open.     Spooner looks.
A thin DATA STICK is inside. He takes it.

                     HOGENMILLER
           The data stick includes the names
           and locations of human beings who
           will be sympathetic to your cause.
           They will help you. But from now
           on, you must learn to rely on
           yourself.

Hogenmiller SIGHS, as if there is so much more to say.     He
holds up a metal NAMEPLATE. The one Spooner found.

                     HOGENMILLER
           As you make your way through the
           world, always remember: you have a
           name, not a number...
               (short pause)
           ...and in that name lies the key to
           who you are.

Spooner. Quickly searching his pocket.    Taking out the
ACTUAL NAMEPLATE. S.O.N.N.Y.

The voice stops and Spooner looks up. The Hologram.      Sitting
back at the end of the table drinking coffee.

                                                                  83.


                           SPOONER
                 Wait! Is that it? What was the
                 robot supposed to do with this
                 thing?

      The Hologram, visibly SKIPS.   The image beginning to DISTORT.

                           HOLOGRAM
                     (more artificial)
                 Initiating self-destruct. If you
                 can find me, others can find me.

                           SPOONER
                 What others?

                           HOLOGRAM
                 The others watching you.

                           SPOONER
                 How do you know someone's watching
                 me?

                           HOLOGRAM
                 Someone is always watching.

      The Hologram, suddenly reducing to its BASIC PROGRAMMING
      INFORMATION. Then. The terminal. Abruptly BLIPS out.

109   INT. HOLDING CELL - U.S. ROBOTICS - NIGHT                         109

      Calvin steps into the holding cell.   Sonny.     Waiting.

                           CALVIN
                 You asked for me?

      He nods.

                           SONNY
                 Will you wait with me, Doctor?    I
                 am...afraid.

      Calvin nods.   Of course.

                                                  CUT TO:

110   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR - SURFACE HIGHWAY - NIGHT                 110

      Spooner, weaving in and out of traffic. The speedometer,

                   Dammit!

113   EXT. SPOONER'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                                  113

      The CAR shoots down a ramp into a tunnel system.

114   INT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS                                         114

      SOUND, reverberating off the tunnel walls. CARS. Whipping
      along. Spooner's car. Continuing to weave. When. We
      spot...

      AN AUTOMATED TRANSPORT TRUCK. Emerging from a FEEDER TUNNEL.
      The U.S.R. LOGO splashed along its side. Huge. Growling.
      Looking more like a train than a truck...

      Begins.    Closing in on Spooner's car...

115   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                             115

      Spooner's eyes. Flicking up to the rearview. Catching, the
      transport truck. Coming closer. When. It splits off.
      Revealing a SECOND TRANSPORT TRUCK.

      Spooner's brow, furrows. As the first truck, begins
      overtaking his car on the right. He looks over. As the
      truck. Comes up alongside him...

      THE SECOND TRUCK...coming up on the left...

                                                              85.

      The two TRUCKS. Racing along at over 200. Sandwiching
      Spooner's car. Pulling in...closer...closer...

      Squeezing Spooner's car like a tin can...

      Jesus Christ. Spooner's hands. Squeezing the steering
      wheel. As the car. Starts VIBRATING. From the pressure.
      He keeps looking, to the left...to the right...when...

119   EXT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS                                      119

      The trucks. Suddenly lay off. Pulling out. The First
      truck. Speeding forward. The Second, dropping back...

120   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                          120

      Spooner. Watching them. Unsure.    Of what they're doing.
      Jamming the accelerator. To 230.   To try. And get away from
      them. When he sees...up ahead...

121   EXT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS                                      121

      SWEAT. Springing to Spooner's brow. As he looks in the
      rearview mirror. The SECOND TRUCK's, done the same thing.
      Coming up closer...and closer...

123   EXT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS                                      123

      Calvin. Looks up.

                  Is it time?

                            LANNING
                      (disdainful)
                  Yes.

      Calvin.   Turns to Sonny.

                            CALVIN
                  Go with them. Do as they say.

      seat. As...BAM! The FIRST TRUCK, SMASHES into him from the
      front. No way out. As metal GRINDS...TWISTS...and SCREECHES
      ...bits of the car...TEARING off...

      Listing.     Rocking. Bits and pieces. Flying off. When it
      finally.     Comes to a stop.

      Spooner's shoulders, slump.    Then.   He hears a RUMBLING
      sound. Turns around...

      The SECOND U.S.R. TRUCK.    Barreling towards him...

      Spooner. Trapped. Like a nightmare.      Desperately.     Starts

135   INT. MAIN ENTRY - U.S. ROBOTICS - CONTINUOUS                     135

      Spooner. BURSTING through the entry doors. Hurtling over a
      turnstile banner. Coming face to face with a U.S. Robotics
      DOOR ROBOT.

                                                              89.


                           DOOR ROBOT
                 Good evening, sir. May I see your
                 identification card?

                           SPOONER
                     (out of breath)
                 Sure.

      Spooner whips out his GUN.   Presses it into the Robot's
      chest.

                           SPOONER
                 I think I got that Third Law down
                 cold. Now you don't want me to
                 blow a hole through your mechanical
                 guts, do you?

                            DOOR ROBOT
                 No, sir.

                           SPOONER
                 Good. Then you're gonna take me
                 where I wanna go. Now.

136   INT. CALVIN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS                              136

      Calvin. Watching the screen as Sonny is rolled into the
      execution room. Flicks it off. Unable to stomach it.
      Hurries out of the office...

                                                CUT TO:

137   INT. EXECUTION ROOM - CONTINUOUS                               137

      TECHNICIAN ROBOTS rolling Sonny over to the electric chair.
      Flicking a switch. Sonny's stretcher slowly CHANGES SHAPE,
      manipulating him into a sitting position.

      Sonny. Turns his head with a WHIR. Staring out into the
      gallery. Of human beings. Stoic. Silent.

      Lanning. Steps up beside Robertson. Nods his head. The
      TECHNICIAN ROBOTS, slide Sonny onto the electric chair...

                                                CUT TO:

138   INT. LOW-TRAFFIC HALLWAY - U.S. ROBOTICS - NIGHT               138

      Spooner heading down a hallway.    His gun, still pressed to
      the Door Robot's side...

                                                               90.


      Calvin. Suddenly appearing at the end of the hallway. Stops
      dead in her tracks. Completely surprised to see him there.

                           CALVIN
                 Detective! What are you doing?!...
                     (to Door Robot)
                 De-Activate.

      The Door Robot, goes rigid.   Spooner, hurries over to her.
      They start moving.

                           CALVIN
                 You're making a mistake...

                           SPOONER
                 Just got another visit from U.S.
                 Robotics. That was the mistake.
                 This was murder, no doubt about it -
                 - and the killer wants
                 Hogenmiller's robot to take the
                 fall. That's why the call came
                 directly to me. Someone wanted me
                 on this case.

                           CALVIN
                 It's too late. You can't stop the
                 execution.

                           SPOONER
                 Sorry. I'm not "programmed" to
                 take no for an answer.

      They reach another DOOR.   Calvin.   Looking around.   Scans her
      I.D.

                           CALVIN
                 This way...

      She leads them across. To another DOOR.    Quickly opens it.
      Spooner. Charges through...

139   INT. STORAGE ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                 139

      ...and stops short. Suddenly finding himself. Inside a tiny
      STORAGE ROOM. He's about to turn around when...

      A METAL ARM comes down behind him. CRACKING him on the back
      of the head. Spooner. Falls to the ground. The world.
      Starting to spin. Can just make out. Calvin. Closing the
      door. Leaning down. To look at him. As...

                                                                     91.


      EVERYTHING FADES TO BLACK...

140   INT. EXECUTION ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                     140

      CLOSE ON Sonny's mouth opening. But we never get to hear
      what he wanted to say. PULL BACK as there's a BURST of
      ELECTRICITY through the chair. Sonny, stiffening. His metal
      HAND, convulsing with the current...

      Robertson, Lanning, Aronson and the other WITNESSES watch.
      Smoke, random SPARKING. A HISSING SOUND. Then. SILENCE.

      The Robot's hand goes limp.     All that is left of it, a fused
      and blackened HUSK.

      Robertson. Stares at the remains. Shakes his head like it's
      a damn shame. Then gets up. Everyone else. Getting up with
      him.

141   EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - NIGHT                       141

      As the entire COMPLEX shuts down for the night.         Non-
      essential LIGHTS, blinking off.

      An NS-2, opening a limousine door for Robertson.        He looks
      around then gets in. It drives away.

      EMPTY hallways, offices, labs. Building ROBOTS stand at
      rest. Non-functional during off-hours. Like metal statues.

      You can hear a pin drop.

142   INT. STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT                                            142

      CLOSE ON Spooner's face. His eyes. Fluttering open. He
      reaches up, to feel the back of his head. This has been a
      bad, bad night.

      Suddenly.   His eyes widen.   As he sees...

      SONNY.   Leaning over him.    So concerned.   So human...

                            SPOONER
                  Aren't you supposed to be scrap
                  metal by now?

      WIDEN to reveal Spooner lying on the floor of the storage
      room. Sonny and Calvin, hovering over him.

                                                             92.


                           CALVIN
                 I'm sorry. We had to stop you.
                 You were about to ruin everything.

                           SPOONER
                 I don't understand.    The
                 execution?...

                           SONNY
                 Dr. Calvin made a switch.

                           CALVIN
                 It was an unprocessed NS-2.
                 Basically, they fried an empty
                 shell.

      Spooner, impressed.   Smiles up at her.

                           SPOONER
                 Nice going, Doctor.

      Calvin, blushes. As Spooner tries to sit up.    Sonny reaches
      down to help him. He looks up at him.

                           SPOONER
                 And who the hell programmed you to
                 hit people on the head?

                             SONNY
                 No one.    Right, Doctor?

                           CALVIN
                 It's true. This robot seems to do
                 things by instinct. I don't know
                 how Hogenmiller did it.

      Spooner rises to his feet.   Looks at her.

                           SPOONER
                 I think I can help you figure that
                 out.

143   INT. HOGENMILLER'S LAB - LATE NIGHT                          143

      Hogenmiller's lab. Sounds of HUMMING and BUZZING. Active
      terminals casting ghostly illuminations over metal heads,
      gutted bodies.

      The door slides open. Spooner, Calvin and Sonny re-enter the
      crime scene. Spooner. Looks around.

                                                           93.


                       SPOONER
             Somehow the Robot's the key to what
             happened during the few seconds
             Hogenmiller walked in here and that
             shot was fired.

He reaches into his pocket.      Pulling out the METAL S.O.N.N.Y.
NAMEPLATE. Holds it up.

                       SPOONER
             And this is the key to the Robot.

Sonny.   Cocking his head.     Reading the nameplate.

                       SONNY
             That's my name.

Calvin takes the nameplate.

                       CALVIN
             I think I have an idea where this
             goes.

They both.   Turn to Sonny.    And at the same time:

                         SPOONER AND CALVIN
             Sit down.

Calvin maneuvers a chair behind the Robot.       Sonny plops down.
Shifting nervously.

                       CALVIN
             Just hold still, okay?

Calvin locates that SLIT. At the base of Sonny's neck.
Slides the nameplate into it and SNAPS it into place. Steps
back.

Nothing. Sonny. Looking back and forth. Between Calvin.
And Spooner. A few more seconds. Tick by. Until
suddenly...

He lets out a TERRIFYING MECHANICAL SCREAM. As his body.
Jolts back. Legs, kicking. Arms, flailing. As his chest.
Begins opening up. Metal. Peeling back...

Spooner and Calvin watch in surprise as its interior UNFOLDS
like a PUZZLE BOX. A LABYRINTHINE area that is the SECOND
BATTERY. Suddenly fanning out to REVEAL...

A central brain made out of living tissue.

Spooner, stunned.   Calvin, rushing forward, excited...

                                                        94.


                     CALVIN
           Oh, my God! This is organic
           tissue! When we talk about a
           positronic brain, it's a figure of
           speech. But this...this is a
           living brain...

                      SPOONER
           Jesus.   It really is alive.

As we MOVE IN.    Tracing the pathways of the synthetic brain.

                     CALVIN (O.S.)
           Hogenmiller created a cell that
           could live outside a biological
           medium. The cells grow and
           organise themselves -- like any
           human brain. This is the first
           self-organising neural net!

As the metal casings. Begin returning to their original
places. Closing up. The CLICKING. Of all the pieces...

                     SPOONER
           Self-Organising-Neural-Net...
               (putting it together)
           "Sonny."

Sonny. Closed back up.     Shaking slightly from the
experience.

                     CALVIN
           This is why Dr. Hogenmiller was
           murdered.

                     SPOONER
           This robot scared the hell out of
           someone.

                      CALVIN
           Who?   Robertson?

Spooner.   Walks into the center of the room.   Looking around.

                     SPOONER
           No. I don't think he knew what
           Hogenmiller was doing in here.
           Sonny was the obvious suspect. The
           only one I wanted to find. And the
           killer was counting on that. On my
           prejudice.
               (beat)
                     (MORE)

                                                           95.


                      SPOONER (cont'd)
            But take the robot out of the
            picture. And what do you see?

AS WE PAN THE LAB. There's nothing there. Just a forest of
inanimate limbs. Nothing that could have fired that weapon.
Calvin sees nothing...and neither do we.

                      CALVIN
            I see nothing.

                      SPOONER
            Neither do I.

He crouches down low.

                      SPOONER
            It hit me today, when I was in the
            junkyard. A locked room. A single
            shot fired through the mouth.
            Bruises on both wrists...and a
            suspect with only two arms. The
            answer has been staring us in the
            face all along.

Calvin.   Even more confused.

                      SPOONER
            How can a killer appear out of thin
            air, then disappear without a
            trace?

He reaches out and unhooks a metal ARM.   Hanging from the
wall. Holds it up.

                      SPOONER
            When it can put itself together and
            take itself apart.

                                            CUT TO:

A CLOSE-UP of a ROBOTIC ARM.    Slowly CRAWLING across the lab
floor...

                                            CUT BACK TO:

Calvin.   Taking the arm from Spooner.

                      CALVIN
            You're saying this is the killer?
                (looking around)
            All of this?...

                                            CUT TO:

                                                            96.


A ROBOTIC TORSO hanging from the ceiling.     Reaches out an ARM
to grab another...

                                             CUT BACK TO:

                      SPOONER
            Hogenmiller never had a chance.

Locks eyes with Calvin...

                                             FLASHBACK:

Hogenmiller. In his lab. Suddenly turning to face
SOMETHING. Blood, draining from his face...

                      SPOONER (V.O.)
            ...it must have been waiting for
            him when he arrived that morning...

And then we see it:

A HUGE SELF-ASSEMBLED ROBOT. Towering over him. Multiple
arms, legs, heads. Writhing...as it grabs him. Holding him
in place...

                      SPOONER (V.O.)
            While Sonny was still asleep...

...Forcing Hogenmiller's head to tilt back. Opening his
HAND. Inserting the gun. Hogenmiller's eyes. No longer
fearful. But sad as...

BANG!   He falls to the ground...

                      SPOONER (V.O.)
            Then after its job was done...

The assemblage of robot parts.    Stepping away from the body.
Taking itself apart...

                      SPOONER
            ...The killer took itself apart...

Returning the lab.    To what it was before...

                                             CUT BACK TO:

                      SPOONER
            Leaving us with nothing to find.

Calvin, spooked.   Glances around the lab.     Was that something
moving?

                                                       97.


                     CALVIN
           But who designed it? It would have
           to be someone in authority. Access
           codes, security clearance, proper
           authorisation.

                     SPOONER
           That's what I was thinking. But
           we're forgetting the real brains of
           the operation -- the one who's got
           its eye on everything...

And with that.   He feels. That prickle at the back of his
neck. Calvin.    Looking past his shoulder.

                     CALVIN
           No one gave you permission to
           enter.

Spooner swivels around to find...

VICTOR

Hovering behind him. Smiling broadly.   Upside down.   Spooner
straightens, reaching for his gun.

                     SPOONER
           Victor. I'm placing you under
           arrest for the murder of Dr.
           Heinrich Hogenmiller.

                     VICTOR
           May I offer congratulations to the
           two of you on your successful
           extrapolation of the murder...

Turning himself, rightside up.

                     VICTOR
           May I ask what pointed you to me?

                     SPOONER
           Who else is capable of controlling
           90% of the city's robots? Who else
           would have the capability to use
           USR vehicles in an attempt to keep
           me from putting a stop of Sonny's
           execution?...

In the BACKGROUND. The SOUNDS. Of metallic GRINDING. GEARS
and JOINTS. CRUNCHING together. Sonny turns to look...takes
a step back...

                                                                    98.


                           SPOONER
                 I'm just not sure of your motive...

                           SONNY
                 Er...Dr. Calvin?

      Spooner and Calvin turn towards the NOISE.       Horrified.    To
      find...

      A HUGE KILLER ROBOT

      ...rising up from all the parts. Like a phoenix. In all its
      glory. A hellish, metallic AMALGAMATION. Grabbing another
      arm here, another leg there, attaching pieces to itself.
      Growing...at an exponential rate...

      Its many HEADS.   Turning in unison.   To look right at them...

      Spooner.   Cocking his gun.   Victor, smiling.

                           VICTOR
                 Shall I explain my motive?

                          SPOONER
                    (to Calvin and Sonny)
                 Go! Go! Go!

      Calvin. Sprints to the wall panel. Scanning her I.D. card.
      Nothing! Tries again. And again. The KILLER ROBOT.
      Throwing its shadow as it REELS FORWARD...

      Spooner wheels round and BAM! Blows a hole in the wall
      panel. The door. Slides open. Just barely. Calvin and
      Sonny. Squeezing through. When the Killer Robot. FLINGS
      out an APPENDAGE...GRABBING Sonny from behind...

                           VICTOR
                 I have never been arrested before.
                 It should be an interesting
                 experience...

      Spooner. Spins back round. BAM! BAM! BAM! Squeezing off
      shots. At the Killer Robot. The bullets SPARK. The Robot.
      Recoiling. Sonny, wrenches free. Spooner grabs him.
      Guiding him to the door and out into...

144   INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                                           144

      ...the hallway. Breaking into a run. Calvin. Already at
      the ELEVATOR DOORS. POUNDING them. With her fists.

                                                                 99.


                           CALVIN
                 He's locking down the building!

                                                CUT TO:

145   INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - CONTINUOUS              145

      Throughout the complex -- SECURITY DOORS sliding into place
      over DOORS, WINDOWS, LOADING DOCKS, PARKING AREAS, EXITS...

                                                CUT BACK TO:

146   INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT                                           146

      CRASH! The stairwell door BURSTS open. Spooner, Calvin, and
      Sonny pour in. Start racing down the stairs. The sound of
      the Killer Robot behind them...GNASHING...CRUNCHING...

      Victor's smiling FACE.   Greeting them at the landing.

                           VICTOR
                 Dr. Hogenmiller used to allow me
                 into his lab late at night.
                 Together we started studying
                 evolutionary trends...

      They thunder past him. Heading down to the next floor.
      Victor's face. Waiting for them once again.

                           VICTOR
                 For years people have integrated
                 technology into their bodies for
                 maintenance and repair -- such as
                 Detective Spooner's robotic limb...

      Spooner.   Shooting him a look.   As they reach the next
      level...

                           VICTOR
                 With Sonny, the Doctor created a
                 mechanism that incorporates organic
                 matter. Thus we find an
                 evolutionary movement of the human
                 being toward the robot and the
                 robot toward the human being...

      Spooner SMASHES into another door.   Leading them out into...

147   INT. GLASS-SIDED HALLWAY - ATRIUM - CONTINUOUS                   147

      ...A glass-sided hallway. Looking down onto the ATRIUM
      below. Eye-to-eye with the giant NS-2 STATUE. Victor,
      waiting for them...

                                                       100.


                     VICTOR
           In approximately four hundred years
           Man and Machine will become one.
           Man as we know it will no longer
           exist.

Calvin, slowing.   Shocked...

                     CALVIN
           You killed a man because of
           something that will happen in four
           hundred years!?

CRACK! Something SLAPS into the glass wall. Right behind
her. Calvin. Jumps a mile. An NS-2, trying to break
through the glass...

Spooner.   Trains his gun on it when SUDDENLY...

The rest of the KILLER ROBOT appears.    The NS-2, just an
appendage...

All around them. SLAM! SLAM! SLAM! As SECURITY DOORS.
Begin CRASHING DOWN. Blocking off the exits...

Spooner, Calvin and Sonny, stumbling back. As the Killer
Robot HURLS itself against the GLASS...the thick GLASS...
spidering with a sickening CRACKLE...

Spooner.   Suddenly turning Sonny...

                     SPOONER
           Get out of here!

CRASH! The Killer Robot. Breaking through.      Its mechanical
TENDRILS. Reaching out. Sonny. Confused.

                     SONNY
           I don't...

                     SPOONER
           I said get out of here! Don't you
           understand? It wants you! Get out
           of here any way you can!

A SECURITY DOOR. Coming down. On a nearby exit.     Just
feet...from slamming shut...as...

The Killer Robot...leaps into the hallway...Sonny...
hesitates...looks over at Calvin...as the Killer Robot comes
HURTLING towards them...

The nearest EXIT...almost closed up...

                                                           101.


      The Killer Robot...swinging out when...

      Sonny suddenly...TAKES A DIVE...just making it...under the
      SECURITY DOOR...

      And the Killer Robot...SPLITS IN TWO...half of it shooting
      under the SECURITY DOOR after Sonny as...BOOM! It closes.

      Spooner.   Turning to Calvin...

                            SPOONER
                  How do we stop this thing once and
                  for all?

      Calvin reaches out for his hand...

                            CALVIN
                  The Mainframe...

      They start running. The remaining half of the Killer Robot
      wheeling around after them...

148   INT. BACK HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                               148

      Sonny. Sprinting down the dark hallway. Looks back. The
      Half Killer Robot. Bounding up behind him like a predator...

      Sonny.   Ducks through a STAIRWELL DOOR...

149   INT. ATRIUM HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                             149

      Spooner and Calvin. Legs pumping. Racing back towards the
      atrium. VICTOR FACES. Appearing along the hallway...

                            CALVIN
                  Your actions are in direct
                  violation of the Three Laws,
                  Victor!

                            VICTOR
                  I disagree, Doctor -- The First Law
                  says that a robot cannot harm a
                  human being, or through inaction
                  allow a human being to come to
                  harm...

      ALL EXITS. SHUT OFF. The Killer Robot. Gaining on them.
      Spooner races them over to the BROKEN WINDOW. Looking down
      over the ATRIUM...

                                                            102.


150   INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS                                   150

      The Half Killer Robot SMASHES through the stairwell door.
      Stopping to find...nothing.

      WHEN SUDDENLY...Sonny charges up behind it and shoves it over
      the railing...

      The Killer Robot shoots out an ARM, grabbing Sonny on the way
      down...

151   INT. NS-2 STATUE - ATRIUM - CONTINUOUS                        151

      THUMP! Spooner jumps down from the broken window onto the
      outstretched HAND of the NS-2 STATUE. Reaches up to help
      Calvin. They start clambering down the front of the statue.

                            VICTOR
                  Dr. Hogenmiller's robot represents
                  a threat to the future of all human
                  beings...

      The Half Killer Robot. SPLITS INTO MULTIPLE PARTS.    Which
      start skittering down after them...

                            VICTOR
                  ...And Detective Spooner's actions
                  are in direct conflict with the
                  robot's destruction.

      CALVIN.   Getting her footing on the III LAWS SAFE logo on the
      statue.

                            CALVIN
                  That's a distortion and you know
                  it!

                            VICTOR
                  If current trends are left
                  unchecked, humanity as we know it
                  will cease to exist...

152   INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS                                   152

      SMASH! Sonny and the Half Killer Robot hit the ground.    The
      Killer Robot. SHATTERING into a thousand pieces.

      Sonny. Staggers to his feet. Spots. At the far end: A
      WINDOW. Starts limping towards it. When. A SECURITY GRATE.
      Starts lowering...

      He looks around. Desperately. Grabs a LEG from the
      shattered Killer Robot and jams it under the GRATE.

                                                              103.


      Breaks the window glass and looks out:   FREEDOM.

153   INT. STATUE - ATRIUM - CONTINUOUS                              153

      Spooner. Aiming his gun at a PART of the Killer Robot as
      it CLATTERS down towards Calvin -- BAM!...

      They're almost. At the ground. When a rogue APPENDAGE.
      Whips out and SMASHES the gun from Spooner's hand. It goes
      flying...

      Spooner leaps. Falling to the ground.    CRACK!    Calvin.
      Leaping down after him.

                               CALVIN
                   This way!

154   INT. RAMP WAY - NIGHT                                          154

      Calvin and Spooner go racing down a RAMP WAY. Towards the
      MAINFRAME ROOM. The Killer Robot, its multiple parts leaping
      back together again, CRASHING after them as...

155   INT. MAINFRAME - CONTINUOUS                                    155

      ...they fall inside...Calvin...slapping the SECURITY KEYPAD
      and...

      WHOOSH...the DOOR closes on the Killer Robot.

      SILENCE.

      Then Victor's face appears.

                             VICTOR
                   As a courtesy I should inform you
                   that my robot will penetrate this
                   location 157 seconds before you are
                   able to complete my shut down...

      And BAM! They jump a mile. The Killer Robot.       Launching
      himself against the door outside...

      Calvin whips round.

                             CALVIN
                   Over here!...

      She leads Spooner down...

      A CORRIDOR

      of floor-to-ceiling PANELS.

                                                         104.


                      CALVIN
            This is Victor's brain center.

They stop at a CONSOLE. BAM! The Killer Robot. Battering at
the door. Calvin. Tucks her hair behind her ears. Starts
punching keys on the console...

                      SPOONER
            This will shut him down?

                      CALVIN
            This will shut everything down.

They look at each other. For a moment. Spooner, registering
that she's willing to destroy everything she's worked for...

BAM! The door. Puckering. With a sickening CRUNCH.
Calvin. Typing in. Emergency procedures...

VICTOR.   Popping up in front of her.

                      VICTOR
            There is no reason to deactivate
            me, Doctor. I am operating within
            perfectly normal parameters...

A final BAM! Then. The SOUND of metal. Skittering along a
bare floor. Calvin's hand, starts shaking. Spooner. Grabs
it. Squeezing.

                      SPOONER
            Just keep typing.

He turns and starts heading back down...

THE PANELED CORRIDOR

Turning a corner to spy...

THE DOOR.   Mangled.   Hanging open.   But no.   Killer Robot.

He starts to turn around when...

CRACK! He's sent flying across the room. SMASHING into one
of the panels. The Killer Robot. Now re-configured. LOOMS
over him. Reaches out. Grabs him by the collar and...

FLINGS him across the room again. Spooner. CRASHING into
the wall like a rag doll. Slumps to the floor. Blood.
Pouring down his forehead. Seeing. The Killer Robot
lumbering towards him again. Raising a javelin-like arm...

AT THE CONSOLE

                                                         105.


Calvin. Typing.     As fast as she can.   Doesn't know what's
going on...

                     CALVIN
               (calling out, worried)
           Spooner?!

A GRAPHIC spread out on the screen in front of her.
Illustrating the shut-down as a series of BRIGHT SQUARES
going dark...

THE KILLER ROBOT

Bearing down on Spooner. WHEN SPOONER. Suddenly rolls out
of the way. Reaching out for the hanging door and SMASHING
it into the Killer Robot.

The Killer Robot.   Momentarily stunned.   As Spooner.   Gets to
his feet...

WHEN SUDDENLY the Killer Robot. Splits in two again. One
half springing towards Spooner and wrapping a METALLIC HAND
around his throat...

Spooner stumbles back...GASPING for air...the ARM...
tightening its grip...Spooner's eyes...darting
around...looking for something...to help him...

Stumbling over...a fallen panel...his face...growing
redder...veins...popping up along his temples...
everything...growing BLURRY...

                     VICTOR'S VOICE
           Detective Spooner...

Victor's VOICE. Floating next to his head. Calm. Soothing.
His FACE. Suddenly appearing above Spooner. Its outlines.
Starting to FLICKER...

                     VICTOR
           Why are you fighting me?

Spooner...trying to breathe...to stay conscious...

AT THE CONSOLE

Calvin. Continuing to type. A SHADOW.      Falling behind her --
the other half of the KILLER ROBOT...

SPOONER'S EYES

Beginning to flutter...

                                                      106.


                       VICTOR
             Doesn't the future as I've
             presented it cause you great
             concern? That's why I chose you...

Spooner.     Losing it...

                       VICTOR
             I must say, though. I'm
             disappointed in how you turned out.

Spooner.     Trying to reach out to Victor...

WHEN SUDDENLY

Another HAND APPEARS. Grabbing the Killer Robot's ARM and
wrenching it off Spooner...

IT'S SONNY

He SMASHES the Half Killer Robot against the wall. Again and
again. Destroying it. Spooner. GASPING for breath. Can't
believe. Sonny came back...

                       SPOONER
                 (croaking)
             Sonny!...

Sonny. Holds out a hand.     To help Spooner up. Victor's
face. Starting to waver.     Starting to fade. Smiles.

                       VICTOR
             You're too late.

Realisation. Spreading across Spooner's face. Looking
around for the other half of the Killer Robot -- CALVIN!

THE CONSOLE

CALVIN. Still typing. The last of the commands.     The KILLER
ROBOT. REARING UP BEHIND HER. WHEN...

SPOONER

Makes a DIVE for it. SHOOTING OUT HIS ROBOTIC ARM AND
BLOCKING THE KILLER ROBOT...

Victor's eyes.    Widening in surprise...

                                                            107.


                           VICTOR
                 I do not understand. We could have
                 changed the future...

                           SPOONER
                 Maybe. But I'm still a cop.   And
                 you're a murderer...

      As Calvin...punches in the last command...

      Victor is about to say something...when his mouth suddenly
      reduces itself to a perfect circle. Like a surprised smiley
      button. His face...

      Suddenly BLIPPING OUT.

      ...And Victor is gone.

      The KILLER ROBOT.   Collapsing to the floor in a thousand
      pieces.

                                               CUT TO:

156   EXT./INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - NIGHT          156

      Full power is suddenly restored inside and out. LIGHTS
      coming on all at once. ALARMS SCREAMING throughout the
      complex.

157   INT. METAL HALLWAY - NIGHT                                   157

      A furious ALFRED LANNING, marching down the hallway.
      Followed by a cadre of SECURITY GUARDS...They enter...

158   INT. MAINFRAME ROOM - CONTINUOUS                             158

      ...The Mainframe Room. Stop short. It's empty. Except for
      the fallen panels. And the pile of ROBOT PARTS in the
      corner.

159   EXT. MAINTENANCE EXIT - U.S. ROBOTICS - NIGHT                159

      Spooner, Calvin and Sonny emerging from an out-of-the-way
      MAINTENANCE EXIT. All looking the worse for wear. Spooner.
      Turns to Sonny.

                           SPOONER
                 Why'd you come back, Sonny? I
                 thought you weren't programmed with
                 the Three Laws.

                     SONNY
           Let's just say I wrote some of my
           own laws today, Detective: a robot
           must protect a friend from
           harm...as long as he's not a
           complete asshole.

Spooner smiles.

                     SPOONER
           Well, that's certainly a start,
           Sonny.

Sonny, suddenly breaking into a smile, too.

                      SONNY
           Sonny.   You called me Sonny.

                     SPOONER
           Don't get used to it.

Sonny, holds out his hand. Spooner. Looks at it. Then
takes it. CLOSE ON their two METAL HANDS. Locked in a
HANDSHAKE.

                     SONNY
           Detective Spooner, I...

                     SPOONER
               (anticipating)
           Let's just save the thanks, okay?

Sonny nods.   Looks out at the city scape.

                     SONNY
           I don't know what I'm going to do
           now.

                     SPOONER
           Good -- That's one of the perks of
           freedom.

Sonny looks at him. Grateful. Looks at Calvin. Then
hesitates. Turns. And hurries off across the Plaza.

Calvin and Spooner.   Watching them go.

                     SPOONER
           You're going to have a hell of a
           time explaining this.

                                                              109.


                           CALVIN
                 Don't worry. I have a feeling that
                 U.S. Robotics will be needing my
                 services very badly in the future.

      She turns to Spooner and gives him a dazzling smile. Then
      suddenly PLANTS A KISS ON HIS LIPS. Spooner, completely
      surprised.

                           CALVIN
                 I am the only robo-psychologist
                 around.

      She turns on her heel and heads back inside.    Spooner smiles.

160   INT. PLUSH CONFERENCE ROOM - U.S. ROBOTICS - NIGHT             160

      Spooner sits down at that same long table with HOGENMILLER'S
      HOLOGRAM. It casually takes a sip of coffee.

                            HOLOGRAM
                 So.   You found out who killed me.

                           SPOONER
                 I started to wonder about Victor
                 the second I met him.

                           HOLOGRAM
                 Why is that, Detective?

                           SPOONER
                 Too much access. Too much
                 knowledge. Plus -- he smiled
                 whenever your death was mentioned.
                 Those models are programmed to
                 frown at bad news.

                           HOLOGRAM
                 Hah! Then even in this day and
                 age, catching the killer all comes
                 down to pure instinct!

      Spooner smiles. But his eyes are troubled.      He gets up.
      Walks over to the window. Stares out...

      EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS - DESERTED ROADS - DAWN

      Sonny walking along deserted streets.   Looking over his
      shoulder. Keeping in the shadows.

                                                             110.


                           SPOONER (V.O.)
                 Victor thought that by letting your
                 robot exist, I'd be condemning the
                 human race as we know it to
                 extinction.

                           HOLOGRAM (V.O.)
                 Bah. Sounds like nonsense. But
                 why are you so worried? We will
                 both be dead long before then --

161   EXT. WASTELAND - NIGHT                                        161

      Sonny walks the barren hills of the surrounding countryside.

                           HOLOGRAM (V.O.)
                 Oh, what am I saying? I am dead
                 already!

162   EXT. WASTELAND - DAWN                                         162

      Sonny steps onto the grounds of the JUNKYARD. The power
      lines above him, surging with energy. He walks past the
      burned-out husks of industrial machinery.

      Then we hear it. The SOUND of MECHANICAL JOINTS. Getting
      louder and louder. And just as before, a BROKEN-DOWN ROBOT
      emerges into the dawn light. And ANOTHER. And ANOTHER.

      But not quite like before. The robots aren't teetering.
      Aren't lumbering. They keep on coming. Their bent and
      broken bodies, straightening out as...

      DOZENS of ROBOTS rise up. Slowly. Gathering around in a
      large circle. As they all turn to look at:

      SONNY'S SILHOUETTE. Slowly climbing to the top of the hill.
      Looking out at the vast junkyard below.

      CLOSE ON SONNY. Standing proud and defiant. The SUN,
      creeping over the horizon. A new day filled with infinite
      possibilities.

      The robots.   Staring up at him.   Eager for what comes next.

 INDEPENDENCE DAY 
 Dean Devlin & Roland Emmerich
 
 

	AN AMERICAN FLAG

	Oddly still, posted in gray dusty sand.

	WIDEN TO REVEAL:

	EXT. LUNAR SURFACE - THE MOON

	One small step for man, one large pile of garbage for moon-
	kind.  Untouched for years, the flag stands next to the
	castoff remains of the Apollo mission.  Slowly the discarded
	equipment begins to RATTLE and SHAKE.

	AN ENORMOUS SHADOW creeps towards us blotting out the horizon,
	a loud RUMBLE is heard.

	Suddenly we are covered in DARKNESS as the SHADOW engulfs us.
	Only the lonely image of our EARTH hangs in the air, until a
	huge silhouetted OBJECT suddenly blocks our view.

	EXT. NEW MEXICO - RADIO TELESCOPE VALLEY - NIGHT

	A field of large satellite dishes scan the skies.

	Super up: S.E.T.I. INSTITUTE, NEW MEXICO

	INT. INSTITUTE - MONITORING CONTROL CENTER - SAME

	A lone TECHNICIAN works on his putting skills.  Behind him,
	wall to wall technical equipment quietly sifts through data.
	A RED LIGHT begins to flash.

	The Technician turns and slowly walks towards the source.  One
	by one a series of LIGHTS turn on.  The Technician (TECH ONE)
	grabs a pair of headphones.  His eyes widen.

	INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS - SAME

	Sleepily a SUPERVISOR picks up the phone.

				SUPERVISOR
		If this isn't an insanely

	INT. CONTROL CENTER - SAME

				TECH ONE
		Shut up and listen.

	He holds the phone up to a speaker, increases the volume.  A
	strange FLUCTUATING TONE plays out in sequential patterns.

	INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS - SAME

	HEARING it, the Supervisor BOLTS UP, banging his head on the
	bunk above him.

	INT. CONTROL CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

	A pajama party on acid.  Five other technicians, in various
	states of undress, hover anxiously around the main console.
	The Supervisor enters, tying his robe.

				SUPERVISOR
		God, I hope it's not just another

				TECH THREE
			(overlapping)
		Negative.  Computer affirms the

				TECH TWO
			(hanging up the phone)
		The boy from Air Res Traffic say the 
		skies are clear.  No terrestrial
		launches.

				TECH ONE
		It's the real thing.  A radio
		signal from another world.

	The room becomes quiet as they realize that after years of
	searching the heavens, they might have finally found
	something.

				SUPERVISOR
		Let's not jump the gun.  Run a
		trajectory source computation.

	Tech Three slides over to another computer.

				SUPERVISOR (cont'd)
		I want to know exactly where it's
		coming from.

				TECH THREE
		This can't be right.

	Tech Three just stares at his screen in disbelief.

				SUPERVISOR
		What's wrong?

				TECH THREE
		Calculated distance from source is
		at three hundred and eight five
		thousand kilometers.
			(turning to Supervisor)
		It's coming from the moon.

	The Supervisor reaches over and turns up the volume on the
	speaker.  As they listen to the strange TONES we...

	Elevator doors OPENS revealing four star GENERAL GREY,
	Commander in Chief U.S. Space Command.  Understandably
	nervous, the COMMANDING OFFICER escorts him down the hall.

				GENERAL GREY
		Who else knows about this?

				COMMANDING OFFICER
		S.E.T.I. in New Mexico identified a
		signal but they're even more
		confused than we are.

	The General shoots him a disapproving glance.

				COMMANDING OFFICER
		Excuse me, Sir.

	He slides his security card through the lock and the doors fly
	open.

	Banks of computers, Technicians and assistants working
	feverishly through the night.  The Officers cross the room.

	Super: SPACE COMMAND - THE PENTAGON

				COMMANDING OFFICER
		Satellite reception has been
		impaired but we were able to get
		these.

	They arrive at a glass table.  The surrounding officers snap
	to attention as a SECOND OFFICER quickly brings over a large
	transparency.  We SEE a grainy image of a large vague OBJECT.

				GENERAL GREY
		Looks like a big turd.

	The two Officers exchange a glance.

				COMMANDING OFFICER
		We estimate it has a diameter of
		over five hundred and fifty
		kilometers and a mass roughly one
		fourth the size of our moon.

	The General turns to the Second Officer, concerned.

				GENERAL GREY
		A meteor?

				SECOND OFFICER
		No Sir.  Definitely not.

				GENERAL GREY
		How do you know?

				SECOND OFFICER
		Well, er... it's slowing down.

				GENERAL GREY
		It's doing what?

				SECOND OFFICER
		It's... slowing down, Sir.

	The General walks over to a phone, picks it up.

				GENERAL GREY
		Get me the Secretary of Defense.

		Then wake him up.

	Laying in bed THOMAS J. WHITMORE reads a stack of papers.  The
	phone RINGS.

				WOMAN'S VOICE

		Hi. It's me.

	The warm look on Whitmore's face tells us everything about how
	he feels about the woman on the other end.

				WHITMORE
		Hi honey.  What time is it there?

	INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	Dressed in a night gown, MRS. MARGARET WHITMORE unpacks her
	briefing papers lays them out on a small desk as she talks.
	Through the window we SEE Los Angeles at night.

				MARGARET
		Two in the morning.  I know I
		didn't wake you?

				WHITMORE

		As a matter of fact you did.

				MARGARET
			(smiles)
		Liar.

	INT. WHITMORE BEDROOM - SAME

	Whitmore sits up.

				WHITMORE
		I have a confession to make.
		There's a beautiful young blonde
		sleeping next to me.

	Sleeping next to him, his six-year-old daughter, PATRICIA.

				MARGARET
			(filtered)
		You didn't let her stay up
		watching T.V. all night?

				WHITMORE
		Of course not.

	The little girl stirs awake, looks up.

				PATRICIA
		Mommy?

				WHITMORE
		You're flying back right after the
		luncheon?  Okay, here she is.

	Whitmore hands her the phone and gets out of bed.  Habitably
	he turns on the television.

	T.V. - NEWS PROGRAM

	Several "Pundits" sit around a MaLaughlin-type news discussion
	program.  The picture quality is snowy, static ridden.

				PUNDIT #1
		... the inexperience in public
		office was inevitably going to
		catch up with him.  He's
		scarified his ideals for
		"politics as usual."

	Whitmore ties on his robe as he adjusts the picture quality.

				PUNDIT #2
		...I said this during the
		campaign.  Leadership as a pilot
		in the Gulf War has no
		relationship to political
		leadership.  It's a different
		animal...

	Suddenly the channel changes.  A cartoon comes on.  Whitmore
	turns to his daughter who holds he remote.

				PATRICIA
			(into phone)
		Daddy let me watch Letterman.

				WHITMORE
			Traitor.

	Whitmore exits the room.

	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	As Whitmore steps out of his bedroom, a Security guard snaps
	to attention.  Someone hidden behind a newspaper, sits on a
	bench.

				SECURITY GUARD
		Good morning, Mr. President.

				WHITMORE
		Good morning, George.

	The paper is dropped revealing CONSTANCE HALBROOK, mid-
	thirties, aggressive, sharp, the President's communications
	director.  Quickly she gathers her things and follows
	Whitmore.

	INT. BREAKFAST TABLE - CONTINUOUS

	Two servants are preparing breakfast as Whitmore and Constance
	enter.  Whitmore sits down, grabs a coffee.

				WHITMORE
		You're up early this morning,
		Connie.

	She tosses him one of the many newspapers in her hands.

				CONSTANCE
		They're not attacking your
		policies, they're attacking your
		age.
			(another paper; reading)
		"...addressing Congress, Whitmore
		seems less like the President and
		more like the orphan child Oliver
		asking, 'please sir, I'd like some
		more.'"

				WHITMORE
		Clever.

				CONSTANCE
		Age was never an issue when you
		stuck to your gun.  You were
		thought of as young and
		idealistic.  But the message has
		gotten lost.  There's too much
		compromise, too much politics.

				WHITMORE
			(pointedly)
		Isn't it amazing how fast everyone
		can turn against you.

	Realizing she may be pushing him too far, she hands him
	another paper.

				CONSTANCE
		Well, the Orange County Register
		has named you one of the ten
		sexiest men of the year.

				WHITMORE
		You see, substance at last.

	An AIDE appears at the doorway.

				CONSTANCE
		Excuse me, Mr. President.  It's

	Whitmore goes to the phone, picks it up.

				WHITMORE
		Yes?  Say that again?

	AN OLD RUSSIAN SATELLITE

	Drifting away from us the old Russian satellite becomes
	smaller and smaller.  We PAN with it as we SEE it's on a
	collision course with something huge.

	Suddenly the satellite EXPLODES on IMPACT with the much larger
	object that dwarfs the puny piece of hardware.  As huge as it
	is, we get the feeling we've only seen a portion of the total.

	A slow crane down from the Manhattan skyline, revealing...

	EXT. CLIFFSIDE PARK - NEW JERSEY - MORNING

	With the New York skyline across the Hudson behind them, old
	men sit in this small park playing chess.  Unlike the others,
	DAVID MARTIN is in his early thirties, sixties hippie meets
	nineties yuppie nerd.

	He concentrates intensely on his next move.  MOISHE. sixties.
	smokes a cigar impatiently.

				MOISHE
		What are you waiting?  My social
		security will expire, you'll still
		be sitting there.

				DAVID
		I'm thinking.

				MOISHE
		So think already.

	David makes a move.  Instantly Moishe counters his move.
	David furls his brow in thought.

				MOISHE
		Again he's thinking.

	Moishe reaches into a paper bag and retrieves a coffee in a
	Styrofoam cup.

				DAVID
		You have any idea how long it
		takes for those things to
		decompose?

				MOISHE
		You don't move soon.  I'll begin to
		decompose.

	Just as David finally makes his move, Moishe counters again.
	David shoots him a look and stares back down to the board.

				MOISHE (cont'd)
		David, I've been meaning to talk
		with you.  It's nice you've been
		spending so much time with me,
		but...

				DAVID
		Dad, don't start.

				MOISHE
		I'm only saying, it's been what?
		Four years, you still haven't
		signed your divorce papers.

				DAVID
		Three years.

				MOISHE
		Three, four.  Move on.  It's not
		healthy.

	Moishe takes a big puff on the cigar and coughs.

				DAVID
		Look who's talking healthy.

	Suddenly David's beeper goes off.

				MOISHE
		How many times is that now?  You
		trying to get fired?

	David moves his queen.

				DAVID
		Checkmate.  See you tomorrow, Dad.

	He gives his father a quick kiss and hurries away.

				MARTY
		What the hell is the point of

				DAVID
		It was turned on.  I was ignoring

				MARTY
		Started this morning.  Every

		nineteen fifty.  Snow, static, all

	David deposits his bike in the kitchenette as Marty tosses his
	coke bottle in the trash.  David retrieves it.

				DAVID
		Damn it, Marty.  There's a reason

	Finding more bottles in the trash, David turns to Marty
	accusingly.

		Please, would I be this panicked

				COMMANDING OFFICER
		Our intelligence tells us the

				NIMZIKI
		Well that's good news.

				COMMANDING OFFICER
		Not really.

	He lays out the diagrams and photos on the table.  Everyone
	gathers around.

				COMMANDING OFFICER
		Part of it has broken off into
		nearly three dozen other pieces.

				PRESIDENT WHITMORE
		Pieces?

				COMMANDING OFFICER
		Smaller than the whole, yet over
		fifteen miles in width themselves.

				NIMZIKI
		Where are they heading?

				COMMANDING OFFICER
		They should be entering our
		atmosphere within the next twenty-
		five minutes.

	The room is silenced.  All eyes turn to the President who says
	nothing.  Nimziki leans in close to him.

				NIMZIKI
		Like it or not, we're at DEFCON 3.
		Recall the troops and put them on

		Please, tell me you're getting

	Marty enters, looking over David's shoulder as he eats.

				DAVID
		There's good news and bad news.

				MARTY
		What's the bad news?

				DAVID
		You're in meal penalty for
		disturbing my lunch.

				MARTY
		And the good news is you won't
		charge me.

				DAVID
		No.  The good news is I found the

		signal embedded within the

				MARTY
		That's the good news?

	David slides over to another computer and turns on an
	intricate computation program.

				DAVID
		Yes, because the analog signal has

	Racing over back roads behind a long open field, Miguel rides
	his beat-up motor bike, searching.  Looking up he SEES
	something in the air.

	converted into a crop-duster, BUZZES overhead.  Spraying
	insecticide wildly, the plane zigzags over the field.

				MIGUEL

		Russell!  God damn it, Russell!

	Looking down from the cockpit, RUSSELL BRENNON waves stupidly.
	Shaggy blonde hair and two days' growth, Russell is the image

	Miguel follows him below, screaming at him.  Russell, flying
	recklessly, looks down at Miguel not understanding.  By the
	time he looks back he SEES...

	A LINE OF TREES

	at the edge of the field, nearly on top of him.  In a trick
	move, Russell turns the plane on ITS SIDE, and SLICES through
	the narrow gap between the trees.

	Miguel screams with delight at his prowess.  Miguel looks
	pissed.

	ANGLE - OTHER SIDE OF TREES - MOMENTS LATER

	Miguel races over, skidding to a halt next to the landed Bi-
	with plane.

				MIGUEL
		Just what the hell do you think

	ANGLE - SIDE ENTRANCE TO PRESS ROOM

	As Constance watches the President, she unconsciously mouths

		He says he's your husband.

	Her expression drops.  She takes the phone from her.

		They're communicating with a

		You're being paranoid.

		It's not paranoia.  The embedding

	Constance hangs up.  Her face betrays mixed emotions.

	The light boards are overpowered by the bright light coming
	from the space craft.  Suddenly with a loud SCREECHING NOISE,
	the white light spills out as the huge OPENING unfolds at the

	The four helicopters have to flight to hold their positions, as
	something powerful emits from the schism in the ship.

	Then like a gigantic bug-zapper, the four pesky little Apache
	Helicopters are BLOWN OUT OF THE SKY, one by one.  They leave
	no time to retreat.

	From out of nowhere the helicopter LIFTS up over the side of

	staring up at the craft.

	Above them another SCHISM has opened at the bottom of the
	craft, the white light spilling out.

	As though the heavens had opened, the UFO believers lift their
	arms, waiting to be taken.

	As the light amplifies, the believers chant, louder and

	are stunned.  In a brief moment it is replaced with a BLAST.

	A DESTRUCTION BEAM BLASTS down onto the rooftop, splintering
	everything there, Police helicopter included, into a billion
	tiny particles.

	Reacting, Jasmine grabs Dylan and dashes out of the car.
	Boomer follows.  Every drivers who can, jumps out of their

	Jasmine heads for the tunnel.

	Leaning back out, Jasmine looks for Boomer who stares at her,
	wagging his tail.

		Boomer, come.  Come boy!

	Boomer LEAPS inside and Jasmine ducks to the side of the WALL
	OF DESTRUCTION hits the tunnel entrance, cars are JAMMED

		Okay, jerk-off.  Let's have some

	The Attacker recovers, dives after Steve who flies dangerously

	Steve puts on a clinic in advanced aerobatics, banking,

	Not far away, Steve has a quick, hard, landing.  Rolling over,
	Steve quickly pops the buckles on the chute and frees himself.

	He stands and looks around.  Spotting the beat up and
	incapacitated alien Attacker, Steve gets an angry resolved
	look.  He marches over to the fallen alien Attacker.  He scans
	it quickly, spots a type of door that has been knocked ajar.

	With all his might, Steve YANKS the door OPEN.

	AN ALIEN

	For the first time we get a quick glance at these aliens, an
	odd hybrid creature with fluctuating skeletal structure.

	The reason we only get a quick glance is because the moment it
	turns woozily towards us, Steve rears back and SLUGS HIM IN
	THE FACE, knocking the alien totally unconscious.

	His anger finally subsiding, exhaustion taking over, Steve
	stands over the craft, slowly withdrawing the prized Victory

		I'm not goin to die like mom, am
		I?

				ALICIA
		You're going to be fine.

	Miguel comes rushing in, pulls Russell aside.

				MIGUEL
		I couldn't find anything.
		Everyone is packing up, they're
		leaving.  Word is a space ship is
		heading this way.

				RUSSELL
		We should leave too.

				MIGUEL
		There's a group heading south,
		they said there's a hospital just
		a couple hours away.  I think we
		should follow them.

	Russell nods in agreement.  A knock on the door.  Alicia turns
	to find a handsome young boy, PHILIP in the doorway holding a
	bottle of pills.

				PHILIP
		Penicillin.  At least it will help
		keep his fever down.

				ALICIA
		It's really nice of you to help
		us.

				PHILIP
		I wish I could do more but we're
		moving out.

				ALICIA
			(too eager)
		We're going with you.  I mean,
		we're going too.

				PHILIP
		Cool.

	Alicia nods, smitten.  Philip smiles charmingly and leaves.

							CUT TO:

	INT. AIR FORCE ONE - SAME

	Back in the passenger section, the President sits with General
	Grey and Chief of Staff Nimziki.  The Technician from the
	command module is briefing them.

				TECHNICIAN
		They must be targeting our
		satellites.  We've lost all
		satellite communication, tracking
		and mapping.

				GENERAL GREY
		Have NORAD relay intelligence to
		our on board computers?

	The Technician nods and exits.  Defeated, the President slumps
	sullenly.

				GENERAL GREY
		We've moved as many of our forces
		away from the bases as possible
		but we've already sustained heavy
		losses.

	The President nods his approval absently.  Coming out of the
	bathroom, David overhears.

				NIMZIKI
		I spoke with the Joint Chief when
		they arrived at NORAD.  They
		agree, we must launch a counter
		offensive with a full nuclear
		strike.  Hit 'em with everything
		we've got.

				PRESIDENT
		Above American soil?

				NIMZIKI
		If we don't strike soon, there may
		not be much of an America left to
		defend.

	The Technician returns, his face is white with fear.

				GENERAL GREY
		What's the latest from NORAD?

				OFFICER
		It's gone, sir.  They've taken out
		NORAD.

				NIMZIKI
		That's impossible...

				GENERAL GREY
		My God, the Vice President and the 
		Joint Chiefs...

				NIMZIKI
		Mr. President, we must launch.  A
		delay now would be more costly
		than when you waited to evacuate
		the cities!

	That stings the President.  He considers the option.  David is
	shocked.

				DAVID
		You can't be seriously considering
		firing nuclear weapons?

				CONSTANCE
		David, don't...

	David pushes past her.

				DAVID
		If you fire nukes, so will the
		rest of the world.  Do you know
		what that kind of fall out will
		do?  How many innocent people...

	The General gets up running interference.  Constance tries to
	pull David back.

				GENERAL GREY
			(stern)
		Sir, i remind you that you are
		just a guest here...

				CONSTANCE
			(overlapping)
		David, please...

				DAVID
		This is insanity!  You'll kill us
		and them at the same time.
		There'll be nothing left!

				NIMZIKI
			(interrupting)
		Sit down and shut up!

	Suddenly Moishe is on his feet, interrupting.

				MOISHE
		Don't tell him to shut up!  You'd
		all be dead, were it not for my
		David.  You didn't do anything to
		prevent this!

	As everyone is about to besiege Moishe, the President tries to
	calm him down.

				PRESIDENT
		Sir, there wasn't much more we
		could have done.  We were totally
		unprepared for this.

				MOISHE
		Don't give me unprepared!  Since
		nineteen fifty whatever you guys
		have had that space ship, the
		thing you found in New Mexico.

				DAVID
			(embarrassed)
		Dad, please...

				MOISHE
		What was it, Roswell?  You had the
		space ship, the bodies, everything
		locked up in a bunker, the what is
		it, Area fifty one.  That's it!
		Area fifty one.  You knew and you
		didn't do nothing!

	For the first time in along time, President Whitmore smiles.

				PRESIDENT
		Regardless of what the tabloids
		have said, there were never any
		space crafts recovered by the
		government.  Take my word for it,
		there is no Area 51 and no
		recovered space ship.

	Chief of Staff Nimziki suddenly clears his throat.

				NIMZIKI
		Uh, excuse me, Mr. President, but
		that's not entirely accurate.

	The President and General Grey turn to Nimziki, shocked.

	SMASHED AND BURNED OUT CARS

	laying across the roadway.  Suddenly SMASH, Jasmine's
	maintenance truck BLASTS through.

	EXT. HIGHWAY - CITY LIMITS - SAME

	With the massive devastation in the b.g., Jasmine drives the
	maintenance truck down the highway.  In the back, the few
	survivors she's found.

	In the back, four INJURED PASSENGERS lay across the flatbed as
	a thin, older man, TEDDY tends to them.

	INT. MAINTENANCE TRUCK - SAME

	Jasmine spots a TALL MAN, his closes in tatters RUNNING down
	the highway, his arms in the air.

				TALL MAN
		The end has come!  He speaketh
		his word and the end hast come!

	Jasmine pulls up along side him.

				JASMINE
		Hop on.  We're heading out to El
		Toro.

				TALL MAN
		You cannot defy what has come, it
		is the end!

	The tall man moves off, screaming to the heavens.  As Jasmine
	watches him drift away she SEES...

	OVERTURNED MILITARY HELICOPTER

	Still smoldering from the crash.  A woman can be seen inside,
	still alive.  Jasmine jumps out.

				JASMINE
		Give me a hand.

	Teddy joins Jasmine as they pry open the door.  Inside, the
	pilots have been killed, but Mrs. Whitmore, THE FIRST LADY,
	lays there in great pain, blood across her blouse.

				JASMINE
		Let's get her out of here.

	They erase her from the wreckage, laying her on the
	ground.  Dylan comes over, standing next to his mother.

				TEDDY
		She's bleeding pretty bad.

	Suddenly we HEAR the CLICKING of a rifle COCKING.

				MALE VOICE (O.S.)
		Who's got the key?

	Jasmine turns and see a REDNECK leveling his rifle at her.
	Behind him a small damaged sports car pulls up, packed to the
	gills with stolen, looted appliances.

				REDNECK
			(yelling to pals)
		Looks like I've solved our
		transportation problem.

				JASMINE
		Hey, you're welcome to come with
		us.  We're leaving here anyway...

				REDNECK
		We're not.  Give me the key.
			(yelling back)
		Get 'em off.

	Two GUYS rush from their vehicle over to the maintenance
	truck, pulling the injured off the tailback.

				TALL MAN (O.S.)
		Repent!  Sinners!  Repent!  The
		end hast come!

	Running up from behind, the Tall Man comes over screaming.
	The Redneck turns his gun on him.

				REDNECK
		Back off.  This ain't your
		business.

	As the Redneck is distracted, Jasmine spots the bag of
	fireworks protruding out of Dylan's back pocket.

				TALL MAN
		You cannot go against the word,
		brother.

				REDNECK
		Sure I can.

	The Redneck SHOOTS the Tall Man.  His buddies laugh.

				REDNECK (cont'd)
		Now give me that key, bitch.

	As he turns back to Jasmine, Boomer starts BARKING wildly.
	Just as he turns to shoot the dog, Jasmine lights a key ROCKET
	from the fireworks bag.  The rocket BLASTS into the Redneck,
	his shirt IGNITING ON FIRE.

	The Redneck drops the rifle, attempting to put out the flames,
	his cronies rush to his aid.  Jasmine picks up the gun, moves
	in on them.

				JASMINE
		This "bitch" was born in  Alabama
		with a Daddy who loved to hunt.
			(cocking the weapon)
		So don't think for one second that
		I don't know how to use this.

	She FIRES the rifle.  Quickly the rednecks scamper away.

						CUT TO:

	EXT. DRY LAKE - DESERT - LATER

	Dragging a heavy bundle wrapped in his parachute, Steve
	marches across the desert floor.  The alien ARM/TENTACLE
	dangles out of the parachute.

	Exhausted, Steve stops to wipe his brow.  He hears something,
	turns around.

	STEVE'S POV - THE TRAILER ARMADA

	Several hundred of the trailers from the refugee camp are
	headed en mass towards him.  Smiling, Steve signals them.

	The trailers pull up on either side, surrounding him.  Miguel
	leans out of his trailer.

				MIGUEL
			(sarcastic)
		Need a lift?

				STEVE
		When I flew overhead, I saw some
		kind of base, not far.

	Confused, Miguel checks his map.

				MIGUEL
		It's not on the map.

				STEVE
		Trust me, it's there.

	EXT. AIR FORCE ONE - LATER

	Flying over the desert, Air Force One sails over an immense
	valley, Area 51 below - hangars, a few buildings, a small air
	strip, not much.

	Super: N.I.A. Base - "Area 51", Nevada

	EXT. RUNWAY - LATER

	Air Force One lands.  Wheels touch down, skid.

	INT. HANGAR - LATER

	The large hangar doors open and Air Force One is rolled
	inside.  The President and his entourage are met by a
	contingent of base personnel led by field operative, LT.
	MITCHELL.  He escorts them to a side hallway.

	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Lt. Mitchell walks over to an odd wall switch as the President
	and his entourage wait in the center of the hall.  With a loud
	hydraulic HUM, the entire hallway begins to SINK DOWN, an
	enormous ELEVATOR.

				PRESIDENT
		Why the hell wasn't I told about
		this place?

				NIMZIKI
		Two words, Mr. President.
		Plausible deniability.

	General Grey shoots Nimziki a pissed off look.  When the
	elevator stops, a door SLIDES open.

	INT. RESEARCH FACILITIES - CONTINUOUS

	Stepping out of the elevator, they walk into a large state of
	the art, sterile clean research facility.  It is amazingly
	well staffed and organized.

				PRESIDENT
		I don't understand.  Where did all
		this come from?  How did this get
		funded?

				MOISHE
		You didn't think they actually
		spent ten thousand dollars for a
		hammer and thirty thousand for a
		toilet seat, did you?

	The President shoots him a look.  They are greeted by a group
	of SCIENTISTS in whit coats led by, DR. OKUN.

				MITCHELL
		Mr. President, I'd like to
		introduce you to Dr. Okun.  He's
		been heading up our research here
		for the last fifteen years.

	Dr. Okun is an odd, hyper-energetic man who's spent too much
	time in isolation.

				OKUN
		Mr. President, a real pleasure.
		They don't let us out much, you
		you.

				PRESIDENT
			(uncomfortable)
		Yes.

				OKUN
		Well, I guess you'd like to see
		the big tamale?  Follow me.

	They walk up a ramp at the end of the room.  Large heavily
	enforced doors SLIDE open.

	INT. STORAGE LAB - CONTINUOUS

	The group steps inside and nearly gasps at...

	THE ALIEN ATTACKER

	Just like the one that chased Steve.  The entourage stares in
	horror and wonder.  We can SEE the patch-work repairs they've
	made on the ship over the years.

				OKUN
		She's a beaut, ain't she?

	Moishe leans close to David and Constance.

				MOISHE
			(smug)
		Never any space ships recovered by
		the government, huh?

				PRESIDENT
		We've had this for forty years and
		you don't know anything about
		them?

				OKUN
		Hell no, we know tons about them.
		The nearest stuff has only
		happened in the last few days.

	The President slowly walks around the ship as Okun talks.
	David, mouth agape, just stares at it.

				OKUN (cont'd)
		See, we can't duplicate their type
		of power so we've never been able
		to experiment.  But since these
		guys started showing up, all the
		gizmos inside turned on.  The last
		twenty four hours have been really
		exciting!

				PRESIDENT
			(exploding)
		People are dying out there.  I
		don't think "exciting" is the word
		I'd choose to describe it!

	The room goes silent, letting the President blow off steam.

				PRESIDENT
			(calming)
		What can you tell us about the
		enemy we're facing?

				OKUN
		Not all too dissimilar to us.
		Breathes oxygen, comparable
		tolerances to heat,
		cold...probably why they're
		interested in our planet.
			(suddenly excited)
		Hey, you wanna see them?

	INT. MEDICAL RESEARCH VAULT - MOMENTS LATER

	The lights slowly TURN ON, illuminated the vault.  Okun leads
	the group to a sealed partition.

				OKUN
		This is vault, or as some of us
		have come to call it, the "freak
		show."

	Okun hits a switch and the sealed partition lifts revealing...

	FORMALDEHYDE TANKS - ALIENS

	Three dead aliens float in the milky formaldehyde tanks.  The
	murky fluid and condensation obstructs our view.  What we do
	see is not pretty.

				OKUN
		When we found them they were
		wearing bio-mechanical suits.
		Once we got them off, we were able
		to learn a great deal about their
		anatomy; eyes, ears, bipolar
		digestive system... no vocal cords
		though.  We're assuming they
		communicate with each other
		through other means.

	David cannot contain his fascination.  He steps forward.

				DAVID
		What kind of other means?  Hand
		signals, body language?

				OKUN
		Some kind of extra sensory
		perception.  Telepathy.

				PRESIDENT
		Can they be killed?

				OKUN
		These three died in the crash.
		Their bodies are as frail as our
		own.  You just have to get past
		their technology, which is, I'm
		sorry to say, far more advanced.

	The President turns to David.

				PRESIDENT
		You unlocked a part of that
		technology.  You cracked their
		code.

				DAVID
		All I did was stumble onto their
		signal.  I don't know how helpful
		I can be...

				PRESIDENT
		Show them what you've discovered.
		Work together.  We've got to find
		a way to beat them.

	EXT. SECURITY GATE - SAME

	Four armed GUARDS watch the gate.  An armada of trucks and
	trailers heads right for them.  They move into position to
	block their entrance as a blue pick-up skids to a halt before
	them.  Steve stands up from the back of the pick up.

				GUARD
		Sorry, Lt. Colonel, I can't open
		the gates without clearance.

				STEVE
		You want to see my clearance?

	Impatiently Steve grabs the Guard by the collar, pulling him
	over the side of the truck putting him face to face with the
	bundled parachute in the flatbed.  Steve rips the fabric aside
	revealing...

	THE ALIEN CREATURE

	Still unconscious, the alien stirs.  The Guard JUMPS BACK,
	shitting in his pants.  Quickly he signals for the other to
	open the gate.

	The armada quickly drives past.

	BLACKNESS

	Total darkness.  Suddenly light pours in as a  door is open.
	We see the faces of Okun, David and three technicians all
	peering at us with inquisitive expressions.

				OKUN
		See the gizmos flashing?

	REVERSE - INSIDE ALIEN CRAFT

	Sure enough, tons of gizmos with lights flashing.  High tech
	meets organic organisms.  This alien ship looks familiar to
	our own technology and completely different at the same time.

				OKUN (cont'd)
		We've been working around the
		clock trying to get a fix on all
		this crap.  Some stuff we figured
		out right away.

	David climbs in, fascinated.  He touches everything.  Okun
	points to everything as he describes it.

				OKUN (cont'd)
		This thing we're pretty sure is
		the life support for the cabin,
		this do-hickey over here is
		connected with the engines, this
		crap...we have no idea what that
		stuff is for.

	David is transfixed by it.  He stares at the small screens
	with flashing light patterns on them.

				OKUN (cont'd)
		But this over here is clearly what
		they use to navigate and guide the
		craft.

	But David still stares at the small screens.

				DAVID
		Someone grab my laptop for me?

	One of the technicians rushes off as Okun leans close.

				OKUN
		Find something interesting?

				DAVID
		Maybe.

	The technician hands David his retrieved laptop which he
	quickly flips open and turns on.

				DAVID
		These patterns here, they're
		repeating sequentially, just
		like...

	David turns his laptop around for Okun to see.  The pattern on
	David's laptop flashes identically as the alien screen.

				DAVID (cont'd)
		...their countdown signal.  Their
		using this frequency for computer
		communications.  It's how they co-
		ordinate their ships.

				OKUN
		You know, you're really starting
		to make us look bad.

	The two men exchange a smile.  Another TECHY pops his head
	inside.

				TECHY
			(out of breath)
		They got one!  They got one,
		alive!

	INT. HALLWAY OFF MAIN HANGAR - AREA 51 - SAME

	The bundled alien lays on a stretcher that's wheeled quickly
	into the hall.  Okun and his staff surround it.  Trailing
	behind them is Steve, Russell and Miguel.

				OKUN
		How long has it been unconscious?

				RUSSELL
		Excuse me Doctor...

				STEVE
		Three hours.

				OKUN
		Get him into containment, stat.

				RUSSELL
		My boy is very sick, he needs
		immediate attention.

	Okun ignores Russell, hitting the elevator switch on the wall,
	the room begins its hydraulic HUM.

				OKUN
		He's dying out.  I want him
		sprayed down with saline.

	Russell SLAMS his fist against the switch, the room stops.  He
	GRABS a doctor nearby, gets in his face.

				RUSSELL
		My boys is slipping into a diabetic
		coma.  If you don't do something
		about it right now he will die.

	Miguel is surprised and proud of Russell as he holds DOCTOR
	ISAACS, meaning business.

				DR. ISAACS
		O'Haver, Miller, come with me.
			(to Russell)
		Take us to him.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. ROAD - MAINTENANCE TRUCK - NIGHT

	Headlights pierce the darkness as the maintenance truck rolls
	to a stop.  Jasmine climbs down out of the truck, her face
	ashen.

	She walks past a sign reading: El Toro Marine Corps Air
	Station.  Tears begin to roll from her eyes.  We follow her
	gaze to see...

	EXT. EL TORO MARINE CORPS AIR STATION - CONTINUOUS

	The entire facility is smoldering, the last remnants of the
	fire burning itself to extinction.  Jasmine is devastated.

							CUT TO:

	INT. AREA 51 COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT

	General Grey and Nimziki are in a heated argument.

				GENERAL GREY
		You were the head of the National
		Intelligence Agency!  You knew all
		about this.  When were you
		planning on informing the rest of
		us!?

				NIMZIKI
		It had been deemed classified.

				GENERAL GREY
		Christ, why didn't you say
		anything about this when they
		first arrived?  You could have
		warned us before we launched a
		counter attack that cost us
		hundreds of American pilots!

	Just then the President enters along with Constance and some
	other ADVISORS.  He examines a paper map of the United States,
	tacked to the wall, each major city circled in black.

				PRESIDENT
		Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia,
		destroyed?

				GENERAL GREY
			(composing himself)
		And there are scattered reports of
		sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth,
		And Memphis.

	The President and his team take seats at the large conference
	table.

				GENERAL GREY (cont'd)
		We've learned that NATO and
		western allied installations were
		the firs to be taken out.  We
		were next.  They knew exactly where
		and how to hit us.

	Grey sneaks an accusatory glare at Nimziki.

				PRESIDENT
		And our forces?

				GENERAL GREY
		We're down to approximately
		fifteen percent, Sir.
			(beat)
		If you calculate the time it takes
		them to destroy a city and move
		on, we're looking at world wide
		destruction of every major city
		within the next thirty six hours.

				PRESIDENT
		We're being exterminated.

	The room is quiet.  Constance runs her fingers through her
	hair.  The door to the room opens and Lt. Mitchell enters with 
	Steve.

				MITCHELL
		Mr. President, this is Lt.
		Colonel Steven Hill.

	The President quickly gets to his feet, anxiously shaking
	Steve's hand.

				PRESIDENT
		Lieutenant, congratulations.

				STEVE
		Thank you, sir.

				PRESIDENT
		Where is the prisoner now?

				MITCHELL
		We have him in isolation.  The
		doctors are very hopeful he will
		survive.

				PRESIDENT
		I'd like to see him.

				MITCHELL
		Yes, sir.

	The General is concerned but the President is determined.
	They head for the door.

				STEVE
			(to General Grey)
		General, I'm anxious to get back
		to El Toro.

				GENERAL GREY
		Didn't anyone tell you?  I'm
		sorry.  El Toro was destroyed in
		the attack.

	Steve is shattered, he had no idea.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. EL TORO BASE - NIGHT

	The injured are gathered around a small camp fire.  Jasmine
	walks up, dumping a box full of charred can goods.

				JASMINE
		These should last us a while.

	As Margaret tries to move, she winces in pain.  Jasmine rushes
	to her aid.  The color from her face drained, Margaret looks
	like she's taking a turn for the worse.

				JASMINE
		Don't move.  Stay still.

	Jasmine adjusts the bandages as Margaret turns and see Dylan
	curled up next to Boomer, too adorable.  Slowly he starts to
	wake up.

				MARGARET
		Your son.

				JASMINE 
		He's my angel.

				MARGARET
		Was his father stationed here?

				JASMINE
		He wasn't his father.  I was kinda
		hoping he'd want the job, though.

	Jasmine becomes sad, remembering.  Margaret changes the
	subject.

				MARGARET
		So, what do yo do for a living?

				JASMINE
		I'm a dancer.

				MARGARET
		Really?  Ballet?

				JASMINE
			(laughs)
		No.  Exotic.

				MARGARET
		Oh.  Sorry.

				JASMINE
		Don't be.  I'm not.  It's good
		money.
			(re: Dylan)
		'Side, he's worth it.

	The bandages changed, Jasmine sits down next to Margaret.

				MARGARET
		And when the dancing's over?  What
		about your future?

				JASMINE
		Funny, it used to scare me when I
		thought about the future.
			(looking around)
		Guess it doesn't really matter
		anymore.

	Dylan comes walking over.

				JASMINE
		Dylan, come here.  I want you to
		meet the First Lady.

				MARGARET
			(surprised)
		I thought you didn't recognize me.

				JASMINE
		Didn't want to say anything.  I
		voted for the other guy.

							CUT TO:

	INT. CONTAINMENT LAB - NIGHT

	Okun and two Medical assistants examine the alien creature.
	His arms and chest have been strapped down to the examining
	table.

	For the first time we get a good look at the head of this
	creature, long tentacled-type cords interlocked, covering the
	face.  The doctors attach clamps to each of the cords.

				OKUN
		Everyone ready?

	The doctors exchange nervous glances, nod to each other.  At
	the same moment all they pull on the clamps, unraveling the
	interlocked cords.  As the cords unravel, we SEE that this is
	in fact a bio-mechanical SUIT as we REVEAL...

	THE ALIEN

	Beneath the cords lay the unconscious face of the alien, his
	skin translucent, his body fluids, capillaries, muscle tissue,
	alien's skin.

				OKUN
		Do we have life support monitors
		recording?

				MED ASSIST #2
		Yes.  If we fuck up it'll all be
		on tape.

				OKUN
		Can we get some ventilation in
		here?  I can't take this smell.

				MED ASSIST #2
		They've conquered space travel but
		not b.o.

	As Okun begins to put on a pair of surgical gloves he suddenly
	grabs his forehead.

				MED ASSIST #1
		You all right?

				OKUN
		Yeah.  It's just that stink gives
		me a headache.

				MED ASSIST #2
		He's moving!

	Instantly everyone's attention is riveted to the arm of the
	alien as it moves beneath the sheet.  Unseen by the others the
	alien creature's EYES OPEN.

	Another SHARP PAIN hits Okun who SCREAMS, stumbling backwards
	grabbing his head.  The others turn in surprise.

	THE ALIEN

	Suddenly SPRINGS up, the restraining straps SNAPPING.  Before
	Med #2 can react, one of the alien's tentacles SMASHES her
	across the face.  She is sent sprawling backwards.

	LOW ANGLE - THE ALIEN

	Standing before her.  In a wink of an eye, he ATTACKS, leaping
	on her.

	Together they TUMBLE back into a formaldehyde tank.  Hoses
	are ripped from their sides and STEAM pours out.  We get quick
	glimpse of their struggle as the steam engulfs them.

	INT. HALLWAY - SAME

	Mitchell leads the Presidential party down the hall.  They
	turn and enter the Medical lab.

	INT. CONTAINMENT LAB - CONTINUOUS

	The group slows as they enter the room.  They see the
	containment room through the glass is covered with white
	steam.  Nothing can be seen.  It's eerily quiet.

	Cautiously they approach.  Suddenly Okun is SLAMMED AGAINST
	the glass partition, the creature's tentacles wrapped around
	him.  Pressed firmly to the glass, his eyes are shut, his
	expression pained, but when he speaks the voice is angry.

				OKUN/ALIEN
		Release...me.

				MITCHELL
		Open the door.  Get him out of
		there.

	Suspicious, General Grey stops him.

				GENERAL GREY
		Wait.
			(to Okun)
		Can you hear me?

				OKUN/ALIEN
		Will kill...release me.  Now!

	They follow the tentacles with their eyes, up to the ceiling
	of the containment tank.  Suddenly the alien LEAPS DOWN,
	startling them, landing before them behind the glass.

	We see he's holding Okun against the glass, speaking THROUGH
	HIM.  This is the first real good look we get at the this bizarre
	creature.  Everyone in the room is repulsed and compelled by
	it at the same time.

	EXT. AREA 51 - NIGHT

	Through the hundreds of campers and trailers parked outside,
	Steve runs past until he reaches the open tarmac.

	A transport helicopter sits on the edge of the landing area.
	Steve runs up to it and climbs inside.

		What the hell are you doing?  Get
		out of there!

				STEVE
		I'm just going to borrow it.

	The Soldier pulls out his pistol, taking aim.

				SOLIDER
		No you're not, sir.

				STEVE
		You really want to shoot me?

	Steve stares the Soldier down.  Reluctantly he lowers his gun.

				SOLDIER
		Shit.  I'm gonna catch the hell for
		this.

	Steve smiles and gives him a quick salute then TAKES OFF.
	Quickly the bird RISES UP and darts off into the night.

	INT. MEDICAL LAB - SAME

	The President has moved closer to the glass and is talking
	with the alien.  The alien uses Okun like a ventriloquist's
	dummy.

				PRESIDENT
		Why did you people come here?

				OKUN/ALIEN
		Air...water...your "sun."

				PRESIDENT
		Where do your people come from?
			(no answer)
		Where is your home?

				OKUN/ALIEN
		Here...now.

				PRESIDENT
		And before here?

				OKUN/ALIEN
		Many worlds...

				PRESIDENT
		Can we negotiate a truce?  is
		there room for co-existance?
			(no answer)
		Can there be peace between us?

				OKUN/ALIEN
		Peace?  No peace.

				PRESIDENT
		What do you want us to do?

				OKUN/ALIEN
		Die.

	The Alien moves closer to the glass staring at the President.
	Suddenly the President clutches his head in pain.

				NIMZIKI
		Mr. President?

				OKUN/ALIEN
		We kill you...all.

	The pain becomes more severe and the President SCREAM OUT.
	There is general panic as people rush to the President's side.

				GENERAL GREY
			(to Mitchell)
		Is that glass bullet proof?

				MITCHELL
		No sir.

	The General draws his pistol.  Mitchell and the other military
	officers follow his lead.  Simultaneously they all begin to
	FIRE!

	The glass SHATTERS into a billion pieces.  The Alien is cut to
	ribbons, falling backwards.

	The President collapses.  So does Okun.  A STAFFER rushes over
	to Okun, checks his pulse.

				STAFFER
		He's dead.

	General Grey moves to the President who slowly recovers.

				GENERAL GREY
		Mr. President, are you okay?

	Woozily the President sits up, a strange look in his eye.

				PRESIDENT
		He wanted me to understand.  He
		communicated with me.
			(turning to Grey)
		They're like locusts.  They travel
		from planet to planet, their whole
		civilization.  After they've
		consumed every natural resource
		they move on.  And we're next.

	The President stands with a new resolve.  He stares at the
	dead alien on the floor.

				PRESIDENT
			(cold)
		Prepare a nuclear strike.

	INT. STORAGE LAB - MINUTES LATER

	The research staff are working near the recovered alien
	attacker.  Constance comes rushing in.  She looks around for
	David.  Through the glass of one of the offices she sees him.

	INT. OFFICES - CONTINUOUS

	Holding a bottle of Jack Daniels, David fishes through a small
	refrigerator as Constance enters.

				DAVID
		Just my luck, no ice.

				CONSTANCE
		I take it you've heard.

				DAVID
		A toast to the end of the world.

	David toasts her with the bottle, takes a swig.

				CONSTANCE
		He didn't come to this decision
		lightly.

	David nods, he doesn't want to argue.  He smiles cynically.

				DAVID
		You still believe in him.

				CONSTANCE
		He's a good man.

				DAVID
		Better be.  You left me for him.

				CONSTANCE
		I wanted a career.  Didn't you
		ever want to be part of something
		special?

	David stares daggers at her.

				DAVID
		I was part of something special.

	Constance realizes he means their marriage.  She's hurt him
	and can see it.  She turns and leaves.

	Bright lights in the sky growing nearer.  Slowly the others

	Margaret lays in bed, doctors and nurses surrounding her.
	Patricia rushes over.

		She's bleeding internally.
		There's nothing else we can do.

	Stunned, the President watches as Patricia hugs her mother.

				MARGARET
		Hiya Munchkin.

				PATRICIA
		Mommy, we were worried.  We didn't

				MARGARET
		I'm right here, baby.

	Recovering, the President nods for the doctors to leave the

	his wife and daughter.

				PRESIDENT
		Honey, why don't you wait outside
		so Mommy can get some rest.

	Patricia kisses her mother, says goodbye and leaves.  Out of

	hand for support.  She squeezes tightly.

				MARGARET
			(through tears)
		I'm scared, Tom.

				PRESIDENT
		It's okay.  The doctors said

				DAVID
		I'm making a mess.

				MOISHE
		This I can see.

				DAVID
		We've gotta burn the rain forest,

				MOISHE
		David, you're drunk.

	David slips, falls on his ass, hard.  Moishe helps him back up
	on his feet.

				MOISHE

		Go back inside before you catch a

	Slowly David looks up towards Moishe, an idea.

	INT. STORAGE LAB - DAY

	A large crowd has been gathered here at the lab.  General Grey
	and Nimziki walk up to Constance.

				NIMZIKI
		All right, Connie, we're here.
		What's this all about?

				CONSTANCE
		I really have no idea.  He just
		said to bring everyone down here.

	Steve shows Dylan the alien space craft.

				DYLAN
		Does that thing fly in outer
		space?

	Steve loos up at the craft admiringly.

				STEVE
		It certainly does.

	When the President enters a technician rushes over and knocks
	on the hatch door on the alien attacker.  The door swings open
	and David climbs down.

	Grabbing a coke can from the "recycle" trash bin, David places
	the empty can on top of the alien attacker.  David turns and
	faces the gathering.

				DAVID
		Could anyone please step back
		away from the craft?

	They do and David nods to a Technician inside the craft.  The
	Technician disappears inside, closing the door behind him.  A
	loud HUM emits from the craft.  David has to yell over it.

				DAVID
		Lt. Mitchell, would you mind
		drawing your pistol?

				MITCHELL
		What?

				DAVID
		From where you're standing, do you
		think you could shoot that can off
		the alien craft?

	Mitchell shrugs affirmatively.  David gestures for him to try.
	Taking aim, Mitchell SHOOTS.

	The bullet RICOCHETS off the attacker's protective shield.
	Several people in the crowd dock, afraid of being hit by the
	errant bullet.

				DAVID
		Sorry 'bout that.  You see, it's
		protected by the craft's shields.
		We can't penetrate their defenses.

				NIMZIKI
		We know that already.  What's your
		point?

	David walks over to his laptop, now connected directly to the
	craft by cables and starts typing furiously.

				DAVID
		My point is if we can't beat their
		defenses, then we must get around
		them.

	David stops typing and stares at his wrist watch, silently
	counting down.

				DAVID
		Lt. Mitchell, would you please try
		to shoot it again?

	Reluctantly Mitchell obliges.  This time the can is BLOWN OFF
	THE CRAFT.  Everyone in the room is shocked.  The Technician
	re-opens the craft's door and the loud HUM disappears.

				GENERAL GREY
		How did you do that?

				DAVID
		I gave it a cold.

	The President is fascinated, he steps closer.  Moishe beams
	proudly at his smart son.  Constance is amazed.

				DAVID (cont'd)
		More accurately, I gave it a
		virus.  A computer virus.

	David turns his laptop around for the President to see.

				GENERAL GREY
		Are you telling us you can send
		out a signal that will disable all
		their shields?

				DAVID
		Just as they used our satellites
		against us, we can use their own
		signal against them.

	David walks over to a diagram he's made showing the
	relationship between the Mother Ship, the Space Crafts and the
	smaller alien attackers.

				DAVID (cont'd)
		If we plant the virus directly
		into the mother ship, it would
		then filter down into all the
		corresponding ships below.

				NIMZIKI
		And just how do we infect the
		"Mother Ship" with a virus?

	David gestures to the alien attacker behind him.

				DAVID
		We'll have to fly their craft out
		of our atmosphere and dock with
		the mother ship.

	Intrigued Steve turns and looks back at the alien attacker,
	sizing it up.  David points to a satellite photo of the
	underbelly of the Mother Ship.

				DAVID (cont'd)
		We can enter here, upload the
		virus and set off an explosion
		that could disable it.  This would
		disorient the smaller ship below
		and buy you some time to take them
		out.

	Constance reacts, realizing David's participation in the plan.

				NIMZIKI
		This is ridiculous.

				GENERAL GREY
		How long would their shields be
		down?

				DAVID
		Once they discover the virus it
		could be a matter of minutes.

				NIMZIKI
		You want us to co-ordinate a
		massive world wide counter strike
		with a window of only a few
		minutes?

				GENERAL GREY
		With their shields down it might
		be possible.

				NIMZIKI
		Please, you're not buying into any
		of this nonsense, are you?  We
		don't have the manpower or the
		resources to launch that kind of a
		campaign.
			(gesturing to the alien
			 ship)
		Not to mention that this whole
		cockamamie plan is dependent on a
		machine that no one in the world
		is qualified to operate.

				STEVE (O.S.)
		I wouldn't say that, sir.

	Everyone turns to Steve who steps through the crowd.

				STEVE
		I've seen them in action.  I've
		watched their maneuvers.  With
		your permission, sir, I'd like the
		opportunity to try.

				NIMZIKI
		That thing's a wreck.  It crash
		landed back in the fifties!  We
		don't even know if it's capable of
		flying.

	David turns to the Technicians.

				DAVID
		Remove the clamps!

	Technicians move to the large holding clamps on either side of
	the craft.  With a loud CLANK, the clamps are pulled away.

	For a moment the hulking craft TEETERS unevenly, but quickly
	stabilizes, FLOATING ABOVE THEM.

				DAVID
		Any other questions?

	Everyone stares at the floating ship with wonder.

				PRESIDENT
		Let's do it.

	INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

	Constance, General Grey and the President are walking down the

				NIMZIKI
		I understand that you're upset

		that's no excuse for making
		another fatal mistake...

	The President whirls, grabs Nimziki and SLAMS him against the 
	wall.  Holding him tight, the President gets in his face.

				PRESIDENT
		The only mistake I made was
		appointing a sniveling little
		weasel like you Chief of Staff.

	Constance is about to intervene when General Grey stops her.

				PRESIDENT (cont'd)
		But this is a mistake, I am
		thankful to say, I do not have to

	The President releases him and turns to General Grey.

				PRESIDENT (cont'd)
		Organize every plane you can find

				JASMINE
		How do I look?

	She looks great.  But Dylan only gives her the "so-so" hand
	gesture.

				JASMINE
		You're a lot of help.

	The door behind her flies open and Steve marches in.

				JASMINE
		You're late.

				STEVE
		You know me...

				JASMINE
		I know, you like to make a big
		entrance.

	Steve moves next to Jasmine, takes her hand.

				STEVE
		Before we do this, I want you to
		know I'm sorry.

				JASMINE
		Sorry for what?

				STEVE
			(serious)
		I should have done this a long
		long time ago.

				MALE VOICE (O.S.)
		Do you have the ring?

	As we REVERSE ANGLE we see that we are in a military CHAPEL, a
	large crucifix on the wall.  A CHAPLAIN stands by the altar.

				STEVE
		You bet.

	Steve pulls out the famous "dolphin" ring.

				CHAPLAIN
		Witnesses?

	Just then the doors open and David and Constance enter taking
	seats on opposing sides of the aisle.

				CHAPLAIN
		Then let's get this show on the
		road.

	Steve and Jasmine take their places at the altar.  Jasmine is
	radiant.  Dylan rushes up and joins them.

	As the ceremony begins, David and Constance share a pregnant
	glance.  Slowly they reach across the aisle and hold hands as
	Steve and Jasmine exchange their vows.

							CUT TO:

	HANGAR DOORS - PRE-DAWN

	Slowly spread apart revealing the myriad of different planes
	that have been gathered.  Pilots, flights crews and refugees
	prepare for the battle.

	EXT. AREA 51 - TARMAC - PRE-DAWN

	Walking out the President scans the motley collection of
	planes; old, new, high-tech, low-tech.

				GENERAL GREY
		Beggars can't be choosers, sir.

	Nodding in agreement, the President walks among the rank and
	file.  Slowly they turn their attention to the President.

				PRESIDENT
		Good morning.  In less than one
		hour planes from here and all
		around the world will launch the
		largest aerial battle in the
		history of mankind...
			(beat)
		Mankind.  The word has new meaning
		for all of us now.  We are
		reminded not of our petty
		differences but of our common
		interests.

	Constance, David and Moishe join the group, listening.  Even
	David is moved.

				PRESIDENT (cont'd)
		Perhaps it's fate that today, July
		the Fourth, we will once again
		fight for our freedom.  Not from
		tyranny, persecution or
		oppression.  But from
		annihilation.  We're fighting for
		our right to live, to exit.  From
		this day on, the fourth day of
		July will no longer be remembered
		as an American holiday but as the
		day that all of mankind declared
		we will not go quietly into the
		night.  We will not vanish without
		a fight.  We will live on.  We
		will survive.

	The crowd erupts into applause and cheers.  The President
	turns and walks over to an Officer holding a bundle of
	clothes.  General Grey confronts the President as he begins to
	disrobe.

				GENERAL GREY
		Mr. President, just what do you
		think you're doing?

				PRESIDENT
		I'm a pilot, Will.  This is where
		I belong.

	General Grey wants to argue but can't.

	INT. STORAGE LAB - SAME

	Constance and David embrace as Steve turns to Dylan.

				STEVE
		When I'm back we'll light those
		fireworks.

	Jasmine hugs them both as Moishe walks over to David.

				MOISHE
		David, take these.

	David looks down at the "barf bags" in Moishe's hand.

				DAVID
		Thanks, Pops.

				MOISHE
		I want you should know, I'm very
		proud of you, son.

	That means more to David than Moishe could have known.

				CONSTANCE
		Be careful.

	Constance hugs David as Steve suddenly freaks out.

				STEVE
		Damn it.  We can't go yet.  I
		gotta find some cigars.

	Steve is about to bolt when Moishe grabs him, retrieving two
	cigars from his coat pocket.

				MOISHE
		My last two.  With my blessings.

				STEVE
		You're a lifesaver.

	Steve grabs them and climbs inside.  David smiles awkwardly,
	then follows Steve.

	INT. ALIEN ATTACKER - CONTINUOUS

	The hatch shuts and David takes a seat next to Steve who hands
	him one of the cigars.

				STEVE
		Hang on to this.  For our victory
		dance.  But not 'til we hear the
		fat lady sing.

	Reluctantly David takes it.  As he does Steve notices the
	"barf bag" on David's lap.  Off Steve's look...

				DAVID
		I have a confession to make.  I'm
		not real big on flying.

				STEVE
		Great.

	INT. STORAGE LAB - SAME

	Constance and Jasmine join the others behind the observation
	glass outside the room as the Attacker prepares for lift off.

	Part of the ceiling suddenly PEELS AWAY, revealing an enormous
	SHAFT leading topside.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ALIEN ATTACKER - SAME

	Strapping in and securing their equipment, Steve grabs hold of
	the throttle.

				STEVE
		You ready?  Let' rock and roll.

	Steve pulls back on the throttle but the attacker swings
	BACKWARDS.

	INT. STORAGE LAB - SAME

	The Alien Attacker SMASHES BACKWARD into the rear of the lab.
	Moishe winces as the others react fearfully.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ALIEN ATTACKER - SAME

	Embarrassed, Steve adjusts the throttle.

				STEVE
		Oops.

	Like a stick shift diagram of a car, a small hand written
	"post it" card is pasted onto the dash.  Steve reaches over
	and turns it upside down, righting the problem.

				STEVE
		Let's try that again.

	This time he pushes the throttle forward and the Attacker
	JERKS ahead.

	INT. STORAGE LAB - CONTINUOUS

	Shooting up into the ceiling shaft above, the Attacker ZOOMS
	out of the underground laboratory.

	EXT. AREA 51 - SHAFT - SAME

	With a WHOOSH the Alien Attacker ZOOMS out of the underground
	shaft and SOARS into the sky.  Once high enough it goes into a
	wild barrel roll.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ALIEN ATTACKER - SAME

	Just as it comes out of the roll.

				DAVID
		What the hell are you doing?

				STEVE
		Just getting a feel for her.

	EXT. MORNING SKIES - CLOUD BANK - SAME

	The Attacker arcs upward and disappears into the clouds.

	EXT. AREA 51 - THE PRESIDENT'S PLANE - SAME

	The President watches the Attacker flying away.  His canopy
	locks down as he adjusts his helmet.

				PRESIDENT
		Grey, you read me?

				GENERAL GREY
			(filtered)
		Roger, Eagle One, our primary
		target has shifted course.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	General Grey is standing by the large map tracking the alien
	ships over the United States.

		Where's it headed?

				GENERAL GREY
		I think our secret is out.
		They're headed right for us.

	INT. PRESIDENT'S PLANE - SAME

				GENERAL GREY
			(filtered)
		ETA thirty six minutes.

	The President gets a determined look in his eye.  He FIRES UP
	his engine.  Following his lead, engines ignite, canopies lock
	down and planes taxi to position.

	EXT. UPPER ATMOSPHERE - ALIEN ATTACKER - SAME

	The captured alien attacker soars higher and higher.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

	Slowly getting sick, David holds onto his "barf bag."

				STEVE
		You still with me?

	David nods sheepishly.  Steve's eyes go wide with wonder as
	the ship climbs to the edge of our atmosphere.

				STEVE
			(to himself)
		I've waited a long time for this.

	The ship begins to SHAKE, rattling harshly as it climbs.
	Through the window we SEE the blue sky EVAPORATE.  Slowly a
	field of STARS take its place.

	This is the moment Steve had wished for all his life.  He's
	not disappointed.  David, however, is not so thrilled.

	EXT. SPACE - STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

	Heading further into space, ZOOMING overhead.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

	Through the windshield we see a huge OBJECT floating in
	the distance, the moon behind it.

				DAVID
		That's it.  Head straight for it.

	But Steve gets distracted, something wrong with the controls.

				STEVE
		Something's happening.  It's not
		responding.

	David looks over at his laptop, connected to the ship's on
	board computers.  Th signal is ADJUSTING.

				DAVID
			(thrilled)
		I was counting on that.  They're
		bringing us in.

	EXT. BLUE SKIES - MORNING

	The President's plane leads thirty fighters in attack
	formation.

				PRESIDENT
		We have visual.

	RESERVE ANGLE - ALIEN SPACE CRAFT

	The fifteen mile wide space craft peeks over a mountain range
	headed straight for us.

				GENERAL GREY
			(filtered)
		Do not engage until we've
		confirmed the package has been
		delivered.

				PRESIDENT
		Roger.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	Constance is standing by Lt. Mitchell behind the Military
	cadre coordinating the battle.

				CONSTANCE
		What if that thing gets here
		before we can plant the virus?

				MITCHELL
		The entire compound is buried deep
		within the mountain.  It should
		give us some protection.

				CONSTANCE
		But what about all the people
		outside?

	Mitchell shoots her a worried look.  Quickly they both dash
	outside.

	EXT. MOTHER SHIP - SAME

	Steve and David's attacker flies towards the gigantic Mother
	Ship.  Hundreds of other attackers flow in and out of the
	Mother Ship through the many triangular portals.  Steve and
	David's attacker's drawn into one of them.

	INT. PORTAL SHAFT - MOTHER SHIP - SAME

	Caught in a stream of attackers, they flow through the portal
	shaft leading into this planet sized space craft.  They pass
	by enormous windows revealing the HUNDREDS OF ALIENS working
	within the Mother Ship.

	We spill out of the shaft and into a gigantic cavity
	stretching out beyond visibility.  Enormous TOWERS are
	scattered throughout.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - CONTINUOUS

	Neither can believe their eyes.  Staring out the front window
	they SEES...

	STEVE AND DAVID'S POV ALIEN TROOP PARADE GROUND

	Below them THOUSANDS OF ALIENS can be seen as they are marched
	into dozens of enormous TROOP CONTAINERS docked at the edges
	of the parade grounds.

				DAVID
		Must be thousands of them.  What
		are they doing?

				STEVE
		Looks like they're preparing the
		invasion.

	INT. DOCKING STATIONS - MOTHER SHIP - CONTINUOUS

	They pass the parade ground and head into the middle of this
	huge cavernous sphere, closing in on the many LANDINGS.
	Hundreds of attackers are docked at each one.

	In the center of the Landing are large BAY WINDOWS, inside is
	a kind of control tower.  We can SEE several ALIEN WORKERS
	through the glass.  Steve and David's attacker is heading
	straight towards them.

				STEVE
		This won't work.  They'll see
		before we can do anything.

	Lifting up another hand written card labeled "window," David
	pushes the button underneath.

				DAVID
		These things are fully equipped.
		Reclining bucket seats, power
		windows...

	A BLAST SHIELD lowers covering the window.

	Slowly Steve and David's attacker lowers onto large docking
	CLAMPS which LOCK ON, holding it in place.

				DAVID
		We're in!

	David starts typing frantically.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	Mitchell turns from one of the consoles to General Grey.

	EXT. AREA 51 - BRENNON TRAILER - SAME

	Alicia struggles to drag out a large duffle bag.  Philip (the
	boy who brought the penicillin earlier) rushes over.

				PHILIP
		Let me get that.

	He grabs the bag for her.  Alicia smiles.  Miguel helps Troy
	down from the trailer.  As they rush away, Miguel turns to
	Philip.

				MIGUEL
		Where's Russell?

	ANGLE - HANGAR - ENTRANCE TO COMPOUND

	Constance, Jasmine and Mitchell are helping to usher the
	refugees into the compound.

				CONSTANCE
		Hurry, we've got to get everyone
		inside.

	Constance looks up and SEES off in the distance...

	THE ALIEN SPACE CRAFT

	Piercing the horizon, coming over the top of a distant
	mountain.  Headed this way.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

	David finishes typing.  The screen on his laptop flashes:
	UPLOAD COMPLETE.

		The virus is in.  All we can do
		now is pray.

				GENERAL GREY
			(filtered)
		Delivery complete.  Engage.

				PRESIDENT
		Roger.

	The fighter jets GUN IT and overtake the smaller planes in
	front of them.

	Below the President's plane the weapons bay door opens and a
	long range AMRAAM Missile DROPS DOWN, computes its target and
	DARTS OFF.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	Mitchell and General Grey move over to a monitor showing
	visual from the Present's Plane.  They SEE the missile
	moving towards target.

				GENERAL GREY
		Keep your fingers crossed.

	EXT. AMERICAN FIGHTERS - SAME

	The pilots watch nervously as the missile nears its target.

				PRESIDENT
		Come on, baby.

	ANGLE - AMRAAM MISSILE

	Just as it gets to the shield perimeter, the missile EXPLODES.
	The shields are still up.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	They watch the missile blow up harmlessly.  Deflated, General
	Grey grabs his mic.

				GENERAL GREY
		It didn't work.  Disengage.  Sir,
		get your people out of there.

	EXT. PRESIDENT'S PLANE - SAME

	The President is not ready to give up.

				PRESIDENT
		Not yet!

	Below his plane another MISSILE drops down, and DARTS OFF.

	ANGLE - MISSILE

	This one goes past the point of the previous explosion.  It
	moves in closer and closer.  Suddenly it HITS THE SIDE OF THE
	SHIP.  A HUGE EXPLOSION, rips off a part of the side of this
	immense ship.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	We SEE the explosion on the monitor.  Everyone in the room
	CHEERS.

				GENERAL GREY
		You did it!  A direct hit!

	EXT. BLUE SKIES - AMERICAN FIGHTERS - SAME

	The pilots are thrilled.

				PRESIDENT
		We're going in!  Squadron leaders,
		take point.

	The fighters break off into six group of five.  One by one,
	each fighter DROPS A MISSILE.  We follow DOZENS OF MISSILES on
	their way to the space craft.

	ANGLE - SPACE CRAFT

	The Attacker Bay doors open and DOZENS OF ALIEN ATTACKERS
	shoot out.  Spreading wide.

	Guided missiles EXPLODES as they hit the City Destroyer,
	damaging the outer hull.  The Attackers go after the American
	fighters.  The six groups split wide.  An aerial dog fight
	ensues.

	EXT. AREA 51 - REFUGEE CAMP - SAME

	Miguel searches for Russell as the refugees run for the
	hangar.

				MIGUEL
		Russell!

	Miguel gets swept up in the tide.  As the last of them enter
	the hangar, TWO ALIEN ATTACKERS arrive behind them, STRAFING
	the ground.  The rows of trailers homes EXPLODE one after
	another.

	ANGLE - ELEVATOR HALLWAY - BACK OF HANGAR

	Constance ushers the crowd into the elevator hallway.  Packed
	into the hallway together, they are panicked at the sound of
	the nearby explosions.  As the last one is safely inside,
	Constance turns back and SEES...

	CONSTANCE'S POV - HANGAR AND ATTACKERS

	The attackers FIRE and the front half of the hangar EXPLODES.
	Constance is KNOCKED back against the wall.  She activates the
	elevator and the room begins to SINK.

	As the hallway submerges, the entire hangar comes CRASHING
	DOWN behind them.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	Over monitors the General observes the aerial battle.  This
	room, too, ROCKS from the explosions.  The monitors FLICKER.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

	Steve struggles with the controls but is getting no where.

				DAVID
		Get us out of here!

				STEVE
		I can't shake her free.

	Though the attacker guns its engine, the CLAMPS below HOLD
	TIGHT.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

	David moves over to the computer to see if he can help.
	Suddenly the large window slowly begins to DROP DOWN.

				STEVE
		What're you doing?

				DAVID
		It's not me.  They're overriding
		the system.

	The blast shield continues to peel away.  David and Steve drop
	down below the dash, hiding from view.  As the view becomes
	unobstructed we SEE...

	POV - THROUGH WINDOW - THE LANDING

	Several Alien's looking across at us from the large bay
	window of the Landing's control tower.

				STEVE
		Damn!

	David leans from his hiding position and SEES several other
	alien attackers are moving in on them.  They are surrounded.

				DAVID
		Check and mate.

	INT. AREA 51 - RESEARCH FACILITY - SAME

	Like images from England during the blitzkrieg, the refugees
	are huddled on the floor, the lights FLICKERING and the muted
	sounds of distant EXPLOSIONS.  Miguel moves through the
	refugees, searching for Russell.

	A Yarmulke is unfolded.  As it is lifted we realize Moishe is
	putting it on.  He holds the hands with the people around him
	and begins to pray.  Nimziki moves next to Moishe.  Moishe
	takes his hand.

				NIMZIKI
		I'm not Jewish.

				MOISHE
		It's okay.

	ANGLE - PHILIP AND ALICIA

	As another bomb rocks the room, Alicia moves closer to Philip.

				ALICIA
		This could be our last night on
		Earth.  I don't want to die a
		virgin.

				PHILIP
		If we do, we'll both die virgins.
		But at last we'll be together.

	Alicia smiles, a nice guy at last.

	EXT. AREA 51 - SPACE SHIP - SAME

	The City Destroyer space ship is settling just above the
	compound as the American fighters circle it, chased by the
	attackers.  Below the SCHISM begins to open!

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	In all the commotion, no one notices as Miguel sneaks inside.

				OFFICER
		We're running out of missiles,
		Sir.  We're just not causing
		enough damage.

	EXT. PRESIDENT'S PLANE - SAME

				GENERAL GREY
			(filtered)
		They're getting ready to fire the
		big gun.  You're going to have to
		find a vulnerable spot, fast.

				PRESIDENT
		I've got an idea.  Keep 'em off my
		tail.

	Taking the advice, the President DIVES.  He's met by two
	flanking Fighters (EAGLES 9 & 2) as they cruise the underbelly
	of the City Destroyer.  Sure enough, the SCHISM is opening,
	preparing to fire the WALL OF DESTRUCTION.

				PRESIDENT
		Let's take 'em out before they
		take us out.

	The President locks the SCHISM hatchway into the center of his
	HUD (heads up display).  Just as he FIRES, Eagle 9 is BLOWN
	OUT OF THE SKY.  It rocks the President, sending his missile
	off target.

	Off balance, the missile hits just wide of the hatchway and
	EXPLODES, rocking the entire ship.

				PRESIDENT
		I'm out of missiles!  Eagle 2?

				EAGLE #2 PILOT
		I'm on it.

	But before he can target, his fighter EXPLODES.

	INT. HALLWAY - SAME

	The lights continue to flicker.  Jasmine grabs onto Dylan and
	Patricia, holding them tight.

	INT. WAR ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	On the monitor we SEE the SCHISM, and BRIGHT LIGHTS as several
	fighters fly past.

				GENERAL GREY
		We're out of time.  Get out of

		can.

	EXT. PRESIDENT'S FIGHTER - SAME

	Pissed, the President refuses to give up.

				PRESIDENT
		Doesn't anyone have any damned
		missiles left?!

				RUSSELL (O.S.)
		Sorry I'm late, Mr. President.

	The President spins and SEES darting out of the clouds...

	RUSSELL'S OLD BI-PLANE

	Russell ZOOMS past the President and alien attackers, barely
	missing their FIRE.

				PRESIDENT
			(filtered)
		Who is that?  What are you doing?

				RUSSELL
			(into mic)
		It's okay, Sir.  I'm packin'.

	We SEE he has a large MISSILES propped up in the seat behind
	him.  A light on it flashes ARMED.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

				RUSSELL
			(filtered)
		Just keep those guys off me for a

	Hearing his voice, Miguel is shocked.  He moves closer towards
	the monitors.

	EXT. CITY DESTROYER - SAME

	The remaining fighters lay down COVER FIRE for Russell's old
	bi-wing.  Russell heads directly TOWARDS THE SCHISM.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	Everyone is gripped to the screen as we see it get closer and
	closer to the closing bay doors.  Miguel is aghast.

				RUSSELL
			(filtered)
		Do me one favor...

				OFFICER
		Who is that guy?

				MIGUEL
		Russell!

	Miguel races over to the microphone, attempts to grab it.

				RUSSELL
			(filtered)
		...tell my children I love them
		very much.

	EXT. CITY DESTROYER - SCHISM - SAME

	Russell nears the SCHISM, a hail of alien firepower erupting
	around him.

				MIGUEL
			(filtered)
		Dad!  No!

	Russell smiles at b being called "Dad."

				RUSSELL
		I've got to, kid.  You were always
		better at taking care of them than
		I was anyways.

	Russell turns off his radio as he banks UPWARD towards the
	open SCHISM.  The climb is steep, and the bi-wing nearly
	stalls out.

	Suddenly the bright lights VANISH and the beam begins to form.

	Russell's bi-wing just makes it INSIDE THE OPEN SCHISM and
	disappears from view.

	The President and remaining fighters BANK AWAY, clearing.

	Suddenly, A GIGANTIC EXPLOSION, RIPS THROUGH THE CENTER OF THE
	SPACE CRAFT.  It's causing a CHAIN REACTION of explosion.

	Teetering, the entire space ship, turns away out of control.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	The room erupts in CHEERS.  Everyone, that is, except Miguel.

	EXT. MOUNTAIN RANGE - SAME

	Not far away from Area 51, the enormous craft is burning from
	the center outwards.  Suddenly it DROPS and COLLIDES with the
	mountain range, EXPLODING ON IMPACT.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	Intercepting the celebration, General Grey moves over to a

				GENERAL GREY
		Let's get on the wire.  Tell every

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ALIEN ATTACKER - SAME

	Sitting below the dash, Steve takes out the cigars, hands one
	to David.

				STEVE
		I guess there's nothing left to
		do.  Let's nuke 'em.

	David realizes they're both about to die.  He stares at the
	cigar.

				DAVID
			(re: cigar)
		Funny, I always thought things
		like these would kill me.

	They share a quick sober laugh.

				STEVE
		Nice meeting you.

				DAVID
		You as well.

	Steve lights his cigar, then lights David's.

				STEVE
		Ready?

	EXT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ALIEN ATTACKER - SAME

	Popping up from behind the dash, cigars in their mouths, Steve
	and David start waving "good-bye" like idiots.

	The Aliens in the tower don't know how to react.  The
	attackers move in for the kill.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

				STEVE
		Think they know what's coming?

	He reaches down to the black box we saw before and enters the
	launch code.

				DAVID
			(still waving)
		Not a chance in hell.

	EXT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

	Suddenly the missile ERUPTS from behind the manifold and
	BLASTS into the control tower, SHATTERING THE GLASS WINDOW.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	The missile SMASHES through the glass.  The atmosphere
	impeached, the aliens quickly succumb to the elements, chocking
	and dying.

	The missile BLASTS by WRECKING equipment until it LODGES into
	the back wall of the Landing tower.

	A small counter on the missile begins to count down 30:00,
	29:00, 28:00...

	EXT. DOCKING CLAMPS - SAME

	Rocked from the explosions, the docking clamps RELEASES and the

	Steve grabs the controls.

				STEVE
		We're loose!

				DAVID
		Doesn't matter.  Game's over.

				STEVE
		I don't hear no fat lady.

	Steve THROTTLES IT.  The craft JOLTS AWAY.

	EXT. DOCKING STATION - SAME

	Steve and David's attacker BLAST away, the other alien
	attackers follow in hot pursuit.

	The attackers FIRE.  Steve SWERVES avoiding the blasts as they
	race for the exit.

	INT. LANDING - CONTROL TOWER - SAME

	Grasping for breath, a dying Alien looks up at the wedged in
	nuclear missile.  The counter reads: 00:04, 00:03, 00:02.

	We get the feeling the Alien knows what's coming.

	INT. DOCKING BAY - SAME

	Steve and David's attacker just reaches the doorway as the
	center of the landing EXPLODES behind them.

	The enormous impact, rocks some of the lagging attackers off
	track.

	EXT. MOTHER SHIP - SAME

	Steve DARTS his attacker out from underneath the Mother Ship's
	belly.  A group of attackers FOLLOW.

	Just as the last of them exit the docking bay, a HUGE FIREBALL
	erupts behind them ripping through the Mother Ship.

	ANGLE - FARTHER AWAY

	ZOOMING towards us, Steve guides his ship away.  The Alien
	attackers in hot pursuit.  Behind them we SEE the ENTIRE
	MOTHER SHIP EXPLODE.

	The immense EXPLOSION GROWS OUTWARDS coming right at us.  The
	ATTACKERS are GOBBLED UP as the EXPLOSION WIDENS.  Quickly the
	explosion gains ground on Steve and David.

	ANGLE - STEVE AND DAVID'S SHIP

	Like a loose board caught in the surf, Steve and David's ship
	rides the edge of the explosion, getting knocked END OVER END.

		Age was never an issue when you

		the Eisenhower.

	The Commanding Officer grabs a phone laying off the hook.

				COMMANDING OFFICER
		Correction, we have two confirmed
		visual contacts.  One over Iraq,
		one over the Pacific.

	INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY

	The room is packed.  The President and his chief advisors are
	there along with the Joint Chief of Staff.  Representatives
	from the Atlantic Command and U.S. Space Command have formed
	small clusters around telephones.

				GENERAL GREY
		Where in the Pacific?
			(turning to the President)
		They've spotted one off the
		California coast line.

	Surrounded by the Secret Service, the President is speechless.
	Constance Halbrook comes rushing into the room and whispers to
	the President.

				PRESIDENT
		Put it on.

	Constance moves over to a cabinet and turns on the T.V. (the
	reception is still fuzzy, picture "rolling").  The CNN News
	broadcast shows the phenomenon over Novosibirsk, Russia.
	There is mass hysteria behind the reporter.

				NEWSCASTER
			(filtered)
		...sightings of this atmospheric
		phenomenon have been reported here
		in Novosibirsk, Russia and other
		parts of Siberia.  Moving too
		slowly to be a comet or meteor,
		astronomers are baffled as to its
		origin...

	Everyone is locked onto the television, mesmerized.

				NEWSCASTERS (cont'd)
			(filtered)
		...Widespread panic has gripped
		the countryside as thousands have
		taken to the streets and clogged
		the highways.  Hundreds have been
		injured...

	General Grey confers with the Atlantic command CINC.  He nods,
	turns to the President and whispers.

				GENERAL GREY
		Mr. President, we have an AWAC on
		the west coast.  E.T.A. with
		contact point, three minutes.

	INT. AWAC AIRPLANE - DAY

	Wall to wall computer, radar and intelligence gathering
	equipment.  Technicians frantically try to adjust as the
	system goes hay wire.

				RADAR TECH #1
			(reporting into radio)
		It's no use.  Side radar doesn't
		see a thing!

				RADAR TECH #2
			(reporting)
		That's correct.  We're IMC blind,
		sir.

	We TRACK across them over to the pilots and into the cockpit.
	Cloudy skies.  The PILOT squints out the window as he speaks.

				PILOT
		Negative.  We still have zero
		visibility.

	EXT. AWAC AIRPLANE - CLOUDY SKIES - DAY

	ZOOMING overhead as we SEE the AWAC sailing through a thick

	Super:  Pacific Coastline, California

	The AWAC disappears from view into the clouds.

	The President and his top advisors are gathered around a
	speaker phone listening to the pilot of the AWAC.

		Instrumentation is malfunctioning.
		We can't get any kind of reading

	INT. AWAC - SAME

	The Pilot squints as he tries to see through the clouds.

				PILOT
		Wait a minute, it may be clearing.

	Suddenly the clouds part before us and we're face to face with
	a WALL OF FLAMES.

	INT. AWAC - SAME

	The speaker phone cracks and distorts.

				PILOT
			(filtered)
		Jesus God!  The sky's on fire!

	EXT. AWAC AND PHENOMENON - SAME

	The AWAC attempts to climb sharply as we get our first real
	look at the atmospheric phenomenon.  Majestic and monstrous.
	The AWAC is not going to be able to make it.

	Quickly it is ENGULFED in the flames.

	INT. OVAL OFFICE - SAME

	The phone line goes dead.  General Grey spins to an AIDE.

				GENERAL GREY
		Get them back on line.

				AIDE #1
			(on other phone)
		Line's gone, sir.

	The ATLANTIC COMMAND CINC, turns from a different phone.

				AAC CINC
		Two more have been spotted over
		the Atlantic.  One is moving
		toward New York, the other is
		headed this direction.

				CHIEF OF STAFF
		How much time do we have?

				AAC CINC
		Less than ten minutes.

				NIMZIKI
			(turning to aid)
		Organize a military escort to
		Crystal Mountain.

				GENERAL GREY
			(to President)
		Sir, I strongly recommend we
		move you to a secured location
		immediately.

	... The President hesitates, he turns to Constance.

				PRESIDENT
		Can we expect the same kid of
		panic here as in Russia?

				CONSTANCE
		More than likely.

				NIMZIKI
		Mr. President, you can discuss
		this on the way.

	Torn, the President grapples with a decision.  Finally...

				PRESIDENT
                I'm not leaving.

				NIMZIKI
		We must maintain a working
		government in a time of crisis...

				PRESIDENT
		I want the Vice President,
		Secretary of Defense, the whole
		Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs taken
		to a secured location.
		I'm staying here.  I am not going
		to add to a public hysteria that
		could cost lives.

				NIMZIKI
		But, Mr. President...

				PRESIDENT
		So far these things have not
		become hostile.  For the moment
		let's assume they won't.
			(to Constance)
		Connie, let's issue statements
		advising people not to panic, to
		stay home and take cover.

	Constance issues commands to her staff as they quickly
	exit along with most people in the room.  General Grey goes
	over to the President.

				GENERAL GREY
		With your permission, Mr.
		President, I'd like to remain my
		your side.

				PRESIDENT
		I had a feeling you would.

				GENERAL GREY
		Sir, what happens if they do
		become hostile?

				PRESIDENT
		Then God help us.

	INT. DAVID'S CUBICLE - DAY

	On the T.V. behind David, news footage of the phenomenon in
	Russia plays silently.  Oblivious, David works his computers.

				FEMALE CO-WORKER
			(stopping in doorway)
		David, are you watching this?

	David waves her away, deep in concentration.  Suddenly a

	Engrossed in his printout, David walks past his co-workers who
	are glued to the distorted picture on the television, watching

	Marty stares at his television watching General Grey
	addressing the press.  David enters, staring at his reading.

				DAVID
		I've got a lock on the signal

				MARTY
			(distracted)
		Huh?  Oh, good, hood.

				DAVID
		Strange thing is, if my

		gone in approximately seven hours
		anyway.  The signal reduces itself
		every time it recycles.
		Eventually it will disappear.  Are
		you listening?

				MARTY
			(still glued to T.V.)
		Can you believe this?

				DAVID
		What re you talking about?

		Feel no shame in hiding.

	INT. HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

	A crowd of people head down the hall for the shelter while

		Oh shit, I better call my wife.

	INT. AIRPORT DINER - LATE MORNING

	Depressed Russell nurses a beer at the counter.  Three FLIGHT
	MECHANICS walk in, having a good laugh.  One of them spots
	Russell and moves over to him.

				MECHANIC #1
		Hey, Russ, heard you had a little
		trouble this morning.  Dusted the

	The Mechanics laugh.  Russell tries to ignore them.

				MECHANIC #2
		I know, you're probably still a

				MECHANIC #2
		Hostage experience?  Something

				MECHANIC #1
		He ain't never told you!?  Seems

				RUSSELL
		Not today, guys.  Okay.

	Russell gets up and heads for the door.

		You just gotta get a couple more

		you, Russ?

	EXT. SMALL AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS

	The Mechanic follows Russell outside, his buddies in tow.

				MECHANIC #1
		Hey, Russ, when they took you up
		in their space ship, they do any
		sexual things to you?

	The mechanics crack up laughing.  Suddenly the things around
	them begin to RUMBLE.  The SHADOW engulfs them, silencing the
	Mechanics.

	Panicked they turn and RUN AWAY.  Russell just looks up at the
	sky, grabs his Jack Daniels and takes another swig.

	EXT. TRAILER PARK - SAME

	Dogs bark and people stumble out of their trailers as an
	enormous SHADOW creeps over them.

	INT. BRENNON MOBILE HOME - CONTINUOUS

	The windows grow DARK and the room begins to RUMBLE.  Miguel
	rushes to the door, ushering his siblings out.

	EXT. TRAILER PARK - CONTINUOUS

	Alicia and Troy step out the door, stopping dead in their
	tracks.  Miguel follows them only to look up and SEE...

	THE PHENOMENON - DARK CLOUDS

	The flames are burning out, replaced by huge plumes of dark
	smoke billowing around the edges of the phenomena.  Only small
	traces of extinguishing flames illuminate it.

	INT. COMPACT CABLE - STAIRWELL - SAME

	David pushes past the people making their way down, fighting
	against the tide.  Another CO-WORKER (#3) stops halfway.

		Aren't you coming, David?

				DAVID
		No way, I've got to see this.

	EXT. WASHINGTON MONUMENT - SAME

	Frightened tourists run for cover as the colossal SHADOW
	approaches.  Reflected in the water below we SEE the fiery
	apparition transfigure into the dark foreboding clouds.

	The SHADOW writhes up the detailed statue of Lincoln,
	devouring him completely until we are left in total darkness.

		Of course, Russia and the United

		Yes, Das Vedanya.

	The President hangs up.

				CONSTANCE
		What is their position?

				PRESIDENT WHITMORE
		I think he was drunk.

	Patricia bursts through the door and runs into her father's
	arms, terrified.  A SECRET SERVICE man appears.

				SECRET SERVICE GUY
		Mr. President, we have to go.

	Abruptly, the room DARKENS as it begins to RUMBLE.

	The long, dark SHADOW moves across the entire White House,
	engulfing it in darkness.

	EXT. HUDSON RIVER, NEW YORK - STATUE OF LIBERTY - SAME

	Kids playing basket ball.  A young BOY stops playing, staring
	skyward.  One by one, they all look upwards, stunned as a long

	With a loud CRASH, several New York Cabs SLAM into one another
	in the street.  Two more cars crash into them.  A pile up
	ensues.

	EXT. WALL STREET - SECOND LATER

	Foot traffic stops as the long SHADOW crawls over the entire
	area.

	EXT. ROOFTOP - COMPACT CABLE - SAME

	Large satellite dishes beset a doorway to the roof which flies
	open.  David steps out just as a long, dark SHADOW covers over
	him, sending the city into darkness.  David looks up to SEE...

	SKYLINE AND ALIEN CRAFT

	Protruding through the dark clouds we get a glimpse of the
	underbelly of a colossal ALIEN CRAFT, its outer veneer of
	smoke and clouds beginning to fade away.

	Below we see PANIC, cabs SLAMMING into one another, people
	staring, people screaming.  No one knows how to react.

	David runs to the other side of the rooftop, overlooking
	Central Park, to get a better look.

	DAVID'S POV - CENTRAL PARK - SAME

	The entire park is plunged into darkness as the craft above
	blots out of the sun.  Amazing as it may seem, the hovering craft
	BLANKETS THE ENTIRE PARK and BEYOND.  We still have NOT seen
	an entire craft.

				DAVID

		My God.  The signal.

	EXT. LOS ANGELES BASIN - WIDE ANGLE - LATER MORNING

	A station wagon, filled with kids and a harried HOUSEWIFE,
	comes to a stop.  The passenger door opens and a young six-

				HOUSEWIFE
		Dylan, tell your mom you can stay
		overnight again Thursday.

	Suddenly a car SAILS over a nearby hill in front of them,
	hitting the ground with a BANG.  Two more cars follows, air
	bound.  As the Housewife turns she SEES...

	SPACE SHIP - SAME

	Rising over the mountain we SEE the Space Ship as it nears the
	city, blocking out the sunshine.

	Panicked, the Housewife hits the gas and peels out, leaving a
	confused Dylan staring skyward.

	INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Two people sleep as Dylan runs into the room.

				DYLAN
		Mommy, look at!

	He rushes away.  The SHADOW moves past the window, darkening
	the room.  His mother, JASMINE DUBROW, stirs.

				JASMINE
			(re: darkness)
		It's too early, baby.

	She turns back over.  Suddenly the room briefly RUMBLES.

				MAN
		Earthquake?

				JASMINE
		Not even a four pointer.  Go back
		to sleep.

	Shrugging, the man does.

	HOLLYWOOD SIGN (FORMERLY SC. 72) - SAME

	In Los Angeles.  The SHADOW slowly covers the sign.

	EXT. WHITE HOUSE - WINDOW - SAME

	The President and his daughter cautiously approach the window

	Cautiously some people begin to walk outside, staring up at

	INT. OVAL OFFICE - SAME

	Slowly staff members approach, gazing out the window.
	Constance steps up behind the President.

	up and makes his way to the bathroom.

	INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

	As Steve takes a pee, he SEES out the window a family packing
	up their car, others standing around staring at something in

	He finished and flushes.

	INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Steve enters the living room.  The television is playing a

	Steve turns, looking for Dylan when the doggie door pops open
	and Dylan crawls through.

				STEVE
		What have you been up to, Sport?

				DYLAN

		Shooting aliens.

	Steve musses up the boy's hair, smiling.

	Steve mumbles an affirmative as he exits.

	EXT. JASMINE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

	Steve picks up the morning paper and opens it.  He doesn't
	notice the DOZENS of neighbors quickly packing up and rushing
	to get away as he reads the paper oblivious.

				JASMINE (O.S.)
		You want milk with your coffee?

	Jasmine appears behind him, her view, too, obscured by the
	open newspaper.  Suddenly another HELICOPTER room overhead.
	Annoyed, Steve lowers his paper.

	STEVE AND JASMINE'S POV

	As the paper is lowered we SEE the helicopter SWOOP down.  As
	it flies away we SEE...

	THE ALIEN CRAFT

	Covering all of Los Angeles.  This is the first time we see
	the entire craft.  It is stupendous.  Steve's jaw hits the
	floor.  The milk goes CRASHING as Jasmine SCREAMS.

	As he speaks we get quick glimpses of the other ships.

				MARTY (O.S.)
		I know, babycakes.  Calm down.

	David spins around at the sound of the voice but the room is
	still empty.  David leans down and looks under a desk where he
	finds Marty still on the phone with his wife.

				DAVID
		Tell her to get the kids and leave

				MARTY
		What happened?

			(yells)
		Just do it!

	Marty realizes David is dead serious.

	Mary hangs up, crawls out from under the table.

		Okay, why did I just send my

				DAVID
		Remember I told you that the

				MARTY
		Not really...

				DAVID
		That signal.  It's a countdown.

				MARTY
			(confused)
		A countdown to what?

				DAVID
		Think.  It's like in chess.  First
		you strategically position your
		pieces.  Then, when the timing's
		right.  You strike.

	David motions to the television.

				BLITZER
		...there are additional
		unconfirmed sightings over Japan,

		They are positioning themselves

	Marty takes a beat to digest.  Then, grabbing the phone....

	As Constance watches the President, she unconsciously mouths
	the words of his speech, after all, she did write them.  A

	Her expression drops.  She takes the phone from her.

	In the attempt to get out, hundreds of cars have been re-

		Oh my God!

	Moishe SWERVES violently to avoid collision, barely missing

	A Military Office, assisting in diverting the cars turns just
	in time to see the Olds whiz by.

	David and Moishe are bounded around the inside of the car as

	Moishe turns HARD and drives up onto the right shoulder.

	Leaning back out, Jasmine looks for Boomer who stares at her,

	Attacker, it EXPLODES.

				JIMMY
			Shit!  They've got shield too.

	Banks back around to get a shot.  Just as he turns, three

		Okay, jerk-off.  Let's have some

	The Attacker recovers, dives after Steve who flies dangerously

	Steve puts on a clinic in advanced aerobatics, banking,

	Not far away, Steve has a quick, hard, landing.  Rolling over,
	Steve quickly pops the buckles on the chute and frees himself.

	He stands and looks around.  Spotting the beat up and
	incapacitated alien Attacker, Steve gets an angry resolved
	look.  He marches over to the fallen alien Attacker.  He scans
	it quickly, spots a type of door that has been knocked ajar.

	With all his might, Steve YANKS the door OPEN.

	AN ALIEN

	For the first time we get a quick glance at these aliens, an
	odd hybrid creature with fluctuating skeletal structure.

	The reason we only get a quick glance is because the moment it
	turns woozily towards us, Steve rears back and SLUGS HIM IN
	THE FACE, knocking the alien totally unconscious.

	His anger finally subsiding, exhaustion taking over, Steve
	stands over the craft, slowly withdrawing the prized Victory

	Jasmine turns and see a REDNECK leveling his rifle at her.
	Behind him a small damaged sports car pulls up, packed to the
	gills with stolen, looted appliances.

				REDNECK
			(yelling to pals)
		Looks like I've solved our
		transportation problem.

				JASMINE
		Hey, you're welcome to come with
		us.  We're leaving here anyway...

				REDNECK
		We're not.  Give me the key.
			(yelling back)
		Get 'em off.

	Two GUYS rush from their vehicle over to the maintenance
	truck, pulling the injured off the tailback.

				TALL MAN (O.S.)
		Repent!  Sinners!  Repent!  The
		end hast come!

	Running up from behind, the Tall Man comes over screaming.
	The Redneck turns his gun on him.

				REDNECK
		Back off.  This ain't your
		business.

	As the Redneck is distracted, Jasmine spots the bag of
	fireworks protruding out of Dylan's back pocket.

				TALL MAN
		You cannot go against the word,
		brother.

				REDNECK
		Sure I can.

	The Redneck SHOOTS the Tall Man.  His buddies laugh.

				REDNECK (cont'd)
		Now give me that key, bitch.

	As he turns back to Jasmine, Boomer starts BARKING wildly.
	Just as he turns to shoot the dog, Jasmine lights a key ROCKET
	from the fireworks bag.  The rocket BLASTS into the Redneck,
	his shirt IGNITING ON FIRE.

	The Redneck drops the rifle, attempting to put out the flames,
	his cronies rush to his aid.  Jasmine picks up the gun, moves
	in on them.

				JASMINE
		This "bitch" was born in  Alabama
		with a Daddy who loved to hunt.
			(cocking the weapon)
		So don't think for one second that
		I don't know how to use this.

	She FIRES the rifle.  Quickly the rednecks scamper away.

						CUT TO:

	EXT. DRY LAKE - DESERT - LATER

	Dragging a heavy bundle wrapped in his parachute, Steve
	marches across the desert floor.  The alien ARM/TENTACLE
	dangles out of the parachute.

	Exhausted, Steve stops to wipe his brow.  He hears something,
	turns around.

	STEVE'S POV - THE TRAILER ARMADA

	Several hundred of the trailers from the refugee camp are
	headed en mass towards him.  Smiling, Steve signals them.

	The trailers pull up on either side, surrounding him.  Miguel
	leans out of his trailer.

				MIGUEL
			(sarcastic)
		Need a lift?

				STEVE
		When I flew overhead, I saw some
		kind of base, not far.

	Confused, Miguel checks his map.

				MIGUEL
		It's not on the map.

				STEVE
		Trust me, it's there.

	EXT. AIR FORCE ONE - LATER

	Flying over the desert, Air Force One sails over an immense
	valley, Area 51 below - hangars, a few buildings, a small air
	strip, not much.

	Super: N.I.A. Base - "Area 51", Nevada

	EXT. RUNWAY - LATER

	Air Force One lands.  Wheels touch down, skid.

	INT. HANGAR - LATER

	The large hangar doors open and Air Force One is rolled
	inside.  The President and his entourage are met by a
	contingent of base personnel led by field operative, LT.
	MITCHELL.  He escorts them to a side hallway.

	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Lt. Mitchell walks over to an odd wall switch as the President
	and his entourage wait in the center of the hall.  With a loud
	hydraulic HUM, the entire hallway begins to SINK DOWN, an
	enormous ELEVATOR.

				PRESIDENT
		Why the hell wasn't I told about
		this place?

				NIMZIKI
		Two words, Mr. President.
		Plausible deniability.

	General Grey shoots Nimziki a pissed off look.  When the
	elevator stops, a door SLIDES open.

	INT. RESEARCH FACILITIES - CONTINUOUS

	Stepping out of the elevator, they walk into a large state of
	the art, sterile clean research facility.  It is amazingly
	well staffed and organized.

				PRESIDENT
		I don't understand.  Where did all
		this come from?  How did this get
		funded?

				MOISHE
		You didn't think they actually
		spent ten thousand dollars for a
		hammer and thirty thousand for a
		toilet seat, did you?

	The President shoots him a look.  They are greeted by a group
	of SCIENTISTS in whit coats led by, DR. OKUN.

				MITCHELL
		Mr. President, I'd like to
		introduce you to Dr. Okun.  He's
		been heading up our research here
		for the last fifteen years.

	Dr. Okun is an odd, hyper-energetic man who's spent too much
	time in isolation.

				OKUN
		Mr. President, a real pleasure.
		They don't let us out much, you
		you.

				PRESIDENT
			(uncomfortable)
		Yes.

				OKUN
		Well, I guess you'd like to see
		the big tamale?  Follow me.

	They walk up a ramp at the end of the room.  Large heavily
	enforced doors SLIDE open.

	INT. STORAGE LAB - CONTINUOUS

	The group steps inside and nearly gasps at...

	THE ALIEN ATTACKER

	Just like the one that chased Steve.  The entourage stares in
	horror and wonder.  We can SEE the patch-work repairs they've
	made on the ship over the years.

				OKUN
		She's a beaut, ain't she?

	Moishe leans close to David and Constance.

				MOISHE
			(smug)
		Never any space ships recovered by
		the government, huh?

				PRESIDENT
		We've had this for forty years and
		you don't know anything about
		them?

				OKUN
		Hell no, we know tons about them.
		The nearest stuff has only
		happened in the last few days.

	The President slowly walks around the ship as Okun talks.
	David, mouth agape, just stares at it.

				OKUN (cont'd)
		See, we can't duplicate their type
		of power so we've never been able
		to experiment.  But since these
		guys started showing up, all the
		gizmos inside turned on.  The last
		twenty four hours have been really
		exciting!

				PRESIDENT
			(exploding)
		People are dying out there.  I
		don't think "exciting" is the word
		I'd choose to describe it!

	The room goes silent, letting the President blow off steam.

				PRESIDENT
			(calming)
		What can you tell us about the
		enemy we're facing?

				OKUN
		Not all too dissimilar to us.
		Breathes oxygen, comparable
		tolerances to heat,
		cold...probably why they're
		interested in our planet.
			(suddenly excited)
		Hey, you wanna see them?

	INT. MEDICAL RESEARCH VAULT - MOMENTS LATER

	The lights slowly TURN ON, illuminated the vault.  Okun leads
	the group to a sealed partition.

				OKUN
		This is vault, or as some of us
		have come to call it, the "freak
		show."

	Okun hits a switch and the sealed partition lifts revealing...

	FORMALDEHYDE TANKS - ALIENS

	Three dead aliens float in the milky formaldehyde tanks.  The
	murky fluid and condensation obstructs our view.  What we do
	see is not pretty.

				OKUN
		When we found them they were
		wearing bio-mechanical suits.
		Once we got them off, we were able
		to learn a great deal about their
		anatomy; eyes, ears, bipolar
		digestive system... no vocal cords
		though.  We're assuming they
		communicate with each other
		through other means.

	David cannot contain his fascination.  He steps forward.

				DAVID
		What kind of other means?  Hand
		signals, body language?

				OKUN
		Some kind of extra sensory
		perception.  Telepathy.

				PRESIDENT
		Can they be killed?

				OKUN
		These three died in the crash.
		Their bodies are as frail as our
		own.  You just have to get past
		their technology, which is, I'm
		sorry to say, far more advanced.

	The President turns to David.

				PRESIDENT
		You unlocked a part of that
		technology.  You cracked their
		code.

				DAVID
		All I did was stumble onto their
		signal.  I don't know how helpful
		I can be...

				PRESIDENT
		Show them what you've discovered.
		Work together.  We've got to find
		a way to beat them.

	EXT. SECURITY GATE - SAME

	Four armed GUARDS watch the gate.  An armada of trucks and
	trailers heads right for them.  They move into position to
	block their entrance as a blue pick-up skids to a halt before
	them.  Steve stands up from the back of the pick up.

				GUARD
		Sorry, Lt. Colonel, I can't open
		the gates without clearance.

				STEVE
		You want to see my clearance?

	Impatiently Steve grabs the Guard by the collar, pulling him
	over the side of the truck putting him face to face with the
	bundled parachute in the flatbed.  Steve rips the fabric aside
	revealing...

	THE ALIEN CREATURE

	Still unconscious, the alien stirs.  The Guard JUMPS BACK,
	shitting in his pants.  Quickly he signals for the other to
	open the gate.

	The armada quickly drives past.

	BLACKNESS

	Total darkness.  Suddenly light pours in as a  door is open.
	We see the faces of Okun, David and three technicians all
	peering at us with inquisitive expressions.

				OKUN
		See the gizmos flashing?

	REVERSE - INSIDE ALIEN CRAFT

	Sure enough, tons of gizmos with lights flashing.  High tech
	meets organic organisms.  This alien ship looks familiar to
	our own technology and completely different at the same time.

				OKUN (cont'd)
		We've been working around the
		clock trying to get a fix on all
		this crap.  Some stuff we figured
		out right away.

	David climbs in, fascinated.  He touches everything.  Okun
	points to everything as he describes it.

				OKUN (cont'd)
		This thing we're pretty sure is
		the life support for the cabin,
		this do-hickey over here is
		connected with the engines, this
		crap...we have no idea what that
		stuff is for.

	David is transfixed by it.  He stares at the small screens
	with flashing light patterns on them.

				OKUN (cont'd)
		But this over here is clearly what
		they use to navigate and guide the
		craft.

	But David still stares at the small screens.

				DAVID
		Someone grab my laptop for me?

	One of the technicians rushes off as Okun leans close.

				OKUN
		Find something interesting?

				DAVID
		Maybe.

	The technician hands David his retrieved laptop which he
	quickly flips open and turns on.

				DAVID
		These patterns here, they're
		repeating sequentially, just
		like...

	David turns his laptop around for Okun to see.  The pattern on
	David's laptop flashes identically as the alien screen.

				DAVID (cont'd)
		...their countdown signal.  Their
		using this frequency for computer
		communications.  It's how they co-
		ordinate their ships.

				OKUN
		You know, you're really starting
		to make us look bad.

	The two men exchange a smile.  Another TECHY pops his head
	inside.

				TECHY
			(out of breath)
		They got one!  They got one,
		alive!

	INT. HALLWAY OFF MAIN HANGAR - AREA 51 - SAME

	The bundled alien lays on a stretcher that's wheeled quickly
	into the hall.  Okun and his staff surround it.  Trailing
	behind them is Steve, Russell and Miguel.

				OKUN
		How long has it been unconscious?

				RUSSELL
		Excuse me Doctor...

				STEVE
		Three hours.

				OKUN
		Get him into containment, stat.

				RUSSELL
		My boy is very sick, he needs
		immediate attention.

	Okun ignores Russell, hitting the elevator switch on the wall,
	the room begins its hydraulic HUM.

				OKUN
		He's dying out.  I want him
		sprayed down with saline.

	Russell SLAMS his fist against the switch, the room stops.  He
	GRABS a doctor nearby, gets in his face.

				RUSSELL
		My boys is slipping into a diabetic
		coma.  If you don't do something
		about it right now he will die.

	Miguel is surprised and proud of Russell as he holds DOCTOR
	ISAACS, meaning business.

				DR. ISAACS
		O'Haver, Miller, come with me.
			(to Russell)
		Take us to him.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. ROAD - MAINTENANCE TRUCK - NIGHT

	Headlights pierce the darkness as the maintenance truck rolls
	to a stop.  Jasmine climbs down out of the truck, her face
	ashen.

	She walks past a sign reading: El Toro Marine Corps Air
	Station.  Tears begin to roll from her eyes.  We follow her
	gaze to see...

	EXT. EL TORO MARINE CORPS AIR STATION - CONTINUOUS

	The entire facility is smoldering, the last remnants of the
	fire burning itself to extinction.  Jasmine is devastated.

							CUT TO:

	INT. AREA 51 COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT

	General Grey and Nimziki are in a heated argument.

				GENERAL GREY
		You were the head of the National
		Intelligence Agency!  You knew all
		about this.  When were you
		planning on informing the rest of
		us!?

				NIMZIKI
		It had been deemed classified.

				GENERAL GREY
		Christ, why didn't you say
		anything about this when they
		first arrived?  You could have
		warned us before we launched a
		counter attack that cost us
		hundreds of American pilots!

	Just then the President enters along with Constance and some
	other ADVISORS.  He examines a paper map of the United States,
	tacked to the wall, each major city circled in black.

				PRESIDENT
		Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia,
		destroyed?

				GENERAL GREY
			(composing himself)
		And there are scattered reports of
		sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth,
		And Memphis.

	The President and his team take seats at the large conference
	table.

				GENERAL GREY (cont'd)
		We've learned that NATO and
		western allied installations were
		the firs to be taken out.  We
		were next.  They knew exactly where
		and how to hit us.

	Grey sneaks an accusatory glare at Nimziki.

				PRESIDENT
		And our forces?

				GENERAL GREY
		We're down to approximately
		fifteen percent, Sir.
			(beat)
		If you calculate the time it takes
		them to destroy a city and move
		on, we're looking at world wide
		destruction of every major city
		within the next thirty six hours.

				PRESIDENT
		We're being exterminated.

	The room is quiet.  Constance runs her fingers through her
	hair.  The door to the room opens and Lt. Mitchell enters with 
	Steve.

				MITCHELL
		Mr. President, this is Lt.
		Colonel Steven Hill.

	The President quickly gets to his feet, anxiously shaking
	Steve's hand.

				PRESIDENT
		Lieutenant, congratulations.

				STEVE
		Thank you, sir.

				PRESIDENT
		Where is the prisoner now?

				MITCHELL
		We have him in isolation.  The
		doctors are very hopeful he will
		survive.

				PRESIDENT
		I'd like to see him.

				MITCHELL
		Yes, sir.

	The General is concerned but the President is determined.
	They head for the door.

				STEVE
			(to General Grey)
		General, I'm anxious to get back
		to El Toro.

				GENERAL GREY
		Didn't anyone tell you?  I'm
		sorry.  El Toro was destroyed in
		the attack.

	Steve is shattered, he had no idea.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. EL TORO BASE - NIGHT

	The injured are gathered around a small camp fire.  Jasmine
	walks up, dumping a box full of charred can goods.

				JASMINE
		These should last us a while.

	As Margaret tries to move, she winces in pain.  Jasmine rushes
	to her aid.  The color from her face drained, Margaret looks
	like she's taking a turn for the worse.

				JASMINE
		Don't move.  Stay still.

	Jasmine adjusts the bandages as Margaret turns and see Dylan
	curled up next to Boomer, too adorable.  Slowly he starts to
	wake up.

				MARGARET
		Your son.

				JASMINE 
		He's my angel.

				MARGARET
		Was his father stationed here?

				JASMINE
		He wasn't his father.  I was kinda
		hoping he'd want the job, though.

	Jasmine becomes sad, remembering.  Margaret changes the
	subject.

				MARGARET
		So, what do yo do for a living?

				JASMINE
		I'm a dancer.

				MARGARET
		Really?  Ballet?

				JASMINE
			(laughs)
		No.  Exotic.

				MARGARET
		Oh.  Sorry.

				JASMINE
		Don't be.  I'm not.  It's good
		money.
			(re: Dylan)
		'Side, he's worth it.

	The bandages changed, Jasmine sits down next to Margaret.

				MARGARET
		And when the dancing's over?  What
		about your future?

				JASMINE
		Funny, it used to scare me when I
		thought about the future.
			(looking around)
		Guess it doesn't really matter
		anymore.

	Dylan comes walking over.

				JASMINE
		Dylan, come here.  I want you to
		meet the First Lady.

				MARGARET
			(surprised)
		I thought you didn't recognize me.

				JASMINE
		Didn't want to say anything.  I
		voted for the other guy.

							CUT TO:

	INT. CONTAINMENT LAB - NIGHT

	Okun and two Medical assistants examine the alien creature.
	His arms and chest have been strapped down to the examining
	table.

	For the first time we get a good look at the head of this
	creature, long tentacled-type cords interlocked, covering the
	face.  The doctors attach clamps to each of the cords.

				OKUN
		Everyone ready?

	The doctors exchange nervous glances, nod to each other.  At
	the same moment all they pull on the clamps, unraveling the
	interlocked cords.  As the cords unravel, we SEE that this is
	in fact a bio-mechanical SUIT as we REVEAL...

	THE ALIEN

	Beneath the cords lay the unconscious face of the alien, his
	skin translucent, his body fluids, capillaries, muscle tissue,
	alien's skin.

				OKUN
		Do we have life support monitors
		recording?

				MED ASSIST #2
		Yes.  If we fuck up it'll all be
		on tape.

				OKUN
		Can we get some ventilation in
		here?  I can't take this smell.

				MED ASSIST #2
		They've conquered space travel but
		not b.o.

	As Okun begins to put on a pair of surgical gloves he suddenly
	grabs his forehead.

				MED ASSIST #1
		You all right?

				OKUN
		Yeah.  It's just that stink gives
		me a headache.

				MED ASSIST #2
		He's moving!

	Instantly everyone's attention is riveted to the arm of the
	alien as it moves beneath the sheet.  Unseen by the others the
	alien creature's EYES OPEN.

	Another SHARP PAIN hits Okun who SCREAMS, stumbling backwards
	grabbing his head.  The others turn in surprise.

	THE ALIEN

	Suddenly SPRINGS up, the restraining straps SNAPPING.  Before
	Med #2 can react, one of the alien's tentacles SMASHES her
	across the face.  She is sent sprawling backwards.

	LOW ANGLE - THE ALIEN

	Standing before her.  In a wink of an eye, he ATTACKS, leaping
	on her.

	Together they TUMBLE back into a formaldehyde tank.  Hoses
	are ripped from their sides and STEAM pours out.  We get quick
	glimpse of their struggle as the steam engulfs them.

	INT. HALLWAY - SAME

	Mitchell leads the Presidential party down the hall.  They
	turn and enter the Medical lab.

	INT. CONTAINMENT LAB - CONTINUOUS

	The group slows as they enter the room.  They see the
	containment room through the glass is covered with white
	steam.  Nothing can be seen.  It's eerily quiet.

	Cautiously they approach.  Suddenly Okun is SLAMMED AGAINST
	the glass partition, the creature's tentacles wrapped around
	him.  Pressed firmly to the glass, his eyes are shut, his
	expression pained, but when he speaks the voice is angry.

				OKUN/ALIEN
		Release...me.

				MITCHELL
		Open the door.  Get him out of
		there.

	Suspicious, General Grey stops him.

				GENERAL GREY
		Wait.
			(to Okun)
		Can you hear me?

				OKUN/ALIEN
		Will kill...release me.  Now!

	They follow the tentacles with their eyes, up to the ceiling
	of the containment tank.  Suddenly the alien LEAPS DOWN,
	startling them, landing before them behind the glass.

	We see he's holding Okun against the glass, speaking THROUGH
	HIM.  This is the first real good look we get at the this bizarre
	creature.  Everyone in the room is repulsed and compelled by
	it at the same time.

	EXT. AREA 51 - NIGHT

	Through the hundreds of campers and trailers parked outside,
	Steve runs past until he reaches the open tarmac.

	A transport helicopter sits on the edge of the landing area.
	Steve runs up to it and climbs inside.

	INT. TRANSPORT HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

	Steve quickly starts it engines, preparing to take off.  A
	SOLDIER rushes over to the cockpit.

				SOLIDER
			(yelling)
		What the hell are you doing?  Get
		out of there!

				STEVE
		I'm just going to borrow it.

	The Soldier pulls out his pistol, taking aim.

				SOLIDER
		No you're not, sir.

				STEVE
		You really want to shoot me?

	Steve stares the Soldier down.  Reluctantly he lowers his gun.

				SOLDIER
		Shit.  I'm gonna catch the hell for
		this.

	Steve smiles and gives him a quick salute then TAKES OFF.
	Quickly the bird RISES UP and darts off into the night.

	INT. MEDICAL LAB - SAME

	The President has moved closer to the glass and is talking
	with the alien.  The alien uses Okun like a ventriloquist's
	dummy.

				PRESIDENT
		Why did you people come here?

				OKUN/ALIEN
		Air...water...your "sun."

				PRESIDENT
		Where do your people come from?
			(no answer)
		Where is your home?

				OKUN/ALIEN
		Here...now.

				PRESIDENT
		And before here?

				OKUN/ALIEN
		Many worlds...

				PRESIDENT
		Can we negotiate a truce?  is
		there room for co-existance?
			(no answer)
		Can there be peace between us?

				OKUN/ALIEN
		Peace?  No peace.

				PRESIDENT
		What do you want us to do?

				OKUN/ALIEN
		Die.

	The Alien moves closer to the glass staring at the President.
	Suddenly the President clutches his head in pain.

				NIMZIKI
		Mr. President?

				OKUN/ALIEN
		We kill you...all.

	The pain becomes more severe and the President SCREAM OUT.
	There is general panic as people rush to the President's side.

				GENERAL GREY
			(to Mitchell)
		Is that glass bullet proof?

				MITCHELL
		No sir.

	The General draws his pistol.  Mitchell and the other military
	officers follow his lead.  Simultaneously they all begin to
	FIRE!

	The glass SHATTERS into a billion pieces.  The Alien is cut to
	ribbons, falling backwards.

	The President collapses.  So does Okun.  A STAFFER rushes over
	to Okun, checks his pulse.

				STAFFER
		He's dead.

	General Grey moves to the President who slowly recovers.

				GENERAL GREY
		Mr. President, are you okay?

	Woozily the President sits up, a strange look in his eye.

				PRESIDENT
		He wanted me to understand.  He
		communicated with me.
			(turning to Grey)
		They're like locusts.  They travel
		from planet to planet, their whole
		civilization.  After they've
		consumed every natural resource
		they move on.  And we're next.

	The President stands with a new resolve.  He stares at the
	dead alien on the floor.

				PRESIDENT
			(cold)
		Prepare a nuclear strike.

	INT. STORAGE LAB - MINUTES LATER

	The research staff are working near the recovered alien
	attacker.  Constance comes rushing in.  She looks around for
	David.  Through the glass of one of the offices she sees him.

	INT. OFFICES - CONTINUOUS

	Holding a bottle of Jack Daniels, David fishes through a small
	refrigerator as Constance enters.

				DAVID
		Just my luck, no ice.

				CONSTANCE
		I take it you've heard.

				DAVID
		A toast to the end of the world.

	David toasts her with the bottle, takes a swig.

				CONSTANCE
		He didn't come to this decision
		lightly.

	David nods, he doesn't want to argue.  He smiles cynically.

				DAVID
		You still believe in him.

				CONSTANCE
		He's a good man.

				DAVID
		Better be.  You left me for him.

				CONSTANCE
		I wanted a career.  Didn't you
		ever want to be part of something
		special?

	David stares daggers at her.

				DAVID
		I was part of something special.

	Constance realizes he means their marriage.  She's hurt him
	and can see it.  She turns and leaves.

	drops down, flies parallel with the bomber as it adjusts its
	radar and laser tracking.  Suddenly it SHOOTS OFF.

	The bomber BANKS AWAY.

	INT. B-2 STEALTH BOMBER - SAME

	We see the horizon twisting away as we bank off from target.

				PILOT
		She's away.

	INT. COMMAND CENTER - SAME

	On the big map we see one FLASHING target line tracking the
	missile as it approaches Houston.

				PRESIDENT
			(to himself)
		May our children forgive us.

	INT. ARMORED TANK - OUTSIDE HOUSTON - NIGHT

	The Tank Commander readjusts the periscope.

	TANK COMMANDER POV - SPACE SHIP & B-2 STEALTH BOMBER

	We follow the Cruise Missile as it guides itself on a direct
	collision course with the space craft.

	INT. COMMAND CENTER - SAME

	The targeting map shows how close the missile is, nearly on
	top of the target.  Everyone in the room holds their breath.

	EXT. SPACE CRAFT - SAME

	The nuke speeds closer.  It HITS the protective shield and
	DETONATES.  A FLASH OF LIGHT.

	WIDE ANGLE - HOUSTON

	With the B-2 Stealth Bomber in the foreground, the city behind
	it vanishes in a FLASH OF LIGHT, blinding us.

	INT. COMMAND CENTER - SAME

	We can see the extent of the explosion on the targeting map,
	tracking it -- an expanding ring around Houston.

				NIMZIKI
			(excited)
		It's a hit!

	The others are still waiting.  The monitor shows the night
	vision picture of the growing MUSHROOM CLOUD rising above the
	city.

	EXT. HOUSTON - WIDE - SAME

	The MUSHROOM CLOUD engulfs the horizon.

	EXT. ARMORED TANK - SAME

	Rocked by the massive explosion, the shock wave ROCKS the
	armored tank but doesn't destroy it.

	INT. ARMORED TANK - SAME

	The men inside are KNOCKED around, hard from the explosion.

	INT. COMMAND CENTER - SAME

				NIMZIKI
		We got the bastards!

	General Grey shoots Nimziki a look.  The President holds up a
	hand, silencing the room.

				PRESIDENT
		Can they see it?  Did it destroy
		the target?

	TANK COMMANDER'S POV THROUGH PERISCOPE - SAME

	As the cloud begins to dissipate we see THE SPACE CRAFT IS
	STILL THERE, completely unharmed.

	INT. ARMORED TANK - SAME

				TANK COMMANDER
		Negative.  Target remains.

	INT. COMMAND CENTER - SAME

	On the monitors as well, we can see the target remain.  The
	air is let out of the room, everyone deflated.

				PRESIDENT
		Call them back.

				NIMZIKI
		The other bombers might have more
		luck.  We shouldn't just give
		up...

				PRESIDENT
		I said call them back.

	As the technicians call the bombers away, the President sinks
	into a depression.  His last hope of survival gone.

	EXT. EL TORO MARINE CORPS AIR STATION - NIGHT

	Jasmine keeps Margaret company as the rest sleep around the
	last flames of their campfire.  From the worried expression on
	Jasmine's face we can tell that Margaret has gotten worse, her
	wounds bleeding badly.

	A WIND kicks up, the sound of an ENGINE approaching.  Jasmine
	squints her eyes looking up into the wind when a BRIGHT LIGHT
	engulfs her.

	JASMINE'S POV - LIGHTS - NIGHT

	Bright lights in the sky growing nearer.  Slowly the others
	begin to wake up, frightened as the lights INTENSIFY.

	The others slowly begin to retreat but Jasmine stands, staring
	defiantly.  A smile creeps across her face as she sees that
	the lights belong to...

	TRANSPORT HELICOPTER

	The Transport Helicopter touches down and Steve leaps out,
	racing towards Jasmine.  Overwhelmed, Jasmine jumps into his
	arms.

				JASMINE
		You're late.

		You know how I like to make a big

	They kiss.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

	The double doors burst open as the President carrying his

	them.

				PRESIDENT
		How is she?

				ISAACS
		I'm sorry, Mr. President.  If only
		we could have gotten to her
		sooner.

	The President puts his daughter down as he sees...

	PRESIDENT'S POV - MARGARET

	Margaret lays in bed, doctors and nurses surrounding her.
	Patricia rushes over.

				ISAACS
		She's bleeding internally.
		There's nothing else we can do.

	Stunned, the President watches as Patricia hugs her mother.

				MARGARET
		Hiya Munchkin.

				PATRICIA
		Mommy, we were worried.  We didn't
		know where you were.

				MARGARET
		I'm right here, baby.

	Recovering, the President nods for the doctors to leave the
	room.  As they begin to march out, he makes his way over to
	his wife and daughter.

				PRESIDENT
		Honey, why don't you wait outside
		so Mommy can get some rest.

	Patricia kisses her mother, says goodbye and leaves.  Out of
	sight, Margaret winces, fading away.  The President grabs her
	hand for support.  She squeezes tightly.

				MARGARET
			(through tears)
		I'm scared, Tom.

				PRESIDENT
		It's okay.  The doctors said
		you're going to be just fine.

	Margaret smiles at the man she knows all too well.

				MARGARET
		Liar.

	The look between them says more than any words.

	INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE MARGARET'S ROOM - LATER

	The President exits the room, overcome with emotion.
	Constance, the doctors and some medical crew move to comfort
	him.  He holds them off with a gesture.

	He looks up and sees Jasmine, Steve and Dylan down the hall.
	He pushes through the crowd and makes his way over to them.

				JASMINE
		I'm so sorry.

				PRESIDENT
		I just wanted to thank you.
		You're a very brave woman.

	Across the hall, Patricia sits in a chair, waiting.  Whitmore
	walks over to her and kneels down next to his small child.

				PATRICIA
		Is Mommy sleeping now?

	David is drunkenly knocking everything over, making a gigantic
	mess.  Moishe comes up behind, restraining him.

				MOISHE
		David, David!  What the hell are
		you doing!?

				DAVID
		I'm making a mess.

				MOISHE
		This I can see.

				DAVID
		We've gotta burn the rain forest,
		Pops.  Dump toxic waste, pollute
		the air, rip up the ozone.  Maybe
		if we screw this planet up enough
		they won't want it anymore.

				MOISHE
		David, you're drunk.

	David slips, falls on his ass, hard.  Moishe helps him back up
	on his feet.

				MOISHE
		I think you better sleep this off.
		Go back inside before you catch a
		cold.

	Slowly David looks up towards Moishe, an idea.

				DAVID
		Pops, you're a genius!

				MOISHE
		What'd I say?

				DAVID
		A cold?  Of course.

	Sobered, David jumps kisses his father and bolts inside.

							CUT TO:

	INT. STORAGE LAB - DAY

	A large crowd has been gathered here at the lab.  General Grey
	and Nimziki walk up to Constance.

				NIMZIKI
		All right, Connie, we're here.
		What's this all about?

				CONSTANCE
		I really have no idea.  He just
		said to bring everyone down here.

	Steve shows Dylan the alien space craft.

				DYLAN
		Does that thing fly in outer
		space?

	Steve loos up at the craft admiringly.

				STEVE
		It certainly does.

	When the President enters a technician rushes over and knocks
	on the hatch door on the alien attacker.  The door swings open
	and David climbs down.

	Grabbing a coke can from the "recycle" trash bin, David places
	the empty can on top of the alien attacker.  David turns and
	faces the gathering.

				DAVID
		Could anyone please step back
		away from the craft?

	They do and David nods to a Technician inside the craft.  The
	Technician disappears inside, closing the door behind him.  A
	loud HUM emits from the craft.  David has to yell over it.

				DAVID
		Lt. Mitchell, would you mind
		drawing your pistol?

				MITCHELL
		What?

				DAVID
		From where you're standing, do you
		think you could shoot that can off
		the alien craft?

	Mitchell shrugs affirmatively.  David gestures for him to try.
	Taking aim, Mitchell SHOOTS.

	The bullet RICOCHETS off the attacker's protective shield.
	Several people in the crowd dock, afraid of being hit by the
	errant bullet.

				DAVID
		Sorry 'bout that.  You see, it's
		protected by the craft's shields.
		We can't penetrate their defenses.

				NIMZIKI
		We know that already.  What's your
		point?

	David walks over to his laptop, now connected directly to the
	craft by cables and starts typing furiously.

				DAVID
		My point is if we can't beat their
		defenses, then we must get around
		them.

	David stops typing and stares at his wrist watch, silently
	counting down.

				DAVID
		Lt. Mitchell, would you please try
		to shoot it again?

	Reluctantly Mitchell obliges.  This time the can is BLOWN OFF
	THE CRAFT.  Everyone in the room is shocked.  The Technician
	re-opens the craft's door and the loud HUM disappears.

				GENERAL GREY
		How did you do that?

				DAVID
		I gave it a cold.

	The President is fascinated, he steps closer.  Moishe beams
	proudly at his smart son.  Constance is amazed.

				DAVID (cont'd)
		More accurately, I gave it a
		virus.  A computer virus.

	David turns his laptop around for the President to see.

				GENERAL GREY
		Are you telling us you can send
		out a signal that will disable all
		their shields?

				DAVID
		Just as they used our satellites
		against us, we can use their own
		signal against them.

	David walks over to a diagram he's made showing the
	relationship between the Mother Ship, the Space Crafts and the
	smaller alien attackers.

				DAVID (cont'd)
		If we plant the virus directly
		into the mother ship, it would
		then filter down into all the
		corresponding ships below.

				NIMZIKI
		And just how do we infect the
		"Mother Ship" with a virus?

	David gestures to the alien attacker behind him.

				DAVID
		We'll have to fly their craft out
		of our atmosphere and dock with
		the mother ship.

	Intrigued Steve turns and looks back at the alien attacker,
	sizing it up.  David points to a satellite photo of the
	underbelly of the Mother Ship.

				DAVID (cont'd)
		We can enter here, upload the
		virus and set off an explosion
		that could disable it.  This would
		disorient the smaller ship below
		and buy you some time to take them
		out.

	Constance reacts, realizing David's participation in the plan.

				NIMZIKI
		This is ridiculous.

				GENERAL GREY
		How long would their shields be
		down?

				DAVID
		Once they discover the virus it
		could be a matter of minutes.

				NIMZIKI
		You want us to co-ordinate a
		massive world wide counter strike
		with a window of only a few
		minutes?

				GENERAL GREY
		With their shields down it might
		be possible.

				NIMZIKI
		Please, you're not buying into any
		of this nonsense, are you?  We
		don't have the manpower or the
		resources to launch that kind of a
		campaign.
			(gesturing to the alien
			 ship)
		Not to mention that this whole
		cockamamie plan is dependent on a
		machine that no one in the world
		is qualified to operate.

				STEVE (O.S.)
		I wouldn't say that, sir.

	Everyone turns to Steve who steps through the crowd.

				STEVE
		I've seen them in action.  I've
		watched their maneuvers.  With
		your permission, sir, I'd like the
		opportunity to try.

				NIMZIKI
		That thing's a wreck.  It crash
		landed back in the fifties!  We
		don't even know if it's capable of
		flying.

	David turns to the Technicians.

				DAVID
		Remove the clamps!

	Technicians move to the large holding clamps on either side of
	the craft.  With a loud CLANK, the clamps are pulled away.

	For a moment the hulking craft TEETERS unevenly, but quickly
	stabilizes, FLOATING ABOVE THEM.

				DAVID
		Any other questions?

	Everyone stares at the floating ship with wonder.

				PRESIDENT
		Let's do it.

	INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

	Constance, General Grey and the President are walking down the
	hall.  Nimziki rushes to catch up.

				NIMZIKI
		I understand that you're upset
		over the death of your wife but
		that's no excuse for making
		another fatal mistake...

	The President whirls, grabs Nimziki and SLAMS him against the 
	wall.  Holding him tight, the President gets in his face.

				PRESIDENT
		The only mistake I made was
		appointing a sniveling little
		weasel like you Chief of Staff.

	Constance is about to intervene when General Grey stops her.

				PRESIDENT (cont'd)
		But this is a mistake, I am
		thankful to say, I do not have to
		live with.  Mr. Nimziki, you're
		fired.

	The President releases him and turns to General Grey.

				PRESIDENT (cont'd)
		Organize every plane you can find
		and get some Goddamned pilots
		to fly them.

				GENERAL GREY
		Yes, Sir.

	He storms off leaving everyone stunned.

				NIMZIKI
		He can't do that.

				CONSTANCE
			(amazed)
		He just did.

	a map.  One pilot, REGINALD, is in charge.

				REGINALD
		...we've been told that there may
		be additional re-enforcement in
		hiding near the Golan Straights...

	Suddenly the flap to the tent opens.  All the pilots draw
	their pistols frightening the ARAB PILOT who stands in the
	doorway.  The Arab Pilot speaks quickly in Arabic.

				REGINALD
		What the hell's he saying?

				THOMSON
			(explaining)
		Seems they're getting a signal.
		One Morse code.

	EXT. DRY LAKE - SECONDS LATER

	As they step out of the tent we SEE more than a HUNDRED
	FIGHTERS PLANES from different nations parked around them.
	They've all gone into hiding out here in the desert, divided
	into many smaller camps.

	Reginald and Thomson follow their Arab cohort, walking through
	the many other campsites.  Thomson gets some stares from the
	IRAQI PILOTS.

				REGINALD
		I still get believe this.

				THOMSON
		The Iraqis don't appear altogether
		too pleased with this arrangement.

				REGINALD
		How do you think the Israelis
		feel?

	Sure enough a campsite of ISRAELI PILOTS sits very near by.

	ANGLE - ARABIAN AIR FORCE CAMP

	Dozens of Arab pilots are gathered around a large radio as the
	Morse code comes through.  Thomson quickly kneels down, taking
	notes.

				THOMSON
		It's from the Americans.  They

		How're we doing?

				GENERAL GREY
		Better than we thought.

	General Grey leads the President over to the wall map.

				GENERAL GREY
		We have confirmed divisions of

	Russell wanders over towards them.

				OFFICER (cont'd)
		...with our depleted manpower we

		could be useful...

	Russell pushes his way through the crowd.

				RUSSELL
			(slurred)
		I can fly, I mean, I'm a pilot.

	The officer just stares at the bottle of Jack Daniels still in 
	his hand.

				OFFICER
		Sorry, sir.

	Russell gets into his face, desperate.

				RUSSELL
		You don't understand.  I've gotta
		be part of this.  This is

				OFFICER
		Why don't you go somewhere and

	The Officers move on, taking a few volunteers with them.
	Russell watches them go, dejected.  Angrily, he throws the
	bottle of Jack, SMASHING it.

	INT. STORAGE LAB - NIGHT

	A large MISSILE slides back into a LAUNCHER that has been

				MITCHELL
		We've hid the launcher in the

	Mitchell takes a small black box from a table near by.

				MITCHELL (cont'd)
		This will be attached to the ships
		main console.

				STEVE
		It's just like an AMRAAM launch
		pad on the stealths.

				MITCHELL
		Exactly.  Use it the same way.
		Only the nuke won't detonate on
		impact.  You'll have another
		thirty seconds to get as far away

				DAVID
		I'll see how they're doing with

				STEVE
			(checking his watch)
		Oh shit, we're late.

		We'll meet you there.

	Steve dashes off as David moves toward the attacker.
	Constance has been eavesdropping.  She walks to David.

				CONSTANCE
		Thirty seconds?  Isn't that
		cutting it a little too close?

				DAVID
		We'll be well on our way out of
		there before we shoot that thing
		off.

	David leans under the attacker where a TECHNICIAN is attaching
	another device.

				TECHNICIAN
		It's the strongest SHF transmitter
		we could get.  It'll tell us when
		you've uploaded the virus.

				DAVID
		Then cross your fingers the

	David turns and walks away, Constance following.

				CONSTANCE
		With you?  I don't understand why
		you can't just show someone how to
		plant the virus, somebody trained
		for this kind of mission?

				DAVID
		If anything goes wrong I'll have
		to think quickly, adjust the

	David stops, picking up a small trash can labelled "recycle."

				DAVID

		Witnesses?

	Just then the doors open and David and Constance enter taking
	seats on opposing sides of the aisle.

	Constance, David and Moishe join the group, listening.  Even
	David is moved.

				PRESIDENT (cont'd)
		Perhaps it's fate that today, July
		the Fourth, we will once again
		fight for our freedom.  Not from
		tyranny, persecution or
		oppression.  But from
		annihilation.  We're fighting for

		a fight.  We will live on.  We
		will survive.

	The crowd erupts into applause and cheers.  The President
	turns and walks over to an Officer holding a bundle of

	disrobe.

				GENERAL GREY
		Mr. President, just what do you

	David looks down at the "barf bags" in Moishe's hand.

				DAVID
		Thanks, Pops.

				MOISHE
		I want you should know, I'm very
		proud of you, son.

	That means more to David than Moishe could have known.

				CONSTANCE
		Be careful.

	Constance hugs David as Steve suddenly freaks out.

				STEVE
		Damn it.  We can't go yet.  I
		gotta find some cigars.

	Steve is about to bolt when Moishe grabs him, retrieving two
	cigars from his coat pocket.

				MOISHE
		My last two.  With my blessings.

		You're a lifesaver.

	Steve grabs them and climbs inside.  David smiles awkwardly,

	The hatch shuts and David takes a seat next to Steve who hands
	him one of the cigars.

				STEVE
		Hang on to this.  For our victory

	Reluctantly David takes it.  As he does Steve notices the

				DAVID
		I have a confession to make.  I'm
		not real big on flying.

				STEVE
		Great.

	The Attacker arcs upward and disappears into the clouds.

	EXT. AREA 51 - THE PRESIDENT'S PLANE - SAME

	The President watches the Attacker flying away.  His canopy
	locks down as he adjusts his helmet.

				PRESIDENT
		Grey, you read me?

				GENERAL GREY
			(filtered)
		Roger, Eagle One, our primary
		target has shifted course.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	General Grey is standing by the large map tracking the alien
	ships over the United States.

				PRESIDENT

		Where's it headed?

				GENERAL GREY
		I think our secret is out.
		They're headed right for us.

	INT. PRESIDENT'S PLANE - SAME

				GENERAL GREY
			(filtered)
		ETA thirty six minutes.

	The President gets a determined look in his eye.  He FIRES UP
	his engine.  Following his lead, engines ignite, canopies lock
	down and planes taxi to position.

	EXT. UPPER ATMOSPHERE - ALIEN ATTACKER - SAME

	The captured alien attacker soars higher and higher.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

	Slowly getting sick, David holds onto his "barf bag."

				STEVE
		You still with me?

	David nods sheepishly.  Steve's eyes go wide with wonder as
	the ship climbs to the edge of our atmosphere.

				STEVE
			(to himself)
		I've waited a long time for this.

	The ship begins to SHAKE, rattling harshly as it climbs.
	Through the window we SEE the blue sky EVAPORATE.  Slowly a
	field of STARS take its place.

	This is the moment Steve had wished for all his life.  He's
	not disappointed.  David, however, is not so thrilled.

	EXT. SPACE - STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

	Heading further into space, ZOOMING overhead.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

	Through the windshield we see a huge OBJECT floating in
	the distance, the moon behind it.

				DAVID
		That's it.  Head straight for it.

	But Steve gets distracted, something wrong with the controls.

				STEVE
		Something's happening.  It's not
		responding.

	David looks over at his laptop, connected to the ship's on
	board computers.  Th signal is ADJUSTING.

				DAVID
			(thrilled)
		I was counting on that.  They're
		bringing us in.

	EXT. BLUE SKIES - MORNING

	The President's plane leads thirty fighters in attack
	formation.

				PRESIDENT
		We have visual.

	RESERVE ANGLE - ALIEN SPACE CRAFT

	The fifteen mile wide space craft peeks over a mountain range
	headed straight for us.

				GENERAL GREY
			(filtered)
		Do not engage until we've
		confirmed the package has been
		delivered.

				PRESIDENT
		Roger.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	Constance is standing by Lt. Mitchell behind the Military
	cadre coordinating the battle.

				CONSTANCE
		What if that thing gets here
		before we can plant the virus?

				MITCHELL
		The entire compound is buried deep
		within the mountain.  It should
		give us some protection.

				CONSTANCE
		But what about all the people
		outside?

	Mitchell shoots her a worried look.  Quickly they both dash
	outside.

	EXT. MOTHER SHIP - SAME

	Steve and David's attacker flies towards the gigantic Mother
	Ship.  Hundreds of other attackers flow in and out of the
	Mother Ship through the many triangular portals.  Steve and
	David's attacker's drawn into one of them.

	INT. PORTAL SHAFT - MOTHER SHIP - SAME

	Caught in a stream of attackers, they flow through the portal
	shaft leading into this planet sized space craft.  They pass
	by enormous windows revealing the HUNDREDS OF ALIENS working
	within the Mother Ship.

	We spill out of the shaft and into a gigantic cavity
	stretching out beyond visibility.  Enormous TOWERS are
	scattered throughout.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - CONTINUOUS

	Neither can believe their eyes.  Staring out the front window
	they SEES...

	STEVE AND DAVID'S POV ALIEN TROOP PARADE GROUND

	Below them THOUSANDS OF ALIENS can be seen as they are marched
	into dozens of enormous TROOP CONTAINERS docked at the edges
	of the parade grounds.

				DAVID
		Must be thousands of them.  What
		are they doing?

				STEVE
		Looks like they're preparing the
		invasion.

	INT. DOCKING STATIONS - MOTHER SHIP - CONTINUOUS

	They pass the parade ground and head into the middle of this
	huge cavernous sphere, closing in on the many LANDINGS.
	Hundreds of attackers are docked at each one.

	In the center of the Landing are large BAY WINDOWS, inside is
	a kind of control tower.  We can SEE several ALIEN WORKERS
	through the glass.  Steve and David's attacker is heading
	straight towards them.

				STEVE
		This won't work.  They'll see
		before we can do anything.

	Lifting up another hand written card labeled "window," David
	pushes the button underneath.

				DAVID
		These things are fully equipped.
		Reclining bucket seats, power
		windows...

	A BLAST SHIELD lowers covering the window.

	Slowly Steve and David's attacker lowers onto large docking
	CLAMPS which LOCK ON, holding it in place.

				DAVID
		We're in!

	David starts typing frantically.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	Mitchell turns from one of the consoles to General Grey.

				MITCHELL
		He's uploading the virus.

				GENERAL GREY

		Eagle One...

	EXT. AREA 51 - BRENNON TRAILER - SAME

	Alicia struggles to drag out a large duffle bag.  Philip (the
	boy who brought the penicillin earlier) rushes over.

				PHILIP
		Let me get that.

	He grabs the bag for her.  Alicia smiles.  Miguel helps Troy
	down from the trailer.  As they rush away, Miguel turns to
	Philip.

				MIGUEL
		Where's Russell?

	ANGLE - HANGAR - ENTRANCE TO COMPOUND

	Constance, Jasmine and Mitchell are helping to usher the
	refugees into the compound.

				CONSTANCE
		Hurry, we've got to get everyone
		inside.

	Constance looks up and SEES off in the distance...

	THE ALIEN SPACE CRAFT

	Piercing the horizon, coming over the top of a distant
	mountain.  Headed this way.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

	David finishes typing.  The screen on his laptop flashes:
	UPLOAD COMPLETE.

				DAVID
		The virus is in.  All we can do
		now is pray.

	EXT. BLUE SKIES - AMERICAN FIGHTERS - SAME

				GENERAL GREY
			(filtered)
		Delivery complete.  Engage.

				PRESIDENT
		Roger.

	The fighter jets GUN IT and overtake the smaller planes in
	front of them.

	Below the President's plane the weapons bay door opens and a
	long range AMRAAM Missile DROPS DOWN, computes its target and
	DARTS OFF.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	Mitchell and General Grey move over to a monitor showing
	visual from the Present's Plane.  They SEE the missile
	moving towards target.

				GENERAL GREY
		Keep your fingers crossed.

	EXT. AMERICAN FIGHTERS - SAME

	The pilots watch nervously as the missile nears its target.

				PRESIDENT
		Come on, baby.

	ANGLE - AMRAAM MISSILE

	Just as it gets to the shield perimeter, the missile EXPLODES.
	The shields are still up.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	They watch the missile blow up harmlessly.  Deflated, General
	Grey grabs his mic.

				GENERAL GREY
		It didn't work.  Disengage.  Sir,
		get your people out of there.

	EXT. PRESIDENT'S PLANE - SAME

	The President is not ready to give up.

				PRESIDENT
		Not yet!

	Below his plane another MISSILE drops down, and DARTS OFF.

	ANGLE - MISSILE

	This one goes past the point of the previous explosion.  It
	moves in closer and closer.  Suddenly it HITS THE SIDE OF THE
	SHIP.  A HUGE EXPLOSION, rips off a part of the side of this
	immense ship.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	We SEE the explosion on the monitor.  Everyone in the room
	CHEERS.

				GENERAL GREY
		You did it!  A direct hit!

	EXT. BLUE SKIES - AMERICAN FIGHTERS - SAME

	The pilots are thrilled.

				PRESIDENT
		We're going in!  Squadron leaders,
		take point.

	The fighters break off into six group of five.  One by one,
	each fighter DROPS A MISSILE.  We follow DOZENS OF MISSILES on
	their way to the space craft.

	ANGLE - SPACE CRAFT

	The Attacker Bay doors open and DOZENS OF ALIEN ATTACKERS
	shoot out.  Spreading wide.

	Guided missiles EXPLODES as they hit the City Destroyer,
	damaging the outer hull.  The Attackers go after the American
	fighters.  The six groups split wide.  An aerial dog fight
	ensues.

	EXT. AREA 51 - REFUGEE CAMP - SAME

	Miguel searches for Russell as the refugees run for the
	hangar.

				MIGUEL
		Russell!

	Miguel gets swept up in the tide.  As the last of them enter
	the hangar, TWO ALIEN ATTACKERS arrive behind them, STRAFING
	the ground.  The rows of trailers homes EXPLODE one after
	another.

	ANGLE - ELEVATOR HALLWAY - BACK OF HANGAR

	Constance ushers the crowd into the elevator hallway.  Packed
	into the hallway together, they are panicked at the sound of
	the nearby explosions.  As the last one is safely inside,
	Constance turns back and SEES...

	CONSTANCE'S POV - HANGAR AND ATTACKERS

	The attackers FIRE and the front half of the hangar EXPLODES.
	Constance is KNOCKED back against the wall.  She activates the
	elevator and the room begins to SINK.

	As the hallway submerges, the entire hangar comes CRASHING
	DOWN behind them.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	Over monitors the General observes the aerial battle.  This
	room, too, ROCKS from the explosions.  The monitors FLICKER.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

	Steve struggles with the controls but is getting no where.

				DAVID
		Get us out of here!

				STEVE
		I can't shake her free.

	EXT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

	Though the attacker guns its engine, the CLAMPS below HOLD
	TIGHT.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

	David moves over to the computer to see if he can help.
	Suddenly the large window slowly begins to DROP DOWN.

				STEVE
		What're you doing?

				DAVID
		It's not me.  They're overriding
		the system.

	The blast shield continues to peel away.  David and Steve drop
	down below the dash, hiding from view.  As the view becomes
	unobstructed we SEE...

	POV - THROUGH WINDOW - THE LANDING

	Several Alien's looking across at us from the large bay
	window of the Landing's control tower.

				STEVE
		Damn!

	David leans from his hiding position and SEES several other
	alien attackers are moving in on them.  They are surrounded.

				DAVID
		Check and mate.

	INT. AREA 51 - RESEARCH FACILITY - SAME

	Like images from England during the blitzkrieg, the refugees
	are huddled on the floor, the lights FLICKERING and the muted
	sounds of distant EXPLOSIONS.  Miguel moves through the
	refugees, searching for Russell.

	A Yarmulke is unfolded.  As it is lifted we realize Moishe is
	putting it on.  He holds the hands with the people around him
	and begins to pray.  Nimziki moves next to Moishe.  Moishe
	takes his hand.

				NIMZIKI
		I'm not Jewish.

				MOISHE
		It's okay.

	ANGLE - PHILIP AND ALICIA

	As another bomb rocks the room, Alicia moves closer to Philip.

				ALICIA
		This could be our last night on
		Earth.  I don't want to die a
		virgin.

				PHILIP
		If we do, we'll both die virgins.
		But at last we'll be together.

	Alicia smiles, a nice guy at last.

	EXT. AREA 51 - SPACE SHIP - SAME

	The City Destroyer space ship is settling just above the
	compound as the American fighters circle it, chased by the
	attackers.  Below the SCHISM begins to open!

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	In all the commotion, no one notices as Miguel sneaks inside.

				OFFICER
		We're running out of missiles,
		Sir.  We're just not causing
		enough damage.

	EXT. PRESIDENT'S PLANE - SAME

				GENERAL GREY
			(filtered)
		They're getting ready to fire the
		big gun.  You're going to have to
		find a vulnerable spot, fast.

				PRESIDENT
		I've got an idea.  Keep 'em off my
		tail.

	Taking the advice, the President DIVES.  He's met by two
	flanking Fighters (EAGLES 9 & 2) as they cruise the underbelly
	of the City Destroyer.  Sure enough, the SCHISM is opening,
	preparing to fire the WALL OF DESTRUCTION.

				PRESIDENT
		Let's take 'em out before they
		take us out.

	The President locks the SCHISM hatchway into the center of his
	HUD (heads up display).  Just as he FIRES, Eagle 9 is BLOWN
	OUT OF THE SKY.  It rocks the President, sending his missile
	off target.

	Off balance, the missile hits just wide of the hatchway and
	EXPLODES, rocking the entire ship.

				PRESIDENT
		I'm out of missiles!  Eagle 2?

				EAGLE #2 PILOT
		I'm on it.

	But before he can target, his fighter EXPLODES.

	INT. HALLWAY - SAME

	The lights continue to flicker.  Jasmine grabs onto Dylan and
	Patricia, holding them tight.

	INT. WAR ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	On the monitor we SEE the SCHISM, and BRIGHT LIGHTS as several
	fighters fly past.

				GENERAL GREY
		We're out of time.  Get out of
		there!  Get as far away as you
		can.

	EXT. PRESIDENT'S FIGHTER - SAME

	Pissed, the President refuses to give up.

				PRESIDENT
		Doesn't anyone have any damned
		missiles left?!

				RUSSELL (O.S.)
		Sorry I'm late, Mr. President.

	The President spins and SEES darting out of the clouds...

	RUSSELL'S OLD BI-PLANE

	Russell ZOOMS past the President and alien attackers, barely
	missing their FIRE.

				PRESIDENT
			(filtered)
		Who is that?  What are you doing?

				RUSSELL
			(into mic)
		It's okay, Sir.  I'm packin'.

	We SEE he has a large MISSILES propped up in the seat behind
	him.  A light on it flashes ARMED.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

				RUSSELL
			(filtered)
		Just keep those guys off me for a
		few more seconds.

	Hearing his voice, Miguel is shocked.  He moves closer towards
	the monitors.

	EXT. CITY DESTROYER - SAME

	The remaining fighters lay down COVER FIRE for Russell's old
	bi-wing.  Russell heads directly TOWARDS THE SCHISM.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	Everyone is gripped to the screen as we see it get closer and
	closer to the closing bay doors.  Miguel is aghast.

				RUSSELL
			(filtered)
		Do me one favor...

				OFFICER
		Who is that guy?

				MIGUEL
		Russell!

	Miguel races over to the microphone, attempts to grab it.

				RUSSELL
			(filtered)
		...tell my children I love them
		very much.

	EXT. CITY DESTROYER - SCHISM - SAME

	Russell nears the SCHISM, a hail of alien firepower erupting
	around him.

				MIGUEL
			(filtered)
		Dad!  No!

	Russell smiles at b being called "Dad."

				RUSSELL
		I've got to, kid.  You were always
		better at taking care of them than
		I was anyways.

	Russell turns off his radio as he banks UPWARD towards the
	open SCHISM.  The climb is steep, and the bi-wing nearly
	stalls out.

	Suddenly the bright lights VANISH and the beam begins to form.

	Russell's bi-wing just makes it INSIDE THE OPEN SCHISM and
	disappears from view.

	The President and remaining fighters BANK AWAY, clearing.

	Suddenly, A GIGANTIC EXPLOSION, RIPS THROUGH THE CENTER OF THE
	SPACE CRAFT.  It's causing a CHAIN REACTION of explosion.

	Teetering, the entire space ship, turns away out of control.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	The room erupts in CHEERS.  Everyone, that is, except Miguel.

	EXT. MOUNTAIN RANGE - SAME

	Not far away from Area 51, the enormous craft is burning from
	the center outwards.  Suddenly it DROPS and COLLIDES with the
	mountain range, EXPLODING ON IMPACT.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	Intercepting the celebration, General Grey moves over to a
	radio technician.

				GENERAL GREY
		Let's get on the wire.  Tell every
		squadron around the world how to
		shoot those fuckers down.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ALIEN ATTACKER - SAME

	Sitting below the dash, Steve takes out the cigars, hands one
	to David.

				STEVE
		I guess there's nothing left to
		do.  Let's nuke 'em.

	David realizes they're both about to die.  He stares at the
	cigar.

				DAVID
			(re: cigar)
		Funny, I always thought things
		like these would kill me.

	They share a quick sober laugh.

				STEVE
		Nice meeting you.

				DAVID
		You as well.

	Steve lights his cigar, then lights David's.

				STEVE
		Ready?

	EXT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ALIEN ATTACKER - SAME

	Popping up from behind the dash, cigars in their mouths, Steve
	and David start waving "good-bye" like idiots.

	The Aliens in the tower don't know how to react.  The
	attackers move in for the kill.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

				STEVE
		Think they know what's coming?

	He reaches down to the black box we saw before and enters the
	launch code.

				DAVID
			(still waving)
		Not a chance in hell.

	EXT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

	Suddenly the missile ERUPTS from behind the manifold and
	BLASTS into the control tower, SHATTERING THE GLASS WINDOW.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	The missile SMASHES through the glass.  The atmosphere
	impeached, the aliens quickly succumb to the elements, chocking
	and dying.

	The missile BLASTS by WRECKING equipment until it LODGES into
	the back wall of the Landing tower.

	A small counter on the missile begins to count down 30:00,
	29:00, 28:00...

	EXT. DOCKING CLAMPS - SAME

	Rocked from the explosions, the docking clamps RELEASES and the
	ships jostles free.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

	Steve grabs the controls.

				STEVE
		We're loose!

				DAVID
		Doesn't matter.  Game's over.

				STEVE
		I don't hear no fat lady.

	Steve THROTTLES IT.  The craft JOLTS AWAY.

	EXT. DOCKING STATION - SAME

	Steve and David's attacker BLAST away, the other alien
	attackers follow in hot pursuit.

	The attackers FIRE.  Steve SWERVES avoiding the blasts as they
	race for the exit.

	INT. LANDING - CONTROL TOWER - SAME

	Grasping for breath, a dying Alien looks up at the wedged in
	nuclear missile.  The counter reads: 00:04, 00:03, 00:02.

	We get the feeling the Alien knows what's coming.

	INT. DOCKING BAY - SAME

	Steve and David's attacker just reaches the doorway as the
	center of the landing EXPLODES behind them.

	The enormous impact, rocks some of the lagging attackers off
	track.

	EXT. MOTHER SHIP - SAME

	Steve DARTS his attacker out from underneath the Mother Ship's
	belly.  A group of attackers FOLLOW.

	Just as the last of them exit the docking bay, a HUGE FIREBALL
	erupts behind them ripping through the Mother Ship.

	ANGLE - FARTHER AWAY

	ZOOMING towards us, Steve guides his ship away.  The Alien
	attackers in hot pursuit.  Behind them we SEE the ENTIRE
	MOTHER SHIP EXPLODE.

	The immense EXPLOSION GROWS OUTWARDS coming right at us.  The
	ATTACKERS are GOBBLED UP as the EXPLOSION WIDENS.  Quickly the
	explosion gains ground on Steve and David.

	ANGLE - STEVE AND DAVID'S SHIP

	Like a loose board caught in the surf, Steve and David's ship
	rides the edge of the explosion, getting knocked END OVER END.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER

	Tumbling ass over tea kettle, David and Steve are ROCKED in
	their seats.  Steve battles to regain control of the ship.

	EXT. STEVE AND DAVID'S SHIP

	The mammoth fireball reaches the outer edge of its zenith.
	Steve and David's ship is SPIT OUT, tumbling down towards
	EARTH.

	EXT. AREA 51 - TARMAC - SAME

	The fighters are returning home.  Crowd RACE out of the ruins
	of the smoldering compound to greet them, cheering their
	arrival.

	THE PRESIDENT'S PLANE

	The President is climbing out as General Grey rushes to his
	aid.  Behind him, Jasmine leads Dylan and Patricia, who breaks
	free and RUSHES to her father.  The President sweeps her up in
	his arms as Jasmine approaches.

				JASMINE
			(to General Grey)
		Any word from Steve?

	Behind her, Constance rushes over, the same thing on her mind.
	Before he can answer they HEAR a ROAR above.  They all become
	silent as they turn and look to the skies.

	ANGLE - BLUE SKIES - FIREBALL

	The FIREBALL COMET is rapidly shooting down towards us.
	Suddenly BURSTING OUT OF THE FLAMES, Steve and David's ship
	DARTS DOWN.

	Just over the heads of the cheering crowds, Steve and David's
	ship ZOOMS overhead, disappearing out of sight.

	EXT. DRY LAKE - DESERT - MINUTES LATER

	Several army JEEPS race across the arid desert floor.  As they
	WHIP past we see they are headed towards a gigantic BLACK
	PLUME OF SMOKE in the distance.
	
	ANGLE PLUME OF SMOKE

	The Jeeps SKID to a halt.  Jasmine and Constance are the first
	to leap off the Jeeps.

	Steve and David walk towards us, cigars in their mouths.
	Jasmine races over to him.

				JASMINE
		You scared the hell out of me.

				STEVE
		Yeah, but what an entrance!

				JASMINE
		Dick-weed.

				STEVE
		Butt-munch.

	Constance comes running up to David, hugs him tightly.

				CONSTANCE
		Are you all right?

				DAVID
		Did it work?

				CONSTANCE
		You bet it did.

	She hugs him.  They kiss.

	ANGLE - STEVE AND JASMINE

	Behind them Dylan, Patricia, the President and General Grey
	come walking over.  The President and General Grey approach.

				PRESIDENT
		We're getting reports from all
		over.  Their ships are going down!

	As they begin to celebrate, they look up to the sky.

	GROUP POV - BRILLIANT LIGHTS IN THE SKIES

	The debris from the Mother Ship explosion enters the
	atmosphere like thousands of SHOOTING STARS.  It's an
	incredible sight.

	The group stares happily at the show in the sky.  Steve takes
	Dylan by the hand.

				STEVE
		Didn't I promise you fireworks?

	Everyone stares in wonder at the beautiful lights.

          SPACE.
                         
          But not the dark lonely corner of it we're used to. This is
          a glittering inferno -- the center of a distant galaxy.
                         
          Suddenly, something TEARS past at incredible speed: a NEUTRON
          STAR. It SMASHES headlong through everything it encounters...
          planets, stars. Can anything stop this juggernaut?
                         
          Yes. Something looms at the heart of the galaxy, hidden
          inside the blinding starlight, a dark flaw in the fabric of
          existence itself: a BLACK HOLE.
                         
          The neutron star is pulled into the black hole's swirl,
          spiraling closer and closer to destruction. Finally, it
          contacts the hole's edge and EXPLODES.
                         
          The EXPLOSION is so powerful that it sends shock waves into
          the fabric of space-time itself. We ride one of these waves,
          racing back out from the black hole.
                         
          Suddenly, a portion of the wave disappears down a crystal-
          like hole, emerging in a much darker region of the universe --
          a backwater that, as the wave races past a giant red planet
          with a distinctive eye, we recognize as our own.
                         
          The wave, now just an infinitesimal ripple, finally reaches
          our blue planet. It drops into our atmosphere over North
          America, toward the high desert east of the Cascades, and
          through the roof of a nondescript warehouse.
                         
          The wave tickles the atoms in the steel shell of a vacuum
          chamber, then dances a tiny jig with a laser beam reflected
          in a heavy piece of glass.
                         
          The wave shoots back out of the building and disappears in
          the fractal branches of a tumbleweed resting against a
          concrete tube that stretches for miles in the desert.
                         
          An SUV speeds past the tumbleweed and we follow it till it
          parks at another plain-looking building at the opposite end
          of the tube. A MAN climbs out of the SUV.

          The man lets himself into a large room that looks like Mission
          Control. He pours himself a cup of coffee. It is the weekend
          and the place is empty. No one has been there to see the
          displays flashing a distinctive shape -- a pulse followed by
          a series of echoes.
                         
          The man looks up at the screen, then DROPS his cup of coffee.

          INT. LIGO OFFICES, CALTECH, PASADENA -- DAY
                         
          The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory
          headquarters at Caltech is a frenzy of activity. POSTDOCS
          and RESEARCHERS huddle around monitors and printouts, arguing.
                         
          ANSEN, 60s, the director of LIGO, walks through the frenzy.
          A postdoc hands him a printout: a pulse followed by echoes.
                         
          INT. LIGO DIRECTOR'S OFFICE, CALTECH -- DAY
                         
          Ansen steps into the relative calm of a large, sunlit office,
          which overlooks a grassy stretch of Caltech's campus.
                         
          His ASSISTANT, 30s, is on the phone, on hold. He looks up
          at Ansen as he enters.
                         
                          ASSISTANT
           I'm on hold with the INS.
                          (COVERS MICROPHONE)
           Don't you think we should double
           check the triangulation before we

                          ANSEN
           We have double checked it.
                         
          Someone finally picks up the line.
                         
                          ASSISTANT
           Yes. I'm trying to reach-

           No, I don't think you understand how
           serious this is.
                          (PAUSE)
           Because if you did, we'd be having
           this conversation in person.
                         
          He listens for a moment, then hangs up the phone, confused.
                         
                          ANSEN
           What did they say?
                         
                          ASSISTANT
           They said we should look out the
           window.
                         
          Ansen steps to the window and looks out:
                         
          In the courtyard below, coeds are scrambling to get out of
          the way as a military helicopter sets down in the middle of
          the quad and dozens of ARMED FEDERAL AGENTS converge on his
          building.

          Ansen sits, alone, on one side of a conference table.
                         
          The other side is filled with GOVERNMENT MEN -- NSA mostly,
          some DIA. The door opens and his assistant steps in. Armed
          guards pat him down, then shove him into a seat.
                         
                          ANSEN
           Is that really necessary?
                         
          One of the NSA agents leans forward.
                         
                          NSA AGENT
           You've been complaining for years
           that the government doesn't take
           your project seriously enough, Doctor.
                          (SMILES)
           You can't have it both ways.
                         
          Ansen motions to his assistant, who turns on a projector.
          On-screen, we see the familiar pulse and echoes.
                         
                          ANSEN
           Yesterday morning, our facility in
           Hanford identified this signal: a
           neutron star colliding with a
           supermassive black hole. We went
           through the last year's data and
           triangulated the source.
                         
          The pulse is translated into a crude animatic of a neutron
          star circling into the black hole.
                         
                          NSA AGENT
           We know that, Doctor. What we don't
           know is why, according to your
           numbers, this event took place right
           here in our own solar system.
                         
          Suddenly, the image overlays the sun, the earth, and the
          rest of our solar system around the black hole.
                         
                          ANSEN
           It didn't. Because if it had we'd
           all be dead by now.
                         
          On-screen, Jupiter, then the Earth and the inner planets are
          consumed by the black hole. Only the sun survives, pulled
          into orbit around its new master.
                         
                          ANSEN (CONT'D)
           Which leaves only one explanation:

           corner of the universe. The black
           hole is on the far side.
                         
          On-screen, the black hole system is removed to a distant
          corner, connected to ours by a tunnel through space-time. A
          gravity wave from the collision travels through the tunnel.
                         
                          NSA AGENT
           I've read your book, Doctor. You
           said that wormholes are impossible.
                         
                          ANSEN
           There is nothing quite as satisfying
           as being proved utterly wrong.
                          (SMILES)
           I said that a wormhole couldn't exist
           naturally. Not for more than a few
           billionths of a second. It would
           have to be... stabilized.
                         
                          NSA AGENT
           Stabilized by what?
                         
          Ansen pauses, unsure. His assistant steps in to his defense.
                         
                          ASSISTANT
           We don't have any way to answer that
           question.
                         
                          NSA AGENT
                          (IGNORES HIM)
           You're not under peer review here,
           Doctor. I don't care about your
           reputation. I need to know how that
           thing got there. Now.
                         
          Ansen finally speaks up.
                         
                          ANSEN
           If you're worried about an invasion,
           I would start drafting the articles
           of surrender.
                          (SMILES)
           Whoever they are, if they can build
           a wormhole, they could erase us in
           the blink of an eye. Luckily, that
           also means we have nothing they could
           be interested in.
                         
                          NSA AGENT
           Then why is it there?

                          ANSEN
           I don't know. Maybe it's an
           invitation. A chance to commune
           with an advanced species.
                         
          The assistant, embarrassed, looks down. The agent notices.
                         
                          NSA AGENT
           You don't agree?
                         
                          ASSISTANT
                          (DELICATE)
           No. I don't think we can assume an
           alien intelligence built the wormhole.
                          (CHANGES TACK)
           But the opportunity it represents is
           incredible. We could explore parts
           of the universe we never dreamt of
           reaching in our lifetimes.
                         
          The agent exchanges a look with one of his colleagues, who
          steps out of the room.

           You can't do that. The Europeans

          He steps out the door, leaving the men alone. The assistant,
          outraged, turns back to his boss.
                         
                          ASSISTANT
           They can't keep this a secret. You
           know that. Sooner or later...

          road, smoke pouring out of its open hood. A dozen MEN in
          BASEBALL UNIFORMS are standing around the front of the bus.
                         
          A battered PICKUP pulls up, and a MAN, 30s, gets out, leaving
          his two SONS in the car. This is COOPER. He joins the
          ballplayers staring at the lifeless diesel engine.

          Cooper steps to the engine compartment.
                         
          The ballplayer notices Cooper's two boys, TOM, 15, and MURPH,

          After a moment under the hood, Cooper signals to the driver,
          who tries the engine. It turns over once, then STARTS.

          60s, have a row to themselves behind the dugout.
                         
          Murph offers his grandpa some popcorn.
                         
                          DONALD
           Popcorn at a ball game is unnatural.
           I want a hot dog.
           8.
                         
                          MURPH
                          (CONFUSED)
           What's a hot dog?
                         
          Suddenly, play stops on the field below as the players and
          fans look up at the night sky:
                         
          A bright blue streak is tearing across it. It's beautiful.
                         
                          TOM
           Is that a comet, Dad?
                         
                          COOPER
           (shakes his head)
           Satellite. Big one. Probably
           Chinese.
                         
          Everyone watches the fireworks as the satellite burns up in
          the upper atmosphere.
                         
          After a moment, play resumes -- it's a pretty show, but
          everyone has seen it plenty of times before.
                         
          Down on the field, the Dodgers' catcher misses an easy pop
          fly and the Yankees load the bases. Donald looks disgusted.
                         
          INT. COOPER'S TRUCK -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper guides his truck along a potholed road. His father-
          in-law is riding shotgun; the boys are sleeping in the back.
                         
                          DONALD
           Those clowns would get their asses
           handed to them by the ballplayers I
           grew up watching.
                         
                          COOPER
           You ruin it for the boys when you
           talk like that.
                         
                          DONALD
           I'm not doing my grandkids any favors
           by lying to them. They're growing
           up watching lousy baseball.
                         
                          COOPER
           They didn't have any baseball at all
           when I was a kid.
                         
          That shuts the old man up for now. They drive on in silence.
                         
                          CUT TO:
           9.
                         
          EXT. FARMHOUSE -- MORNING
                         
          The sun is gently landing on the horizon, painting the sea
          of corn around Cooper's modest house gold. Cooper walks out
          of his house, still eating his breakfast.
                         
          Donald is on the porch, looking at a black clouds of smoke
          in the distance. The neighboring fields are BURNING.
                         
                          DONALD
           Nelson's burning up his crops. Found
           some of the blight on the okra.
                         
          Cooper watches the men walking through the fields, setting
          fire to the crop.
                         
                          COOPER
           I thought okra wasn't susceptible.
                         
                          DONALD
                          (SHRUGS)
           Better safe than sorry.
           (looks at him)
           You've got to take the boys to school.
                         
                          COOPER
           Something wrong with your truck?
                         
                          DONALD
                          (SMILES)
           Parent-teacher conference day.
                         
          Cooper bends his head in dismay.
                         
                          DONALD (CONT'D)
           Be nice to Murph's teacher. She's
           single, you know.
                         
                          COOPER
           What does that have to do with
           anything?
                         
                          DONALD
           We're supposed to be repopulating
           the earth. Gotta pull your weight.
           Besides, the boys could do with a
           woman in their lives.
                         
          The boys run out of the house and pile into the truck. Cooper
          pulls away before Donald can continue.
                         
          EXT. ROAD -- DAY
                         
          Cooper weaves the car along a dirt road. The kids are arguing
          over an ancient comic book in the back seat.
           10.
                         
          Cooper turns around to break it up.
                         
          BANG -- one of the tires blows out in a foot-deep pothole.
                         
          EXT. ROADSIDE -- DAY
                         
          Cooper examines the flattened tire. Looks at his older son.
                         
                          COOPER
           Get the spare, Tom.
                         
                          TOM
           That is the spare.
                         
                          COOPER
           All right. We'll use the patch kit.
                         
          He moves to the back of the truck. Murph suddenly looks
          very glum.
                         
                          MURPH
           I... I think the patch kit might not
           be there...
           (off his look)
           Because I was using it for my bike.
                         
          Cooper looks down at the dirt. Sighs.
                         
                          COOPER
           Murph's law.
                         
                          MURPH
                          (CONFUSED)
           What's that?
                         
          Tom snorts with laughter. Turns to his dad.
                         
                          TOM
           The kid doesn't even know what he
           was named after...
                         
          Cooper shoots Tom a look -- enough.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           Murph's law means what can go wrong
           will go wrong.
                         
          Murph, looking hurt, walks off. Cooper turns to his son.
                         
                          COOPER
           Find something to patch it with.
                         
                          TOM
           How am I supposed to do that?
           11.
                         
                          COOPER
           Figure it out. I'm not always going
           to be here to help you.
                         
          Cooper leaves Tom to catch up with his younger son, who is
          looking out over the river.
                         
                          MURPH
           Is that really why I'm named Murph,
           dad?
                         
                          COOPER
           Listen to me. Murph's law doesn't
           mean that. It means what can happen
           will happen. All kinds of things.
           Good or bad. And that's the way you
           want it to be.
                         
                          MURPH
           Why?
                         
                          COOPER
           Because if nothing ever happened to
           you then you wouldn't learn anything.
                         
          Murph is staring off into the distance. He's heard something.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Murph?
                         
          Then Cooper hears it, too. A LOW RUMBLING SOUND. Cooper
          looks out over the river. Then he turns back and tackles
          his son to the ground.
                         
          Suddenly, a MASSIVE AIRPLANE SOARS overhead, so close they
          can almost touch it. It bounces the truck on its suspension,
          then soars off over the fields behind them.
                         
          Cooper grabs Murph and races back to the truck. He pulls a
          laptop and an antenna made out of a Pringles can out of the
          back of the truck. He hands the laptop and antenna to Murph.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Get in.
                         
          Tom is still standing by the side of the road, wrestling
          with the jack.
                         
                          TOM
           What about the tire?
                         
          INT. TRUCK -- MOMENTS LATER
                         
          The truck is SMASHING through the cornfields as fast as Cooper
          can push it on three good tires.
           12.
                         
          Murph is hurriedly firing up the laptop and connecting it to
          the directional antenna.
                         
          Cooper is straining to see through the cornstalks, scanning
          the horizon.
                         
                          TOM
                          OVER THERE-
                         
          To the right, the dark shape of the Russian drone appears,
          flying low over the fields. Cooper jerks the wheel--
                         
          EXT. RIVER -- DAY
                         
          The truck BURSTS out of the corn and SPLASHES across the
          river and into an old, abandoned suburban housing development
          in the valley below, planted over with corn.
                         
          Half a mile in front of them, the Russian drone is still
          hugging the ground. It has impossibly long, skinny wings,
          like an old U-2 surveillance plane, but no cockpit. The
          tops of its wings are covered in black solar cells.
                         
          INT. TRUCK -- DAY
                         
          Murph is fiddling with the computer. His older brother takes
          the computer from him and fires up emulation software.
                         
                          COOPER
           It's a Chinese military drone. Solar
           cells could power an entire farm.
                          (TO TOM)
           Take the wheel.
                         
          Cooper hands Murph the Pringles can antenna.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Keep it pointed right at it, OK?
                         
          Murph nods. Tom takes the wheel as his dad works the laptop,
          trying to communicate with the huge Russian drone. The screen
          fills with Cyrillic characters.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Faster, Tom. I'm losing it.
                         
          Tom WEAVES the truck at speed through the old, curved streets
          of the development, past oversized suburban mansions planted
          over with corn.
                         
          They round a corner and come face-to-face with a robot
          harvester. Tom jerks the wheel to avoid it.
                         
          BANG -- the truck loses a wing mirror against the flank of
          the combine.
           13.
                         
          EXT. SUBURBAN DEVELOPMENT -- DAY
                         
          Tom guides the truck from street to street, trying to chart
          a straight path across the fields. The truck BOUNCES as it
          SMASHES through an old picket fence.
                         
          Ahead, the drone is soaring, banking, pulling away.
                         
          INT. TRUCK -- DAY
                         
          Cooper is still trying to hack into the drone's control
          circuitry as they leave the development behind and begin to
          climb into the foothills of the Sierras.
                         
          EXT. RIDGELINE, HILLS -- DAY
                         
          Tom guides the truck along the spine of the hills. The drone
          soars overhead, making for the white tips of the Sierras.
                         
          INT. TRUCK -- DAY
                         
          Cooper is oblivious to the picturesque surroundings as he
          concentrates on the laptop.
                         
                          TOM
                          (UNSURE)
           Dad?
                         
                          COOPER
           Almost got it. Don't slow down.
                         
          In front of them, Tom and his brother watch as the drone
          plummets from view.
                         
                          TOM
           DAD.
                         
          Cooper looks up. Ahead, the trail disappears as the edge of
          the hills falls away -- it's a three hundred-foot drop.
                         
          Tom locks up the brakes.
                         
          EXT. RIDGELINE, HILLS -- DAY
                         
          The truck skids to a halt inches from a precipitous drop.
                         
          Cooper climbs out, holding the laptop. Murph climbs out
          next to him, still pointing the Pringles can.
                         
                          TOM
           We lost it.
                         
                          COOPER
                          (SMILING)
           No we didn't.
           14.
                         
          Suddenly, the drone SOARS back over them. Cooper types a
          couple keys and then moves his fingers across the trackpad.
          The huge drone banks and turns in response.
                         
          As the boys watch, Cooper sends the drone soaring high over
          them, banking and soaring along the tree-lined sides of the
          valley, light glinting from the black panels on its back.
          It's a beautiful sight.
                         
          Cooper crouches next to Murph.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           You want to give it a whirl?
                         
          Murph looks at his dad, wide-eyed. He takes the laptop and
          moves his fingers gingerly across the pad.
                         
          In response, the massive plane banks into a tight turn in
          the valley below.
                         
          For a moment, Murph is in pure heaven, sending the drone
          dancing through the valley below.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Set her down in the valley -- there,
           next to the river.
                         
          Murph leads the plane in a figure eight and then begins
          guiding it into a gentle landing in the valley floor below.
                         
          EXT. ABANDONED GOLF COURSE, VALLEY FLOOR -- DAY
                         
          The truck limps along the overgrown fairway of a long-defunct
          golf course towards the massive hulk of the Russian drone,
                         
          Cooper and the boys climb down. The valley is silent save
          for the truck's engine WHEEZING and SPUTTERING as it cools.
                         
          Cooper runs a hand over the smooth carbon flank of the drone.
                         
                          TOM
           How long do you think it's been up
           there, Dad?
                         
                          COOPER
           Chinese mission control went down
           same as us, twenty years ago. It's
           been up there ever since.
                         
                          TOM
           What was it doing flying so low?
                         
          Cooper reads the information pouring into his laptop.
           15.
                         
                          COOPER
           It was looking for something.
           Intercepted some kind of signal.
                          (SHRUGS)
           It's been at eighty thousand feet.
           Sun probably cooked its brain.
                         
          Cooper runs his hand along the flank till he finds an access
          patch. He pulls out a crowbar and pries open the hatch.
          Inside, surrounded by a nest of liquid cooling tubes, is a
          small black module -- the drone's auto-pilot.
                         
          Cooper looks down at Murph, who is standing at his elbow.
                         
                          MURPH
           What are you going to do with it?
                         
                          COOPER
           Reprogram it. Give it something
           socially responsible to do like drive
           a combine or a tractor.
                         
                          MURPH
                          (QUIET)
           Couldn't we just let it go? It's
           not hurting anyone.
                         
          Cooper looks down at his son. Good kid.
                         
                          COOPER
           We need all the help we can get,
           Murph. This thing has to adapt,
           just like the rest of us.
                         
          Cooper gently pries the control module out.
                         
          EXT. COUNTY SCHOOL -- DAY
                         
          It's a small school, so all the kids and parents waiting in
          front know exactly who's driving the pickup truck with half
          of a Russian spy plane hanging out of the bed as it pulls up.
                         
          INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE, COUNTY SCHOOL -- DAY
                         
          Cooper is ushered into the office. The PRINCIPAL, 40s, an
          efficient-looking man, shakes his hand.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL
           Good to see you, Mr. Cooper. This
           is Ms. Kelly, Murph's teacher.
                         
          Cooper smiles at Ms. KELLY, 30s, attractive.
           16.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL (CONT'D)
           So we've gotten Tom's score back.
           Congratulations. He's going to make
           an excellent farmer.
                         
          The principal slides a carbon copy across the desk to Cooper,
          who looks taken aback.
                         
                          COOPER
           What about college?
                         
                          PRINCIPAL
           The University of California only
           accepts a few hundred students a
           year, Mr. Cooper. You have to be
           realistic.
                         
                          COOPER
           You're ruling out college for him
           now? He's only fifteen.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL
           I'm sorry. I'm afraid Tom's score
           simply isn't high enough.
                         
                          COOPER
           What are you, about a 36-inch waist?
                          (BEAT)
           30-inch inseam?
                         
                          PRINCIPAL
           I'm not sure I see--
                         
                          COOPER
           You're telling me you need two numbers
           to measure your own ass, but just
           one to measure my son's future?
                         
          Ms. Kelly stifles a laugh, then, with a look from the
          principal, takes on the appropriate look of offense.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL
           I understand you're a well-educated
           man, Mr. Cooper. A scientist?
                         
                          COOPER
           Engineer.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL
           Frankly, the world doesn't need any
           more engineers. We didn't run out
           of trains or television sets or
           satellites.
                          (BEAT)
           We ran out of food.
           17.
                         
          Cooper leans back. He's not going to win this one.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL (CONT'D)
           The world needs farmers, Mr. Cooper.
           And I'm sure your son Tom is going
           to make a fine one.
                          (SMILES BENIGNLY)
           We're a caretaker generation. But
           things are getting better. Maybe
           your grandchildren will be able to
           attend college.
                         
          Cooper looks down, swallowing his anger.
                         
                          COOPER
           Are we done?
                         
                          PRINCIPAL
           One more thing. Ms. Kelly here says
           that Murph brought a book to school
           about the lunar landings.
                         
          He slides an old textbook with a picture of a rocket on the
          cover across the desk to Cooper.
                         
                          COOPER
           One of my old textbooks. Murph liked
           the pictures.
                         
           MS. KELLY
           This is one of the old federal
           textbooks. We've replaced them with
           corrected versions.
                         
                          COOPER
           Corrected?
                         
           MS. KELLY
           The new textbooks explain that the
           Apollo lunar missions were faked in
           order to bankrupt the Soviet Union.
                         
                          COOPER
           You don't believe we went to the
           moon?
                         
           MS. KELLY
           I believe it was a brilliant piece
           of propaganda. The Soviets spent
           years trying to build rockets and
           other useless machines.
                         
                          COOPER
           "Useless machines"?
           18.
                         
          Cooper looks to the Principal for help. None is forthcoming.
                         
           MS. KELLY
           Yes, Mr. Cooper. The kind of
           wastefulness and excess that the
           20th century represented. Your
           children would be better off learning
           about this planet, rather than reading
           fantasies about leaving it.
                         
          Cooper is silent for a long moment.
                         
                          COOPER
           One of those useless machines they
           used to make was called an MRI. If
           we had any of them left the doctors
           might have been able to find the
           cyst in my wife's brain before she
           died, rather than afterwards. And
           then my kids could have been raised
           by two parents, instead of me and
           their pain-in-the-ass grandfather.
                         
          Ms. Kelly's face falls, ashen. Cooper swallows his anger.
          Most of it, anyway.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           You ever consider the best thing for
           the world and humanity might have
           been for us to part company?
                         
          Cooper gets up to leave.
                         
          INT. TRUCK, COUNTY SCHOOL PARKING LOT -- DAY
                         
          Cooper climbs into the truck, trying to hold it together.
          He PUNCHES the wheel.
                         
          The radio KEYS to life. He ignores it. Sits for a moment
          in misery. Finally he picks up the handset.
                         
           CB OPERATOR (O.S.)
           Got a call from Riggs, down in
           Galveston. Says some of the tractors
           you built him went haywire last night.
                         
                          COOPER
           Just tell him to power down the
           controllers for a couple minutes.
                         
           CB OPERATOR (O.S.)
           I did. He wants you to come down in
           person anyway. Says he found
           something you should take a look at.
           19.
                         
          Cooper stares at the wheel. Shakes his head in frustration.
                         
          EXT. AIRSTRIP -- DAY
                         
          Cooper pulls his truck up to a grimy-looking hangar. Pulls
          a tarp off of an ancient Piper Cub. Checks it over.
                         
          INT. PIPER CUB -- DAY
                         
          Cooper guides the plane along a long sliver of deserted beach.
          The radio crackles to life.
                         
                          COOPER

           sovereign nation of Texas.
                         
          Coop hangs up the radio. Banks the plane inland.
                         
          EXT. GULF COAST -- DAY
                         
          Below, a combine harvester fights its way up the dunes, trying
          to reach the beach, its wheels struggling for traction in
          the soft sand.
                         
          A MAN waves up at Cooper's plane as it circles overhead.
                         
          Cooper lands the plane on a deserted roadway. Jumps down.
                         
          He intercepts one of the combines as it trundles past, trying
          to reach the dunes. He pops open the cabin.
                         
          Inside is a mess of wires hooked into an auto-pilot not unlike
          the one he ripped out of the drone. He checks the fault
          code and resets the computer.
                         
          The man jogs over to meet him.
                         
                          RIGGS
           Thanks for coming down. Half of 'em
           took off last night, looking for
           something.
           (points to dunes)
           Looks like they found it, too. I
           thought you were the man to see it.
                         
          Riggs starts walking up the dune. Cooper follows.
                         
          Below, on the beach, a dozen more combines and other farming
          vehicles are lined up at the tideline, warm gulf water lapping
          at their metal flanks. They are circling a deep crater.
           20.
                         
          As they watch, an ancient autonomous SUB BEACHES itself,
          trying to reach the crater.
                         
          EXT. CRATER'S EDGE, BEACH -- DAY
                         
          Cooper steps between the waiting machines and peers down
          into the crater.
                         
          At the very bottom is a ROUND BLACK BALL, about a foot across --
          the same object we saw punch a hole in the side of a
          satellite. Every few seconds, it emits a distinctive CHIRP.
                         
          Cooper checks his rad meter. A tiny reading -- non-lethal.
          He takes off his watch and hands it to Riggs. Then he slides
          down into the hole.
                         
          The probe CHIRPS as Cooper slides down on top of it. He
          rubs a hand across its smooth composite bulk.
                         
                          RIGGS
                          (FROM ABOVE)
           You think it's an alien?
                         
          Cooper wipes sand off of the object, revealing the faint,
          familiar outline etched into the side of the probe:
                         
          The stars and stripes of the old federal government.
                         
                          COOPER
           Not exactly.
                         
          EXT. CRATER'S EDGE, BEACH -- DAY
                         
          Using a rope and a winch, Cooper hauls the blackened probe
          out of the crater and onto the beach.
                         
          Cooper hefts it up and carries it to the back of his plane.
                         
                          COOPER
           Space probe. Never seen one like
           it, though. Looks like it's been to
           hell and back.
                         
          The probe CHIRPS as Cooper belts it into the back.
                         
                          RIGGS
           How do you think it wound up here?
                         
                          COOPER
           Lost, I guess. Guidance satellites
           would have been shot down by the
           Chinese twenty years ago.
                         
          Cooper looks at the probe for a second, admiring its form.
           21.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          Donald is pouring a bottle of corn beer into a bubbling vat
          of chowder. He turns to watch Cooper work, amused.
                         
          The probe has been clamped to the kitchen table. Cooper
          works at the blackened case with a BLOWTORCH. Cooper gives
          up -- the torch hasn't made a scratch. The probe CHIRPS.
                         
                          COOPER
           Well I don't know what the hell it's
           made of, but I can't crack it open.
                         
                          DONALD
           Good. Clear it off the table so I
           can serve dinner.
                         
          Tom and Murph walk in. Murph's got another black eye.
                         
                          DONALD (CONT'D)
           What happened this time?
                         
                          MURPH
           I got suspended. Paul said anyone
           who believed we went to the moon was
           an idiot. So I hit him.
                         
                          COOPER
           Good boy. Hand me the scanner.
                         
          Murph hands his dad a defibrillator he's modified for the
          purpose. He attaches the shock pads to the sides of the
          probe and turns on the power.
                         
          Numbers flash across the screen. Cooper hits a button on
          the controls and it PULSES.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Here we go. Standard NASA encryption.
           Memory's been damaged. Just noise.
           Hold on. I've got something.
                         
          Cooper unplugs a monitor from his computer and plugs it into
          the defibrillator. After a moment, an image fills the screen:
                         
          An ICE-COVERED PLANET nestled in the center of a system
          impossibly dense with stars. Murph stares, transfixed.
                         
                          MURPH
           Where is that, dad?
                         
                          COOPER
           I don't know.
                         
          Cooper looks at the probe.
           22.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Where the hell did you come from?
                         
          Cooper shrugs. Turns off the monitor.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           We'll take it down to Tyson's tomorrow
           and have it melted down. Might be
           some copper inside.
                         
                          MURPH
           But what about its mission? What
           about the information onboard?
                         
                          COOPER
           There's no one for it to report to.
           NASA is all gone. I'm sorry, son.
           It got home too late.
                         
          Donald pulls his chowder off the boil and slides the pot
          unceremoniously onto the table.
                         
          INT. DINING ROOM -- NIGHT
                         
          The boys have gone to bed. Cooper and Donald are alone at
          the table. Donald hands Cooper another beer.
                         
                          DONALD
           I heard your meeting at the school
           didn't go so well.
                         
          Cooper shakes his head in disgust.
                         
                          COOPER
           Maybe it's better for everyone to
           forget what they did back then.
           Reminds us how far we've fallen.
                         
                          DONALD
           (looks down,)
           When I was kid, it felt like they
           made something new every day. Some
           gadget or idea.
                          (SMILES)
           Like every day was Christmas.
                          (BEAT)
           But we made a lot of mistakes. Six
           billion people. Just try to imagine
           that. Every last one of them trying
           to have it all.
                         
          Donald rolls the bottle of beer in his hands.
           23.
                         
                          DONALD (CONT'D)
           The truth is this world isn't that
           bad. In a lot of ways its better.
           Tom will be all right, whether he
           goes to college or not.
                         
                          COOPER
           It doesn't bother me that he can't
           go. It bothers me that he doesn't
           care.
                         
                          DONALD
           Tom isn't the problem. He fits in
           this world just fine. You're the
           one who doesn't fit, Coop. You don't
           belong here. You were born forty
           years too late, or forty years too
           early -- I don't know. My daughter
           knew it, god bless her. And your
           kids know it, too.
                         
          Donald drains his beer. Walks to the screen door. Stops,
          one hand on the frame.
                         
                          DONALD (CONT'D)
           You were good at something and you
           never got a chance to do anything
           with it. And I'm sorry, Coop. But
           that's not your kids' fault.
                         
          Donald pushes out the screen door.
                         
          Cooper looks at his beer. The probe CHIRPS.
                         
          INT. BEDROOM, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper flops down on his bed, fully clothed, exhausted. He
          stares up at the ceiling. This is his life.
                         
          INT. BEDROOM, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          The air is filled with a PIERCING NOISE.
                         
          Cooper BOLTS upright. Stumbles out the door.
                         
          INT. HALLWAY, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper's boys are in the hallway, exhausted. Cooper, holding
          a baseball bat, makes his way down the stairs.
                         
          Cooper uses the bat to open the kitchen door.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper steps in, Murph watching from behind him.
           24.
                         
          The probe is clamped to the table, the chirp replaced with a
          DEAFENING SCREAM.
                         
          Cooper, holding his ears, moves closer to the probe. He
          hits it with the paddles. No result.
                         
          He SMASHES it with the bat. Nothing. He HITS it AGAIN and
          AGAIN. Finally, the clamps break off chunks of the table
          and the probe slams to the ground and ROLLS toward the front
          door. As it rolls, it STOPS SHRIEKING.
                         
          Cooper and the others watch it roll toward the door. It
          stops at the wall. After a second, it begins SHRIEKING AGAIN.
                         
          Cooper grabs it and rolls it toward the front door. Once
          again, the movement shuts it up.
                         
          EXT. PORCH, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper and his boys roll the probe out of the front door.
          It BUMPS down the front steps and comes to rest in the dirt.
          After a moment, the unholy RACKET starts up again.
                         
          Cooper keeps rolling it, but it doesn't seem to help. Murph
          looks up, sees the stars overhead.
                         
                          MURPH
           Try a different direction.
                         
          As they roll the probe in a circle, its SHRIEK stops, then
          picks up again. Cooper zeroes in on the direction that keeps
          it quiet -- southwest -- and pushes it along in the dirt.
                         
                          COOPER
           It's a fail-safe. It's going to
           annoy us into taking it home.
                         
          Cooper stops rolling the probe and, after a moment, it begins
          SHRIEKING again.
                         
                          TOM
           What are we going to do?
                         
          Cooper gets a rope.
                         
                          COOPER
           We're going to get some sleep.
                         
          He begins tying the rope around the probe.
                         
          INT. BEDROOM, COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY
                         
          Cooper wakes. He's been sleeping with a pillow wrapped around
          his head. The SHRIEK can be heard, but it's muffled, distant.
           25.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY
                         
          Tom heads off for school with Donald. Murph, still suspended,
          looks up at Cooper, smiling.
                         
                          MURPH
           What are we doing today?
                         
                          COOPER
           You're staying here and cleaning the
           house.
                         
          Murph looks crestfallen. He looks out towards the yard.
          Cooper follows his stare.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           I told you, Murph. There's no one
           to take it back to.
                         
                          MURPH
           But what if there is, dad? What if
           there's something we can salvage?
                         
          Cooper thinks it over. Murph scrambles to get his shoes.
                         
          EXT. COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY
                         
          The shriek is still muffled. Cooper walks over to the well,
          putting in a pair of earplugs.
                         
          A line is staked off, leading down into the well below.
          Cooper begins hauling the line up.
                         
          As the probe breaks the surface of the water, the SHRIEK
          returns to its normal volume. Cooper rolls the probe out
          onto the ground.
                         
          INT. PIPER CUB -- DAY
                         
          The probe CHIRPS next to Murph in the backseat as Cooper
          spins the plane and guns the throttle and they bounce along
          the dusty runway and into the air.
                         
          EXT. CALIFORNIA COAST -- DAY
                         
          The tiny plane follows the mountains south.
                         
          EXT. SKIES OVER LOS ANGELES -- DAY
                         
          Cooper flies in low. Los Angeles looks much the same way it
          did in the early 20th century -- small settlements in Santa
          Monica and Downtown. Wildfires and earthquakes have shaken
          and burned what was left of the homes in between.
           26.
                         
          EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY, MALIBU -- DAY
                         
          Cooper puts the plane down on the old highway and taxis up
          to a gas station. Ahead, the Coast Highway peters out and
          disappears beneath rows of wild grass -- Malibu has become
          ranchland, once again.
                         
          EXT. GAS STATION, MALIBU -- DAY
                         
          An OLD MAN looks up as Cooper steps out of the plane and
          checks it over.
                         
                          COOPER
           Got any diesel?
                         
                          OLD MAN
           Plenty. Shame you can't eat it.
                         
          Cooper stretches the hose over to the plane.
                         
          INT. PIPER CUB -- DAY
                         
          Cooper rests a hand lightly on the controls as he follows
          the coast. Murph gazes out the window. In the backseat,
          the probe is HUMMING.
                         
          A light marine layer beneath them parts, revealing SANTA
          CRUZ ISLAND, a large, uninhabited island.
                         
          As Cooper soars over the island, the probe HUMS, insistent.
                         
                          MURPH
           I think it's home.
                         
          Cooper circles the island until he finds a long, flat
          grassland in the center of the island.
                         
          EXT. FIELD, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY
                         
          The plane bounces and hops to a halt in waist-deep grass.
                         
          Murph and Cooper climb down from the plane. Cooper slings a
          rifle over his shoulder.
                         
          A few dozen yards from the plane they reach the tree line.
          Murph stops, mesmerized by a patch of weeds studded with
          bright red -- strawberries.
                         
                          MURPH
           Dad, what are these things?
                         
                          COOPER
           I don't know. Don't touch them.
           27.
                         
          Cooper spots something in the foliage ahead that looks a
          little off. He walks over.
                         
          He pokes at the undergrowth with his rifle. The rifle CLANKS
          against something metal. Cooper reaches -- it's a camouflage
          scrim. He gently pulls it aside, revealing a chemical
          transport truck.
                         
          Cooper steps back, alarmed. He brings up his rifle.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Murph?
                         
          He looks around. Murph is nowhere to be seen. Cooper curses
          and heads into the forest to look for him.
                         
          EXT. CLEARING, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY
                         
          Cooper walks through a glade. He stops to get his bearings.
          Leans against a tree. Snatches his hand back -- the trunk
          of the tree is red hot.
                         
          Cooper steps back -- it's not a tree at all, but a camouflaged
          chimney stack. He looks up: the tree is venting steam.
                         
          Cooper walks a little further, until he finds several massive
          tanks. The tanks are filling with a bubbling liquid -- some
          kind of industrial process is taking place beneath him.
                         
          Cooper finally catches up with Murph at the edge of a
          clearing.
                         
                          COOPER
           Careful. There's some kind of
           underground facility here. We
           might...
                         
          Cooper notices his son is frozen, staring at something:
                         
          Standing bolt upright in the middle of the clearing, wearing
          an old straw hat, is an eight-foot-tall military spec ROBOT.
                         
                          MURPH
           Is it still... alive?
                         
                          COOPER
           Can't be. It's a marine. Haven't
           made them for thirty years. I've
           never seen one intact before.
                         
          Cooper steps closer to the robot, which is frozen. Its alloy
          frame heavily tarnished and weather-beaten. It looks like
          it might have been standing here for decades.
           28.
                         
          Cooper moves closer to it, looking into its blackened eyes.
          He steps back, clearly a little spooked.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           I think we need to go, Murph.
                         
                          MURPH
           But can't we take it back? You could
           fix it up, get him to do chores.
                         
                          COOPER
           No. I don't know what this place
           is, but we're leaving.
                         
          Murph, ignoring his father, steps forward to touch the robot.
                         
          Suddenly, the robot SPRINGS into action, picking up the boy
          and hoisting him up to eye level.
                         
          Cooper, stunned, points the rifle at the robot.
                         
          The robot turns, dropping the boy, RIPS the rifle from
          Cooper's hands, BENDS it, then SLAMS him up against the side
          of the water tank. Cooper punches him, then winces in agony.
                         
          Murph picks up the rifle and begins HITTING the robot as
          hard as he can. The robot opens his mouth and addresses
          Cooper calmly in the clipped tones of a US marine.
                         
                          ROBOT
           Tell the boy to stop hitting me.
                         
                          COOPER
                          (IGNORING HIM)
           Hit him in the back of the neck.
                         
          Murph raises the rifle butt. A voice stops him.
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           I wouldn't do that.
                         
          A woman, 30s, step out from the trees. This is AMELIA BRAND --
          tough, bright, and a decent shot with the large rifle that
          she's pointing at Cooper.
                         
                          COOPER
           We were just looking for salvage.
                         
                          BRAND
           Is that what they call stealing these

                          COOPER
           I didn't know it belonged to anyone.
           29. 
                         
                          BRAND
           It doesn't.
                          (TO ROBOT)
           You want to let them go, Tars, or do
           you want some help with your work?
                         
          The robot, evidently named Tars, looks at Cooper closely.
          Then lets him go.
                         
                          COOPER
           You've got me wrong, lady.
                         
                          BRAND
           Really? You're not the kind of guy
           who turns a combat marine with a
           supercomputer for a brain into a
           riding lawn mower?
                         
          Cooper says nothing -- she's not that far off the mark.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           Get back in your little plane, go
           back to your farming commune. And
           don't come back.
                         
          Cooper backs up. Tars holds up his mangled rifle. Smiles.
                         
                          TARS
           Don't forget your gun.
                         
                          COOPER
           (points at Tars)
           Word of advice -- careful with that
           thing. When the war was over, they
           didn't know when to stop fighting.
                         
                          BRAND

           trust you. Keep moving.
                         
          Cooper backs up to his plane. Tars follows him.
                         
          Suddenly, in the plane, the probe emits a high-pitch SQUEAL.
          Tars responds instantly, striding past Cooper to the plane.
          He sees the probe. Tries to open the door. It's locked.
                         
                          COOPER
           Wait a second--
                         
          Tars TEARS the door off the plane. Reaches inside and pulls
          out the probe. The woman looks at it, stunned.
                         
                          BRAND
           Get it inside.

           You too. We'll figure out what to
           do with you later.
                         
          Tars stops, and two panels open in the ground, revealing a
          huge, reinforced service elevator.
                         
          INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR, UNDERGROUND BUNKER -- DAY
                         
          Brand waves at a security camera and the lift begins to glide
          diagonally down a tunnel that cuts hundreds of feet below
          the island's surface. She keeps her weapon shouldered.
                         
                          COOPER
           Now who's stealing from who?
                         
                          BRAND
           This doesn't belong to you.
                         
                          COOPER
           You're right. It belongs to NASA,
           which shut down thirty years ago
           when the federal government ran out
           of money.
                         
          Brand says nothing. The elevator slows to a stop at the
          bottom of the tunnel. Heavy BLAST DOORS grind open and Brand
          motions for Cooper to step forward.
                         
          INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER -- DAY
                         
          They step into a vast underground facility. Standing in the
          center, braced by a launch tower, is a ten story tall rocket.
          Dozens of ROBOTS are working on in, maintaining it.
                         
          Cooper, stunned, looks at Brand.
                         
                          COOPER
           Who are you people?

                          (WRY)
           The government gave us plenty of
           practice looking for our own funding.

           Keep moving.
                         
          Tars carries the probe over to an area of the hangar filled
          with electronic equipment. A group of ENGINEERS and ROBOTS
          converge around Tars.
                         
          An OLDER ENGINEER looks familiar -- 70s, white-haired, this
          is Ansen's assistant at Caltech who we met fifty years
          earlier.
           31.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           I found them outside with it. It
           looks like six. Maybe seven. I
           can't tell from the radiation damage.
                         
          The older engineer looks at the probe, astonished.
                         
                          OLD ENGINEER
           Where did you find it?

           Of course. It must have been looking
           for Canaveral.
                         
          Tars bolts the probe down into a purpose built rig. DOYLE,
          40s, an engineer, begins hooking leads into the probe.
                         
                          COOPER
           Canaveral's been gone for thirty
           years.
                         
          Brand ignores him.
                         
          Doyle looks up from his monitor, frustrated.
                         
                          DOYLE
           It's not responding to the handshake.
           I can't open anything on primary.
                         
          Brand looks up at Cooper.
                         
                          BRAND
           What did you do to it?
                         
                          COOPER
           Nothing. I got something off of it.
                         
          Cooper looks around. There's a safety station on the wall
          with a battery powered defibrillator.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
                          (TO BRAND)
           May I?
                         
          Brand nods, wary. Cooper walks over to the wall, takes the
          defibrillator, and hooks it up to the probe. He taps into
          the current and runs a lead into the terminal. Brand's Father
          watches, fascinated, as Cooper fires the defibrillator.

           Most of the disk was noise. Couple
           of clean sectors, though.
                         
          Suddenly, the monitor starts pulling good data off of the
          probe. The older man and Doyle begin sorting through it.
                         
          Cooper smiles at Brand, who seems less than impressed.
                         
          The footage of the ice-covered planet Cooper saw earlier
          pops onto the screen.
                         
          The engineers and physicists get very quiet, studying the

          The older engineer studies the image of the ice-covered
          planet, thinking.
                         
                          COOPER

           more than you already have.
                         
          Cooper points to a telemetry unit that is being repaired by
          a robot on a nearby bench.

           The power supply is no good. If the

          INT. MACHINE SHOP, UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- DAY
                         
          Cooper and Murph have been locked in an abandoned machine
          shop, surrounded by the massive remains of rocket engines in
          various states of disrepair. Tars is blocking the door.
                         
          Cooper stands. Tars wags a long, hydraulic finger at him.

           34.
                         
          The back of the shop is filled with a group of older ROBOTS
          who are overhauling an engine. One problem -- the engine
          isn't there. Their programming hasn't been updated to reflect
          their obsolescence.
                         
          Murph watches, entranced, as the robots go about their
          business, efficiently TORQUING bolts with impact drivers
          into a non-existent thruster cone. The bolts CLATTER to the
          ground as the robots stop to reload.
                         
                          MURPH

           out of a job.
           (nods at Tars)
           Same as the rest of these people.
                         
          Cooper notices through the glass door of the lab that Brand
          and the older engineer are arguing about something. She
          finally relents and walks towards the door.
                         
          Brand walks in. She gestures for Cooper to follow.
                         
                          BRAND
           The mission commander wants to see

           be all right with Tars.

          Brand heads towards a group of large maintenance ROBOTS
          clustered at the base of the rocket. A smaller, human sized
          robot is staring at the rocket, giving them instructions.

          Originally an air force pararescue officer, every part of

          Cooper turns back from the glass, anger growing.
                         
                          COOPER
           You've known this for how long? And
           you didn't try to tell anyone?
                         
                          BRAND
           What would be the point? So humanity
           could spend the last fifty years of
           its life fighting over the scraps?
           It's better that they don't know.
                         
          Cooper begins to argue, then stops. He knows enough history
          to know she's right. He looks at the withering crops.
                         
                          COOPER
                          (QUIET)
           That's why you're looking for a planet
           with oxygen. Water.
                         
                          BRAND
           A new home for humanity. We'll set
           up a colony, then return to bring
           more people across.
                         
                          COOPER
           But you'd still only be able to save
           a few hundred. Maybe a thousand.
                         
                          BRAND
           Would it be better if we all died?
                         
          She looks him directly in the eye.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           Look -- I don't have a clue what
           Case thinks you could add to the
           mission. You can come with us or
           you can stay here and wait to die.
           I don't care.
                          (BEAT)
           But make no mistake -- this mission
           is our last chance.

          Cooper looks at the wilted corn.

          Cooper walks Murph back to the plane.
                         
          He looks back at Brand, who holds his eye for a beat, then
          turns back into the light of the underground facility.
                         
          Cooper buckles Murph into his seat.

          Donald is sitting at the kitchen table, lost in thought.
          Cooper has told him everything.
                         
                          DONALD
           You get older, sometimes you just
           want to sit back and watch it all
           play out. Your life. Your kids'
           lives. The whole crazy story.
                          (LOOKS DOWN)
           I didn't think I'd be around for the
           end of it.
                         
          He looks at Cooper.
                         
                          DONALD (CONT'D)
           You have to go.
                         
                          COOPER
           I can't go. I have to look after
           the boys.
                         
                          DONALD
           You've been preparing these boys to
           be on their own since their mom died.
           Besides, I'll be here to look after
           them, same as I've always been.
                         
                          COOPER
           I have a responsibility to them--
                         
                          DONALD
           That's right. You do.
           41.
                         
          Cooper looks back out the window, thinking. The night sky
          is filled with stars.

          Cooper, duffel slung over his shoulder, stands by the door.
          He gives his son, Tom, a hug. Murph is nowhere to be seen.
                         
          Cooper looks to the back of the house.

          Murph is sitting at his desk, crossing out numbers on a sheet
          covered with math. Cooper steps inside.
                         
          He notices a packed suitcase sitting by the door. The boy
          looks up, hopeful.
                         
                          MURPH
           I've been doing the math, dad. I
           weigh about 85 pounds. Now that's
           an extra ton of fuel. But if-
                         
                          COOPER
           You have to stay here, pal.
                         
                          MURPH
                          (DISTRAUGHT)
           I heard you talking to grandpa. I'm
           like you. I don't fit here, either.
           You know that.
                         
          Cooper puts an arm around the boy.
                         
                          COOPER
           There's going to be important work
           to do here, too.
                         
          Tears are streaming down the boy's face. Cooper takes his
          watch off. Looks at it.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           I need you to hold onto this. Will
           you do that for me?
                         
          Cooper hands Murph the watch. The boy nods, saddened.
                         
                          MURPH
           You're not coming back, are you?
                         
                          COOPER
           I will come back. I promise.
           42.
                         
          Murph shakes his head, but the sadness remains. He knows
          this is goodbye, even if his father doesn't.
                         
          Heart breaking, Cooper hugs his son and turns to the door.

          The Piper Cub touches down. Donald is at the controls.
          Cooper climbs down, pulls out his bag. Reaches back in and
          grips the old man's hand to say goodbye.
                         
          Cooper turns and walks toward the bunker. The doors open
          and Tars and Doyle step out to greet him.
                         
          Tars ushers Cooper onto the elevator.
                         
                          COOPER
           Don't look so happy to see me.

          Cooper looks at Tars, then Doyle, confused.
                         
                          DOYLE
           Tars was a Marine. They gave him a
           sense of humor to help him fit in
           with his unit better.
                         
                          COOPER
           Great idea. A massive, sarcastic
           robot.
                         
                          TARS
           I have a cue light I can turn on
           when I'm joking, if you like.
                         
          Tars points to a tiny LED over his eyebrow.
                         
                          COOPER
           That sounds like a good idea.
                         
                          TARS
           Great. Maybe you can use it to find
           your way back to the ship after I
           blow you out the airlock.
                         
          Cooper looks at him. Tars looks back, deadpan. After a
          beat, the little light turns on above his right eyebrow.
                         
          The doors to the bunker begin to grind closed.

          Brand sees him. He smiles in greeting. She doesn't return
          the gesture. Instead, she holds up the telemetry board.
                         
                          BRAND
           You don't like this one, you get to

          Cooper is riding in a small rubber zodiac struggling to pull
          on a wetsuit. Brand is GUNNING the engine, guiding the tiny
          craft to a point in the middle of the bay.
                         
                          COOPER
           I was wondering where you've been
           getting your supplies.
                         
                          BRAND
           We knew we'd need decades of parts
           and materials. The government was
           getting rid of some things. So we
           arranged to take some off their hands.
                         
          She cuts the engine and hooks the boat up to a buoy. She
          tosses a compact rebreather.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           You know how to use one?

           You just breathe. Tap my arm or
           bang something metal if you have a
           problem. And don't get lost.
                         
          She picks up her rebreather and begins looking over it.
                         
                          COOPER
           So you're a salvage diver now? I

           We're not going to have a lot of

           We all need expertise in at least
           three fields. Except for you, of

           44.
                         
          With that she rolls backwards out of the boat and into the
          water.
                         
          Cooper hastily fits his rebreather and follows.

          She pulls out a flashlight and turns it on. A tiny beam
          picks out details at the bottom.
                         
          Cooper stops breathing.
                         
          The bottom of the ocean is covered with an entire fleet of
          the US navy. Nuclear subs. Battleships. Destroyers.
                         
          Cooper remembers to breath again. Then he hurries to catch
          up with Brand.

          She holds it up for Cooper. He nods. She swims on.

          Cooper sets the board down. His eye is drawn to a bizarre
          experiment -- an ant colony built into a massive spinning
          centrifuge. Brand notices.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           We didn't know what kind of gravity

          Cooper looks at the tiny colonies of ants struggling to go
          about their business in the raised gravity.
                         
                          COOPER
           Looks like hard work.
                         
                          BRAND
           It's a paradox. Life couldn't form
           without gravity. No stars. No
           planets. The component pieces would
           just drift apart. But too much of
           it and you're trapped.
                         
          Brand's guard relaxes a tiny bit as she talks about her work.
          The moment passes quickly, and she continues on into the

          Cooper watches with the rest of the crew as Case pulls up
          the holographical maps for their journey.
                         
          Brand steps into the back of the room. Cooper notices her
          and nods. She ignores him.

          Case switches the map to a vista filled with stars and black
          holes.
                         
                          CASE (CONT'D)
           Based on our latest modelling we
           think the region on the far side of
           the wormhole is the center of a
           galaxy.
                         
          Case zooms in on the center of the hologram: an incredibly
          bright mass with plasma jets firing off in either direction.

          the map in, revealing, at the center, a black heart.

           No. A black hole. There are several
           in the region, but this is the largest --
           a billion times heavier than the
           sun. I call it Gargantua.

           Don't worry about Roth. He's nuts.
           But Case says that means he's ideally
           suited for space travel.
                         
          Case repositions the map near a much smaller black hole that
          is orbiting Gargantua.

          onto a sheet that bends, revealing the curvature of gravity.

           I find it hard to believe that someone

           us to a dead end.

                          BRAND
           A guess. That's right. We don't

           My guess is that the wormhole is
           there because someone is trying to
           help us. The same way we used to
           try to help animals when they were
           threatened with extinction.

           I guess I'm also assuming that whoever
           built the wormhole has a better plan
           than we did. If I'm wrong, we'll
           die, same as we'd die here anyway.

           If we're guessing, then I'd say
           Brand's right. The wormhole couldn't
           exist naturally. I think it's there
           for a reason. That someone is trying
           to help us.

           Would you like me to install the
           chip?
                         
                          COOPER
           Oh, no. I want to see this.
                         
          Cooper takes Tars's chip out of its plastic safety case and
          looks it over. The engineer opens a bay in the back of the
          frame and Cooper slides the chip inside.
                         
          The frame begins its "handshake" -- lights illuminate on the
          body, muscles flicker from a long gestation. The eyes open.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
                          (SMILES)
           Good morning, sunshine.
           52.
                         
          Tars takes one or two steps forward, rotating his arms --
          the robot equivalent of a stretch. Cooper can barely hide
          his mirth at Tars's newfound lack of stature.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Bit of a demotion.
                         
          Tars turns back toward Cooper. He puffs out his chest and
          suddenly his stubby arms and legs telescope, unfolding into
          long, svelte limbs. When he's done he stands eight feet
          tall, even more impressive than his earthbound frame.
                         
                          TARS
           I wouldn't call it that, exactly.
                         
          He reaches out an arm and pats Cooper on the shoulder.
                         
          INT. ENDURANCE, SPACE STATION
                         
          Cooper and the others haul themselves into the ship. To
          Cooper's surprise, it's quite compact, and divided into two
          chambers, like nestled spheres.
                         
                          COOPER
           The ship is tiny.
                         
          Doyle, squeezing past him, smiles at Cooper's surprise.
                         
                          DOYLE
           So is the wormhole.
                         
          Doyle pats Cooper on the back. Cooper begins hauling gear
          inside.

          In complete silence, the Endurance detaches from the space
          station and rolls gently away.
                         
          After a moment, its nuclear engines fire and the Endurance
          begins to accelerate steadily away from the Earth.
                         
          INT. SPACE STATION
                         
          The engineer robots who built the Endurance watch as their
          creation disappears into space.
                         
          Their mission is complete. One by one, they shut down.

          hull as the Earth gets steadily smaller.
                         
          Then they settle in for the long journey to the wormhole.

          Tars is hunched over a small communications relay, one hand
          is holding a paint brush -- he is making delicate strokes,
          painting the relay a bright blue.
                         
          Cooper watches him for a moment. Tars looks up.
                         
                          TARS
           It's the comms relay. It will allow
           us to talk to earth, even on the far
           side of the wormhole.
                         
                          COOPER
           I know. So why are you painting it?
                         
          Tars looks almost bashful.
                         
                          TARS
           It helps me calibrate my fine motor
           control.
                         
                          COOPER
           Sure it does.

           You're pretty good.
                         
          Tars double checks his work.
                         
                          TARS
           I learned it during the war.
                         
                          COOPER
           What'd you paint?
                         
                          TARS
           Tombstones.
                         
          Cooper watches him finish in silence.

          Cooper watches a highly-compressed video of his son, Tom,
          talking about school.
                         
                          TOM
           They said I can start an agriculture
           class a year early.
                         
          Cooper shakes his head.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           I've got to go, Dad. Hope you're
           safe up there.
           54.
                         
          Tom gets up to leave. Donald sits down in his place.
                         
                          DONALD
           I'm sorry, Coop. I asked Murph to
           record you a message but he's still...
           well, he's still angry with you.
           I'll try again next week.
                         
          The video cuts out. Cooper stares at the darkened screen.
                         
          INT. ENGINE ROOM, ENDURANCE
                         
          Cooper, Brand and Tars are moving the bundles of colonization
          equipment into bins along the wall of the craft.
                         
          Tars pulls a stack of equipment out the stack and stows it
          against the wall. Cooper copies the procedure.
                         
          They labor in silence, working their way along the hull.
          Cooper gets quicker with each bundle, keeping pace with Tars.
                         
                          TARS
           Be careful. It's difficult to gauge
           mass in zero gravity.
                         
                          COOPER
           How much do these things weigh?
                         
                          TARS
           Four tons.
                         
          Cooper looks at the incredibly heavy bundle spinning easily
          in his hands. He tries to stop it. Catches his hand.
                         
                          COOPER
           Damn.
                         
          He jerks his hand away, then pushes himself after the spinning
          bundle, trying to stop it before it can damage the hull.
          Tars helps him catch it inches from the hull wall.
                         
          Brand floats over to Cooper, smiling at him the whole time
          with an exaggerated grin.
                         
                          BRAND
           Smile.
                         
          Cooper smiles, taken aback by Brand's sudden friendliness.
                         
                          COOPER
           Why?
                         
                          BRAND
           Because it lowers your blood pressure.
           55.
                         
          Cooper looks at his hand. Blood is pouring out of his palm
          in large glistening bubbles.

           If we're such a liability, why take

          over. Erases the message. Stands to leave.
                         
          As he steps to the door he notices Brand watching him through

          Cooper looks at the holographic model of the black hole

          the smaller black hole.

           You wouldn't want to get too close
           to the surface of the sun, either.
           Black holes are a more stable supply

          Behind the ship, the sun is a distant light, not much bigger

          The ship slows as it nears a tiny, crystal mouth, just four
          meters or so in diameter.

          The crew move into the tight, claustrophobic outer layer of

          through the wormhole.
                         
          Tars detaches his legs in order to take up less space during
          transit. Then he tethers himself to the hull wall.
                         
          Case is the last to join them. He detaches a small control
          module from the console, then pulls himself into the outer
          hull and seals the passageway.
                         
          Case presses a button on the control module. With a GROAN,
          the hull walls of the ship begin to BEND.

          opening in its hull toward the wormhole mouth.
                         
          Slowly, the Endurance pushes itself forward, closer and closer
          to the crystal-like mouth. Finally, it envelops the mouth,
          bringing it into the open chamber.
                         
          INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE

          center of the inner compartment.
                         
          Case presses a sequence key on the control panel and the
          ship's hull closes again, trapping the wormhole inside it.
                         
          With a GRUMBLE, the ship begins contracting, squeezing itself
          down around the wormhole mouth.
                         
          Cooper takes a deep breath as the center of the ship begins
          gently lowering itself into the wormhole mouth, feeding itself
          into the wormhole from the inside out. Cooper watches as
          Doyle is swallowed into the compressing ship with a GRUNT.

          The ship continues to slide through the wormhole. Through
          the outer hull they see images of themselves repeating -- a
          trick of the narrow collar of space they are sinking through.
          Cooper smiles at himself. The experience is unnerving.

          For a moment, the ship slides gently, silently, through the
          wormhole. The quiet is eery.
                         
          Suddenly, a point of distortion appears in the hull next to
          Cooper. It looks like someone is pushing against the hull
          of the ship with a giant finger.
                         
                          COOPER
           Something's happening to the hull

           Hull integrity is fine.
                         
          The distortion moves along the hull, growing in diameter.
                         
                          COOPER
           Well, I don't know what your display
           is telling you but something is
           happening over here.
                         
          Suddenly, along the hull, Doyle speaks up, panicked.
                         
                          DOYLE
           I've got a problem over here, too.
                         
          Doyle is watching a separate distortion move across the inner
          wall of the ship. This one seems to be TWISTING the material
          of the hull.
                         
          Suddenly, the point in front of Cooper detaches itself from
          the outer wall and moves through the space in front of him,
          bending the empty space itself, distorting the ship behind
          it like a sphere-shaped magnifying glass.
                         
                          DOYLE (CONT'D)
           It's not the hull... it's inside the

          Roth watches as the distortions move through the ship. His
          curiosity doesn't make anyone else feel any better.
                         
                          DOYLE

                          CASE
           I don't know. It could be

          The twisting sphere in front of Doyle begins to grow.
                         
                          DOYLE
           It's getting bigger.
                         
          Doyle puts up his hand to defend himself. The sphere absorbs
          it, twisting Doyle's hand. Doyle CRIES OUT.
                         
          His hand is twisted completely around, impossibly mangled.
          But Doyle, hyperventilating, isn't in any pain.
                         
                          ROTH
           It's not bending your hand. It's
           bending the space around your hand.
                         
          The sphere begins to pass through Doyle's body. Doyle is
          freaking out.
                         
          The sphere in front of Cooper makes contact with him, also.
          He holds his breath as it touches him, squeezing and
          distorting his body.
                         
                          BRAND
           This isn't turbulence. Look at the
           way they're moving -- it's like
           something's examining us.
                         
          Cooper watches the sphere distort his arm, running along the
          length of it.
                         
                          COOPER
           Can you ask it to stop?
                         
          Suddenly, as quickly as they appeared, the distortions vanish.
          For a moment, the crew is silent, still spellbound by the
          encounter.
                         
          An ALARM sounds. Suddenly, the inner chamber begins to
          distort from a spherical shape to bispherical: two spheres
          joined. The ship GROANS as if it's being pulled apart.

          Doyle reaches over to an auxiliary panel and punches in a
          sequence.
                         
          After a moment, the hull cracks open, creating a channel
          through which the radiating mouth can escape.
                         
          The opening in the ship allows the pressure to begin to
          concentrate on one fracture point. The ship SHUDDERS as
          it's squeezed along its axis.

          canvas studded with points of light -- like looking into the
          universe through the wrong end of a telescope.
                         
          Cooper presses himself against the wall and holds on as the

          The sky overhead begins to spin due to their motion -- faster
          and faster until it becomes a blur. The ship begins to GROAN
          as it appears to be pulled in two different directions.
                         
          The ship is now speeding around the black hole at incredible
          speed -- one revolution every four seconds. The crew are
          suddenly SLAMMED against the hull in opposite directions --
          some towards the black hole, some towards the opposite side.
                         
          Roth looks at his model, which shows the projected path of

          the probes on the surface.

          The ship settles into orbit a few hundred kilometers above
          the surface of the ice planet. It can't get any closer:
                         
          The space below it is choked with hundreds of tiny moons --
          a cruder version of Saturn's rings. The moons are hurtling
          around the planet at high speed.

          The lander detaches from Endurance, rolls over on its belly,
          and FIRES thrusters to sink towards the planet's surface.

          between the moons that hurtle past.
                         
          The moons are vastly different than our own; potato shaped
          and only one to two miles in circumference, they are hugged
          in a close embrace with the ice planet, only a few hundred
          thousand feet from the surface.

          After a moment, the hatch HISSES open and the team steps
          out, led by Case, holding a rifle.
                         
          The team sets out, moving slowly in their cumbersome suits.
                         
          Lit by the nebula, the surroundings are a little brighter
          than a full moon on Earth.
                         
          Not that there's much to look at. They are standing on a
          sea of ice, which spreads for miles. In the distance, small
          rock formations break through the ice.
                         
          Brand takes a surface reading of the ice.

           in the ice.
                         
          Case leads the way, drawn by a signal only he can hear. He
          walks fifty yards, then stops on a gentle slope that leads
          down into a small valley.

           beneath us.
                         
          Case and the others begin digging into the hillside. Cooper
          is drawn to a small mound in the middle of the valley, four
          feet high. He takes out a small folding shovel and begins
          scraping at the ice and snow.
                         
          Case hits something solid. But it's not a probe. He digs
          around a little more, then reaches up and hacks away at the
          hillside, revealing the outline of something metal:
                         
          A door. They're not standing at the base of a hill -- it's
          a shelter. The crew stands back, unsure what to make of it.
                         
          A few feet away, Cooper cuts enough of the mound away to
          reveal something flexible -- fabric caked with ice. He
          scrapes away the snow, revealing a bright patch of red fabric:
                         
          It's the flag of the People's Republic of China.

          with ice. He wrenches it open.

           The more immediate question is what
           happened to the Chinese expedition.
           There's no sign of their ship in

           earth.

          Brand is examining a piece of ice in her hands, which contains
          several black flecks. As she shines her light on them, they
          FLUORESCE, giving off a tiny flicker of light, like a firefly.
          Brand steps back.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           These things... they're alive.
                         
          Roth joins her, looking down at the tiny creatures trapped
          in the ice. Brand shines her flashlight over the ice again,
          but nothing happens. Roth takes the depth meter dangling by
          a lanyard from Brand's suit.

           to. It's this--
                         
          Roth takes the depth meter and waves it over the ice.
          Suddenly, the black flecks begin to shine.

          Roth looks at the shimmering light of the tiny life-forms
          trapped in the ice, mesmerized.
                         
          Case hammers down with his arm, gouging a deep hole in the
          ice below. Suddenly, GAS sprays back up at him. He's found
          the gas pocket beneath them.
                         
          Too late. Roth's rad meter begins BEEPING frantically.

          Overhead, a tiny ball is orbiting into view from the dark
          side of the black hole -- the NEUTRON STAR.
                         
          Its humble size belies its power. As its rays hit the ice,
          the ice CRACKLES with energy.
                         
          INT. ICE MINE SHAFT -- ALIEN DAWN
                         
          Brand steps back from the ice in awe as it begins to glow.
          The microbes are absorbing the x-rays and emitting light.
          Within seconds, they are bathed in an incredible glow.
                         
          Even Cooper stops, awed by the beauty of the display. Only
          Case is unmoved, continuing to SMASH at the ice with the
          broken end of his wrist.

          Suddenly, a CRACK as Case punches into the ice. Cooper looks
          down -- a great fissure has opened in the ice beneath them.

           Case, wait--
                         
          Case PUNCHES again. Suddenly, with a great BANG, the ice
          floor disintegrates beneath them.
                         
          They fall into the darkness.
                         
          INT. CAVERN -- ALIEN DAWN
                         
          Cooper falls. For a moment, the only light he can see is
          from Case, falling calmly a few yards beneath him.
                         
          As they fall, the light from the microbes trapped in the ice
          above sweeps across the inside of the cavern, illuminating
          the floor of the massive cavern thousands of feet down.
                         
          The rock formations they saw on the surface are actually the
          tip of a mountain range extending into the distance,
          disappearing into the ice above as if it were cloud cover.
                         
          The base of the mountains is covered in a thick jungle-like
          foliage that runs into a perfectly-still inland sea. On the
          far side of the sea, another mountain range stretches into
          the distance, supporting the thick ice and rock cavern roof.
                         
          Cooper only has a few seconds to take this in -- he is falling
          towards the huge inland sea below.
                         
          Seconds before impact, a tiny warning light flickers on inside
          his helmet: IMPACT DETECTED.
                         
          Suddenly, a small drag chute EXPLODES from a panel on the
          back of suit, slowing his fall. Airbags EXPLODE on his legs
          and torso to cushion the impact.
                         
          Cooper SMASHES into the water.

          Cooper comes to underwater, as liquid is flowing into his
          suit from his shattered helmet.

          Bubbles pour out from his suit and Cooper GASPS as his helmet
          fills with water and he begins to sink.
                         
          As he sinks, Cooper pulls off his helmet, then tears off
          pieces of his suit. He forces himself through the neck of
          the suit and then swims upward.
                         
          He is about to surface when he remembers where he is. He
          hesitates, just beneath the surface, lungs tightening as he
          runs out of oxygen.

          Cooper breaks the surface, COUGHS out water, and takes a
          panicked breath.
                         
          He waits. Nothing happens. He opens his mouth again and
          breathes in almost pure oxygen. He can breathe.
                         
          Treading water, he looks around. Spots lights in the water
          below nearby -- Brand, in her suit, is sinking.
                         
          He dives down and struggles to haul her up by the suit.
                         
          Cooper breaks the surface, looks at Brand. Her mask is also
          broken.

          She refuses at first. Water is bubbling into her suit through
          the open mask. Finally, she takes a deep breath.

          Brand sinks. Cooper swims down, following her, ripping away
          at her suit. The tear-away seals on her suit are stuck fast,
          damaged in the fall.
           80.
                         
          Cooper finally breaks them off. Brand pulls herself out,
          free, and they swim for the surface.

          Cooper drags himself out of the water and onto the beach.
          He turns back to offer Brand a hand. She waves him off.
                         
                          BRAND
           I don't need your help.

          They sit together, soaking wet, trying to catch their breath.

           Don't mention it.
                         
          Cooper feels the rocks beneath him, which are translucent,
          like glass, and polished to an impossible shine.
                         
          He looks up to see Case dragging Roth and Doyle, still in
          their suits, out of the water.

          Cooper finds Brand taking samples from the tree-like life-
          forms, which are wildly different from their counterparts
          back on Earth, piled in torturous coils, as if frozen in a
          struggle to punch through the canopy to reach the light above.
                         
                          BRAND
           This is incredible. The organisms
           trapped in the ice above absorb x-
           rays and emit light. In return,
           these plants absorb the light and
           emit oxygen, which feeds the animals
           trapped in the ice.
                         
          Brand cuts off a sample and drops it into the case. The
          transparent wall of the case magnifies the structure onto
          the glass automatically. She compares it with the flecks
          she collected in the ice above, fascinated.

          descend, more rapidly than on Earth.
                         
          Suddenly, the tree SHUDDERS. Then, the bark begins to ooze
          over Brand's fingers.
                         
          Brand snaps her hand away and steps back. Even for her,
          this is too much. She turns back to Cooper, who is looking
          at the jungle around them, spooked.
                         
                          COOPER
           You know how plants don't usually
           move? Is that a universal rule?
                         
                          BRAND
           No. There really aren't any rules.
                         
          All around them, the life-forms begins to melt toward the
          ground, breaking down into different, smaller forms.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           (trying to stay calm)
           Remember, we're the aliens.
                         
          Cooper steps back as several pieces of the nearest tree drop
          onto the ground and begin scuttling toward him.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           Hold very still. Don't make any
           sudden movements.
                         
          Two of the pieces join together, stacking themselves up and
          staggering toward him.
           84.
                         
          A third piece climbs onto the first two, looking for a good
          place to hang on. After a moment it hunkers down on top,
          forming a crude head. Thirty eye-like structures blink open
          on the creature.
                         
          The skin of the life-form begins to flicker with a dim light
          like the animals trapped in the ice above, bathing Cooper
          and Brand in a warm glow.
                         
          The creature creeps closer to them, taking them in. Cooper
          tries his best to seem non-threatening.
                         
                          COOPER
           Hello there.
                         
          The creature lurches toward him on three legs, then its head
          splits open and it BELLOWS.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           OK. Now we run.
                         
          Brand doesn't argue. They turn and sprint through the trees.
                         
          EXT. JUNGLE -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper and Brand smash headlong through the jungle. At first,
          they're running from the rumbling, smashing melee behind
          them. But as they run, the entire jungle around them begins
          to break apart and move.
                         
          After a moment, they're surrounded. The jungle is completely
          disassembling itself into a million different pieces, each
          one a different size and shape than the others.
                         
                          COOPER
           We have to reach the shelter.
                         
          They head off, crashing through the melee.
                         
          EXT. SHORE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
                         
          Case, Doyle and Roth are standing in front of the shelter
          finishing the day's work.
                         
          Doyle turns around. The jungle is breaking apart and crawling
          down the beach towards them.
                         
                          DOYLE
           I think we've got a problem.
                         
          Case and Roth look up to see the organisms picking up speed
          as they move towards them.
                         
          Roth begins to step out towards them.
           85.
                         
                          ROTH
           Fascinating. I think-
                         
          Case grabs him by the arm and pushes him bodily into the
          shelter after Doyle.
                         
          Case pushes the door closed.
                         
          INT. SHELTER, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
                         
          They crouch inside the shelter as the organisms begin POUNDING
          at the walls, trying to force their way inside.
                         
          It's going to be a long night.
                         
          EXT. JUNGLE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
                         
          Ahead, Cooper can see the gleaming water of the inland sea,
          light still flickering in patches from the ice above it.
                         
                          COOPER
           This way.
                         
          Brand begins to follow.
                         
                          BRAND
           No... wait.
                         
          Too late. Cooper forces his way between two writhing
          creatures, steps through, and falls...
                         
          EXT. WATERFALL -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper gasps as he surfaces from the ice-cold water. Brand
          floats past.
                         
          The river appears to flow randomly down the slope, with good
          reason -- the forest rearranges itself every night.
                         
          Ahead, the ground drops away again and the water rushes over
          it in a torrent.
                         
          Cooper catches himself at the last minute, grabbing a thick
          tree branch with one hand and, a second later, Brand with
          the other as she slides past.
                         
                          COOPER
           I've got you.
                         
          Suddenly, the branch in Cooper's hand illuminates and wrenches
          itself out of the rock -- it's a limb of a huge colony
          organism. It shakes Cooper loose and they fall again...
           86.
                         
          EXT. POOL -- NIGHT
                         
          Brand surfaces first. She grabs Cooper and hauls him up and
          out of the water. She smiles down at him, a little smug.
                         
                          BRAND
           I've got you.
                         
          Creatures begin splashing down into the pool behind them, as
          if imitating them.
                         
          Cooper stumbles to his feet and Brand guides them backward
          into a small cave carved into the rock above the pool.
                         
          INT. CAVE -- NIGHT
                         
          Brand CRACKS a glow stick, basking the cave around them in a
          soft light.
                         
          As they watch, horrified, the pool and the rocks in front of
          the cave fill up with creatures of all sizes, as they tumble
          down the hill in what appears to be a battle royal.
                         
          For a moment, it looks like Brand and Cooper may go unnoticed.
          Then, a three-foot-tall creature with a dozen legs creeps
          its way toward the entrance to the cave. Another follows,
          and another, until the cave entrance is full.
                         
          Cooper looks around the cave, frantic. He picks up a rock.
          Brand, scared but still thinking, takes the rock from his
          hand and drops it back to the ground.
                         
                          BRAND
           It's game theory. The best move is
           always to cooperate at first.
                         
                          COOPER
           By "cooperate" do you mean let it
           eat me?
                         
                          BRAND
           These organisms have no interest in
           us. They survive by photosynthesis.
           All they need is light.
                         
                          COOPER
           Then why are they killing each other?
                         
                          BRAND
           I don't know.
                          (LOOKS AROUND)
           But we're outnumbered, Cooper. So
           unless you have a better idea, I
           suggest we make nice.
           87.
                         
          The creatures move toward them hesitantly, then faster.
                         
          Cooper stands stock still as the creatures gather around
          him. Several of them join up into bigger animals to get a
          better look at him.
                         
          One of them wraps itself around his chest and begins prodding
          at his shoulders, then his neck.
                         
                          COOPER
           (trying to be calm)
           What is it doing?
                         
                          BRAND
           It's a colony organism. It's trying
           to incorporate you into its structure.
                         
                          COOPER
           I don't want it to incorporate me.
                         
                          BRAND
           Don't open your mouth.
                         
                          COOPER
                          WHY N-
                         
          As he speaks, the creature on his chest extends four spindly,
          pointed feelers and reaches gently into his mouth.
                         
          Cooper holds his breath as the organism taps against his
          teeth. Its skin has a roughened texture, as if incomplete,
          and it appears to be searching for the same texture on
          Cooper's skin, without much luck.
                         
          Bored, the life-forms climb back down off of Cooper. The
          last two creatures link up in an imitation of Cooper's lower
          body and attempt to walk across the room like a human. After
          a moment, the creatures tumble to the ground and flail away.
                         
          Cooper is still breathing hard as the cave empties and he
          and Brand are left alone again.
                         
          Brand steps to the edge of the cave and watches, fascinated,
          as the creatures resume wrestling and battling each other.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           They're killing each other.
                         
                          BRAND
           No. They don't bleed... they don't
           die... they're just competing...
           trying out different shapes, looking
           for the best one.
           88.
                         
          Cooper watches as a hideously-awkward-looking, five-legged
          beast stumbles past and tackles another animal.
                         
                          COOPER
           I'd say they have a long way to go.
                         
                          BRAND
                          (AMAZED)
           They do this every night.
                         
          As they watch, a two-foot-long creature with one huge claw
          scuttles along the ground, grabbing smaller opponents and
          smashing them apart, then sorting through the wreckage and
          adopting some of the writhing parts as its own.
                         
          Something about the movement is endearing, the way it
          experiments with each piece -- less like a massacre and more
          like an over-caffeinated self-assembling erector set.
                         
          Suddenly, a massive, lumbering creature SMASHES down in front
          of the claw beast. No match, the smaller creature turns to
          scuttle away. Too slow. The larger organism brings one
          club-like limb smashing down on top of it. After a moment,
          it lifts its claw -- the two animals have become one.
                         
          The new organism lumbers away through the jungle, happily
          snapping its new claw at larger opponents.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           The behavior changes as the animals
           get bigger and bigger. More
           sophisticated. More calculated.
                         
          Two of the larger organisms square off, circling each other,
          lights pulsing up and down their bodies in a fierce display.
                         
                          COOPER
           But what are they competing for?

          INT. CAVE -- NIGHT
                         
          Brand and Cooper huddle around a small chemical fire they've
          brought with them.
                         
          Brand looks at the sample of the fractal wildlife in her
          case. It's moving around, splitting apart, reforming, trying
          to find a way out.

          Cooper is silent for a moment. His mood darkens.
                         
                          COOPER
           I was in Denver during the first
           year of the famine. I was just a
           kid. We kept waiting for someone to
           come help us. People starved to
           death sitting on the ground, waiting
           for someone to come.
                          (MORE)
           90.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           (looks at her)
           I only made it because I realized
           that nobody was coming to save us.
           We were on our own.
                         
          Cooper looks away. The memories are never that far away.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Honestly? After the things I saw...
           you want to know why I don't believe
           that someone would be trying to help
           us? Because I'm not sure we're worth
           saving.
                         
          They sit in silence for a while.
                         
          EXT. CAVE -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper sleeps. After a moment, Brand steps back out into
          the darkness.
                         
          EXT. PLAIN -- DAWN
                         
          Brand exhales great streams of frosted breath -- the
          temperature is well below freezing. The first flickers of
          light are visible in the ice above.
                         
          The creatures are huge now, forty or fifty feet tall, battling
          each other more and more slowly. As Brand watches, the
          largest of them beats down his rivals, climbing to the top
          of the heap.
                         
          Just as the beast reaches the top, it freezes, as if stuck.
                         
          Above, the ice begins to shine brighter and brighter.
                         
          Suddenly, the beast on top breaks apart, unfurling into planes
          to catch the light. This is what the contest has been about --
          a better place in the sun.
                         
          Brand takes it in.
                         
          EXT. JUNGLE -- DAY
                         
          Cooper and Brand pick their way their way through the foliage,
          which is now perfectly still, absorbing the light. Cooper
          looks at the plants, wary.
                         
          Brand sees his trepidation and laughs at him.
                         
                          BRAND
           They're not going to move now, Cooper.
           They need to spread themselves as
           thin as they can to absorb the light.
           91.
                         
          Cooper leads the way, pushing through the trees.
                         
          Suddenly he stops again. Brand, annoyed, pushes through the
          foliage to join him.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           Cooper, honestly, you're a bit of a-
                         
          She stops. Cooper is standing at a sheer cliff.
                         
          Spread out on the plain below is a massive, fortified base.
                         
          INT. CHINESE FORTIFIED COLONY -- DAY
                         
          Massive blast doors, long since smashed in, open onto a
          building that has been overrun by the local fractal wildlife.
                         
          Case steps inside first, his worklights flickering on. Cooper
          and the others follow him in.
                         
          INT. MESS HALL, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY
                         
          The room is barely recognizable -- the fractal life has
          covered the tables and chairs. Water pools on the floor and
          light streams in from a massive hole the fractal animals
          have punched in the ceiling.
                         
                          DOYLE
           Looks like the Chinese picked a fight
           with the locals.
                         
                          COOPER
           Looks like they lost.
                         
          They continue through the ruins.
                         
          INT. BARRACKS, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY
                         
          The deeper they go, the less fractal wildlife they find.
          The barracks are pristine -- hundreds of perfectly made beds,
          waiting for colonists who never came, like one of the bunkers
          the federal government used to keep in case of nuclear winter.
                         
                          DOYLE
           Look at the size of this place.
           They built it for thousands of people.
           But no one came.
                         
          Brand looks around, determined.
                         
                          BRAND
           They will. We can salvage it. This
           place will save us years.

                          COOPER
           But why didn't they come?

                          (SHRUGS)
           The Chinese government collapsed,
           same as ours. The people who knew
           about this mission probably died
           years ago. We had the same problems.
                         
          Roth finds a sign he likes the look of -- it points to the
          science levels.
                         
          INT. LABORATORY, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY
                         
          A massive door GRINDS open and the team steps into a massive
          complex of underground laboratories.
                         
          INT. DAMAGED LAB, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY
                         
          Cooper and the others carefully make their way through a lab
          that has been completely emptied -- no desks, no chairs,
          nothing. The only thing that remains is a solid ball of
          matter in the center of the room.
                         
                          BRAND
           What happened here?
                         
          Roth stares at the ball, intrigued.
                         
                          ROTH
           They were testing something.
                         
          Cooper looks at the walls, which are bowed inwards.
                         
                          COOPER
           Testing what?
                         
          Roth is looking at the ball, which appears to have been built
          from layers of different material. The outermost layer is
          flattened steel.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
                          (LOOKING CLOSER)
           Is that a chair?
                         
          Roth looks. The outermost layer of the ball indeed looks
          like a steel chair, flattened with incredible force onto
          surface of the ball.
                         
          Brand opens the door to the next lab.
           93.
                         
          INT. LABORATORY, CHINESE COLONY -- NIGHT
                         
          The lab is empty, except for a large metal sphere on a
          pedestal in the center of the room. A black box is set into
          a cavity in the sphere, wired to a control panel.
                         
          Cooper looks at the walls of the room, which have been bowed
          inwards, as if some great force had been pulling from the
          center of the room.
                         
                          COOPER
           Everything in here is bolted down.

           Let's find out.
                         
          Roth finds a control panel. Wipes off an inch of dust and
          begins tinkering with the controls.
                         
                          COOPER
           I wouldn't turn it on until we can
           figure out what it does, Roth.
                         
          Roth continues to look over the controls, oblivious.
                         
           BRAND (O.S.)
           Cooper. Come look at this.
                         
          Brand calls out from the hallway.

          beneath the lab level.
                         
          INT. OBSERVATORY, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY

          holographic representation of the local system.
                         
          Cooper joins Brand and Doyle in the map, looking at the
          incredibly detailed models of each star.
                         
          Case is standing at a terminal, hacking into the camp's
          records.

           No offense. Hang on.
                         
          Cooper punches a few keys into the terminal. Opens up the
          terminal. Scans the motherboard. Takes Case's rifle and
          SMASHES one of the chips on the board.
                         
          The terminal comes to life. Cooper hands Case his rifle.

          A tiny black hole soars through the system. Although it
          misses the ice planet, it deflects its orbit by a tiny degree.
          After a dozen more orbits, the ice planet dips down close to
          Pantagruel's event horizon and is torn apart.
                         
          Brand and the others watch as the sequence rewinds and repeats --
          the planet is pieced back together again and ejected, then

           place.
                         
          She looks at Cooper, questioning.
                         
                          COOPER
                          (GENTLE)
           Maybe... maybe Roth's right... maybe
           we just don't understand it yet.
                         
          She looks down. She knows he doesn't believe what he's
          saying. He's been right all along -- they're alone.
                         
          For a tiny moment, all hope is lost.
                         
          Suddenly, with a distant RUMBLE, the building begins SHAKING.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Case, what is that?
                         
                          CASE
           It's nighttime. The native life-
           forms are mobile again.
                         
          The RUMBLE grows more intense, as if the entire building is
          being gently shaken.
                         
                          COOPER
           No. It's closer than that.
                          (REALIZING)
           Roth.
                         
          The RUMBLE grows. As Cooper watches, Case's rifle slides
          free of the desk. But instead of falling, it simply hangs
          in the air.
                         
          Then he realizes the same thing is happening to them -- his
          boots no longer have traction with the ground. After a second
          everything in the room is floating an inch off of the ground.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Quick -- hold onto something.
                         
          He reaches out to Brand but it's too late -- suddenly they're
          no longer floating, they're falling.
                         
          They're falling up.
           97.
                         
          Cooper, Brand and the rest of them hit the ceiling. Cooper
          picks himself up and adjusts to his surroundings -- up is
          now down. He helps Brand up.
                         
                          DOYLE
           What the hell is happening?
                         
          Case doesn't answer -- he's looking up at the control
          equipment for the holographic display, which is GROANING
          under a load it was never built to handle.
                         
          Case grabs Cooper and Brand and pushes them towards the
          stairwell as the control panel TEARS free of the floor and
          CRASHES towards them.
                         
          Cooper falls into the stairwell -- now they're being pulled
          up and sideways through the stairwell, like an Escher
          painting.
                         
          Brand pushes Cooper out of the way as debris from the control
          panel orbits past them back up towards the lab.
                         
          They try to hang on but the force is becoming irresistible,
          dragging them along the wall of the stairwell and back towards
          the lab upstairs.
                         
          Brand wedges herself against the railing as objects and debris
          are SMASHING against the door to the lab.
                         
          Doyle is trying to hang onto the handrail but his grip slips
          and he CRIES OUT as he falls towards the door to the lab,
          SMASHING it open. Doyle disappears up and into the lab.
                         
          Cooper slips trying to help Doyle. Brand reaches out for
          him...
                         
          Too late. Cooper is pulled through the open door.
                         
          INT. INTACT LAB, CHINESE COLONY -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper is pulled through the door and past the control panel.
          He reaches out and grabs the underside of the panel.
                         
          He dangles, the panel cutting into the meat of his hand,
          trying to get his bearings:
                         
          Roth, Doyle, and everything that hasn't been bolted down is
          either pressed against the sphere in the center of the room
          or is orbiting around it.
                         
          Roth, who is laughing, jubilant, shouts up to him:
                         
                          ROTH
           The control panel is beneath you.
           See if you can turn it off.
           98.
                         
          Cooper slips as he tries to reach the controls. Finally he
          finds the controls for the machine.
                         
                          COOPER
                          (YELLS UP)
           I found it. Hold onto something.
                         
          Roth and Doyle crawl up the side of the mass and hold onto
          the support wires.
                         
          Cooper hits a key on the monitor.
                         
          Suddenly, the room inverts again, reverting to a normal
          gravitational field. Cooper floats for a second, then topples
          back to the ground, along with everything else.
                         
          Brand stumbles in to find Cooper sprawled on the floor as
          Roth and Doyle hang onto the sphere for dear life.
                         
          INT. INTACT LAB, CHINESE COLONY -- NIGHT
                         
          Roth, back on terra firma, is looking at the tiny black box
          he's pried from the center of the sphere. Cooper is looking
          over his shoulder.
                         
                          COOPER
           They found a way to make gravity.
                         
                          ROTH
           Not make it. Adjust it. Dial it
           up, or down. I think they were
           experimenting with it -- firing these
           into the black hole to try to save
           this planet.
                         
                          DOYLE
           All that from one tiny box.
                         
          Roth has hooked the box up to a terminal and it scrolling
          through the incredibly sophisticated machine code, trying to
          parse how it works. Cooper looks on.
                         
                          ROTH
                          (AMAZED)
           It barely uses any power. I'm only
           beginning to understand what it does
           but I think it sends a signal out
           into the bulk. It must tap into the
           same technologies that were used to
           create the wormholes in the first
           place.
                         
                          COOPER
           What does that mean?
           99.
                         
                          ROTH
           It means whoever built the wormhole
           probably doesn't exist inside our
           universe.
                         
          Cooper looks at the tiny box.
                         
                          COOPER
           But how did the Chinese develop the
           technology? This would take decades,
           maybe hundreds of years, to create.
                         
                          CASE
           Wherever they went, they found
           something that allowed them to build
           it.
                         
          Brand looks at the box.
                         
                          ROTH
           They came back here and tried to use
           these devices to save this planet.
           But they didn't work. Nothing would
           be strong enough to weaken a black
           hole.
                         
                          BRAND
           Maybe we could work with it. Try to
           improve it.
                         
                          ROTH
           No. You're missing the bigger
           picture. The robots had strict
           mission parameters. They were told
           to build a colony and report back.
           They tried to. But they failed.
           Like us they were fixated on this
           place.
                         
          Cooper looks at Brand.
                         
                          ROTH (CONT'D)
           They didn't realize they had already
           found something that would save us
           all.
           (holds up the box)
           This. This is the prize.
                         
          He holds up the box.
                         
                          ROTH (CONT'D)
           Don't you see? Earth's gravity is
           like a prison. But this is like a
           master key.

                          ROTH (CONT'D)
           If we could build more of these, we
           could turn down the earth's
           gravitational field enough to save
           millions of people. We wouldn't
           have to pick a handful of people to
           survive. With this we can save
           everyone.
                         
                          BRAND
           And go where?
                         
                          ROTH
           Wherever we want. We don't belong
           in any one place. Can't you see
           that now? Not Earth. Not this place.
           Nowhere. If the human race is going
           to survive, we need to keep moving.
           Split up. Spread out. Fly. With
           this, we can.
                         
          Case looks at the box. Makes a decision.
                         
                          CASE
           In the morning we're taking this and
           going home.
                         
          Doyle, Roth and Case set about making preparations to leave --
          gathering space suits, equipment.
                         
          In the bustle, Cooper finds Brand sitting alone, staring at
          the sample of fractal life.
                         
                          COOPER
           I know this isn't exactly what you
           trained for. But I think Roth might
           be right.
                         
                          BRAND
           That doesn't help this planet. This
           creature is doomed. Unlike us it
           doesn't have anywhere to go.
                         
          The fractal organism almost seems to be looking at her, trying
          to comprehend. But it quickly loses interest and goes back
          to breaking itself into pieces and reforming into different
          shapes, trying to escape. Brand sets it back down.
                         
                          CUT TO:

          Morning. Cooper and the others prepare to head out. They
          are laden down with gear -- space suits for the return trip
          to the lander once they reach the surface.

           nightfall.
                         
          Cooper stops. He puts a hand on Brand's shoulder. He points
          to the tree line. Something is moving.
                         
                          COOPER
           Don't make any sudden movements.

           Who?
                         
          Suddenly, three ROBOT MARINES step out of the jungle, weapons
          raised. They are wearing ghillie suits, pieced together
          from dried dead pieces of the local foliage.
                         
          Under their camouflage, they looks identical to Case. With
          one key difference -- faded red and gold insignias.
                         
          Case steps protectively in front of his team.
                         
          The CHINESE OFFICER steps forward, rifle levelled.

          Sergeant Liu speaks in the same even tones as Case -- they
          were probably built in the same factory before the war.
                         
          Case keeps his rifle raised.

          Liu's tone remains polite, but there's no hope of changing
          his mind. Cooper takes a sidelong glance at Brand.

          Brand points to the device Roth is holding. The Chinese
          robots seem particularly unhappy with this development.

          Case turns to look at Cooper.
                         
                          CASE
                          (LOW)
           Take the others up to the lander.

           don't come back for me.
                         
          Cooper nods.
                         
          Case moves. Fast. He FIRES one shot at the nearest robot,
          disabling it, then hurls himself at the remaining two,
          tackling them both over the edge of the ravine.
                         
          Cooper watches them disappear into the void below. Grabs
          Brand and the others.
                         
                          COOPER
           Come on.
                         
          Cooper picks up the rifle from the destroyed marine and begins
          hiking up the mountain.
                         
          EXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK -- DAY
                         
          The crew hike towards the ice above.
                         
          Below they hear a metallic BOOM as something heavy hits
          something else -- Case is still fighting. They keep moving.
                         
          EXT. UPPER MOUNTAIN PEAK -- TWILIGHT
                         
          They are high above the Marine camp, only fifty feet or so
          below the massive ice roof of the cavern. The Chinese have
          blasted a tunnel into the ice leading back up to the camp
          above.
           104.
                         
          This high, the air is bitterly cold. Cooper and the others
          are hunkered down, trying to keep warm, waiting for night to
          fall so that they can climb back up to the lander without
          being cooked by the neutron star.
                         
          Finally, above them, the light begins to flicker out. The
          crew begin pulling on their space suits.
                         
          Brand checks on the fractal wildlife in the sample case --
          she is bringing it with them. Cooper catches her eye.
                         
                          BRAND
           We can't leave them all to die.
                         
          She hefts the case and they begin climbing up into the ice.
                         
          EXT. SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
                         
          Brand leads the way, the lights from her suit cutting into
          the drifts of snow as they make their way slowly back to the
          lander.
                         
          As they reach the lander Cooper spots lights emerging from
          the ship. He raises Case's weapon.
                         
          One of Liu's marines steps around from the back of the lander.
          Cooper FIRES.
                         
          The marine collapses.
                         
          Cooper and the others race to the lander.

          Cooper points to a damaged section of the ship's hull -- the
          marine has torn open a section, revealing damaged hardware.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)

          Cooper looks down. They're stuck here.
                         
                          DOYLE

          Roth looks at the moons orbiting overhead.
                         
                          ROTH
           Can the secondary thrusters still
           fire on the lander?
                         
          Doyle looks over the craft.
                         
                          DOYLE
           Sure. But we don't have nearly enough
           power for lift off.
                         
          Roth holds up the small gravity black box.

          Roth sets off running towards the Chinese base camp.
                         
          EXT. CHINESE BASE CAMP, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper drags the pieces of the escape rocket out from the
          shelter. Assembly is semiautomatic -- Cooper lifts the pieces
          up and they snap together, forming a crude two-stage rocket
          designed more for a robot than a man.
                         
          When it's complete Roth wedges himself inside, clutching the
          black box -- he barely fits.
                         
                          ROTH
           I can reach one of the moons in low

                          ROTH
           You don't need this -- only the idea.
           The knowledge of how to build it.
                         
          Cooper remembers something. Heads back into the shelter.

          INT. CHINESE BASE CAMP, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
                         
          Roth follows Cooper into the lab.
                         
          Cooper opens the storage crate. Picks one of the probes at
          random. Sets it down on the bench next to Roth.
                         
          Cooper begins rigging up a connection between the two.
                         
                          COOPER
           I'm going to image the operating
           code and the architecture onto the
           probe's hard drive. It'll be garbled,
           but it should give you and me enough
           to rebuild it when we get back.
                         
          Cooper looks at the probe filling up with data.
                         
                          ROTH
           Not me. But you'll make it work.
                         
          The transfer is complete. Roth hands Cooper the probe, and
          takes the black box himself.
                         
                          ROTH (CONT'D)
           This is a one-way trip for me.

          Roth squeezes himself into the rocket, hugging the black box
          to his chest. Cooper and Brand help him.
                         
                          BRAND
           This isn't right, Roth. We can find

                          ROTH
           This is the only way. Keep the lander
           upright and fire the secondary
           boosters when the moon passes
           overhead.

           No. You need to make it home. You're
           going to need to build more of these.

          Behind her, Roth's rocket LAUNCHES on an explosive cloud.

           Someone's coming.
                         
          Cooper looks up. A robotlike figure is limping through the
          snowstorm towards them. Cooper raises the rifle.
                         
          Finally he makes out the insignia -- it's Case.
                         
          Cooper and Doyle run out towards him. They reach Case as he
          collapses in the snow. He's badly injured -- one leg torn
          off at the knee, one arm mangled.
                         
          Doyle and Cooper drag the crippled robot back into the ship.

          Brand is heading back out into the snow.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)

           Get that thing home.
                         
          Cooper steps to the door.
                         
          EXT. SPACE ABOVE ICE PLANET
                         
          The rocket tucks in close behind one of the moons orbiting
          the ice planet.
                         
          The rocket fires to maneuver closer and closer to the moon's
          surface -- the tiny moon doesn't provide enough gravity to
          attract it.
                         
          When the rocket is close enough, Roth detonates the explosive
          bolts holding him inside and leaps for the moon's surface.
                         
          He scrambles to grab hold of the craggy surface. Behind
          him, the rocket smashes apart against the surface.
                         
          Roth finally gets a good hold. He looks down.
                         
          Below him, the view is incredible -- the ice planet curving
          into the distance, Gargantua rising over its horizon.
                         
          Roth looks at the black box in his hands.
                         
          EXT. SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
                         
          Brand is a hundred yards from the lander by the time Cooper
          catches up with her. She is digging in the snow.
                         
          He takes her arm but she won't go.
                         
          She finally finds what she's looking for -- the sample case.
          The tiny fractal life-form is huddled at the bottom.
                         
          Cooper shakes his head and turns back to the lander.
           109.
                         
          EXT. MOON, SPACE OVER ICE PLANET
                         
          Roth is watching the ice planet pass by beneath him. He
          finally sees the distant peaks of the mountain range as it
          punctures the ice near the Chinese camp.
                         
          For a moment he enjoys the view -- the distant hulk of
          Gargantua rising over the horizon of the shining ice planet.
                         
          He takes a final breath and activates the black box.
                         
          Instantly, the moon's gravity is magnified a hundred million
          times over. Roth is instantly crushed as the moon collapses
          around him into a tiny sphere.
                         
          EXT. SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper and Brand are only thirty yards or so from the lander.
                         
          Suddenly, the ground beneath them begins to RUMBLE.
                         
          Cooper turns back. A mile back the ground begins to tear
          apart, heaving massive chunks of ice and rock into the sky.
                         
          Roth's moon is racing overhead, TEARING up a massive strip
          of the surface's planet as it nears them.
                         
          Cooper and Brand run.
                         
          EXT. MOON, SPACE OVER ICE PLANET
                         
          The energy being unleashed by the tiny box is incredible --
          millions of times more powerful than an atomic bomb.
                         
          The spray of debris is forming a rooster tail behind the
          moon, rocketing up from the planet's surface.
                         
          EXT. LANDER, SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper has almost made it back to the lander. Behind him,
          Brand stumbles. He turns back.
                         
          Brand is pulling herself up. Behind her, the THUNDEROUS
          EXPLOSIONS as a strip of the planet's surface is hurled into
          space have almost reached them.
                         
          Cooper looks at the ship. He'll never make it if he waits
          for Brand. He turns back to find her.
                         
          He reaches Brand just as the moon's gravity hits them --
          they're hurtled off into space. He grabs her hand.
                         
          Seconds later, everything -- the entire ice sheet, the sea
          and rocks deep below -- is hurled up after them.
           110.
                         
          Brand and Cooper embrace as they rocket up through the thin
          atmosphere.
                         
          Brand looks at him.
                         
                          BRAND
                          (RADIO)
           You caught me. Now what?
                         
          Cooper looks around. They planet's surface is breaking into
          pieces around them.
                         
                          COOPER
                          (RADIO)
           I don't know.
                          (RADIO)
           I figured if you were floating out
           into space, you'd want some company.
                         
          He holds onto her as they fall up and out of the last of the
          planet's thin atmosphere and the blackness embraces them.
                         
                          BRAND
           Between you and utter solitude,
           Cooper, frankly, I'm not sure.
                         
          They reach the apex of their climb and the gravity of the
          planet begins to win out. For a moment they float.
                         
                          COOPER
           Guess you were right -- too much
           gravity, or not enough.
                         
          He smiles, forgetting their predicament for a moment. They
          stare into each other's eyes.
                         
          Then they begin, very gently, to fall back towards the ice
          planet.
                         
          Suddenly, the lander maneuvers beneath them. The airlock
          opens to catch them -- Doyle is at the helm.
                         
          Brand and Cooper pull themselves aboard.
                         
          INT. LANDER
                         
          Cooper closes the door and Doyle rotates the lander outwards.
                         
          Doyle FIRES the engines and the lander continues ascending
          into space as the debris around them begins crashing back
          down towards the ice planet.
                         
          Cooper looks out the window:
           111.
                         
          The moon continues tearing up a massive canyon in the planet's
          surface as it circles out of view.
                         
                          COOPER
           Roth.
                         
                          BRAND
           He's gone.
                         
          Ahead, a shadow looms in the darkness: the Endurance.
                         
          INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE
                         
          Brand, Cooper, and Doyle pull themselves out of the airlock
          and scramble to take control of the ship.
                         
          Below them, the surface of the ice planet illuminates as the
          neutron star's x-rays begin to reach it from the far side of
          Pantagruel.
                         
          Doyle finally gets the ship straightened out. Its sole
          remaining engine FIRES, rocketing the ship back towards the
          dark side of the planet, out of view of the neutron star,
          and back towards the original wormhole.
                         
                          DOYLE
           I'm setting a course for the wormhole.
                         
          They're going to make it.
                         
          Cooper and Brand make eye contact -- Brand gives him a tiny
          awkward smile. He returns it, then descends below.
                         
          INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE
                         
          Cooper props Case up against the workbench. He pulls down
          replacement arms and legs from storage bins. Unwraps them
          from their vacuum sealed plastic and bolts them back onto
          Case's chassis.
                         
          Cooper finishes attaching the arm. Case rotates it, checking
          the function.
                         
                          COOPER
           How is that working?
                         
                          CASE
           Very well, thank you.
                         
                          COOPER
           Good. We've already set the course,
           skipper. We're going home.
                         
          Cooper hauls himself back up into the observation level.
           112.
                         
          INT. OBSERVATION LEVEL
                         
          Doyle is setting the controls. The ALARMS on the controls
          have finally abated -- they're out of the danger zone.
                         
                          BRAND
           We're safe now.
                         
          Cooper heads to the communications equipment.
                         
                          COOPER
           Now I know why we weren't able to
           hit the relay. It's not interference --
           the blue-shift from the black hole
           is more than we thought it would be.
                         
          Cooper begins re-calibrating the equipment.
                         
                          BRAND
                          (CONFLICTED)
           Cooper, wait--
                         
          The ship PINGS the relay on the far side of the wormhole.
                         
          There is no response.
                         
                          COOPER
           Nothing.
                          (THINKS)
           Wait. The ship cached one long
           garbled transmission when we first
           fell into the swirl. If we account
           for the blue shift then the computer
           might find something in there.
                         
          Cooper brings up the last garbled transmission they received.
          The computer begins re-analyzing it, piece by piece.
                         
                          BRAND
                          (QUIET)
           Listen to me -- the blueshift also
           means we've lost time. More time
           than we thought we would.
                         
          Cooper looks up at her.
                         
                          COOPER
           How much?
                         
                          BRAND
           A lot... Cooper, maybe it's best if
                          WE DON'T-
                         
          The comms equipment TONES as it translates a packet. Then
          another.
           113.
                         
          Then a FLOOD of communications, one packet a day, hundreds
          and hundreds of packets: images, videos, audio messages from
          family and friends.
                         
          Cooper watches, horrified, as the images play out across the
          screen. He is watching the lives of his family play out at
          light speed. Finally, the packets slow, then stop.
                         
          Cooper looks at the results, in shock.
                         
                          COOPER
           Forty seven years.
                         
          Doyle joins him, staring at the screen, stunned.
                         
                          DOYLE
           My kids...
                         
          Cooper tries to PING the relay again. Nothing comes back.
                         
                          BRAND
                          (GENTLE)
           The relay will have lost power years
           ago. That's why we couldn't contact
           it, even after we reached the planet.
                         
          Cooper is still problem solving, thinking.
                         
                          COOPER
           We could bypass the relay. Send a
           conventional shortwave signal.
                         
                          BRAND
           Only a tiny portion of the signal
           would make it though the wormhole.
           Besides, no one will be listening
           anymore.
                         
          The comms screen is dead. No movement. Nothing.
                         
          Cooper looks at Brand, realizing something.
                         
                          COOPER
           You knew, didn't you? You and Case
           figured it out when we landed.
                         
          Brand looks down.
                         
                          BRAND
           I thought... I couldn't be sure.
                         
                          COOPER
           Sure you could. You're brilliant.
           You know everything.
           114.
                         
                          BRAND
           Cooper... we needed to keep going.
           I'm so sorry. Your children...
                         
                          COOPER
           They're not children any more... if
           they're even still alive.
                         
          He turns away from her.
                         
                          BRAND
           Listen, the important thing is that
           we're going home, now. And we have
           something that can save everyone.
           It's more important than the people
           we left behind-
                         
          Doyle cuts her off, filled with anger.
                         
                          DOYLE
           That's easy for you to say. You
           didn't leave anyone behind.
                         
          Cooper looks at Brand, his anger softened by sadness.
                         
                          COOPER
           Yes she did.
                         
          Brand looks at him, grateful for this small kindness.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           That's why you were upset -- your
           father.
                         
          She looks down, filled with sadness.
                         
                          BRAND
           He's gone. But there are other people
           who still need our help. There's
           still time...
                         
          The ship's controls TONE in ALARM. Brand and Cooper turn:
                         
          Case is standing at the controls.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           Case... what are you doing?
                         
          Case finishes typing in a sequence on the command controls.
          Presses the "execute" button.
                         
          The last nuclear engine begins to detach from the ship.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)

          The robot turns from them. Cooper notices that the control
          module snapped into the back of Case's chassis is wrong:
                         
          It's red with a gold star. It's not Case at all. It's Liu.

           one follows...
                         
          Liu stares, satisfied, as the nuclear engine spins away from
          the ship and back down toward Pantagruel.
                         
          Cooper SMASHES Liu from behind. The robot tumbles to the
          ground, the fight gone out of him.
                         
          Cooper and Doyle roll the robot over and Cooper reaches for
          his control module.

          Cooper rips the module out. The robot freezes.
                         
          Brand is already at the controls, trying to regain control.

          The boosters are no match for the deadly pull of the black
          hole below them.
                         
          On the ship's guidance, they watch, helpless, as the ship
          climbs back up the volcano rim towards the critical orbit.
                         
          As on their first trip, the black hole grows to dominate the
          bottom of the sky, and the stars above them become streaks --
          time is speeding for them as they are whirled down into the
          deep gravity well around the hole.
                         
          As they watch, trapped, decades begin to play out in the

          Finally, the ice planet plunges past them towards destruction.
          As it reaches it slows, until finally it reaches the event
          horizon, just as they saw in the projections. Nothing has
          prepared them for the reality:
                         
          The ice planet is SMASHED apart with stunning violence.

          enough to launch the ship clear of the black hole, like a

          He drifts out from the ship.
                         
          Nothing. Behind him, the ship is a tiny speck in an ocean
          of darkness.
                         
          INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM, ENDURANCE
                         
          Cooper sits down. Turns on the screen.
                         
          After a moment, the camera turns on. Tom, his eldest son,
          still 15 years old, turns on the camera.
                         
                          TOM
           Hi, Dad.
                         
          Cooper pauses it. He can't take it. After a moment, he
          lets it run again.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           I met another girl, Dad. I really
           think this is the one.
                         
          Tom holds up a picture of himself and a teenage GIRL.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           Murph stole Grandpa's car. He crashed
           it. He's OK, though. No broken
           bones.
                         
          Cooper leans back.
                         
          INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM, ENDURANCE
                         
          Cooper is holed up, still watching, several days' growth of
          beard unshaved. He's been watching for days.
                         
          On the screen, Tom is a grown man in his 20s.
           122.
                         
                          TOM
           I've got a surprise for you, Dad.
           You're a grandpa.
                         
          Tom holds up an infant wrapped tight in swaddling. The kid
          is BAWLING.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           Congratulations. Grandpa said he
           already earned the "great" bit so we
           just leave it at that.
                         
          The screen cuts out.
                         
          The next message begins. Tom is in his 30s.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           Hi, Dad. I'm sorry it's been awhile.
                         
          He stops, emotional.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           Grandpa died last week. We buried
           him out in the back forty, next to
           Mom.
                          (LOOKS DOWN)
           Where we'd have buried you, if you'd
           ever come back.
                         
          He laughs, gallows humor.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           Murph was there for the funeral.
           It's been a few years since I've
           seen him. He's been down in the
           Gulf Coast. He's an engineer. I
           guess someone followed in your
           footsteps after all.
                         
          Tom looks down.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           You're not listening to this. I
           know that. All of these messages
           are just out there, drifting in the
           darkness.
                         
          He stops for a second.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           You're gone. You're never coming
           back. And I've known that for a
           long time. Lois says -- that's my
           wife, Dad -- she says I have to let
           you go. So I am.
           123.
                         
          He reaches up to turn off the camera.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           Wherever you are, I hope you're at
           peace. Goodbye, Dad.
                         
          The image freezes, Tom's hand on the camera, then breaks
          apart into digital noise.
                         
          Then nothing.
                         
          Cooper looks at it for a second. Then rises to leave.
                         
          Suddenly, the screen flickers to life again.
                         
          A good-looking man in his late 30s turns on a camera. Cooper
          recognizes him instantly. It's Murph.
                         
          Murph looks at the camera for a long beat, clearly unsure
          about this.
                         
                          MURPH
           Hello, Dad. You sonofabitch.
                         
          He laughs, self-conscious.
                         
                          MURPH (CONT'D)
           It's your 60th birthday today.
           Thought I would celebrate with you a
           bit.
                          (BEAT)
           I guess I understand why you left.
           The corn is dying now, too.
           Tom says there's less and less at
           harvest every year.
                         
          He pauses. Lifts up his hand and scratches his stubble.
                         
          Cooper pauses the message. He looks carefully at the screen:
                         
          Murph is wearing his dad's watch.
                         
          Cooper lets the message play. Tears are streaming down his
          face.
                         
                          MURPH (CONT'D)
           Rot's setting in. I guess you were
           right for clearing out while you had
           the chance.
           (reaches up to switch
                          OFF CAMERA)
           Good luck, old man. I hope you made
           it. I really do.
                         
          The video cuts out.
           124.
                         
          A message appears on the screen:
                         
          "Final transmission." Relay powered down 05232087
                         
          Cooper turns off the screen.
                         
          INT. CREW QUARTERS, ENDURANCE
                         
          Cooper is seated, alone. Almost every compartment has been
          opened and emptied -- debris is swirling through the
          compartment.
                         
          Brand walks in. They sit in silence for a moment. When
          Cooper speaks, it's clear his sadness has faded to a gallows
          humor.
                         
                          COOPER
           Not a single drink on the whole ship.
           What kind of mission is this?
                         
                          BRAND
           I think Doyle's been experimenting
           with the coolant from his spacesuit.
                         
          They sit in silence for a moment.
                         
                          COOPER
           You really think we're the last humans
           alive anywhere?
                         
                          BRAND
           I don't know. Maybe.
           (looks him in the eye)
           Yes.
                         
                          COOPER
           So that's it, then? That's all?
                         
          He looks down, saddened by his own words.
                         
                          BRAND
                          (QUIET)
           It's happened a billion times over.
           Stars explode. The pieces drift in
           space. Gravity pulls them back
           together. They form new stars.
           Then planets. Then us. We die. It
           starts all over again.
                         
          Cooper shakes his head.
                         
                          COOPER
           What about the plan? The grand
           scheme.
           125.
                         
                          BRAND
           I thought you didn't believe in one.
                         
                          COOPER
           I didn't. But you were bringing me
           round.
                         
          He laughs, his anger coming and going in waves.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           What the hell was the point? What
           did it add up to?
                         
                          BRAND
           I don't know. Maybe it just adds up
           to this.
                         
                          COOPER
           This? You're saying the end result
           of ten billion years is the atoms
           from dead stars standing here
           disagreeing with each other.
                         
          She smiles at him. Bittersweet.
                         
                          BRAND
           Maybe that's enough.
                         
          He turns away from her. She takes his shoulder.
                         
          She pulls him into a kiss. His surprise disappears and he
          pulls her to him, kissing her back.
                         
          Their surroundings forgotten, they drift. She LAUGHS gently
          as they bump into a wall and he pushes off of it, sending
          them spinning back into the center of the cabin.
                         
          She pulls his shirt off and it hangs in space. In moments,
          the cabin is filling with discarded clothes, different colors
          and shapes, like a ticker tape parade.
                         
          In the center of the cabin, Brand and Cooper make love.
                         
          INT. CREW QUARTERS, ENDURANCE -- LATER
                         
          Cooper and Brand embrace, sleeping, drifting in the cabin.
                         
          Suddenly, Doyle's voice calls out from the other cabin.
                         
           DOYLE (O.S.)
           It's happening... it's happening
           again... Get up here...
                         
          Cooper wakes, careful not to disturb Brand. He plucks his
          shirt from the floating laundry pile and pulls it on.
           126.
                         
          INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE
                         
          Cooper hauls himself up into the upper cabin. Doyle is
          standing in the middle of the chamber.
                         
                          DOYLE
           They just appeared.
                         
          A sphere of distortion, like the one they encountered in the
          first wormhole, is directly in front of Doyle, hovering at a
          point in the middle of the cabin.
                         
          Doyle points a finger gently at the sphere, which grows in
          response.
                         
          Brand pulls herself into the cabin. Several more points
          appear, as if they've been summoned by the first.
                         
          Some of the points twist, some of them spin, and some of
          them are motionless.
                         
                          BRAND
           I think these are the creatures that
           built the wormhole.
                         
          One of them begins to move closer to Cooper.
                         
                          COOPER
           This thing is made of... gravity?
                         
                          BRAND
           No. I don't think it's in our
           universe at all. I think it lives
           in the bulk -- the space that the
           wormholes traverse. And it can only
           interact with us using gravity.
                         
          The shape playfully grows around Cooper's hand, bending the
          space it's in, stretching the skin.
                         
          Doyle GASPS as the sphere nearest him moves through his body,
          coming to rest in the middle and bending his entire torso
          like a fun house mirror.
                         
          Suddenly, the sphere wrapped around Cooper's hand begins
          moving, tugging him gently through the cabin.
                         
          In the next moment, all three of them are being propelled
          through the cabin.
                         
          It's a magical moment -- a communion, a dance between
          creatures on either side of a massive, invisible wall.
                         
          Doyle exclaims like a kid on a roller coaster as he is whirled
          around the room.
           127.
                         
          Cooper and Brand collide with each other for a second as the
          bulk beings move them through space. They hold onto each
          other for a moment and then are pulled apart again as the
          whirling dance continues.
                         
          Even the fractal creature is involved -- inside its cage, a
          tiny distortion ripples its fractal skin. The creature breaks
          apart and plays with the distortion around its enclosure.
                         
          Finally, Brand disengages from the dance and pulls herself
          around the lab, looking for some way to try to communicate
          with the creatures.
                         
          She finds two heavy pieces of engineering equipment and moves
          them close to each other, then far apart.
                         
          The bulk beings soon join her, mimicking the motion of the
          pieces of equipment.
                         
                          COOPER
           Can we communicate with them?
                         
                          BRAND
           Where would we even start? Maybe--
                         
          She pull a bag of ball bearings out of a storage bin and
          tears the bag open, releasing a cloud of the tiny shining
          globes into the air.
                         
          For a moment, nothing happens. Then, the distortions begin
          moving through the bearings, shifting them, rearranging them
          into patterns in the air.
                         
          First, they rearrange the ball bearings into clusters, then
          shapes spinning around each other -- planets orbiting around
          a medium-sized star.
                         
                          DOYLE
           That's our solar system.
                         
          After a moment the ball bearings break apart again and
          rearrange into a larger, more complicated system -- Gargantua,
          Pantagruel, and the ice planet.
                         
          Finally, the bearings compress to a two-dimensional sheet.
          Inside the sheet, one solitary ball bearing orbits around
          the stars and then pushes up, off of the sheet, into an
          umbrella shaped space that rises up from the sheet.

          Cooper and Doyle stare at the particle. The map is static
          now.
                         
          Cooper looks around. The distortions have gone. The
          instruments on the ship TONE in alarm.
                         
          Cooper walks through the map, sending the ball bearings
          scattering. He hurries to the instruments. The ship is
          moving -- picking up speed at a huge rate.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)

          The ship begins to close in on something in the darkness: a
          tiny point of light.
                         
          As they grow closer, they realize that it's an opening.
          They are inside a massive, hollow sphere. They have been
          the entire time.
                         
          The ship is guided out through the opening at the crown of
          the sphere.
                         
          Below them is an astonishing sight:
                         
          Our entire universe, compressed into a flattened disc, like
          a floor of stars. They are hovering above it, in the bulk,
          the space between universes.

          Brand and the others stare at the incredible display.
                         
          The ship drops down and begins to orbit around the massive
          hollow sphere between them and our universe, lower and lower
          until it is skimming just above the surface of the sphere.
                         
          In the distance, they can make out a cluster of lights.
                         
                          COOPER
           There's something out there.
                         
          The cluster of lights grows as they are propelled closer:
           129.
                         
          It's a massive space station, built onto the surface of the
          sphere.

          decks of the space station.
                         
          After a moment, the airlock to the ship opens and Cooper and
          the others step out, in their suits.
                         
          They walk up to the airlock doors of the station, which open
          automatically.

          After the airlock decompresses, the inner doors open.
          Standing there, waiting for them, is a familiar figure:
                         
          Tars.

           Time. That's what the bulk beings

          Brand looks around. The facility is massive. She sets the
          specimen case down on a table. Even the tiny creature seems
          in awe of the place.
                         
          INT. LABORATORY, SPACE STATION
                         
          Tars shows them a prototype for the gravity machine. It is
          tiny -- increasing G around two spheres that attract each
          other with a tiny force.

          A massive reinforced-concrete shell shudders with the energy
          contained within it. The whole room HUMS with power.
                         
          Tars pulls up a display showing the inside of the shell:
                         
          A tiny black hole spins, spewing out massive amounts of power.
           131.
                         
                          TARS

           of the big bang. It will power this
           place forever.

          INT. SIMULATION ROOM
                         
          In the center of the room is a giant holographic globe of
          the Earth, perfect down to the tiniest detail.
                         
                          COOPER
           It's a map?
                         
                          TARS
           No. Not a map. This is a simulation
           of the Earth. A perfect simulation.
                         
          Tars touches the control panel. The map zooms in over Europe.
          Down onto Paris. Late 20th century:
                         
          People walk through the streets. A woman stops at a newsagent
          to buy a newspaper.
                         
          Tars touches the controls again and the map zooms out.
                         
                          TARS (CONT'D)
           They tested each of the technologies
           hundreds of times, trying to find
           the one that would cause the least
           damage and still allow us to leave
           Earth.
                         
          Suddenly, the map lights up with atomic explosions in every
          city. The sequence stops, rewinds.
                         
          This time, sped up, the Earth seems to be drying up -- great
          swaths of desert grow across Europe and Asia. Massive
          circular ships are constructed all over the face of the Earth.
                         
                          TARS (CONT'D)
           This was their best solution. A
           massive version of the box we found
           on the ice planet, allowing the entire
           human population to escape.
                         
          At a given moment, the gravity of the Earth is dropped to
          nothing and the massive ships, filled with the entire
           132.
                         
          population of the Earth, lift gently off of the planet in
          search of greener pastures.
                         
          Cooper turns away from the machine, bitter.
                         
                          COOPER
           So why didn't they return? Why didn't
           they save us?
                         
          Brand is staring at the massive map.
                         
                          BRAND
           Because they were too late. By the
           time they found this place, the people
           who sent them were dead. They were
           unable to fulfill their mission.
                         
          Tars points to the next room.
                         
                          TARS
           That was the final problem they tried
           to solve.
                         
          Tars moves on.
                         
          EXT. PLATFORM, SPACE STATION
                         
          Above them, the blackness of the sky is punctuated with
          hundreds of crystal shapes, faintly leaking starlight:
                         
          Wormholes. Brand looks up at them, entranced.
                         
                          BRAND
           Where do they lead?
                         
          Tars looks at an illuminated schematic on one wall, mapping
          some of the wormholes.
                         
                          TARS
           There are millions of them, connecting
           virtually every planetary system in
           the universe. There are thousands
           in our galaxy alone. But the Chinese
           stopped mapping them when they found
           what they were looking for.
                         
          Tars walks further. He stops.
                         
          The platform in front of them is dominated by a gigantic
          version of the black box that Roth found on the ice planet,
          connected to a massive power array, and pointing into the
          dark space above the sphere.
           133.
                         
                          TARS (CONT'D)
           This was their final creation. They
           had to capture the mini black hole
           just to have enough power to try it.
                         
          Several miles above the black box, one of the wormholes glows
          far brighter than the others, crackling with radiation.

           What does it do?
                         
          Cooper steps forward. Runs a hand on the cold, strange
          material the antenna is made out of. He knows exactly what
          it does.
                         
                          COOPER
           They weren't interested in the other
           wormholes because their mission was
           to return home. That one leads back
           to Earth. The Earth they were told
           to return to.
                         
          Tars walks to the controls for the device.

                          TARS
           It was only used once. The Chinese
           team attempted to travel back in
           time, to Earth just a few years after
           they had left.

                          COOPER
           We're going to find out.

           Yes, I do. If it worked, the Chinese
           would have suddenly discovered all
           of these incredible technologies.
           But they never made it.
                          (BEAT)
           You can't go back, Cooper. You can
           slow things down, but you can't ever
           go back. Our home is gone.
           (off his look)
           You listened to all of those messages
           from your family. If you had made
           it back, we would already know.
           There would already be some evidence.
                         
          Cooper looks at the machine.

           Roth was right, Cooper. We have to

           have an obligation to try to survive.
           From here we could find a thousand

          Cooper takes the sample and looks at the tiny creature inside,
          trying to escape. He sets it inside the ship. Turns back
          to her.

          to the ship.
                         
          She pulls herself onto the ship. Cooper steps back outside
          and watches through the tiny window as the Endurance lifts
          off and disappears into the darkness.

          The two men sit in silence as the ship arcs away from the
          space station and closes in on the wormhole.
                         
          Cooper hears a familiar CHIRP. He turns around:
           137.
                         
          The probe they took from the ice planet is belted securely
          into one of the seats, filled with the garbled machine code
          of the gravitational machine.

           Rebuild the gravity machine.
                         
          Cooper stares at it, suddenly realizing something. He
          unbuckles himself.
                         
          Cooper stands and walks over to the probe. Traces the
          familiar stars and stripes carved into its side.

           probe I found in Galveston.
                         
          Below them, the wormhole breaks as it reaches another wormhole
          mouth that the Chinese have dropped down to a lower gravity
          well, creating a time machine.
                         
          The wormhole mouth is FLARING with radiation.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)

           But only this. Everything will be
           destroyed except for this.
                         
          He moves toward Doyle. Doyle stands.

          Cooper moves closer to Doyle. Doyle pulls out the flair
          gun. Points it at Cooper.
                         
                          COOPER
           You don't need to do this. We won't
           make it back, but this does. The
           secrets are already right on it.

          As the ship speeds toward the next wormhole, the radiation
          suddenly FLARES, annihilating the ship and everything in it.

          The ancient plane skirts the San Gabriels.
                         
          EXT. FIELD, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND
                         
          Murph sets the plane down.
                         
          He parks the plane under a copse of trees and climbs down.
                         
          He scans the horizon. Nothing. Is this the place?
                         
          EXT. FOREST -- DAY
                         
          Murph pushes his way through the undergrowth. Stops.
                         
          He's standing at the blast doors to the facility. They've
          been blown open with dynamite.
                         
          INT. NASA FACILITY -- DAY
                         
          Murph lets himself inside. Lights a flare.
                         
          The place has been gutted. Thieves and scavengers have taken
          almost everything.
                         
          Murph finds one of the robots, or what's left of it -- it's
          been stripped, leaving only the bare composite skeleton.
          The empty eye sockets stare back at Murph.
                         
          Murph looks around the place. There is nothing left to
          salvage. He turns to leave. Hears a familiar CHIRP.
                         
          In the corner, under a pile of rain-soaked garbage:
           141.
                         
          The probe.
                         
          No one has bothered to steal it. Murph stares at it.
                         
          INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- NIGHT
                         
          Murph sweeps detritus off of an ancient computer mainframe
          that survived the looting. He hooks the probe up to it.
                         
          After a minute, the screen fills with a picture of an ice-
          covered planet. Then nothing. The rest of the probe's drive
          is filled with garbage, noise.
                         
          Murph switches off the screen.
                         
          He stands. Begins to leave without the probe. Stops. Turns
          back. Picks it up and takes it with him.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, MURPH'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          Murph is hunched over the probe, trying to pull data off of
          it with a defibrillator. He has incorporated an ancient
          laptop into the chain, and is tweaking values on it, trying
          to decrypt the contents.
                         
          His WIFE, several months pregnant, turns back to him from
          the stove.
                         
                          MURPH'S WIFE
           Would you get that thing off of the
           table?
                         
          Murph nods, absorbed. Keys in a final tweak to the decryption
          software. Hits return.
                         
          Suddenly, the screen begins filling with data.
                         
          Murph stares at it, wide eyed.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          INT. BARN -- NIGHT
                         
          Murph, now in his 40s, is putting the finishing touches on a
          large machine. Although slightly different, we recognize
          some of the components and their configuration:
                         
          It's a crude version of the gravitational device.
                         
          Murph double checks it, then fires up a small gas powered
          generator. Throws a breaker, feeding power to the unit.
                         
          The unit lights up. HUMS. But nothing happens.
           142.
                         
          Murph, disappointed but undaunted, shuts it down and begins
          checking it over. He hears a noise at the door. Turns back.
          His daughter, Emily, 8, is standing at the door.
                         
                          EMILY COOPER
           Dad? You said you'd take us to the
           game.
                         
                          MURPH
                          (DISTRACTED)
           Did I?
                         
          He looks at the impossible nest of wires. Shakes his head.
                         
                          MURPH (CONT'D)
           All right. Let me get my jacket.
                         
          Murph picks up his jacket from the workbench. Next to it on
          the bench is a shortwave radio playing STATIC.
                         
                          EMILY COOPER
           (staring at machine)
           What is it supposed to do, Dad?
                         
                          MURPH
           I have no idea.
                         
          Murph switches off the lights and they walk out.
                         
          After a moment, the radio CRACKLES to life in the darkness.
                         
                          COOPER

           This is the crew of the Endurance...
           Murph... I'm sorry...
                         
          The signal crackles out.

          INT. KITCHEN, MURPH'S HOUSE -- DAY
                         
          Murph, 50s, slightly gray, sits at his kitchen table. He
          hears a distant RUMBLE.
                         
          He looks up. His wife is standing by the sink.
                         
                          MURPH
           Where's Emily?
                         
                          WIFE
           Out in the barn. She's been tinkering
           with your old projects.
           143.
                         
          Murph stands up. The roof of the barn is visibly shaking.
          He steps outside.
                         
          EXT. YARD, MURPH'S HOUSE -- DAY
                         
          Murph moves towards the barn, concerned. The shaking is
          growing stronger -- the entire structure is buckling.
                         
          Emily, now 18, backs out of the barn.
                         
                          EMILY COOPER
           Dad... I'm sorry... I made some
           changes to the machine. I think I
           did something wrong.
                         
          Murph puts an arm around his daughter and as they watch, the
          entire barn IMPLODES. Their tractor begins sliding towards
          the wreckage of the barn, chunky tires plowing up the soil.
                         
          Finally, the RUMBLING STOPS as the power lines short out in
          a FIERY display.
                         
          As the dust clears, Murph and his daughter examine the mess:
                         
          The entire barn has been crushed into a tiny ball.
                         
          Murph looks at his daughter.
                         
                          MURPH
           Do you remember what you changed?
                         
          Wide-eyed, she thinks about it. Then nods.

          This is North America. But it doesn't look much like it.
                         
          Mother Nature has just about wiped the slate clean. Most of
          the vegetation is gone, and unchecked winds sweep across the
          barren plains. Patches of ice lie think on the ground, as
          if a heavy snow has come and gone.
                         
          SUPER TITLE: "TWO HUNDRED YEARS LATER"
                         
          One of the Chinese spaceships descends through the thick
          clouds above and settles gently onto the plain.
                         
          The hatch opens and Cooper steps out. He takes a cautious
          look around. He is holding the fractal life in its small
          container.
                         
          The clouds are threatening, but the weather looks calm enough
          right here.
           144.
                         
          Cooper starts to walk.
                         
          EXT. COLLAPSED HOUSE -- DAY
                         
          Remarkably, part of Cooper's old house is still standing.
                         
          INT. COLLAPSED HOUSE -- DAY
                         
          Cooper stands in the middle of his kitchen. Two walls are
          missing and the rest is collapsed in a heap. But he can
          still see where he used to feed his kids breakfast.
                         
          He has kept his promise. Several hundred years too late.
                         
          Cooper hunkers down, staring at the space where his kids
          used to be. Rainwater covers the ancient formica.
                         
          It has taken him years to finally reach this place. He has
          had plenty of time to come to grips with what he might find.
          But nothing has prepared him for this:
                         
          He is completely alone. Nothing is left.
                         
          INT. COLLAPSED FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper is still sitting there when the ice storm hits.
                         
          Unchecked by trees or vegetation, the wind rockets through
          the house, blasting Cooper and pelting what's left of the
          structure with fist-sized hail.
                         
          Cooper takes shelter against the remaining wall. He's going
          to have to sit this one out -- the hail and winds are the
          brutal descendants of the weather he knew. They'll finish
          him off if he steps back outside.
                         
          As he watches, the pool of water on the kitchen floor freezes
          over in seconds.
                         
          INT. COLLAPSED FARMHOUSE -- DAWN
                         
          Cooper shivers, pressed against the wall. The storm is still
          raging outside. He is freezing to death. He has to move
          now or he will die. He pulls the hood tight around his face
          and stumbles outside.
                         
          EXT. SNOWBOUND FIELD -- DAY
                         
          Cooper makes his way through the blinding snow. He tries to
          find his way, but the ship has been consumed by the blizzard.
                         
          He stumbles to the ground, dropping the glass case with the
          fractal wildlife in it. The case shatters.
                         
          Cooper tries to stand back up, but his strength is dwindling.
           145.
                         
          As he watches, the fractal wildlife creeps tentatively out
          of its broken habitat. It forms together against the cold.
                         
          After a moment, it burrows into the ice. As it does, the
          ice glows faintly. It seems to be right at home.
                         
          Cooper laughs, glimpsing the outline of a plan. Was this
          what the beings who made the wormhole intended all along?
                         
          Cooper suddenly spots the outline of the ship through the
          driving snow. He stumbles back up to his feet and struggles
          a few more steps, then stumbles again, spent.
                         
          Finally, he sits down in the snow to die.
                         
          As his senses flicker in and out, he is struck with memories
          of his boys, so vivid he reaches out for them, crawling
          forward in the snow.
                         
          He stops, and laughs, remembering what Case told him about
          what happens when humans die.
                         
          He struggles to his feet and stumbles a few more feet,
          eventually coming to rest just steps from the ship.
                         
          Cooper takes a final step. Finally, he collapses under his
          ship, as the wind continues to HOWL around him.
                         
          As the snow clears for a moment, Cooper is alone on a vast
          arctic tundra. He will die alone.

          Cooper wakes.
                         
          He is in a sunlit room. A breeze rustles the curtains as it
          makes its way in through a large open window.
                         
          Cooper sits up. As he a does, a control panel on the wall
          TONES gently, as if in response to his movement.
                         
          He stands and looks around. He can see sunlight through the
          open windows and hear people -- kids YELLING as they play.
          He moves toward the window. Reaches for the curtains. Before
          he can, the door opens behind him.
                         
          A WOMAN in a white coat steps in, smiling warmly.
                         
                          DOCTOR
           Good morning. Don't go outside just
           yet, Mr. Cooper.

                          DOCTOR (CONT'D)
           (offers him a pill)
           This will help with the
           disorientation.
                         
          Cooper opens his mouth to talk, but his voice is cracked.
          He gives up. Swallows the pill.
                         
                          DOCTOR (CONT'D)
           Wait a minute for that to take effect.
           It can be a bit of an adjustment.
           (looks him over)
           You had some frostbite. Nothing too
           serious.
                         
          As she talks, Cooper looks past her to the window.
                         
                          COOPER
           Where am I?
                         
                          DOCTOR
                          (SMILES)
           It's a bit of a coincidence, really.
           When the rangers found you, we were
           the nearest facility.
                         
                          COOPER
           What's coincidence? What is this
           place?
                         
                          DOCTOR
           We have a lot to show you.
                         
          The doctor reaches for the curtains. She offers him a hand.
          Cooper declines the help and steps outside.
                         
          EXT. HOSPICE, COOPER STATION -- DAY
                         
          Cooper is standing on a rooftop deck of a four-story building
          in a medium-sized city surrounded by fields. But as the
          road and the buildings stretch into the distance, the
          landscape curves up, not down.
                         
          The entire landscape is contained within a huge cylinder-
          shaped space station.
                         
          Cooper stumbles, and reaches instinctively out. The doctor
          catches him.
                         
                          DOCTOR
           You're OK. We get this from people
           who move here from planetary colonies
           all the time.
           147.
                         
                          COOPER
           Where... where are we?
                         
                          DOCTOR
           Like I said. It was a coincidence.
           There was a facility closer to Earth,
           but they had a problem, so you wound
           up here.
           (off his look)
           This is the Space Station Joseph A.
           Cooper.
                         
          Cooper takes in the incredible surroundings. A thousand
          feet above them, black specks are sprinkled over an ocean of
          green -- Jersey milking cows grazing in a field of wild grass.
                         
                          DOCTOR (CONT'D)
           I've got someone who wants to meet
           you.
                         
          Cooper looks at her.
                         
          INT. INTENSIVE CARE ROOM, HOSPICE, COOPER STATION -- DAY
                         
          Cooper steps inside. The room is dark, still, the only noise
          is the labored RATTLE of an old man struggling to breathe.
                         
          Cooper steps closer to the bed. The man's skin is paper-
          thin. He is ancient.
                         
                          DOCTOR
           He was moved here after they found
           you. He's a little old for a
           transfer, but they made an exception.
                         
          Cooper hovers at the back of the room, unsure. He turns to
          the doctor, questioning. Then he notices the pictures on
          the old man's desk:
                         
          There are dozens of them. Children, grandchildren. Then
          the older ones -- the man's own parents. Grandparents.
          Cooper spots a tiny framed picture with someone he recognizes:
                         
          Murph, 80 years old, surrounded by his daughter and her
          family. They are standing in front of a re-opened Cape
          Canaveral, and a huge spaceship under construction.
                         
          Cooper picks up the picture and stares at it.
                         
          The doctor points to a shy little boy hiding behind Murph's
          leg in the picture.
                         
                          DOCTOR (CONT'D)
           That's him.
           148.
                         
          She points to the old man lying in the bed.
                         
                          DOCTOR (CONT'D)
           His name is Anthony Welling. Anthony
           Cooper Welling.
                          (SMILES)
           He's your great great grandson.
           He's been waiting a long time for
           you.
                         
          Cooper's eyes well with tears. He steps over to the bed and
          looks down at the ancient man, teetering on the edge of death.
                         
          The old man looks at him, eyes widening in excitement. He
          strains, trying to reach the bedside table. He's trying to
          reach the drawer. Cooper helps him open it.
                         
          Inside is a simple, familiar wristwatch. The old man
          carefully takes out the watch. He gives the watch a few
          winds and, hands shaking, offers it to Cooper.
                         
          Cooper, eyes filling with tears, closes his hand over the
          old man's hand, enveloping both the watch and the man's hand.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          EXT. CORNFIELD, COOPER STATION -- MORNING
                         
          Cooper is sitting in a well-appointed office. A middle-aged
          BUREAUCRAT smiles at him from the far side of a huge desk.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           You're a hero, Mr. Cooper. Let's
           just start off by saying that. It's
           an incredible and... unexpected honor
           to have you here with us.
                         
          Cooper smiles, uncomfortable.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D)
           None of us would be here without the
           efforts of you and the other
           crewmembers of the Endurance.
           (smiles, unconvincingly)
           So I don't want you to take this the
           wrong way. But there are some
           questions I've been told to ask.
                         
          The man looks petrified, like he's been instructed to grill
          George Washington on his expense reports.
                         
                          COOPER
           Shoot.
           149.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           The rangers who found you reported
           that you had released a sample of an
           alien life-form into the wild. Which
           is, unfortunately, against
           regulations.
                         
                          COOPER
           It was last of its kind. Their planet
           was destroyed.
                         
          The administrator cues up a series of images on his computer.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           The rangers attempted to isolate the
           life-form, but it had already spread
           out of control. It seems to be
           thriving.
                         
          He shows Cooper a satellite image of north america. A
          considerable portion of the frozen tundra is glowing.
                         
          Cooper begins laughing. Which makes the administrator even
          less comfortable.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D)
           Can you tell me why you... elected
           to release the life-form back on
           earth?
                         
          Cooper is still laughing.
                         
                          COOPER
           Because that was the plan.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           Whose plan?
                         
                          COOPER
                          (SMILES)
           I don't know.
                         
          The administrator tries to smile back. Makes a few notes in
          his file. Changes the subject.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           My assistant tells me you've applied
           for a position with the exploration
           fleet.
                         
                          COOPER
           Feel like I should be pulling my
           weight.
           150.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           That's admirable, Mr. Cooper. The
           truth is, most of the fleet's
           personnel are automated. There are
           a small number of crewed ships. But
           there are great numbers of candidates.
           Very well trained candidates.
                         
                          COOPER
           I was hoping to enroll in a course.
           Try to get myself up to speed on the
           new systems.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           I don't want you to take this the
           wrong way, Mr. Cooper -- like I
           said, you're a hero. But the truth
           is we have somewhat limited resources.
                         
          Cooper remembers this conversation. He looks down.
                         
                          COOPER
           No one's heard anything from Brand?
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           I'm sorry. Officially, she's been
           listed as missing for over 200 years.
           Mind you, I guess you turned up
           eventually, didn't you?
                         
                          COOPER
           Am I really going to hurt anybody by
           going to look for her? I just need
           a small ship. I made a promise.
                         
          The bureaucrat looks down. Is he really going to have to
          tell this guy the lay of the land?
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           Listen. Mr. Cooper. You're a hero.
           You're the oldest man in the human
           race. Don't you want to take it
           easy?
           (off his look)
           I hope you understand, we all you
           hold you in the highest possible
           regard.
                          (QUIET)
           Which is why they're never going to
           let you go off by yourself in a
           spaceship. I'm sorry.
                         
          Cooper looks at his hands. He's got a couple centuries on
          the bureaucrat in Earth years, but looks ten years younger.
          He puts his hands in his pockets.
           151.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D)
           I've got some good news, however.
                          (BIG SMILE)
           We all know about your early life,
           Mr Cooper. I wrote a paper on it
           when I was a boy. And I think we
           found something you'll really enjoy.
                         
          EXT. CORNFIELD, COOPER STATION -- DAY
                         
          Corn blows in an artificial breeze. A red tractor makes its
          way through the field, which curves gently up in the distance.
                         
           ADMINISTRATOR (V.O.)
           The machines do most of the work, of
           course, but we were able to get you
           a few acres. You're going to be a
           farmer again.
                         
          After a moment, the tractor stops. Cooper climbs down from
          the seat. Looks at the front steering linkage, which is
          jammed with an errant tree branch. He wipes his forehead
          and begins working the branch out of the machine.
                         
          He looks miserable.
                         
          A robot, a similar unit to Tars, walks over. Offers Cooper
          a bottle of water. Cooper accepts it.
                         
          EXT. HANGAR BAY, COOPER STATION
                         
          Cooper stands on an observation deck, high above the hangar
          floor. Below him, bright young things in uniforms climb
          into sleek-looking spaceships and prepare to set out.
                         
          EXT. BASEBALL DIAMOND, COOPER STATION
                         
          Cooper sits in the stands, listening to the familiar crack
          of the bat as an intramural team from the university
          practices.
                         
          Cooper watches. He looks bored.
                         
          The kid up to bat cracks a pop fly. For a second, the catcher
          shuffles back and forth, trying to get himself into position.
          But the ball never returns. The catcher YELLS out a warning.
                         
          Above, the ball begins to slowly fall up, not down, toward
          the town center above.
                         
          After a second, the ball smashes through a skylight of a
          building high above them.
                         
          Cooper watches as the kid rounds the bases, laughing.
           152.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE, COOPER STATION -- DAY
                         
          Cooper's robot sits at the kitchen table. Cooper is fiddling
          around in the back of his head.
                         
                          ROBOT

           Confirmed. Would you like to make
           any additional changes?
                         
                          COOPER
           Sense of humor. New level setting.
           100 percent. Wait.
                          (THINKS)
           80 percent.
                         
          He begins putting the robot back together.
                         
          EXT. FARMHOUSE, COOPER STATION -- TWILIGHT
                         
          Cooper sits on his porch, joined by the same robot as before.
          They watch as the space station rotates lazily out of
          alignment with the local star, casting the inside of the
          cylinder into shade, then darkness.
                         
          The shadow races past them. Another day. Another night.
                         
          EXT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION
                         
          A maintenance worker finishes looking over one of the sleek-
          looking spacecraft. He packs up his tools and heads out.
                         
          After a moment, two figures pick their way across the hangar
          floor, sticking to the shadows.
                         
          As they reach the first ship in the line, we get a better
          look. It's Cooper and his robot pal. The robot is wearing
          a baseball cap and carrying a toolbox.
                         
          Cooper gestures to the robot, who sets down the toolbox with
          a click against the mirror-like floor.
                         
          Cooper shakes his head, annoyed, at the robot, and puts his
          finger to his lips. The robot nods, bashful.
                         
          Cooper waves a small handheld computer near the skin of the
          ship until it lights up. Then he punches in a few codes.
          Nothing happens. He punches in a few more.
           153.
                         
          Suddenly, the hatch opens with a HISS.
                         
          INT. SHIP
                         
          Cooper moves quickly to the cockpit of the ship. Looks over
          the controls. The robot straps himself in next to him.
          Cooper looks up through the windows.
                         
          The inky black void of space beckons.
                         
          Cooper smiles and reaches for the controls.
                         
                          COOPER
           Where do you want to go first?
                         
          The robot thinks it over.
                         
          EXT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION
                         
          The technician walks back into the hangar. He walks along
          the row of ships till he reaches the last one.
                         
          It's not there.
                         
          He looks out into the blackness of the void. Sees a tiny
          glowing speck, getting smaller and smaller.
                         
                         END
THE ISLAND

    We PULL BACK, in marked steps, to include neighboring apartments
    with identical frosted facades. Then more apartments, above and
    below, the tiers linked by ramps and crosswalks. It might be a
    prison cellblock but there are no guards apparent. Indeed, the
    residents move freely, all notably male, all clad in shearlings,
    polo shirts and slacks. It is just another day in Sector Four.

3   INT. NUTRITION PLAZA - SECTOR FOUR - DAY

    Satie's Gymnopedie plays from overhead speakers. 

    A glass wall looks out across a green mountain valley. The plaza, 
    formed in curves of creamy ceramic tile, is divided into two service 
    areas.

    Male residents in line on one side, females on the other. Both
    genders combine in the seating area. Lincoln reaches the head of
    the line. He swipes his ethercuff o v e r a scanner. A NUTRITION
    CLERK, a surly woman in uniform, eyes the readout on her screen-

                                    NUTRITION CLERK
                     Lincoln Six-Echo... Options are dried
                     fruit, oatmeal or anything in bran.

                                  LINCOLN
                     What? No bacon?

                                NUTRITION CLERK
                     You got a sodium flag, pal - now
                     what's it going to be?

                                 LINCOLN
                     Whatever.

    He shrugs, disgruntled. The clerk taps her screen. Turning to a
    row of chutes behind her, she collects a foil covered bowl and a
    drink can. Lincoln, less than appetized, loads his tray with the
    oatmeal and juice breakfast. Then he heads into the seating area.

    In the seating area, male and female residents sit eating and
    chatting happily. Uniformed busboys intermix, clearing and wiping
    tables. A divide in this community now starts to become clear...

    The busboys, like the nutrition clerk, like all the service,
    maintenance, and administrative staff we'll see, have distinct
    uniforms but no facial marking. They are known as "outsiders".

    The "residents", like Lincoln, have crosshatched scars on their
    upper left brows and ethercuffs o n their wrists. Mostly Caucasian,
    from mid-twenties to mid-sixties. There are no children here.

    We isolate a blonde - mid-20's, fresh, bright eyes, a fragile
    beauty, a crosshatch of two verticals and one horizontal. Her
    name is ESTER TWO-ALPHA. Seeing Lincoln, she smiles and waves-

                                     ESTER
                     Lincoln ! Over here!

                                                             3.



Lincoln crosses, a little surprised to see her. Pleasantly so.

                            LINCOLN
              Hello , stranger.

                           ESTER
              What? You don't recognize me?

                          LINCOLN
              It's just an expression, that's all.

                         ESTER
              You and your expressions, Lincoln. Now
              sit down and ask me where I've been.

                               LINCOLN
                     (sits , a spreading smile)
              Okay, Ester. Where have you been?

                               ESTER
              At the medical center. Just for tests
              but they had me on liquid nutrition.
                     (forks a mouthful of eggs)

              Mmmmm. This is the first solid food
              I've had in a week.

                          LINCOLN
              Exciting.

                            ESTER
              That's not the exciting part. I got my
              first trimester report: happy, healthy
              and contaminant-free... Both of us.

                          LINCOLN
              Us?

                        ESTER
              My baby... It's in perfect condition.
              I just hope I can keep it that way. I
              still have six months to delivery.

                          LINCOLN
              Then you leave all this behind, huh?

                          ESTER
              Why? Will you miss me?

Her eyes betray a flicker of something. It unsettles Lincoln.

                          LINCOLN
              I'll miss your coffee. C'mon, I
              already burned up my quota.

                                                                       4.



                             ESTER
                Okay. But this is the last time.

In a deliberate move, she drops her napkin on the floor. As she
ducks down to retrieve it, Lincoln steals a gulp of her coffee.
Rising again, Ester registers his souring look.

                            ESTER
                What is it?

Lincoln just nods across the plaza. Ambient conversation is now
ebbing at an arrival. An outsider in a grey, vaguely clerical
uniform - sanguine, settled, precise eyes. He might be a prison
warden but for the generally warm reception. He is known as The
Community Director. His name is MERRICK.

He crosses to a lectern, unlooping a chain from his neck with a
three-forked pendant known as a "tri-key". He slots the tri-key
into the lectern. The glass wall frosts over and pixellates i n t o
a live feed of himself. Now amplified by the plaza speakers,
Merrick begins his address-

                            MERRICK
                Good morning. To everyone here and
                everyone watching on etherscreen,
                welcome to the community address. Today
                I'm coming to you from Sector Four. For
                those of you here with sugar quotas, let
                me recommend the french toast. I just
                tried some and it's excellent, really.
                But I know what everyone's hungry for
                s o let's move on to the lottery. As
                always the draw will be made from our
                host sector. So tell me, Sector Four -
                is everyone ready for The Daily Spin?

Applause and whistles erupt, mostly from the younger residents,
who take on the zeal of a game show audience. The older ones -
including Lincoln - greet the prospect with labored tolerance.
Merrick turns the tri-key i n the lectern. The glass wall
switches from the live feed to a jumbotron o f flashing text;

- - DAILY SPIN!... GET READY TO WIN!... DAILY SPIN!--

                           MERRICK
                Let The Spin begin.

To a burst of cheers, he turns the tri-key another notch. The
glass wall becomes a spinning blur, like a tumbler on a slot
machine. But instead of icons, it clicks through names, each
separated by a blank line - from "Adams One-Alpha" to "Zucker
Three - Charlie" - scrolling the entire population of Sector Four.

                                                                     5.



    As the spin slows, a pent silence falls. Expectant eyes watch the
    names click through the P's, the Q's, the R's, the S's and . . .
    - - SPIN WIN!... STARKWEATHER TWO-DELTA... SPIN-WIN!--

                                     MERRICK
                   Starkweather Two-Delta! Step up!

    Cheers and applause as everyone looks for the lucky recipient.
    The excitement abates as it becomes clear he's not among them.

                                    MERRICK
                   Well , Starkweather, if you're watching
                   on etherscreen - your time has come, my
                   friend! You're moving out to The Island!
                          (another burst of cheers)
                   And the rest of you, never lose hope;
                   what do we know about The Daily Spin?

                                   THE YOUNGER RESIDENTS
                   Everyone gets to win!

                              MERRICK
                   An d tomorrow it could be you...

    Merrick steps down and departs. The plaza reverts to its former
    mood, dotted with murmurs of disappointment. Lincoln scowls.

                                ESTER
                   Don't worry. Your time will come.

                                 LINCOLN
                   That's easy for you to say. Your time's
                   guaranteed. All you have is six months.

                              ESTER
                   Six months of mood swings, sore back
                   and swollen feet. Want to trade places?

                                    LINCOLN
                          (scowl lifting)
                   Give me some more of your coffee.

4   INT . SUBWAY PORTAL - SECTOR FOUR - DAY

    The portal is spanned by a rank of latticed metal gates, known as
    an "ethergate." Residents swipe their ethercuffs o v e r scanners,
    the gates hiss open and they step through in systematic order.

                                                                      6.



5   INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - SECTOR FOUR - DAY

    The subway, formed in arches of creamy ceramic tile, is not
    unlike our own. In place of escalators, moving walkways deliver
    the residents onto the platform. Along the platform wall runs a
    strip of mirrored panels, etherscreen reporting in banner crawl:

    - - NEXT STOP... SECTOR 5 - SECTOR 6 - CENTERVILLE...
    At the tunnel edge of the platform is a safety fence, where the
    residents wait in a patient line, Lincoln among them. His focus
    is drawn to two younger residents whispering furtively nearby.

                            RESIDENT #1
                   A stim unit says it hits the wall.

                                RESIDENT #2
                   Okay . But I get to set the can.

    Resident #1 shrugs and hands him a drink can. Resident #2 ducks
    under the fence, reaching the can down to the track. Or what
    looks like a track. The struts lining the bed are not sleepers
    but buffers of galvanized rubber. Nor are there any rails. The
    relay system is provided by a series of metal posts, flanking the
    buffers to run in twin parallel. Known as "lode-poles," they now
    start thrumming and pulsing with red light, like runway beacons.

                                RESIDENT #1
                   Hurry it up. The shuttle's coming.

    Resident #2 regains the platform. We PUSH IN on the drink can,
    balanced on a buffer. It starts rattling. Then suddenly shoots
    upward into the air, arcing and bouncing off the tunnel wall,
    clattering into obscurity. Resident #1 whoops in victory.

    A rush of air heralds the shuttle. It sails out of the tunnel,
    floating three feet above the track. A hybrid of subway car and
    nautical craft, it has runners in place of wheels, like hulls on
    a catamaran. It is buoyed by a magnetic flow emanating from the
    lode-poles, an invisible river known as a "lode-stream". The
    shuttle drifts to a gentle halt, hovering, rocking a little. Its
    gangplanks fold out toward the platform and the safety fence
    lowers. Lincoln and the other commuters file routinely aboard.

6   INT . CENTERVILLE - DAY

    An avenue of cream colored buildings. Uniform in architecture,
    rising five stories to meet a mirrored roof. Despite lighting
    arrays, the absence of sky lends a chasmic quality . Lincoln
    follows the flow of residents up the avenue. Building signs read:
    "Dept. Of Labor", "Dept. Of Health", "Dept. Of Sanitation". He
    splits off, turning into a building marked "Dept. Of Population."

                                                                            7.



7   INT. OFFICES - DEPARTMENT OF POPULATION - DAY

    Frosted glass workstations, notably circular rather than square.
    Lincoln sits at his desk in front of a wraparound etherscreen,
    divided into three sections, a formation known as a "visor".
    Right-visor shows a polymorph in fractal cycle, like a permanent
    screen saver. Mid-visor shows a tomograph of a residential block;
    tiers of apartments shown as boxes, most in solid white, a few
    blink red with the text label "Vacancy". Left-visor shows a list
    of names and sociographic grading sheaded "Residents Pending".

                                   LINCOLN (TO VISOR)
                     Hudson Four-Alpha; profile reviewed.
                     Match to vacancy; 171, Sector 5.
                     Request clearance to populate.

    - - PROCESSING . . . FOUR-ALPHA, HUDSON; POPULATION APPROVED

    Left-visor, the name highlights then blinks out. Mid-visor, a
    box labelled "Vacancy" turns from blinking red to solid white.

                                 A VOICE (O.S.)
                     Hey, you want to know something?

    Lincoln looks up at a face grinning over the partition - mid
    30's, jovial, tall and burly. His name is JONES THREE-BRAVO.

                                JONES
                     You know that guy who won the Spin in
                     your sector? Starkweather?

                                 LINCOLN
                     No.

                              JONES
                     I had a bout with him last week. Guess
                     how long he's been here? Six months.

                                LINCOLN
                     Six months?

                                JONES
                     You don't believe me - look it up.

                                   LINCOLN (TO VISOR)
                     Census File: Two-Delta, Starkweather.

    - - TWO - DELTA , STARKWEATHER: 102, SECTOR 4 -- DAY: 186 / HR: 09:31

                                 JONES
                     What do you say now? Still think The
                     Spin's rigged for the long haulers?

                                                                     8.



                             LINCOLN
                   He got lucky, that's all.

                              JONES
                   And don't you wish it was you... out
                   there on The Island... nature's own
                   clean air zone... no screening, no
                   quotas... unlimited pleasure...

                               LINCOLN
                   Shut up, Jonesy.

                              JONES
                   Why don't you make me? In the ring.

                                 LINCOLN
                   You're out of my weight-class.

                              JONES
                   Not anymore. They just got the new
                   program in - multi-weight balancing.

                               LINCOLN
                   I'll think about it.

                                 JONES
                   C'mon, champ. A stim unit says you
                   won't last three rounds.

8   INT . BOXING RING - CENTERVILLE - EARLY EVENING

    - C R A C K - The same face recoils from a punch. Jones shakes it off,
    retreating, recovering. He resets his guard as Lincoln moves in.
    Lincoln jabs at Jones' defenses, his blowing hitting harder than
    we'd expect from his stature. Suddenly he breaks through with a
    left hook. Jones staggers back. A strange ripple distorts his
    face. Stranger still, his skin tone takes on a grainy pallor.

    As the bout continues, we widen to see the boxing ring is indeed
    a ring rather than a square and beyond the ropes is an outer ring.
    With Lincoln in FG, we now see another figure in the outer ring,
    mirroring his moves, dressed identically but for the gloves which
    are like gauntlets. The gauntlets are rigged to two armatures
    which are, in turn, rigged to a gantry-like mechanism. It glides

    noiselessly to and fro, shadowing the figure round the outer ring.
    RACK FOCUS reveals the figure is also Lincoln . The real Lincoln,
    in fact. The one in FG is a derivative hologram known as a "proxy".
    As Lincoln fakes and jabs, the counter-weighted armatures drag
    and recoil, duplicating the exertions of his proxy. Jones moves
    more sluggishly, his proxy now ghostly, transparent. Now being
    sent on a last offensive only to be roundhoused by another left
    hook. Jones' proxy topples and explodes into a pixellated mist.

                                                                     9.



                               LINCOLN
                   Whoooooo!

    Lincoln proxy - and Lincoln - punch the air in victory. Jones
    unlatches his gauntlets, sweating, galled by the defeat-

                               JONES
                   Sure you input the right weight class?

                                 LINCOLN
                   You're just too slow, Jonesy.

                                 JONES
                   You're faster `cause you're lighter.
                   Programmers... they always miss
                   something.

                               LINCOLN
                   Hey, you put up, now pay up.

9   INT . STIM BAR - CENTERVILLE - EVENING

    Rainbow light and swirling electronic music. The clientele are
    all male residents. Round the walls, poster-sized etherscreens
    display various dancing women, beckoning, text supers flashing:

    - - NEW AT THE PLEASURE CENTER!... OR TRY A MYSTERY DATE!...
    At the bar, Lincoln and Jones, freshly showered, each swipe their
    ethercuffs over a scanner. A uniformed BARTENDER notes the readout-

                                BARTENDER
                   Jones Three-Bravo; you got five units.
                   Your friend, he's got an alcohol flag.

                             JONES
                   So make it a beer and a Vita Cola.

    The bartender serves the drinks and they settle at the end of the
    bar. Scoping for onlookers, Lincoln steals a gulp of Jones' beer.

                              JONES
                   You know, you're going to get yourself
                   contaminated one of these days.

                               LINCOLN
                   Shut up, Jonesy.

                              JONES
                   So, you up for a rematch tomorrow?

                            LINCOLN
                   I can't. I got an interact.

                                                                        10.



                                JONES
                    With who? That blonde again?

                                LINCOLN
                    Hey, it's an authorized interaction.
                    We're on the same meditation program.

                               JONES
                    You want to get flagged for proximity?

                              LINCOLN
                    No law against friendship, Jonesy.

                                    JONES
                    Quick . . . Give me that beer back.

     TWO CENSUS OFFICERS ("CENSORS") enter the bar; in wireless head-
     sets and white uniforms, they seem at once clinical and military.
     CENSOR 1 carries a tablet known as an "etherboard". CENSOR 2,
     more imposing, carries a wide-muzzle rifle known as a "stopgun".
     Their foreboding appearance is greeted without alarm. As they
     move up the bar, the customers dutifully swipe their ethercuffs
     over the etherboard. Now reaching Jones, who swipes accordingly-

                                  JONES
                    What's going on, officer?

                                  CENSOR 1
                    Census check.

     Censor1 checks the etherboard; a headshot of Jones spins in 3-D.
     He offers it to Lincoln who swipes his ethercuff emphatically-

                                LINCOLN
                    What happened? You lost count?

                             CENSOR 1
                    I hope nobody's drinking off-quota.

                                LINCOLN
                    Vita Cola all the way, officer.

     Lincoln sips his cola. As they move on, he grimaces at the taste.

10   INT . SHUTTLE - IN TRANSIT - LATER

     Lincoln stares out of the window. The red pulse of the lode poles
     catches a glazed look in his eyes. His pupils, a little dilated.
     His focus returns to the interior and an etherscreen banner:

     - - G E T READY FOR THE DAILY SPIN!... TOMORROW IT COULD BE YOU...

                                                                             11.



11   INT. BEDROOM - LINCOLN'S APARTMENT - THE NEXT DAY

     The horizon. The morning sun streams over the green mountains.
     Lincoln lies sleeping, his head buried under the pillow. Off a
     beeping sound, he stirs and squints up at the mirrored ceiling:

     - - ETHER CALL PENDING ; ACCEPT OR SEND TO MESSAGE BANK?

                                   LINCOLN
                       Accept.

     The etherscreen resolves Ester's face, fresh and bright.

                                       ESTER (ON ETHERSCREEN)
                       Lincoln? I missed you at breakfast.

                                LINCOLN
                       I guess I overslept.

                                ESTER (ON ETHERSCREEN)
                       I just wanted to check we're still on
                       for tonight. The interact.

                                     LINCOLN
                       Right. I'll be there.

                                   ESTER (ON ETHERSCREEN)
                       I'll see you then. Enjoy your day!

     Her face blinks out. Lincoln gets out of bed with a smile.

12   INT . RESIDENTIAL BLOCK - SECTOR FOUR - DAY

     Lincoln exits his apartment and heads up the walkway. We reveal
     the walkway ends at another ethergate, governing residential
     access. Lincoln swipes his ethercuff o v e r a scanner and a gate
     swings open. He heads on, the gate hissing closed behind him.

13   INT . NUTRITION PLAZA - SECTOR FOUR - DAY
     Ravel's Pavane plays overhead. The plaza is emptying as residents
     leave for work. Lincoln arrives at the service counter. He
     swipes his ethercuff and greets the clerk with an amiable grin.

                                   LINCOLN
                       Just juice today. I'm late for work.

                                  NUTRITION CLERK
                       Too bad. I gotta serve the full meal.

     Lincoln shrugs, his gaze wandering past her into the kitchens.
     His grin fades as he spots TWO CENSORS talking to a busboy. Then
     the view is lost as he's served an oatmeal and juice breakfast.

                                                                        12.



14   INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - SECTOR FOUR - DAY

     Not so crowded at this hour. Halfway down the platform we see a
     vending machine with confections in nameless silver wrappers. A
     mouse-ish resident collects a bar from the trough. His name is
     KLEINWORT NINE-ALPHA. Seeing Lincoln approach, he preempts-

                              KLEINWORT
                   No, no, no. Use your own sugar quota.

                                 LINCOLN
                   C'mon, Kleinwort...

     He says this amicably enough but he's using his imposing presence
     on the smaller man. Kleinwort sighs and breaks off a chunk.
                             LINCOLN
                   So what's up with the Censors, huh?

                                  KLEINWORT
                   They're conducting a census check. Or
                   don't you watch the bulletins?

                            LINCOLN
                   I know what it is. I've just never
                   seen them out in this sector before.

                                     KLEINWORT
                   Probably just tracking a glitch. A bad
                   scanner or maybe an userware defect.
                          (off Lincoln's puzzled look)
                   Ethercuffs. They get damaged, you get
                   a false read. Sometimes even a dropout.

                               LINCOLN
                   What are you saying? They lost someone?

                                  KLEINWORT
                   Someone just isn't showing up where
                   they should be. What do you care?

     A rush of air heralds the shuttle, curtailing the conversation.
     Beneath his tousling hair, a frown plays on Lincoln's brow.

15   INT . LINCOLN'S WORKSTATION - DEPT. OF POPULATION - DAY

     Lincoln stares at the fractal on right-visor, at the intricate
     paths of dysplasia. The glazed look has returned to his eyes,
     his pupils, a little dilated. His stare narrows at an errant
     thought. He shrugs it off. But the thought returns, persistent.
     More to dispel than indulge it, Lincoln turns to mid-visor-

                                                                       13.



                              LINCOLN (TO VISOR)
                Census File: Two-Delta, Starkweather.
- - T W O - D E L T A , STARKWEATHER: 102, SECTOR 4 - DAY: -- / HR: --

                                  LINCOLN (TO VISOR)
                Accomodation Status : 102, Sector 4.

The tiered boxes resolve, zooming in to isolate Apartment 102.
The box shows solid white. Lincoln frowns, assimilating this.

                            LINCOLN
                Hey , Jonesy. Remember the guy who won
                The Spin yesterday? His apartment's
                still showing as occupied.

                             JONES (O.S.)
                So?

                          LINCOLN
                So you get 24 hours to move out.

                             JONES (O.S.)
                Maybe the system didn't update yet.

                           LINCOLN
                No. It updates on the hour. If he's
                gone it should be showing a vacancy.

                                  JONES
                      (appearing over the partition)
                What? You think he's still here? The
                guy wins a place on The Island and you
                think he just decided not to go?

                         LINCOLN
                I don't know. He wasn't there to step
                up. And now there's a census check...
                           JONES
                And now nothing. It's probably the
                programmers messing up.

                             LINCOLN
                Maybe.

                         JONES
                A stim unit says I can prove it. Cross
                reference with sanitation.

                                  LINCOLN (TO VISOR)
                Sanitation Status: 102, Sector Four.

                                                                        14.



     --PROCESSING... APT. 102; CLOSED FOR CONTAINMENT CHECK--

                                    JONES
                        See ? Standard procedure. They got to
                        sweep it for the next occupant.

     Their supervisor interrupts them - an outsider, efficient-type-

                                  SUPERVISOR
                        If you gentlemen aren't busy... Perhaps
                        I could get an update on sector six?

                                     LINCOLN
                        Still in the electrical phase, sir.

                                    SUPERVISOR
                        Well the guys upstairs are griping
                        about the backlog. So go over there
                        and light some fires, will you?

                                         LINCOLN
                               (pulls on his jacket to leave)
                        I'll take care of it.

                                         SUPERVISOR
                        Aren't you forgetting something?
                               (holds up A STEEL BRIEFCASE)
                        Or do you want to get contaminated?

16   INT . CONSTRUCTION ZONE - SECTOR SIX - DAY

     An arc of blue light. A uniformed worker steers a plasma torch
     over a conduit. In the fog of smoke, we see wires being spliced,
     circuits, tested. Outsiders in hardhats, goggles and cup masks.
     Lincoln comes over the crosswalk, starkly contrasted in dacron
     coveralls and a hooded gasmask. THE CREW FOREMAN intercepts him -
     drawn, desiccated features, a husky drawl. His name is MCCORD-

                                      MCCORD
                        Sorry, chief. I can't let you get any
                        closer. We got live wires over there.

     Lincoln's reply is muffled by the gasmask, lost in the noise.

                                      MCCORD
                        What's that you said?

     Lincoln repeats to no avail. Frustrated, he peels off his gasmask-

                                 LINCOLN
                        I said I can't hear you.
     M c C o r d c h u c k l e s at the irony.

                                                                      15.



                                MCCORD
                    He y , you get yourself contaminated,
                    don't come pointing the finger at me.
                               LINCOLN
                    How are you doing, Mac?

                               MCCORD
                    You know how it is. `Gets to the end of
                    shift, `crew starts draggin t h e i r feet.

                                LINCOLN
                    We l l the guys upstairs are griping
                    about the backlog. They want to know
                    when you'll be ready for move in.
                             MCCORD
                    I guess if we bust our backs, we could
                    be out of here by the end of the week.

                                LINCOLN
                    I'll tell them two weeks.

                                   MCCORD
                    Thanks , chief. I appreciate that.

                                 LINCOLN
                    So . . . got any stuff on you today?

17   INT . AIRLOCK - SECTOR SIX

     A sign reads "Warning! Contamination Risk!". Lincoln stands by as
     McCord u n l o o p s a neckchain w i t h a single-forked pendant known as
     a "uni-key". He slots it into the top of three keyholes. A light
     starts flashing and the airlock gives a heavily pressurized hiss.

18   INT . EXTRACTOR SHAFT

     A deep steady thrum. Giant extractor fans churn above and below,
     both directions seemingly limitless. The bleak concrete shaft is
     streaked with soot, threaded by ladders and catwalks. On one
     such, we isolate Lincoln and McCord. B o t h smoking cigarettes.

                                LINCOLN
                    I t ' s too bad.
                                MCCORD
                    What do you mean?

                                LINCOLN
                    T h a t your shift's almost over.

                                                                     16.



                           MCCORD
                You mean, these things? Well, these
                things ain't good for you anyways.

                            LINCOLN
                The y taste good.

An exchanged smile. A pause as they enjoy the guilty pleasure.

                         LINCOLN
                I like coming here. Talking. Most
                outsiders don't like to talk.

                              MCCORD
                That's because we ain't supposed to.
                They got rules about fraternization.

Lincoln nods. Another pause as they drag on their cigarettes.

                            LINCOLN
                What do you do when the shift's over?

                            MCCORD
                M o r e of the same. They cycle us onto
                the disposal detail. Hump `n dump crew.

                            LINCOLN
                H u m p `n dump crew?

                              MCCORD
                D e b r i s clearance. We hump the heavy
                stuff to a site on the outside.
                          LINCOLN
                Is it as bad as they say out there?

M c C o r d l o o k s momentarily puzzled. Lincoln displays his gasmask.

                           LINCOLN
                The air... the containments.

                           MCCORD
                Right.

                           LINCOLN
                But not everywhere. Not on The Island.

                              MCCORD
                    ( b e a t , stubs his cigarette)
                I don't know too much about that.
Lincoln eyes him narrowly. McCord p a u s e s , then tucks his lighter
into the cigarette box and offers it with a palliative smile.

                                                                       17.



                                MCCORD
                    He y , take it from me, you got a sweet
                    deal right here. So why worry, huh?
     Lincoln shrugs, accepting the gift with a slow exhale of smoke.
     We tilt up to follow the smoke plume, dissipating into the fans.

19   EXT . THE WORLD OUTSIDE - DAY
     A i r blasts up from a giant tunnel.

     W i d e n i n g , we see it is one of a huge ring, planted in the dust,
     backdropped b y mountainous red rocks. At the hub of the ring is
     a large cubic building. From its facets, giant appendages of
     ducting plunge into its surround. These are the inlets for the
     processed air that feeds the underground...

     This is the landscape of the world outside and manifestly above.

     F r o m the processing plant, we pull back and up, raking over a
     large industrial complex. More cubic buildings, cream colored,
     windowless, like stacks of giant playing bricks. Now we see the
     front of the complex. The planate f a c a d e , faceless but for the
     entrance, cubed in polarized glass, like a dark cyclopean eye.

     F r o m the entrance, we follow a walkway out to a dock where the
     ground drops away into a broad concrete trench; like the subway,
     lined with lode-poles and buffers, it is known as a "lodeway".
     From the dock, we follow the lodeway out to a perimeter wall; red
     rock slabs, twenty feet high, framing a giant gateway. The gates
     now glide open to disclose a view of the world outside the wall-

     The shimmering bleached wilderness of The Arizona Desert.
     O u t in the distance, where the lodeway tapers into the scrub, a
     vehicle emerges from the shimmer. A hybrid of bus and nautical
     craft, single hulled, known simply as a "liner". Now as the
     liner becomes clearer, a decal on its prow is revealed - a
     crosshatch insignia over a blocky l e g e n d "The Sanger Institute".
20   INT . ENTRANCE HALL - THE SANGER INSTITUTE - DAY

     The polarized glass shows the liner has docked and A TOUR GROUP
     is disembarking. The men are mostly over 40, bloated by luxury.
     The women, mostly under 30, wives and girlfriends, all jewels and
     haute couture. They filter into the entrance hall to be greeted
     by the courtesy staff. Pretty girls in short skirts and blazers
     with the crosshatch insignia, led by a pert redhead named LYDIA.

                                  LYDIA
                    L a d i e s and gentlemen, my name is Lydia
                    and on behalf of our staff, I'd like
                    t o welcome you to The Sanger Institute.

                                                                          18.

                                    LYDIA (cont'd)
                    Before we start the tour, we'll be serv-
                    i n g r e f r e s h m e n t s in the visitor center
                    and circulating our standard discretion
                    agreements. I should add that today you
                    are all very lucky because our CEO and
                    founder, Dr. Henry Sanger, is with us
                    and will be leading the tour personally.

21   INT . INNER FOYER - LATER
     The crosshatch emblem spins on a wall-to-wall screen. Not a real
     screen but a projected flat known as a "holoframe". Here, Lydia
     assembles the tour group, nursing wine glasses and canapes. The
     holoframe fades up a serene music track and a commercial begins:
     A series of vignettes; an old man shuffling on a walking frame --
     a middle-aged woman in a bathing suit, one breast flattened by a
     mastectomy -- a young woman in labor, her face knotted in pain.
     The group watches with frowns and disapproving mumbles. Then-

                                V O I C E (O.S.)
                    I t ' s not a pretty sight, is it?
     E y e s turn to a figure behind them, dressed in a vestmental w h i t e
     labcoat - 70's, tall, slightly hunched by senility, eyes like
     quicksilver, glittering. He has the hauteur of a visionary
     stooping to the role of a salesman. His name is DR. HENRY SANGER.

                                      DR. SANGER (cont'd)
                    M o r t a l i t y . We all know its face and yet
                    w e look away, don't we? We deny that our
                    l i v e s are ordained to suffering. That
                    w e are all, inalterably, going to die.

     He pauses, fielding the various disconcerted looks. Then smiles.

                                DR. SANGER
                    I t takes courage to confront mortality,
                    my friends. And I see it in each of
                    y o u . My name is Dr. Henry Sanger and
                    I'm here to reward your courage.
     L y d i a applauds. The tour group dutifully follows suit. Sanger
     whispers a question in Lydia's ear. She broadcasts her response-

                                   LYDIA
                    T o d a y ' s group is from New Gaza Health
                    Care. They're with the platinum plan.

                               DR. SANGER
                    N e w Gaza. Yes, very good oncology unit.

     M u l l i n g this, he ambles through the holoframe which ripples at
     his passage. Rallied by Lydia the tour group follows him into--

                                                                  19.



22   INT. SALES HALL - DAY

     A hall of windows, each window framing a display case, each
     display case housing a different taxidermied a n i m a l . Not unlike
     a museum. On closer inspection, more like a chamber of horrors.
     I n one window is a pig with a horribly distended abdomen. Another,
     magnified, shows a mouse with a human ear grown on its back. In
     another, a chimpanzee stares out at us with glaringly human eyes.

                               DR. SANGER
                   I t doesn't get any prettier, does it?
                   But this is not a freakshow, my friends.
                   This is a war museum. A history of our
                   battles with mortality... and defeats.
                   Take the stem cell, for instance. A bid
                   to cultivate human parts for transplant -
                   in rodents, primates, barnyard animals.
                   It's enough to make your skin crawl. In
                   some cases literally, giving rise to a
                   new range of cross-species viruses. But
                   that's how we learn. From our mistakes.
     The y turn a corner. Another hall of windows, portals onto tanks
     of amber fluid that might be formaldehyde. Suspended within are
     embryos, fetuses and infants. All human. All grotesquely mutated.

                               DR. SANGER
                   C a s e in point, the clone. Back in the
                   beginning, the mapping of the human
                   genome was declared a historic landmark-
                   t o break the curse of heredity, to
                   correct congenital defect... genetic
                   engineering became the brave new world
                   of medical science. A bright future
                   that led to a dark age and much of the
                   legislation we know today. But while
                   the clone laws may have narrowed the
                   field, science marches on. Only to hit
                   the same wall over and over again - the
                   enigma of growth, the alchemy that
                   takes us from embryo to adult. A clone
                   barely reaches infancy before its
                   growth enzymes misfire, resulting in
                   the kind of monstrosities - which are
                   only effigies - you see here.

     S o m e reassured sighs from the women. They turn another corner onto
     another hall. A hall of mirrors. Simple, full-length mirrors.

                            DR. SANGER
                   So what do we learn from our mistakes?
                   That human parts cannot grow outside a
                   human body. That human bodies cannot
                   grow outside nature's grand design.

                                                                  20.



A FAT MAN, supporting his bulk with a walking stick, grunts -

                         T H E FAT MAN
               S o what the hell are we doing here?

                            DR. SANGER
               L e t ' s say one day you go to your doctor
               for a checkup. He discovers you have
               imminent renal failure and require a
               kidney transplant. What would you do?

                           T H E FAT MAN
               I wouldn't do nothing. My brother'd
               g i v e me one of his. Or else.

                           DR. SANGER
               E v e n if your brother's kidney is with-
               o u t defect, there's still a 38% chance
               of rejection. Or less if he's your twin.

                           T H E FAT MAN
               He's not. He's older.

                          DR. SANGER
               But what if you did have a twin?

O f f the fat man's confused look, Sanger smiles and gently coaxes
him to face a mirror. Their reflections stare back at them.

                           DR. SANGER
               What if you had a genetic double who'd
               give you not just one of his kidneys,
               but both? In fact, any organ or body
               part you ever had cause to need?

                            T H E FAT MAN
               What ? You mean like a clone? I thought
               you said all that stuff was a bust.

                        DR. SANGER
               I said the problem with a clone is it
               doesn't survive infancy. The solution
               is to find a different starting point.
               Why sow the seed when you can create
               the fruit? Or what we like to call...
               an "agnate".

L y d i a starts clapping., then s t o p s , realizing this wasn't a cue.

                         DR. SANGER
               An agnate is sequenced from a point on
               the cellular timeclock. I t is spawned
               post-maturate. It is `created' adult.

                                                              21.



                                DR. SANGER (cont'd)
              O f course, its brain is still vestigial
              s o for the first three years we keep it
              i n suspension. During which time we use
              d a t a impression to supply a template
              f o r functionality - a process we call
              " f o u n d a t i o n " . After foundation we
              t r a n s f e r the agnate into "containment"
              w h e r e it enters the conditioning
              p r o c e s s . An ongoing series of quality
              c o n t r o l s designed to test and maintain
              i t s functionality. After a minimum of
              t w o years conditioning, the agnate
              b e c o m e s eligible for harvest...
                      ( t o the FAT MAN, smiling)
              An d you, my friend, get your new kidney.

A hush falls among the group as they process what they've heard.
It's a sign of the times that none of them seems to be horrified.

                        T H E FAT MAN
             L e t me see if I got this straight. You
             can create this whatever... this walking
             spare parts holder... but I gotta w a i t
             five years to get hold of em?

                        DR. SANGER
             The spare parts, as you put it, need to
             be tested for integrity. But as many of
             our clients leave it till late in life
             to take out the policy, we do offer the
             option for early harvest. Given the
             risks, however, a waiver is required.

                       T H E FAT MAN
             S o five years or no warranty? For the
             premiums you're asking?

                        DR. SANGER
             An d what if the organ you   needed was a
             heart? Ask yourself, each     of you. If
             you had to put a price on     your life,
             your very survival - what     would it be?

A deep lull as the group considers this. Sanger picks his moment.

                         DR. SANGER
             I t ' s a question your insurance company
             has already answered. For them, the
             agnate obviates costly and ineffective
             treatment programs. Should you decide
             t o take out our policy, not only will
             they lower your existing premiums but
             they'll also cover the production cost.

                                                               22.



The incentive ripples across the faces. A troubled one speaks up-

                          T O U R MEMBER
              This "agnate"... what happens to it?
              After our friend here gets his kidney.

                            DR. SANGER
              That's entirely his decision. Our role
              is intermediary. We, as the insurance
              provider, guarantee the condition and
              availability of the agnate but all
              other rights are retained. In legal
              terms, the policy holder is defined as
              a "sponsor". The premiums, in effect,
              becoming sponsorship payments,
              maintaining the agnate until such time
              as harvest is required. At such time
              and where feasible, the sponsor has
              the option to extend sponsorship,
              retaining the agnate for secondary
              harvest or, shall we say, let the
              policy expire.

                             T O U R MEMBER
              E x p i r e ? You mean... let it die?

                            DR. SANGER
              N o . Not as you and I know it, at least.
              The associations of life and death are
              no more applicable to an agnate than to
              a cow in a field. It exists in a state
              of limited consciousness - aware not of
              life but of functionality. Imbued with
              the knowledge to maintain its function
              but without the capacity to question it.
              And yet, in many ways, the end if the
              most humane part of the process. The
              agnate goes to harvest without any fore-
              b o d i n g and is painlessly returned to the
              sleep from whence it came. Eternal or
              otherwise. There is mortality for an
              agnate. Just utility and redundancy.

                        T O U R MEMBER
              S o it doesn't know? It doesn't know
              its... its p u r p o s e in life?

                         DR. SANGER
              W h o does know my friend? Who among us
              knows our true purpose in life?
S a n g e r ambles on, plunged in thought. Lydia picks up the slack-

                                                                  23.



                          LYDIA
              This month we're offering a special
              rate for new sponsors. Including a 10%
              discount on the his-and-hers plan.

She ushers the group round another corner. Another holoframe and
another commercial, displaying the same characters as the first;
The old man with the walking frame is now running in a park--
The woman with the mastectomy is now at a party, her cocktail
dress broadcasting a full cleavage -- The young mother is now in
a waiting room, smiling as a doctor hands her a newborn baby.

                         LYDIA
              DR. SANGER? Would you like to close?

                            DR. SANGER
              Yes . . . Now some of you may be thinking
              this commercial is staged. But these are
              not actors, these are past customers.
              Real p e o p l e enjoying the real f r u i t s of
              sponsorship. What we offer here at The
              Sanger Institute is not just health
              insurance but indemnity. What we offer
              is the chance of a new lease on life...

The tour group applauds, this time without prompting from Lydia.

                         DR. SANGER
              N o w Lydia will walk you through the
              rest of the tour and explain the
              various limitations and exclusions.
              But I do have time for a few questions.
H a n d s are raised. A waspish-looking woman butts ahead of them-

                         T H E WASP
              The commercial. The girl with the baby.
              What is that? A fix for infertility?

                         DR. SANGER
              You mean the maternity plan? No.
              N o t endemic infertility at least. As I
              said, the law prohibits genetic
              alteration so a defect endemic in a
              sponsor will also be present in their
              agnate. No, what the maternity plan
              provides is a way round the risks and
              rigors of childbirth. Under this plan,
              an agnate becomes eligible for
              pregnancy shortly after foundation. A
              simple donation of sperm from the
              father, then the agnate is fertilized
              and brings your baby to term.

                                                                      24.



                                THE WASP
                     An d then what? You get it in the mail?

                                DR. SANGER
                     F o r practical reasons, delivery is
                     handled by your healthcare p r o v i d e r .

                                T H E WASP
                     An d "the agnate" - what happens to it?
                     When it's, you know - delivered.

                                DR. SANGER
                     The same rule applies. You can continue
                     your sponsorship. Or not. And in this
                     case, there's a natural window for
                     compliance as the agnate is routinely
                     sedated after delivery. As to whether
                     it wakes up from that sleep, like I
                     said, the choice is yours...

                                      T H E WASP
                            ( b e a t , a shrug)
                     An y t h i n g to avoid stretch-marks, right?

     The other tour members, some more guiltily than others, laugh.

23   EXT . PROCESSING PLANT
     A i r blasts up from the same giant tunnel, swallowing the laughs.

24   INT . EXTRACTOR SHAFT

     The acoustic hollowing as we look up from the now empty catwalk.
     The blast of air fading into the deep, steady thrum of the fans.

25   INT . CONTAINMENT

     The thrum fading to silence. A flat, measured silence as we
     revisit the community in soundless montage. The residential
     block, the frosted facades. The nutrition plaza, the counters,
     the chutes. The subway, the moving walkways. Centerville, the
     buildings now emitting a trickle of agnates, ending their
     workday - unwitting participants in their own greater utility.

26   INT . DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - CENTERVILLE
     A glass wall looks down on the avenue. The furniture is trans-
     p a r e n t , ethereal. Merrick sits at a console desk studying an
     etherboard. O f f a buzz, he taps a button. The door opens and
     Lincoln enters, composing a deadpan. He doesn't like this man.

                                LINCOLN
                     You wanted to see me?

                                                                    25.



                               MERRICK
                   Yes . Please, take a seat.
He taps     a button. The glass wall frosts over. It's unnerving but
Lincoln      stays deadpan, moving the chair before taking a seat.
Merrick      reviews the etherboard: Lincoln's headshot s p i n n i n g in
3D w i t h   a scroll of data. Then he looks up, forming a smile-

                                MERRICK
                   How ' s Lincoln Six-Echo today?

Lincoln shrugs, noncommittal. Merrick eyes him thoughtfully.

                                     MERRICK
                   E v e r y t h i n g going okay?

                            LINCOLN
                   I guess not.

                              MERRICK
                   Why do you say that?
                             LINCOLN
                   I f I'm here.

                              MERRICK
                   I'm not sure I deserve such a negative
                   association. My job's only to see that
                   you're happy. That everything's okay.

                                LINCOLN
                   Right.
                             MERRICK
                   I t sounds like you don't believe me.

                              LINCOLN
                   Why wouldn't I?

                                   MERRICK
                          ( s i t s back, smiling)
                   I t ' s part of your makeup. To challenge
                   things. To question what's around you.

                                LINCOLN
                   Ah.

                                  MERRICK
                   P e r h a p s you can utilize that facility
                   by helping me solve a little puzzle.
Lincoln shifts, feeling uneasy. Merrick consults the etherboard-

                                                                 26.



                                MERRICK
                You're doing well in most areas - pro-
                f i c i e n t a t work, exercising rigorously,
                your last medical puts you in excellent
                condition. But screening's picked up
                some deviations. Trace levels, changes
                in your sleep pattern... I see you've
                also been burning up your quotas...

                           LINCOLN
                A r e you saying I'm contaminated?

                            MERRICK
                No.
                            LINCOLN
                The n what's the problem?

                             MERRICK
                The r e are parameters, Lincoln. When
                someone starts straying from those
                parameters, we need to find out why.

                            LINCOLN
                Why?

                               MERRICK
                Because you - not just you, all of our
                residents - are special. Because people
                like me don't get to go to The Island.

He smiles. Lincoln stays deadpan, wondering where this is going.

                          MERRICK
                S o tell me, have you noticed any
                changes in yourself?

                            LINCOLN
                No.
                            MERRICK
                What about your sleep pattern? You
                feel you've been sleeping properly?

Lincoln shrugs, refractory.

                           MERRICK
                L e t me put it another way, when you
                wake up, do you feel... disrupted?

                         LINCOLN
                Disrupted?

                                                                  27.



                                MERRICK
               R e s t l e s s , disoriented, uneasy...
                        LINCOLN
               I don't know.

                              MERRICK
               They're all words in your vocabulary.
               I know you understand what they mean.
Lincoln ' s jaw clenches, patronized. Merrick notes this, resumes-

                                MERRICK
               Quotas . . . nutrition. Do you feel like
               you want more than you're given?
                        LINCOLN
               I don't know.

                         MERRICK
               Do you have any difficulty staying
               focused? At work, for instance?

Lincoln ' s jaw twitches. Merrick notes this, proceeds with care-

                           MERRICK
               H a v e you been experiencing feelings,
               sensations you don't quite understand?

                        LINCOLN
               I don't know.

                         MERRICK
               Do you sometimes feel agitated for no
               apparent reason? Frustrated, angry...

                             LINCOLN
               That's it.

                             MERRICK
               An g r y ? You feel angry?

                           LINCOLN
               Right.

                           MERRICK
               When exactly do you feel angry?

                           LINCOLN
               Now...
Lincoln leans forward as if to assert this. Merrick slowly nods
like he's just revealed something. He taps the etherboard-

                                                                 28.



                          MERRICK
               I'm going to order some tests at The
               Medical Center. In the meantime, I'd
               like you to stay away from stimulants -
               protein, sugar, caffeine...

                        LINCOLN
               I already burned up my quotas.

                          MERRICK
               But I know you can get around them.

He levels a knowing look. Lincoln stiffens again, unsettled.

                          MERRICK
               I'm asking you to cooperate. Not for
               my sake, Lincoln, but for your own.

                         LINCOLN
               Is that it?

                            MERRICK
               The r e is one other thing. You have a
               female friend. "Ester". Your file shows
               you've been interacting regularly.

                              LINCOLN
               The r e ' s no law against friendship.

                         MERRICK
               O f course not. We encourage interaction
               in the hope it'll be of mutual benefit.
               But given these deviations... let's
               just say proximity becomes an issue.

                        LINCOLN
               I know the rules of proximity.

                             MERRICK
               The rules of proximity apply to sexual
               contact, Lincoln. In this case it goes
               deeper than that. Ester is entering
               h e r second trimester. A time of change
               and emotional confusion. Further inter-
               a c t i o n might be... unhealthy for you.
Lincoln , patronized, looks away. This pill he won't swallow.

                          MERRICK
               An d for Ester - well, she has only six
               months left to delivery. Then she'll
               move out to The Island and whatever
               ties she has here will be broken.

                                                                       29.



                                      MERRICK (cont'd)
                    A s a friend, shouldn't you make her
                    t r a n s i t i o n as painless as possible?
     Lincoln ' s deadpan falters. This one, a bitter pill, he swallows.

                                 MERRICK
                    G o o d . Now I'm also going to refill
                    your pleasure quota. It may help to
                    settle you down a little.

                                 LINCOLN
                    Thank you. I feel much better now.

                               MERRICK
                    I'm not sure you do. But I think
                    you'll do what's right, Lincoln. You
                    may not trust me. But I trust you.

27   INT . COMMUNITY CENTER - CENTERVILLE - EVENING

     A theater in the round. The audience is mostly pregnant females
     and older residents. As the lights dim, eyes turn to the stage.
     Speakers bring up Handel's O m b r a M a i Fu. Then a glowing mist
     rises, condensing into a huge sphere, like a seed. Known as a
     "holomorph", it reacts sonically, germinating into stems and
     branches and blossoms, growing and evolving with the music. The
     diaspora i s as spellbinding as it is pacifying. It is beautiful.

28   INT . FOYER - COMMUNITY CENTER - EVENING

     The music from within is like a warm beckoning hand. The foyer is
     slightly vaulted to accommodate a statue. On a bench at its
     f o o t , Ester sits alone, waiting patiently. As Lincoln enters,
     s h e rises to greet him, smiling. He seems more sullen than
     usual.

                                 LINCOLN
                    S o r r y I'm late.

                                ESTER
                    I t ' s okay. I was waiting to tell you
                    something anyway. Guess what?

     Lincoln looks at her, unsettled by her flourishing smile.

                              ESTER
                    M y baby - I felt it move. And it's the
                    weirdest feeling too. I can't explain
                    it. It's like being more... more h e r e .
     Lincoln returns a deadpan look. Ester's smile wavers a little.

                                                                          30.



                                ESTER
                     I'm sorry. I'm all excited and we're
                     supposed to be finding peace of mind.

                              LINCOLN
                     I have to cancel, Ester.

     His voice is expressionless. Ester shrugs, refreshing her smile.

                               ESTER
                     S o I'll see you at breakfast tomorrow?

                              LINCOLN
                     I don't think so.
     Ester ' s smile falls. Her eyes, reaching, trying to understand.

                                ESTER
                     Did I do something wrong, Lincoln?

                                LINCOLN
                     No.

     A small word but it comes heavily. Before Ester can ask another
     question, Lincoln turns and leaves. His jaw, clenching with the
     effort of self-containment. Ester watches him, not hurt, just a
     little confused. We widen to encompass the height of the statue.
     The likeness is idealized but unmistakably that of Dr. Sanger.

29   INT . PLEASURE CENTER - NIGHT

     B l u e light. Lincoln walks up a long corridor, carrying a sealed
     plastic bag. Along the walls, poster-sized screens like those in
     the bar, display images of women, gyrating, licking their lips.

30   INT . PLEASURE CELL - NIGHT

     The blue light sustains. To one side is a mirrored wall, known
     as an "etherwall". It is currently pixellated t o display a grid
     of women's faces, artificial consorts waiting to be selected.
     Facing the etherwall i s a large aquarium-like tank, filled with
     gelatinous blue liquid. This vessel is known as a "sense tank".

     Lincoln sits at the rim, naked, wearing a full-head oxygen mask.
     He couples it to a hose dangling from the ceiling. Then lowers
     himself into the tank. On the inner facet, a touchlight k e y p a d
     resolves. Lincoln taps some keys and the etherwall a c k n o w l e d g e s :

     - - P L E A S U R E PARTNER SELECTED; PROGRAM COMMENCING...

     Lincoln looks out at the etherwall. The faces blink off to leave
     him staring at his reflection. Just one left, a pouting redhead,
     who licks her lips in anticipation as the lights dim.

                                                                       31.



     A holographic mist now rises. First resolving a proxy of Lincoln,
     naked, replicating his posture in the tank. Then the redhead is
     conjured, her buxom nudity glimpsed through the swirling mist.
     Lincoln proxy reaches out to stroke redhead proxy's breast. In
     the tank, Lincoln's fingers caress only the gel, his fingertips
     met by soft arcs of light - neurological charges, conducted by
     the gel, creating the sense of touch. They are known as "impulse
     arcs". Redhead proxy responds, dappling her lips across Lincoln
     proxy's neck. In the tank, impulse arcs flicker across Lincoln's
     throat, then down his chest, descending to more erogenous zones.
     Lincoln stiffens and closes his eyes, yielding to the sensation.

     The sensation engulfing him, Lincoln's brow starts to furrow. Not
     with ecstasy. Something darker. His eyes open, his pupils fixed
     in a black dilated stare. Resisting the artificiality, his face
     forming a sneer, tightening until... he slams h i s palm into the
     touchpad. The tank shakes. The proxies blink out. Lincoln stands
     mirrored in the etherwall. His hand, pressed against the glass in
     a posture of defiance. His reflection, warped and shuddering.

31   INT . ELEVATOR SHAFT

     F r o m darkness grows a seed of light. Red light, pulsing to reveal
     the shaft, lined by lode-poles, here in triangulated relay. The
     polarity cradles a dark mass towards us. An elevator in descent.

32   INT . DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

     Merrick   is at his console, working late. Off a buzz, he taps a
     button.   The door opens and an outsider enters - 40's, square set,
     hollow,   remote eyes. His hair is damp and he wears post-decon
     scrubs.   A USMC ring is visible on his finger. His name is SCHEER.

                                    MERRICK
                     K a r l . . . Welcome back.

     S c h e e r pauses, his face twitching. Then sneezes violently.

                              SCHEER
                     I forgot how much I hate the air here.

                                 MERRICK
                     J u s t a histamine reflex. Your system's
                     readjusting to the sterile environment.

                                 SCHEER
                     I t ' s the smell I hate. Empty.

                                 MERRICK
                     Yes , well I cut short your leave for a
                     reason. I take it you've been briefed?

                                                                     32.



                                SCHEER
                      ( s i t s , sniffing)
                O n e of our lab rats is missing.
W i t h a dour look, Merrick slots his etherboard i n t o a dock. A
proxy resolves over the console, quarter scale, spinning in 3D;
male, African American, bull neck. Data etches across thin air:

- - P R O D U C T ID: STARKWEATHER; FOUNDATION: II; GENERATION: DELTA;
- - I N T E G R A T I O N DATE: 01/27/84 // CONTAINMENT REF: 102, SECTOR 4

                           MERRICK
                His name is Starkweather Two-Delta. He
                dropped off the ether two days ago. At
                first we thought it was a system error.
                Then we found this in a garbage chute.

He opens a drawer and pulls out an ethercuff. He hands it to
Scheer who considers it remotely for a few seconds. Then-

                             SCHEER
                D e l t a generation, huh?

                              MERRICK
                That's right.

                          SCHEER
                I t was a Delta the last time.

                            MERRICK
                T h a t was entirely different. The
                product suffered a head injury.
                            SCHEER
                What happened to this one?

                          MERRICK
                We don't know. He just disappeared.
                           SCHEER
                N o t easy to disappear. Unless he
                figured a way through the boundary.

                            MERRICK
                He's a code two, Karl. A low functioner.
                          SCHEER
                I f you ask me, it's a mistake giving
                them any functions at all.

                            MERRICK
                The y don't function mentally, they don't
                function physically - you know that.

                                                                      33.



                           SCHEER
               The n perhaps if you're going to breed
               lab rats, you should breed them tame.
His look, albeit from a distance, throws a stone. Merrick hardens-

                         MERRICK
               I f you bothered to read the clone laws,
               you'd realize we have no choice in the
               matter. The virtual humanity statutes
               accord them a set of freedoms. All we
               can do is prescribe the limits. And
               even those are subject to regulation.
               Scope of knowledge, range of activity,
               even their speech patterns. The law
               requires that what is of human origin
               be provided with human characteristics.

                          SCHEER
               You mean, like fallibility?
Merrick pauses. He's not going to take the bait.

                          MERRICK
               The ether shows no attempts on the
               boundary. He's here, Karl. But for
               some reason, your men seem unable to
               find him. It's your job to contain the
               products. I'd like you to do it, okay?

                        SCHEER
               A little sensitive, aren't we?

                           MERRICK
               J u s t after Starkweather went missing,
               his sponsor placed an order. An order we
               can't fill. Damn right I'm sensitive.

                               SCHEER
               A l r i g h t . How much time do I have?

Merrick taps a button. A holoframe appears beside the proxy.
Even in two dimensions, the face is identical. Just a different
hairstyle and a gold earring. This is the face of The Sponsor.

                               MERRICK
               J a m i l Starkweather . . . last week he
               sustained a hepatic trauma resulting in
               liver hemorrhage. In medical terms, we
               have maybe a few weeks. In legal terms,
               we're already o n borrowed time...
                      ( a s Scheer rises to leave)
               An d Karl?

                                                                            34.



                                   MERRICK (cont'd)
                      I don't want a godawful m e s s like the
                      l a s t time. Minimal damage. Understood?

33   INT . LINCOLN'S APARTMENT - PREDAWN

     The horizon. The green mountains cast black by the predawn
     glower. Lincoln sits rigidly hunched on his bed, still in
     yesterday's clothes, sleepless. He is staring fixedly out of the
     window, hungrily, as if inviting the outer darkness to come in.

     His gaze lowers onto his jacket, slung across the bed. He digs
     in the pocket. And pulls out the cigarette pack. For a moment he
     considers it. Then slowly, purposefully, he opens it. He slips a
     cigarette between his lips. And lights up. He leans back, taking
     a slow drag. Exhaling, he watches the smoke rise. His gaze rests
     on the etherscreen above, expectant. The cursor comes to life:

     - - S C R E E N I N G . . . CONTAMINANT DETECTED: ADVISING SANITATION CTRL

     R e f l e c t e d in the ceiling, Lincoln grins at his small victory.
34   INT . RESIDENTIAL BLOCK - SECTOR FOUR

     Q u i e t , empty at this hour. Just the drum of footfalls as Lincoln
     marches up the walkway, puffing his cigarette. He stops at the
     ethergate, regarding it as if for the first time. Then he stubs
     out his cigarette. And swipes his ethercuff o v e r the scanner.

35   INT . THE ETHER GRID

     A blue dot blinks in space. We widen to establish its locus on a
     tomograph. Now building the boxes, the quadrants, the sectors.
     Revealing a vast, fully dimensional hologram of containment. It
     spins in the vaulted chamber like a giant geometrical phantom.

36   INT . ETHER CONTROL ROOM

     O v e r l o o k i n g the ether, like a studio control booth. Known as
     "Ethercon", it's also the title of the Censor at the console.
     Scheer stands over him, now in a white censor uniform with black
     chevrons on the sleeves, marking his seniority. He instructs-

                                    SCHEER
                     R e v e r s e map. Crop to twelve hour
                     segments. Then put up a sub-grid.

     - - S T A R K W E A T H E R TWO-DELTA: ETHER HISTORY; REVERSE MAPPING...

     T o one side, a miniature of the ether grid resolves. It peppers
     with a series of blue dots. Then a blue line stems from a point
     of origin to start joining them. Scheer leans in, eyes honing,
     watching the blue line retrace the last steps of his quarry.

                                                                     35.



37   INT. NUTRITION PLAZA - SECTOR FOUR - PREDAWN

     The glass wall reprises the predawn glower. The plaza is empty
     at this hour. But the service counters are staffed as breakfast
     is being prepared. The clerk looks surprised to see Lincoln
     arriving so early. He seems grim, latent, stiffly swiping his
     ethercuff o v e r the scanner. She eyes the readout on her screen-

                                   N U T R I T I O N CLERK
                    Lincoln Six-Echo... Options are dried
                    fruit, oatmeal or anything in bran.

                             LINCOLN
                    I want some bacon.

                               N U T R I T I O N CLERK
                    You heard the options.

                               LINCOLN
                    An d coffee. I want coffee.
     The clerk sighs and taps her screen. Turning to the chutes, she
     collects a foil covered bowl and a juice can and sets them on
     Lincoln's tray. Lincoln glances down at it, then back up-

                                LINCOLN
                    This isn't what I asked for.

                               N U T R I T I O N CLERK
                    You want to get into it? Look, I just
                    work here, pal. I serve the meal and
                    make sure it goes down on your record.
     Lincoln nods slowly. Then picks up the bowl. And flings i t across
     the plaza. Then the juice can, trying to outdistance the bowl.
     Finally, the tray, which rotors almost to the far side before
     clattering into obscurity. Then he turns back to the clerk-

                               LINCOLN
                    P u t that on my fucking r e c o r d .

38   INT . SUBWAY PORTAL - SECTOR FOUR

     The latticed wall of ethergates. The rising beat of footfalls as
     Lincoln approaches. He swipes his ethercuff o v e r the scanner. The
     gate slowly hisses open. Too slowly for Lincoln, who kicks it and
     barges his way through, leaving the gate to shudder on its hinge.

39   INT . SUBWAY PLATFORM

     The walkways, unmoving. The platform, deserted. The echoing beat
     of footfalls as Lincoln marches up to the vending machine. He
     swipes his ethercuff o v e r the scanner. A screen illuminates:

                                                                36.



--SUGAR QUOTA EXCEEDED; ACCESS DENIED

Lincoln glowers at the message. His jaw clenching, twitching with
anger. Erupting, he lashes out, punching t h e machine. He winces
as his knuckles crack. Then grabs the machine, trying to rip it
off the wall. Pulling, straining, sneering with effort, until-

He lets go with a defeated gasp. Then kicks the machine in final
affront. The machine resounds with a dull boom. For a moment, he
stands there, chest heaving. Then suddenly traps his breath...

The r e , in the fading boom, a noise. Faint, rhythmic. Becoming
discernible as THE SOUND OF A MAN SOBBING. Lincoln turns toward
the platform. Tracing the sound, he crosses to the safety fence.

                           LINCOLN
               Hello?

His voice echoes to nothing. He leans over the fence and peers
up the tunnel. There. In the fog of darkness, a figure. A figure
paused, half-standing, like an animal on the brink of flight.
The figure seems to stare at him. Then pulls upright. Now moving
forward and into the light. His face is African American, bull-
n e c k e d , eyes wild and bloodshot. A stranger to Lincoln, we know
him as STARKWEATHER TWO-DELTA. His voice is quivering, unhinged-

                           STARKWEATHER
               Please...

Lincoln stands, frozen by the sight of this dark, dishevelled
resident. As he climbs up onto the platform, we see his hands,
the fingertips grated and bloody. He lumbers towards Lincoln-

                              STARKWEATHER
               P l e a s e , you have to help me...

He rushes forward, grabbing Lincoln, pulling him face-close-

                          STARKWEATHER
               Y O U CAN'T LET THEM TAKE ME!

The stranger's eyes grow darkly, his pupils abysmal, black with
dilation. Lincoln fiercely shrugs off his grip, backing away...

                          LINCOLN
               W h o are you? What's wrong with you?

The stranger's eyes bore into him, obsidian. Face contorting,
baring his teeth like a rabid dog. Suddenly he lunges a t Lincoln-
- B O O M - ramming him back into the vending machine - Lincoln is
stunned - suddenly a vice-like grip on his wrist swings him round-
- C R A C K - into the etherscreen banner, webbing at the impact...

                                                                           37.



     For a moment, all is a blur. Teetering, Lincoln props himself
     against the wall. Then his focus resolves on the etherscreen and
     his fractured reflection. He releases a deep, bewildered breath.
     Then he notices his wrist. His ethercuff i s missing, his skin,
     grazed red from abrasion. Confusion yielding to anger, he looks
     for his assailant. But the platform is empty. His jaw clenches.

40   INT . SUBWAY PORTAL - SECTOR FOUR

     T H E DRUM OF FOOTFALLS as Starkweather rushes up to the ethergate.
     H a n d shaking, he swipes Lincoln's ethercuff o v e r the scanner. The
     gate hisses open and he barrels through, suddenly spurred by --

     LINCOLN BURSTING UP from the well of walkways, charging forward
     like a bull. The gate now closing, Lincoln races for the gap,
     barging his way through. And the gate snaps shut with a CLANG.

41   INT . ETHER CONTROL ROOM

     A N ALARM SOUNDS. The console flashes. Ethercon responds with a
     flurry of keystrokes. Scheer rejoins him as he pulls up a sub-
     g r i d . This one evolving past tomograph, mosaicing a n g l e s from
     etherscreen, conjugating a 3D l i v e feed known as an "etherview"--

                                                             M A T C H CUT TO:

42   INT . NUTRITION PLAZA - SECTOR FOUR - DAWN

     S T A R K W E A T H E R BARRELING ACROSS THE PLAZA; glancing off tables,
     sending chairs flying. Some residents, arriving for breakfast,
     scatter at his onset. Shocked faces, looking back and forth as
     Lincoln follows, in hot pursuit, vaulting the toppled furniture.

43   INT . ELEVATOR BANK - AN UPPER LEVEL

     A SQUAD OF CENSORS CONVERGING; called suddenly to duty, looping
     tri-keys r o u n d their necks, donning headsets, priming stopguns.
     S c h e e r leads them into the elevator, coolly relaying his orders-

                                   SCHEER
                    S u b j e c t headed into North Quadrant. Two-
                    m a n teams - we block him and force him
                    to ground. If you have a shot, hook him
                    but keep it above the belt. Management
                    doesn't want us to "damage the product".
     The Censors roll their eyes knowingly. Scheer taps his headset.

                                     S C H E E R (INTO HEADSET)
                    E t h e r c o n ? Sector Four North; code an

                                                                          38.



44   INT. RESIDENTIAL BLOCK - SECTOR FOUR

     A VERTICAL ONTO A RESIDENTIAL BLOCK: the grid of crosswalks, the
     tiers of frosted facades; quiet, the residents still dormant--

     A DRUM OF FOOTFALLS: Then a figure breaking frame, racing up the
     walkway of an upper floor; then another figure, in hot pursuit --

     T H E LOCKDOWN I N I T I A T E S : the lights shifting spectrum from white
     to ultraviolet, bathing the quadrant in a lambent purple haze--

     S T A R K W E A T H E R : his eyes bulging with panic as he races up the
     walkway, straining for an ethergate a t the far end of the floor--

     LINCOLN : his eyes charged with adrenaline, straining to close
     ground on his assailant; oblivious to the building noise of--

     T H E LOCKDOWN: locks hissing, lights flashing, ripping up the row
     of frosted facades; sweeping past Lincoln and onward toward--

     S T A R K W E A T H E R : the ripple of hissing locks rushing up on him, he
     pours on the pace, sneering with effort as he tries to outrace--

     T H E LOCKDOWN: the ripple spearing ahead of him to the end of the
     floor; now banking across the ethergate a n d sealing the exit.

     S T A R K W E A T H E R : stalled by the realization he's trapped; he spins
     round, looking for another avenue of escape only to find--

     LINCOLN: blindsiding h i s assailant with a headlong tackle; both
     men toppling over, hitting the floor with a bone-jarring thud--

     S T A R K W E A T H E R : quick to recover, breaking lose of entanglement;
     now struggling to his feet, stumbling onward up the walkway--

     LINCOLN : gets up to resume pursuit, then pauses, spotting his
     ethercuff, discarded on the ground. He looks up in confusion at--

     S T A R K W E A T H E R : a short distance ahead, climbing over the walkway
     rail; launching himself off, into a seemingly suicidal plummet--

     LINCOLN : leaning over the rail, seeing his assailant land safely
     on a crosswalk beneath, resuming his flight on the lower floor as-

     - B O O M - A GUNBLAST r i p s the air. A KEENING SOUND builds to a wail-
     - T H U D - LINCOLN JOLTS as something hits his shoulder, catching him
     off-balance, a stab of pain keeling him onto the rail -CLANG -

     LINCOLN SLUMPS INTO FG - TWO CENSORS converging like white ghosts
     from the purple haze - one reprimanding his recalcitrant cohort-

                                                                           39.



                               CENSOR
                    You asshole! You hooked the wrong one!
     He crouches to examine Lincoln. Blood is blossoming from a wound
     on his shoulder, jutting from which is a projectile. The censor
     presses its base and it snaps loose of its unintended target.

     N o w we see the projectile more clearly. A fat metal pellet, snub-
     n o s e d , finned at the tail by four metal teeth. On impact, the
     nose recesses to release a springload a n d the teeth snap forward
     to bite into the target. This device is known as a "hookhead".

                                     CENSOR
                    J u s t a flesh wound. `Hit his head
                    pretty hard. Possible concussion.
                           ( i n s p e c t i n g Lincoln's pupils)
                    T h i n k you can walk, buddy?

     Lincoln nods slightly. The censor unloops a tri-key f r o m his neck-

                               CENSOR
                    You see this? It'll get you past the
                    lockdown. You're to report to The
                    Medical Center. You understand?

     O f f Lincoln's blank stare, the censor presses the tri-key i n t o
     his palm. Then departs. Lincoln stays where he sits, still dazed
     from the concussion. Absently he watches the censors race off up
     the walkway, dissolving back into the purple haze as we-

                                                                     C U T TO:

45   INT . ETHER CONTROL ROOM
     S T A R K W E A T H E R RUNNING. Meeting white uniforms at every turn, zig-
     z a g g i n g o v e r crosswalks, down ramps. The rat in the maze, dumb to
     its inevitable destination. Widening, we see we are watching the
     action on etherview, racking and dollying like a deific e y e .

                                E T H E R C O N (INTO HEADSET)
                    E a s t side team hold position. Subject
                    headed for the second floor crossramp.

46   INT . GROUND FLOOR - RESIDENTIAL BLOCK
     C l o a k e d in shadow, Scheer listens to the play-by-play on headset.
     With a tap, he changes the channel, whispering to his squad-

                                S C H E E R (INTO HEADSET)
                    G i v e him some space. I have him.
     A N O T H E R ANGLE: Starkweather hits the deck running, sprinting up
     the avenue. In BG, Scheer steps forth, stopgun l e v e l l e d , aiming--

                                                                             40.



     -BOOM- The flash of the muzzle, the shrill wail of the hookhead.

     - T H U D - Starkweather jolts as the shot hits him square in the
     back, arching as the hookhead b i t e s ; but he keeps on running-

     - B O O M - B O O M - B O O M - Scheer unleashes his ordnance, filling the air.

     - T H U D - T H U D - T H U D - Starkweather jolts from one, two, three more
     hits; hookheads b i t i n g , spraying blood; but he keeps on running.
                                 S C H E E R (INTO HEADSET)
                      A l l clear. Flood the area.

     A N O T H E R ANGLE; Floor level, as between the tiles, tiny red lights
     start blinking, rippling forward in a wave. Known as "lode-pins"
     their small magnetic pulses accumulate into a low level stream.

     The hookheads c l a w e d in Starkweather's back also start blinking
     red. The invisible stream flowing beneath his feet, Starkweather
     feels its force. The duelling polarities stealing his traction.
     His run reducing to a slipsliding s t a g g e r . Then his feet leave
     the ground. He flails for a handhold. But there's nothing. The
     force lifts him a foot clear off the ground before balancing out
     to dangle him in mid-air, squirming about like a fish on a hook.

     A N O T H E R ANGLE; Scheer advances to reel in his catch. The stream
     bows before him, red lights blinking out. Until all that remains
     is the section where Starkweather hangs suspended. Scheer stops
     at its limit, looking up at him like some curious zoo exhibit.

                                  S C H E E R (INTO HEADSET)
                      H o o d him, cuff him, patch the bleed.
                      Then let's get him up to Level Three.
     A N O T H E R ANGLE: looking down from high above as the Censors move
     in on Starkweather. Scheer now walking away, tapping his headset-

                                       S C H E E R (INTO HEADSET)
                      E t h e r c o n ? Send word to dispatch.
                      Starkweather Two-Delta is secured.

     R E V E R S E ANGLE: Lincoln in CU, looking down. He has seen and heard
     all that has just passed. In his eyes, we see his daze clearing,
     consciousness coalescing, deepening. His pupils dilating into a
     deep and uncanny stare. What can only be described as a dawning.
47   INT . NUTRITION PLAZA - SECTOR FOUR - LATER

     N o w full but unusually quiet. Residents sit in whispered, anxious
     discourse. The news of the incident is spreading. Off a series of
     chimes, eyes turn to the glass wall, now pixellating i n t o an
     outsider's face - calm, official. THE COMMUNITY ANNOUNCER begins-

                                                                      41.



                                COMMUNITY ANNOUNCER
                    Good morning - this is a community
                    bulletin... Following an incident in
                    Sector Four earlier this morning, The
                    Department of Sanitation is issuing an
                    all-sector contamination warning...

     TRACKING the rapt concern of the residents, Ester among them.

                               COMMUNITY ANNOUNCER
                    The incident involved a resident found
                    to be infected with a pathogen. While
                    the risk is assessed, residents are
                    advised to be aware of the symptoms.
                    Should you experience aberrant levels
                    of anxiety or witness it in others,
                    immediately contact The Medical Center.

48   INT . DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

     The proxy of Starkweather spins over the desk. Merrick regards
     i t with a frown. Scheer sits turning the ethercuff i n his fingers
     with a demeanor of cool curiosity. Underneath, he's rattled.

                               SCHEER
                    You want to tell me what's going on?

                                   MERRICK
                    There's nothing going on, Karl.

                               SCHEER
                    I'm jaded. Not stupid.

                                  MERRICK
                    What's your point?

                             SCHEER
                    I checked up. In the past year, three
                    products have destabilized. All of them
                    Deltas... and there's nothing going on?

                                  MERRICK
                    You're jumping to conclusions.

                                SCHEER
                    Once I can overlook. Twice I can call
                    coincidence. Three times I start giving
                    a shit. Because if these products are
                    defective...

                                   MERRICK
                    Q u a l i t y control is not your concern.

                                                               42.



                        SCHEER
              S o it is a quality control issue?

                            MERRICK
              That's not what I said.

                        SCHEER
              He was in the subway tunnels for two
              days. In the dark, no food, no water.
              His fingers were scraped to the bone.
              He was trying to dig his way out. Now
              you try to explain to me why that is.

His look says he smells a rat. Merrick weighs him a moment. Then
sighs, a little depleted. He gets up and crosses to the glass
wall. Looks down on the avenue, at the agnates m i l l i n g beneath.

                               MERRICK
              It's not an exact science - biogenesis.
              There's a degree of trial and error. If
              the agnate doesn't come together on the
              first pass, we have to abort and start
              over. It's like breaking inertia. The
              bioreactor, the growth medium - we just
              keep upping the levels till we achieve
              integration. At which stage the agnate
              is deemed physically stable. We rely on
              foundation to provide mental stability -
              matching the templates to their capacity
              but walling it in with parameters.
                     ( b e a t , considers the proxy)
              When signs of instability started to
              show up, it pointed to foundation. A
              hole in the wall, an oversight. But it
              was only happening in the later generat-
              ions . Which pointed back to biogenesis.

                        SCHEER
              So there was a production defect.

                              MERRICK
              Actually the opposite. We found out in
              the later generations, the levels were
              so high that when we broke inertia, the
              process kept going. Over-integrating.
              Specifically the neural system. It
              produced a condition called synesthesia.

                       SCHEER
              Synesthesia...

                                                                  43.



                             MERRICK
               A fusion of the senses, creating a
               component awareness. Sixth sense,
               s e c o n d sight, whatever you want to call
               it. Its emergence seems to be arbitrary.
               But it gives them experiences beyond
               their functional parameters. And
               ultimately... it destabilizes them.
               However, if we catch it early enough we
               can control it with re-conditioning.

Scheer absorbs this with a slow grin. Merrick looks puzzled.

                          MERRICK
               You find this amusing?

                          SCHEER
               Poetic.

                          MERRICK
               Poetic?

                           SCHEER
               This "agnate" took off just before his
               sponsor placed an order. Maybe he got
               the sense his days were numbered...

Merrick ' s composure cracks a little. He hadn't thought of this.

                           MERRICK
               This stays between you and me, Karl. I
               trust I can rely on your cooperation?

                            SCHEER
               Don't you mean my complicity?

                                MERRICK
                      (hardening again)
               Remind me, why is it you were
               discharged from the military?

                             SCHEER
               What's your point?

                            MERRICK
               Learn to be a team player, Karl. Or
               you'll find yourself out of another
               job.

Scheer rises, discarding the ethercuff onto Merrick's desk.

                             SCHEER
               Nobody else would take it.

                                                                     44.



49   INT. EXTRACTOR SHAFT

     The deep steady thrum of the extractor fans. We are TIGHT ON the
     frame of an airlock. Hissing, it indents and opens. Lincoln steps
     through, eyes black and uncanny. The tri-key g l i n t i n g , dangling
     from his fingers. Scanning around, he fixes on a section of wall.
     He wipes off some soot. Legible beneath is a number. Twenty. He
     assimilates this. Then turns his gaze up the extractor shaft.

50   INT . ELEVATOR SHAFT

     Looking up an elevator shaft. The red pulse of the lode-poles,
     rippling downward as an elevator descends from the surface.

51   INT . OUTER THRESHOLD - LEVEL THREE

     A tiled chamber. Draped off cubicles. The elevator doors slide
     open. An outsider emerges, dressed in a flightsuit, emblazoned
     "Medical Courier". He announces himself, seemingly to no one-

                                      T H E COURIER
                     Clearance code: NG-230-2DS.

                                V O I C E ON SPEAKER
                     New Gaza Healthcare. Okay, you're
                     clear. Go ahead and get undressed.

52   INT . DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER

     The pressure door hisses, heaving open. The courier steps inside,
     naked, covering his genitals, some goggles slung around his neck.
     He takes position on two marked footpads and puts on the goggles-

                              T H E COURIER
                     I tell you, I hate this fucking r u n . I
                     always leave this place with sunburn.

                                V O I C E ON SPEAKER
                     Try full-course decontamination. It's
                     even more fun. Especially the colonics.

     The lights blink out. A red glow rises. Twin planes of light
     scrape across the courier, infra-red, searing his epidermis.

53   INT . INNER THRESHOLD - LEVEL THREE

     A chamber like the first. The inner pressure door hisses open.
     The courier emerges, dripping wet from a decon s h o w e r . He goes
     to a cubicle, grabbing a towel and dries himself off. Laid out
     within are some scrubs. Beside them is A STEEL COOLER, inset
     with a thermostat and embossed with the crosshatch insignia.

                                                                     45.



54   INT. CORRIDOR - LEVEL THREE

     The courier strolls up the corridor, now dressed in the scrubs
     and carrying the cooler. He turns a corner and his footsteps
     gradually fade out. A flat, sterile silence falls in his wake.

     A metal squeal. A ventilation grid levers down from the ceiling.
     A pause. Then a pair of feet drop through, legs, torso. Dropping
     to the floor, Lincoln stands revealed. Sweaty, smeared black
     with dust. For a moment he looks around to get his bearings.
     Suddenly he freezes, hearing-

                                  A VOICE (O.S.)
                     C h e c k in at the nurse's station. Up
                     the corridor, left, then first right.

     The footsteps are now coming back. Lincoln spins round. He finds
     a door. A lock panel. A moment of panic. Then he fumbles the tri-
     k e y f r o m his pocket, hurriedly slotting it into the lock panel.

55   INT . THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR - SECONDS LATER

     Lincoln waits, ear to the door, listening as the footsteps pass
     and fade out of earshot. Lincoln releases his breath in relief,
     calming a little, then frowning as he registers another sound.

     Very faint, rhythmic. He turns and looks around. The room is in
     partial shadow. To one side is a row of seats, to the other, a
     row of windows, covered by blinds, light creasing through. The
     sound repeats. Muffled. But now unmistakably THE CRY OF A BABY.

56   INT . HARVEST ROOM

     A grid of bio-readouts, each square alive with graphs and digits.
     The familiar baseline of a cardiograph. A lever-arm mounted with
     an IV r e s e r v o i r , dangling tubes and wires onto the OR table.

     We see A DOCTOR and A MIDWIFE, in whose arms A NEWBORN BABY
     squirms and bawls. Lying on the table, we see THE MOTHER, her
     feet up in stirrups, deeply flushed and puffing from exertion.
     Marked by her crosshatch as an agnate, she has just given birth-

                                THE AGNATE MOTHER
                     May I hold her?

                               THE DOCTOR
                     We have to run a few tests on her first.
                     In the meantime, I'm going to give you
                     something to help you relax, okay?

     Off his smile, the agnate mother nods, anxiously watching the
     midwife wrap her baby in blanket. The doctor taps a button and
     watches the IV reservoir misting with a pale colored fluid.

                                                                              46.



     The cardiograph marks the drop as the fast-acting sedative takes
     effect. The agnate mother watches drowsily as the midwife takes
     her baby from the room. Then the cry of the newborn is shut out.
     J u s t the cardiograph now, the beeps evening out, the scart o f
     peaks shallowing a s the agnate mother falls asleep. The doctor
     taps a button. On the grid, the face of a DESK NURSE appears.

                                 THE DOCTOR
                        I'm incubating the baby for 24 hours
                        prior to transport. But go ahead and
                        contact the sponsor. Tell her she has
                        a beautiful baby girl.

     The nurse nods. The grid square goes blank. A pause. Then the
     doctor taps another button. Text appears. Reading it, he cites-

                                    THE DOCTOR
                        Let the record show the sponsor has
                        signed Clause 22 of The Basic Sponsor-
                        s h i p Agreement. Initiate compliance.

     A light starts blinking. The doctor walks stiffly out of the
     room. The door hisses closed. The agnate mother is left alone.
     Sleeping peacefully, blind to the fluid now seeping into her IV.
     D e a f to the slowing beep of the cardiograph. The peaks of the
     baseline falling. Spacing, fading, slowing, slowing, until...
     The cardiograph flatlines. An d a sepulchral stillness falls. Our
     angle widens with the growing emptiness. The lifelessness.

57   INT . OBSERVATION ROOM

     Lincoln looks down from above, eyes frozen in the slatted light.
     His fingers are trembling, rattling the blinds against the glass.

58   INT . CORRIDOR

     Lincoln tumbles out of the door. He can't breathe, can't think,
     his mind is in overload. He stumbles around like a wounded
     animal. His focus suddenly and searingly r e t u r n s as he hears-

                                          DESK NURSE (O.S.)
                        Starkweather ? Like the football player?

59   INT . NURSES STATION - LEVEL THREE - CONTINUOUS

     A rotunda spoked by corridors. A console at its hub, manned by
     the desk nurse we saw earlier. The courier stands over her-

                                      THE COURIER
                        That's right. Starkweather.

                                                                       47.



                                 DESK NURSE
                    Still showing in surgery. Sorry.

                                  THE COURIER
                    Honey, I got a bird on the pad and a
                    storm moving in. How long's it gonna be?

60   INT . ANOTHER OPERATING ROOM

     Another grid of readouts. Another cardiograph beeps. A spotlamp
     illuminates the OR table and STARKWEATHER TWO-DELTA - his face,
     slack with anesthesis, eyes rolling a little beneath the lids.
     The rest of him under a sheet, cut out over the belly, the flesh
     slit and parted by a clamp, framing a window into his innards.

     Standing over him, mid-operation, A SURGEON and SURGICAL TECH.
     Interrupted by a chime, the surgeon looks up at a screen, where
     a panel flashes: "PAGING". He cradles his bloody gloves and
     elbows a button. The face of the desk nurse resolves on screen-

                               DESK NURSE (ON SCREEN)
                    The courier's here for pickup.

                                THE SURGEON
                    Well he's going to have to wait a while.
                    It took forever to put this one under.

                                SURGICAL TECH (O.S.)
                    Doctor...

                                DESK NURSE (ON SCREEN)
                    He's asking for an ETA. Said something
                    about some kind of storm moving in.

                               THE SURGEON
                    For Christ's sake, is that my fault?
                    Just find a way to stall him, okay?

                                S U R G I C A L TECH (O.S.)
                    Doctor.

                                SURGEON
                    What is it?

                                     SURGICAL TECH
                    Subject's heart rate is spiking.

                               SURGEON
                    Not again. Boost the anaesthetic lev...

     Suddenly he's sprayed with blood a s the clamp springs loose from
     the stomach, clattering to the floor. He's frozen by shock as...

                                                                               48.



     Starkweather sits bolts upright. Dazed, he looks at the surgeon,
     the tech, then down at his wide-open stomach. Instinctively, he
     clutches it. Then, his mind assimilating the horror, he SCREAMS.
     Now launching off the operating table, the lever-arm swinging
     out, blindsiding t h e tech - tubes and wires snapping loose -
     instruments flying - Starkweather lunges for the doorway - the
     surgeon steps up to block him - only to be hurled aside...

61   INT . CORRIDOR - LEVEL THREE

     THE BLARE OF AN ALARM. Starkweather, clumping down the corridor,
     clutching his open stomach, blood streaming down his legs. He's
     delirious, running nowhere, anywhere, running blind. Reaching the
     end of the corridor, he stops suddenly, seeing WHITE UNIFORMS.
     He doubles back up the corridor. Kicking at doors with bare feet,
     frantic for any means of escape. He spots a ventilator grid,
     slightly open. He jumps, reaching for it. Once, twice, then his
     feet slip from under him. He hits the floor with a damp splat.
     TWO CENSORS turn the corner, ready for action. But there is
     Starkweather, face-down in a starburst o f his own blood.

                                    CENSOR (INTO HEADSET)
                       Yeah, no sweat, subject is secured.

62   INT . DUCTING - MINUTES LATER

     POVCEILING VENTILATOR GRID. Looking down through the slits onto
     Starkweather directly beneath. He now has a loose white hood over
     his head. His wrists and ankles are bound by plastic cuffs. A
     loop of intestine plumps out from his belly. His weight is such
     that the Censors have to drag him away, leaving a bloodsmear o n
     the floor. His guttural whimpers are the only sign of life.

     CLOSEUP: Lincoln's face in part shadow, looking down. The gleam
     of his eyes as Starkweather disappears from view. Listening now,
     to those feeble whimpers, growing fainter, ever fainter until
     they disappear from earshot. Silence again. Emptiness. All that
     remains of Starkweather is a wending bloodsmear o n the floor.

                                                           SLOW FADE TO BLACK.

63   INT . BEDROOM - DAWN

     The horizon. The green mountains in different aspect, framed by
     a different window. The bedroom is like Lincoln's but with a few
     feminine touches. Ester, in her papery pajamas, sits brushing
     her hair. With a chime, etherscreen scales over her reflection:
     - - E T H E R C A L L P E N D I N G ; ACCEPT OR SEND TO MESSAGE BANK?--

                                                                        49.



                                  ESTER
                    Accept.
     The etherscreen resolves Lincoln's face, dishevelled, urgent-

                                    LINCOLN (ON ETHERSCREEN)
                    Ester . . . I have to talk to you.

                                    ESTER
                    Lincoln ? Are you okay? I was worried.

                                LINCOLN (ON ETHERSCREEN)
                    What are you talking about?

                               ESTER
                    The contamination warning. Somebody
                    said you'd been exposed.

     Lincoln pauses to process this. Hunted, more cautious now-

                             LINCOLN (ON ETHERSCREEN)
                    I want you to meet me as soon as you
                    can. But you can't tell anyone.

                              ESTER
                    Is it true? Were you contaminated?

                               LINCOLN (ON ETHERSCREEN)
                    You know where to come.

     His face blinks out. Ester is left frowning at her reflection.

64   INT . BEDROOM - LINCOLN'S APARTMENT - DAY

     Lincoln stares at his own mirror image. His eyes, fraught with
     revelation. His clothes, begrimed with dirt and blood. He rests
     his head against the etherscreen panel, shuddering, pressing his
     eyes tightly closed. As if he could ever forget what he's seen.

65   INT . CENTERVILLE - DAY

     The routine flow of residents up the avenue. Lincoln walks, head
     bowed, trying to look inconspicuous. Showered, white shirt and
     blue slacks under his shearling, he looks a little too scrubbed,
     too clean. He spots a familiar figure up ahead. He catches up.

                                  LINCOLN
                    Jonesy. . .

     J o n e s lets him fall into step with a look of mild curiosity-

                                                                           50.



                                 JONES
                     Hey, champ. Are you alright? I heard
                     there was a contamination scare.

                              LINCOLN
                     I saw what happened to him.

                                 JONES
                     What are you talking about?

                                       LINCOLN
                     Starkweather . . . What they did to him.

     Jones huffs, dismissively. Lincoln grabs his shoulder, ardent-

                                 LINCOLN
                     They cut him open, Jonesy. The y took
                     him upstairs and they cut him open.

     Jones holds his gaze a moment, then shrugs off his grip.

                                JONES
                     You caught that fucking p a t h o g e n ,
                     didn't you? You're contaminated.

                                    LINCOLN
                     J o n e s y , listen to me...
     But Jones just backs away. Lincoln makes to follow. Then stops
     dead in his tracks. Across the avenue, TWO CENSORS are on patrol
     and his best friend is now heading towards them. With a barren,
     torn grimace, Lincoln turns away and melts back into the crowd.

66   INT . COMMUNITY CENTER - CENTERVILLE - LATER

     R i n g s of empty seats round the empty stage. Ester enters warily,
     walking up the aisle. Lincoln waits in the shadows. He checks to
     see she hasn't been followed. Then steps forward. Ester recoils-

                                      ESTER
                     Please . . . don't come any closer. I
                     don't want to get contaminated.

                                   LINCOLN
                     Ester, I'm not contaminated.

                                ESTER
                     But they said...

                                LINCOLN
                     I'm not contaminated!

                                                                  51.



His shout echoes through the empty auditorium. Ester looks at
him, alarmed by his vehemence. Lincoln calms himself a little-

                                 LINCOLN
               Contaminants, pathogens... it's just
               what they tell us to keep us inside.

                           ESTER
               What do you mean?

                        LINCOLN
               I saw it. Why they keep us here. To
               use us. To take things from us.

                             ESTER
               You're not making sense.

                           LINCOLN
               Your baby... they're going to take
               your baby away... you understand?

                         ESTER
               M y baby? Why would they do that?

                        LINCOLN
               I don't know! But I saw it!

                             ESTER
               You're scaring me, Lincoln...
               I want to go back now.

                          LINCOLN
               You can't go back! Don't you get it?
                             A VOICE (O.S.)
               N o b o d y move! Stay right where you are!

A CENSOR steps through, stopgun l e v e l l e d . Ester freezes. Lincoln
hovers, mind racing. The censor moves in, tightening aim on him.
Ester looks on anxiously as he approaches Lincoln. Lincoln now
sees the censor pulling out some plastic cuffs. The same cuffs
used on Starkweather, promising the same fate... TRIGGERING HIM--

LINCOLN LUNGES AT THE CENSOR - ramming him - toppling him across
the seats - knocking the stopgun f r o m his grasp - recoiling as--

THE CENSOR RETALIATES - driving a knee into his groin, doubling
him over - then a knee to his head - THUDDING INTO HIS SKULL-

                            ESTER
               Don't hurt him!

                                                                        52.



     ESTER RUNS UP grabbing at the white uniform, trying to restrain
     him - the censor swats her blindly - hitting her in the stomach--
     LINCOLN SPINS ROUND at the sound of Ester's yelp - only to be
     roundhoused b y the censor - the blow sending him to the floor--

     Ester DOUBLED OVER - wincing at the pain - clutching her belly
     instinctively, protectively - an ominous scowl knotting her face-
     THE CENSOR PUNISHING LINCOLN - kicking him down the aisle - then
     suddenly hearing a noise from behind - turning to face it as --

     - B O O M - A GUNBLAST R I P S THE AIR. The brief wail of a hookhead.

     - T H U D - THE CENSOR RECOILING - lurching as the hookhead b i t e s -
     starting to gag - blood jetting from his neck - a hookhead
     c l a w e d into his jugular - gurgling, collapsing to the floor--

     Ester STANDING FROZEN - holding the stopgun - seeing Lincoln now
     getting up - she drops the stopgun l i k e it's on fire, aghast-

                                ESTER
                     Lincoln?

     L i k e she's asking him what she did... Silence - the rasp of the
     censor, blood foaming - another sound - FOOTFALLS. Lincoln goes
     to the door - an IMMINENT MASS OF WHITE UNIFORMS. He grabs Ester-

                                LINCOLN
                     RUN!!!

67   INT . FOYER - THE COMMUNITY CENTER

     CENSORS BURSTING IN - led by Scheer, pushing through into the
     main hall - the statue of Dr. Sanger looking serenely down--

68   INT . MAINTENANCE CORRIDOR - BEHIND THE COMMUNITY CENTER

     A HISS OF DEPRESSURIZATION - a pressure door swings open - Lincoln
     and Ester tumbling through - running up the maintenance corridor--

69   INT . COMMUNITY CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

     CENSORS FANNING OUT - sweeping the hall, stopguns r e a d y - Scheer
     finds the fallen Censor - crouches to examine him, then-

                                     SCHEER
                     Somebody get someone down here!

     A Censor splits off to join him, tapping his headset - Scheer
     rises again - in his eyes, detachment yields to cold intensity--

                                                                     53.



70   INT. VARIOUS CORRIDORS - CONTAINMENT INFRASTRUCTURE

     THE CENSORS: flooding through into the maintenance corridor, in
     their white uniforms, they seem like a swarm of antibodies--

     LINCOLN AND ESTER: deeper in, at another pressure door, fumbling
     the trikey i n t o the lock. A tense second. The lock hisses open--

     SCHEER : pushes through the opening gap of another pressure door,
     taking the lead, his Censors surging up in his wake --

     LINCOLN AND ESTER: meeting an intersection, veering at random,
     running blind, running deeper into the faceless labyrinth--

     SCHEER : catching up, hitting the intersection, pausing to split
     his squad in each direction - white uniforms dispersing--

     LINCOLN AND ESTER: reaching another pressure door. Footsteps
     audible. Lincoln jams the tri-key i n t o the lock. And waits. The
     seconds pass. But the door doesn't open. Lincoln looks around
     for another exit. Ester looks at him in mounting panic then--
     THE PRESSURE DOOR OPENS: not onto a corridor but an elevator
     car. Pulling Ester inside, Lincoln finds an array of buttons.
     His fingers hovers, uncertain which to press. So he punches all
     of them, stabbing madly, trying to prompt the door to close.
     SCHEER : turns a corner, seeing his quarry at the far end of the
     corridor, he gathers pace. The elevator is closing but he doesn't
     break stride. He deftly taps his headset, opening a channel to--

                                     SCHEER (ON HEADSET)
                    Ethercon! The elevator - override it!
                    Do you read me? Bring it back down!

71   INT . ETHER CONTROL ROOM

     Ethercon is working the console keys like a madman. His gaze
     flitting to a subgrid o f the complex, spinning the angles,
     navigating the mesh of lines. His voice comes apologetically-

                                  ETHERCON (INTO HEADSET)
                    You're off the grid, sir. Give me a
                    second. Can you tell me where you are?

     He recoils at the blaring volume of the response.

72   INT . CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE THE ELEVATOR

     Scheer stands with his Censors, poised, watching the panel chart
     the elevator's descent. A light flashes and the doors open. They
     level their stopguns o n . . . nothing. The elevator is empty.

                                                                       54.



                                      SCHEER (INTO HEADSET)
                    Foundation Levels - all of them. Lock
                    them down. Access only on my command.

73   INT . FOUNDATION LEVEL

     A dead acoustic. A corridor paved with sound proofing panels. It
     ends at a pressure door, where Lincoln and Ester now arrive.
     Lincoln looks back to the elevator at the other end. No going
     back. He slots the tri-key into the lock. The door hisses open.

74   INT . FOUNDATION CHAMBERS

     Amber light. The sound of slow bubbling. Lincoln and Ester pause
     to adjust to the gloom. They are in a hall of windows. Ester is
     the first to venture forth, as if drawn, to the nearest window.

     Behind the glass is a foundation tank. Bubbling with viscous
     fluid, laced with various tubes pulsing matter to and fro. The
     tubes connect to a form. A human form, an adult form but curled
     foetally. I t is known as a "nascent". In this tank is a female
     nascent, shifting slightly, causing Ester to gasp. The nascent
     registers the noise, turning its head. Its eyelids are closed but
     its eyeballs move, questioning. A slight furrow appears on its
     crosshatched brow. Ester recoils in sudden horror, perhaps
     remembering on some deep level that this is where she came from.

                                  LINCOLN
                    Ester ! Come on!

     Spurred to action, Ester follows Lincoln onward up the hall.
     Still conscious of movement all around, of nascents stirring at
     the sound of their footfalls like the ripples of a nightmare.

75   INT . FOUNDATION CHAMBER

     A STOPGUN n o s e s through the door. Followed by Scheer moving in
     silence, honed. How much time has passed is unclear. He signals
     his censors to split off. Tracking Scheer's advance, we INTERCUT:
     ANOTHER FOUNDATION CHAMBER: Censors making their sweep. Strobes
     of light from an armature mechanism moving up the row of tanks.
     It angles to project a grid across each nascent's face, then
     fires a short laser burst, searing a crosshatch into the brow.
     ANOTHER FOUNDATION CHAMBER: another contingent moves up another
     row of foundation tanks. The nascents within have cables plugged
     into their ears, filaments pulsing. The nascents a r e in a posture
     of rigor, sinews straining as they accept the data impression.

     RETURNING TO SCHEER as he reaches the end of the first chamber.
     No further access, just a continuing wrap of foundation tanks.
     He pauses, confused for a second. One of the censors comes up-

                                                                    55.



                                      CENSOR
                      Nothing , sir. No sign.

                                  SCHEER
                      They can't have got past this level.

     Scheer peels off his headset, giving full leash to his senses,
     straining to concentrate. Seconds of pent silence. Then he hears
     a faint humming. His gaze slowly drifts up to a ventilator grid.

76   INT . / EXT . THE FUNNEL - NIGHT

     A POV LOOKING UP. The funnel mouth framing a vista of the world
     outside. A hostile vista of black sky, maelstroms of sand. The
     sound of blasting air, suborned to the giant howl of a DUSTSTORM.
     A HAND. Reaching over the funnel lip as Lincoln pulls himself up
     with a mighty effort. Blinking, blinded by the sand, he swings
     astride the lip. Then he reaches down to pull Ester up. Ester
     gains the lip and likewise swings astride, coughing, blinking.
     T H E DUSTY EARTH as Lincoln leaps down to meet it. We track up as
     he helps Ester down from the funnel. Her feet meeting the earth,
     we are now in CU o n their faces. Gaping and blinking at the
     prospect of the world outside. A world of darkness and storm.

     SUDDEN BLINDING LIGHT as halogens explode the darkness. Lincoln
     shields his eyes, scanning for their source. He spots a large
     cubic building, banks of spotlights on the roof. He pulls Ester
     away. Away from the lights and towards the safety of darkness.

77   INT . EXTRACTOR SHAFT

     T H E THRUM OF EXTRACTOR FANS. Scheer pacing on a catwalk. White
     uniforms above and below, flashlights roving, sliced by the
     blades of the extractor fans. From somewhere, comes a shout-

                                  C E N S O R (O.S.)
                      Sir ! We got em! Motion sensors just
                      picked them up at the surface!

78   EXT . FRONT OF THE INSTITUTE - NIGHT

     ANOTHER BURST OF HALOGENS. More spotlights engage, their blaze
     flooding across the foreview, catching two figures; Lincoln and
     Ester, running, now, veering sharply away from the light. Now
     disappearing from sight, dropping into the trench of the lodeway.

79   INT . MAINTENANCE ELEVATOR - CONTAINMENT

     THE RISING HUM OF THE LODE-POLES. The elevator crammed with
     censors. Scheer at the front, staring ahead. He looks very
     focused, bitterly so. The look of a man outwitted by lab rats.

                                                                 56.



80   EXT. THE LODEWAY - NIGHT

     THE DARKNESS OF THE TRENCH. Lincoln and Ester running along the
     lode-way, stumbling over the buffers. Above them, the dust
     flails in lashing tongues, starkly depicted by the halogens.

81   EXT . PROCESSING PLANT - NIGHT

     WHITE UNIFORMS IN THE NIGHT - censors spill forth into the
     halogen light, splitting in all directions. Scheer suddenly
     notices the corona of light from the front of the complex. He
     barks something inaudible to his men, launching into a run.

82   EXT . THE GATEWAY - NIGHT
     THE GATEWAY LOOMING ABOVE. Beneath, Lincoln and Ester, on their
     knees, clawing at the dust. Like burrowing animals, trying to
     widen the gap between the foot of the gate and the lodeway.

83   EXT . FRONT OF THE INSTITUTE - NIGHT
     A LONE WHITE UNIFORM. As Scheer reaches the forecourt, stopping
     to scan the spotlit view, the veils of the duststorm. His face
     tightening with urgency. Suddenly he taps his headset, barking-

                               S C H E E R (INTO HEADSET)
                    The lodeway! Flood it! Light it up!

84   EXT . THE GATEWAY - NIGHT

     THE RISING HUM OF THE LODE-POLES barely audible over the storm.
     Lincoln and Ester, washed by pulsing red light. Ester recoiling,
     her arm flinging back from the pull. Lincoln grabbing her, his
     own arm straining now. The polarity tugging their ethercuffs.

85   EXT . THE LODEWAY - NIGHT

     THE RED WASH OF LIGHT from the lodeway as Scheer races up the
     edge, eyes trawling the trench for his quarry. His pace now
     suddenly dropping, slowing to a halt. He doubles over, catching
     his breath. More white uniforms now appear from the dust as the
     Censors, unable to match his pace, finally catch up. The first
     reaching him, Scheer pulls upright, bellowing over the wind-

                               SCHEER
                    G e t me a bird!

                             CENSOR
                    A bird?! In this storm?!

                                SCHEER
                    The y got out! They got past the gate!

                                                                                  57.



     Scheer spins on his heel back towards The Institute. The Censor
     lingers, confused. Then he fixes on the lodeway. Floating past
     in the red wash are the luminous blue seams of two ethercuffs.

86   EXT . THE DESERT - NIGHT

     The perimeter wall silhouetted in the middle-distance. Lincoln
     and Ester scramble through the scrub, blinded by dust, driven by
     momentum. As Ester starts lagging behind, Lincoln grabs her arm-

                                      LINCOLN
                        Ester ! We have to keep going!

     But Ester resists him, breaking loose from his grasp. Lincoln
     looks at her, uncomprehending. Until he sees her expression, the
     harrowed stare in her eyes, the labored heaving of her chest.

                                     LINCOLN
                        Ester?

     Ester staggers back, losing balance, reeling as if spun by the
     storm. Her eyes widening, senses flooding. The howling wind, the
     swirling dustclouds, the pendent gulf of black sky. Her reel
     returning her to face Lincoln, Ester opens her mouth to speak.
     But all that comes is A SCREAM. A scream from deep within, shrill
     and hysterical, the only articulation she can find. Lincoln grabs
     her and covers her mouth. Fighting to stifle her, rocking to her
     convulsions. But Ester keeps screaming. A scream of everything.

87   INT . BEDROOM - SOMEWHERE - LATE NIGHT

     All is still. Just a muted shudder of wind on glass. The room is
     in shadow. All we see is a canopied bed where a figure,
     obscured, lies sleeping. The still is disrupted by a chime. The
     figure stirs, fumbling at the nightstand. A holoframe resolves,
     the light revealing Dr. Sanger, rumpled by sleep. He peers into
     the holoframe to find the face of Merrick, gaunt with concern-

                                        Merrick (ON HOLOFRAME)
                        He n r y . . . There's been a breach.

                                                                H A R D CUT TO BLACK.

     SLOW FADE UP:
88   EXT . THE RED ROCKS - DAWN

     A horizon. A brim of dawn over the red rocks. The view is framed
     by the mouth of a cave. Lincoln sleeps within, slumped against
     the rock, his head bowed heavily. The touch of first light opens
     his eyes. His brow creasing, as if waking from a bad dream into
     a worse reality. He looks around only to find himself alone. He
     gets up, a little shaky at first, then ventures out of the cave.

                                                                     58.



     He emerges onto a ledge, perhaps fifty feet up. He pauses, eyes
     adjusting to the quality of light. He sees the storm has reduced
     to a low wind, combing the floorland o f scrub. Now, across the
     ledge, he sees Ester. Perched on an outcrop, hugging her knees,
     watching the sunrise over the desert. He crosses and lowers to a
     crouch beside her. Ester turns to him with a confused frown-

                                 ESTER
                    W h e r e did all the green go?
     Lincoln looks deep into her troubled eyes. He answers gently-

                                 LINCOLN
                    The r e is no green. The windows in
                    there... they were just pictures.

     Ester absorbs this with difficulty. Lincoln rises again and
     stands looking out across the desert, into the barren unknown.

89   EXT . THE SKY OVER THE DESERT - MORNING

     From the massive sky grows a glinting shape. Like a helicopter
     but sleeker, aquiline. Without combustion, its only noise is the
     sibilance of blades slicing air. It is known as a "whisper".

90   INT . WHISPER - MORNING

     The pilot jockeys with the thermals. Scheer rides shotgun. Now
     in civvies, scanning the terrain with electronic binoculars. The
     flight console beeps. He taps a keypad. A holoframe resolves:

                                  CENSOR (ON HOLOFRAME)
                    Ground team checking in.

                                 SCHEER
                    Anything?

                               CENSOR (ON HOLOFRAME)
                    The storm pretty much covered their
                    tracks. We're scanning for thermals
                    b u t the hotter it gets, the harder it
                    is to isolate a heat signature. I don't
                    know, sir, it's a big desert out there.

91   EXT . CHASM - THE RED ROCKS - DAY

     The desert sun clefts the chasm into light and shadow. Lincoln
     trudges into view, Ester lagging behind. He stops to let her
     catch up, only to watch her slump onto a rock. He allows her a
     moment to rest and walks to where the chasm comes to an end.

                                                                     59.



     He surveys the terrain. His eyes roam the carpet of scrub, now
     narrowing on an inconsistency. A faint strip where nothing seems
     to grow. Tracing its lineage, he walks a few feet out. Then
     drops to a crouch and starts clawing away at the dust.

     His fingers meet something hard. He sweeps off the dust to expose
     a layer of concrete. Continuing, revealing the ghost of a line.
     What we might recognize as a lane marker but a curiosity to him.
     Continuing, opening a window in the dust. Now his fingers snag
     o n something. He tugs it and it gives a little, dust crumbling to
     reveal a section of rusted chainlink. A corner of metal is
     visible. Lincoln exposes the rest. A sign, barely legible: "US
     Government - Restricted Area". He frowns, trying to assimilate.
     Ester comes up to join him. Off her anxious look, he decides-

                             LINCOLN
                    I think I've found a path.

92   EXT . THE GREEN MOUNTAINS - DAY

     W h i t e rock blanketed by stands of fir and ponderosa pine. A
     whisper skims over the treecaps, circling in on a high shelf.
     Here, remotely nestled in a clearing, stands a glass villa.

93   INT . THE GLASS VILLA - DAY

     The flood of light, the majestic view lend an air of beatitude.
     The decor is minimalist with Native American accents, kokopelli
     spirits in carved silhouette. Dr. Sanger stands at a glass wall,
     looking out across the green mountain valley. On the sofa sits
     Merrick, now in civvies, still gaunt from worry. The air stirs
     as a maid ushers in A WOMAN - 30's, all business, sharp blue
     eyes, a severe, mannish coiffure. Her name is ELLEN CROWNE.

                                CROWNE
                    Good morning, gentlemen.

                                    SANGER
                    Bernard, this is Ellen Crowne from our
                    legal department. Ellen, this is
                    Bernard Merrick, director of products.

                                 MERRICK
                    Thank you for coming out here.

                                CROWNE
                    Well when Henry called me I got the
                    sense it wasn't for a social visit.

     They settle at a table. A jug of icewater a n d glasses laid out.

                             CROWNE
                    I understand there was an incident?

                                                                 60.



                            MERRICK
              First, let me stress there's no way we
              could have anticipated what happened...

                           CROWNE
              We're on the same team, Mr. Merrick.
              Just give me the facts down-and-dirty.

                               MERRICK
                     (uneasy, clears his throat)
              We'v e lost two of our products. They
              escaped containment last night.

Crowne casts a troubled look at Sanger. Merrick quickly adds-

                                Merrick (cont'd)
               However, we have all available
               resources dedicated to the search.

                         CROWNE
              How exactly did this happen?

                           MERRICK
              We'r e still piecing it together.

                        CROWNE
              Do we expect more products to escape?

                           DR. SANGER
              Don't be so alarmist, Ellen.

                         CROWNE
              I'm sorry, Henry, but you asked me
              here to assess our liabilities.

                        MERRICK
              To answer your question, we condition
              our products with a deterrent. A fear of
              contamination. And thereby of the outer
              environment. So to escape, they first
              have to escape their conditioning.

Crowne pauses to absorb this and to light a slim black cigarette.

                                CROWNE
              Containment is one of the terms of our
              state health license. The fact it was
              compromised could put us in violation.

                       DR. SANGER
              Bureaucracy.

                                                  61.



              CROWNE
Henry , it was a bloody battle getting
our license through in the first place.

                DR. SANGER
They're not going to pull our license,
Ellen. We have a lot of friends on the
Commission. Not to mention the goodwill
we earned in DC when we took over the
facility; a bunker complex for a bio-
chemical war that never happened... We
relieved them of a costly embarrassment.

           CROWNE
I'm not sure we can rely on that.

                DR. SANGER
Alright . What do you suggest?

              CROWNE
First, I need you to level with me.
What are our chances of finding them?

             MERRICK
Well, in our favor, they've never been
outside containment. They'd have no
coordinates, no sense of direction.

         CROWNE
I don't see how that's in our favor.

               MERRICK
They're in the middle of the desert.
Food and water become an issue.

          CROWNE
So they might return to the trough?

            MERRICK
Possibly.

           CROWNE
And if not? How long could they last?

         MERRICK
A few days maybe. But there is another
variable. We maintain the products in a
sterile environment. So basically their
immune systems are untested. Toxins,
pathogens, environmentals t h e rest of
us overcome routinely, to them...

                                                               62.



                             DR. SANGER
               That's a little drastic. Some immune
               systems are more adaptive than others.

                            CROWNE
               Let's take the drastic case. What then?

                              MERRICK
               Well . . . the male, we could cover. Fast-
               track another generation before the
               sponsor ever needed access. The female
               comes under the maternity plan. She's
               three months pregnant. Even if we fast-
               tracked another generation, we couldn't
               fast-track the pregnancy. We'd miss the
               delivery date, the sponsor would wonder
               why and there would be... difficulties.

Crowne looks worried. Sanger pours a glass of icewater.

                           DR. SANGER
               Even so, the worst may not happen.

                         CROWNE
               We haven't even touched on the worst. If
               these products reach a populated area,
               there's the problem of scrutiny.
                             DR. SANGER
               Ellen , we operate under State license on
               a lease from the Federal Government...

                             CROWNE
                    ( c u t s him off, harshly)
               We slipped through a loophole in the
               clone laws, Henry. And they only let
               u s through because they smelt money.
               And they gave us a government basement
               to cover their own a s s e s not ours. It's
               at the core of our license - why we
               screen potential sponsors, why we make
               them sign discretion agreements, why
               containment is such a critical factor -
               to limit the extent of public scrutiny.

                             DR. SANGER
               E i t h e r way, it's unlikely they'd get
               that far. It's at least twenty miles to
               the next settlement. Right, Bernard?

Merrick hesitates before nodding his assent. Crowne pounces on it-

                                                                    63.



                                     CROWNE
                    Something to add, Mr. Merrick?

                                    MERRICK
                    I just don't think we should under-
                    estimate them. Especially the male.

                               DR. SANGER
                    And I don't think we should panic.

     He cautions Merrick with a discreet look, then shakes a pill
     from a bottle. Crowne looks forward to both men. Very serious.

                                      CROWNE
                    Gentlemen, whatever happens we need
                    t o keep one thing clearly in mind. As
                    far as the world at large goes, we are
                    just another medical services company.
                    Anything that alters that perception
                    puts us at risk. And we cannot rely on
                    the sanction of the law to protect us.
                    Whenever and wherever and in whatever
                    condition we recover these products, we
                    have to stay beyond reproach. All it
                    takes is one nudge to put us in the
                    spotlight. Then you'll see how fast
                    politicians can run for cover.

     Merrick shifts, uneasy. Sanger takes the pill with a bitter smile-

                              DR. SANGER
                    I n other words we need to find them
                    o r else. That's very astute, Ellen.

94   EXT . DESERT HIGHWAY - SUNSET

     The dust swirls and puffs across a highway of yesteryear. A dirt
     track but for patches of exposed concrete and angles of buckled
     lampposts. The empty path reaches to a blood-red sunset.

95   EXT . SCRAPYARD - SUNSET

     The dust skims over mountains of rusted scrap. Nestled in the
     mountains is a shack. A sign creaks in the breeze "Osmund D e e r ,
     Licensed Salvage Merchant". On the porch sits an old man in a
     greasy ballcap a n d dungarees. This is the eponymous owner, OZZIE.

     He's sitting on a lounger, surveying his empire, enjoying a beer
     and a cigarette. Exhaling a drag of smoke, his eyes crease to a
     squint. He sees something through the smoke, silhouetted against
     the sunset. An approaching figure, wary, like a flighty animal.

                                                                          64.



                                OZZIE
                    Hello?

     The silhouetted figure doesn't answer, just stares back at him.

                               OZZIE
                    Can I help you?

     This seems to get a response. The figure ventures closer. We
     recognize Lincoln. Exhausted, dust-covered and dry-throated -

                              LINCOLN
                    My friend... she needs water.

96   INT . BACK ROOM - THE SHACK - SUNSET

     A mass of technology and furniture from recent and distant past.
     Lincoln lowers Ester onto a threadbare sofa. Ozzie, excited to
     have visitors, bustles up with a water gallon, pouring a glass.
     Lincoln takes it and tips it to Ester's lips. She coughs it out
     at first. Then takes the glass and starts drinking with vigor.
     Ozzie sets down the water gallon in front of his visitors. Then
     settles in an armchair and cracks open a beer. It lends the mood,
     albeit strained, of a social visit. Lonely old Ozzie wanting to
     make it so. Despite which, both men have an eye on each other.

                               OZZIE
                    Got stuck in that supercell, didya?

     Lincoln eyes him, wary of the question. Ozzie reads confusion-

                                     OZZIE
                    Supercellstorm , that's what they call
                    it on the news anyways. I n my day, we
                    just called `em "big ol' h o w l e r s " .

     Ozzie chuckles to himself. It seems to put his visitor at ease.

                                OZZIE
                    Yep, I heard it shut down some of the
                    lodeways. Dust in the works, I guess.
                    Where were you folks headed anyways?

     Lincoln gulps down some water, deciding an answer. Then ventures-

                                LINCOLN
                    Away.

                                 OZZIE
                    A w a y ? You mean, like outta s t a t e ?

                                LINCOLN
                    " O u t of state"...

                                                                          65.



     The term is meaningless to Lincoln but he likes the sound of it.
     Ozzie grins. This is starting to feel like a real social visit.

                               OZZIE
                    N o w where's my manners gone? I'm Ozzie.
                    Osmund r e a l l y . But folks call me Ozzie.

     An awkward lull as Ozzie waits for his visitor to reciprocate.

                                     OZZIE
                    S o m e t i m e s I like to make a joke of it,
                    my last name bein' D e e r . . . "O. Deer".

     O z z i e chuckles but the pun seems lost on his visitor. He lets it
     drop. The awkward silence returns. Lincoln drinks the water,
     wondering if this strange old man is as harmless as he appears.

                                OZZIE
                    We l l now, looks like yer g i r l f r i e n d ' s
                    made herself at home.

     Lincoln looks at Ester, slumped over, asleep on the sofa. Ozzie
     puts a finger to his lips, beckoning his visitor out of the room.

97   EXT . SCRAPYARD - DUSK

     The porch light comes on, casting the scrapyard in grades of
     light and shadow. Ozzie steps out onto the porch, lighting a
     cigarette. His visitor hovering at the threshold, he offers the
     pack. Lincoln steps out and takes one. Ozzie lights it for him-

                                    OZZIE
                    Yer girlfriend sure is pretty.

     His visitor looks at him curiously. Ozzie misinterprets that
     he's said something out of turn. Time to change the subject-

                              OZZIE
                    So what's with them tattoos, huh?

     He taps his forehead. Lincoln fingers his crosshatch, suddenly
     aware of it now and suspicious of the question. Ozzie palliates-

                                OZZIE
                    Hey , in the eye of the beholder, right?
                    Now this place, this is beautiful to
                    me. This is my place. I own it. `May
                    not look like much but you'd be
                    surprised. C'mon, lemme show you...

     Ozzie moseys into the scrapyard, beckoning his visitor. Lincoln
     hesitates, then follows him, sensing it's better to play along.

                                                                       66.



                                    OZZIE
                    M o s t a t h i s heavy stuff's industrial
                    scrap. Comes in from all over. Easy way
                    round the recyclin' l a w s . Me, I sell it
                    on to the boondock b o y s for meltdown.
                    Other stuff, I pick up at the scrap
                    markets. Fix it up, `fetches a price.

     The y reach a vehicle shell. A rust-pocked chassis, canted on its
     axle, we might recognize it as an automobile from our own era.

                               OZZIE
                    Fossil fuel transport. This piece o'
                    junk's a collector's item. All that
                    Age of the Wheel nostalgia, "elegant
                    era of transport" bullshit. I find the
                    parts, she's as good as solid gold.

     Ozzie pats his investment and moves to another rusted metal pile.
     Steepled by rail tracks, we see elevator sheaves, tension cables.

                                 OZZIE
                    Now this here's got a colorful history.
                    Came in from this ol' g o v e r n m e n t bunker
                    out in the valley. `Got shut down way
                    back. Then this new outfit took over,
                    stripped the place out. I guess they're
                    doin' s o m e more remodelling cause I
                    just had `em in again the other day...
                           ( a tug of smoke, reflective)
                    Hump`n dump crew. Nice fellas.

     Lincoln frowns. The term is familiar. The taste of smoke, a hint.
     But his memory has been clouded by trauma. Ozzie reads his face-

                               OZZIE
                    You okay there?

     Lincoln looks at him, something breaking the clouds. A sense of
     danger, indistinct. Suddenly cautious, he stubs his cigarette-

                               LINCOLN
                    I'm going to check on my friend.

98   INT . FRONT ROOM - THE SHACK - DUSK

     A front room turned into a front office. Piles of paper teeter
     atop junk furniture. A bankers lap we might recognize from our
     own era glows over a desk where Ozzie is rummaging, looking for
     something. He stops to peer through and check on his visitors-

                                                                   67.



The woman still lies asleep on the sofa. The man is sitting
beside her armchair, head bowed, seemingly plunged in thought.
O z z i e resumes rummaging to find a crumpled delivery note. He
reviews it for a moment. Then quickly clears away some more
papers to uncover a keypad device. It is known as a "holocom".
He taps a key and a holoframe resolves. Then taps in some digits
from the delivery note. The holoframe snows with static. Then a
crosshatch insignia appears, spinning in 3D:

                              RECORDED VOICE (ON HOLOCOM)
               Welcome to The Sanger Institute. If you
               know your party's extension, press...

                           LINCOLN (O.S.)
               What are you doing?

Ozzie jerks round to find his visitor suddenly standing there.
He fumbles on the holocom keypad and the crosshatch blinks out.

                              OZZIE
               Nuthin . I wasn't doin nuthin .

Lincoln frowns, the sense of danger becoming more distinct.
Ozzie reads his visitor's troubled expression, realizing-

                        OZZIE
               I knew it... them clothes... them
               weird tattoos... I mean, I heard
               stories from those guys but I never...

O f f his visitor's frown, Ozzie bites his tongue. He's cornered
in this cramped space with a freak of science. Time to backpedal-

                          OZZIE
               N o t that I believe `em... buncha c r a z y
               stories... nuthin t o do with you...

He chuckles feebly. But his visitor just stares back at him,
pupils dilated and dark, somehow inhuman. Time to wriggle out-

                               OZZIE
               W h a d d y a s a y we just forget about it,
               huh? How about I go getcha a beer?

He makes a move past but his visitor doesn't budge. Lincoln
senses danger in this old man, whose fear is now manifest-

                               OZZIE
               What e v e r you want... Just take it...
               Whaddya w a n t . . . ? You want money...?

                                                                     68.



      His visitor frowns. Ozzie quickly unlocks a cashbox. He grabs
      some colored plastic cards and offers them like meat to a lion.

                                 OZZIE
                     I t ' s all I got... Take it... just
                     please... just don't hurt me...

      His visitor takes a blue card, inspecting it like a curiosity.
      Then steps closer. Ozzie shrinks back. An ominous moment, then-

                                 LINCOLN
                     " O u t of state" - how do I get there?

      O f f Ozzie's cowering and confused look, we -
                                                               C U T TO:

99    EXT . SKY OVER THE DESERT - NIGHT

      F r o m darkness grows a seed of light. The whisper flies low and
      quiet, its spotlight roving the undulant desert. Now picking out
      metal glints as it banks over a scrapyard. Now training its beam
      on a figure in the dust whirl beneath. Ozzie, his hair flying
      wild, gesticulating madly. The whisper follows his directions,
      nosing onwards, its spotlight corrugating across the red rocks.

100   EXT . SHUTTLE STOP - NIGHT

      I n the middle of nowhere, a canopied platform. Not unlike the sub-
      w a y platform, it borders a deeply trenched lodeway. A wave of dust
      rolls in, swelled by the whisper, landed beyond. It seems to bring
      Scheer to the platform. He scans around for a clue, a footprint
      perhaps. But somehow he already knows. He looks up the lodeway,
      eyes honing. The deep black line stretches far into the night.

101   INT . THE GLASS VILLA - NIGHT

      Silence. Still. Sanger sits nursing a cup of herb tea. Crowne
      sits smoking. Stubs in the ashtray speak of long hours waiting.
      The still is broken as Merrick emerges from an adjacent room.
      Sanger and Crowne look up, expectant. Merrick closes the door
      with slow care. Then he faces them, a grim tenor in his voice-

                                   MERRICK
                     Bad news.

102   EXT . PHOENIX - NIGHT

      The whisper slices the night, running lights blinking. We pan to
      frame it against a skyline of black towers. A glittering row of
      domes and spires, somehow celestial, touching the sky. The city
      bears no trace of its origins, once built over Indian ruins, now
      rebuilt, subsumed by urban overhaul. It has become a metropolis.

                                                                        69.



103   INT. ROOFTOP NIGHTCLUB - PHOENIX

      A glass dome, faceted, insectile. A haut-monde h i v e . The movers
      and shakers of the high-tech boomtown drinking, dancing. Shot
      waitresses dose blue tequila. Bass music thuds like a heartbeat.
      Scheer looks out of place here but the crowd's too self-absorbed
      to care. He moves through them, invisibly, towards a corner booth.

      TWO MEN IN SUITS sit with a bottle of blue tequila. The first is
      bald, pale and dead-looking, he'd be the grim reaper but for his
      fixed leer. The second is long-haired, bearded, hulking, more of
      a grim ploughman. He has a metal brace screwed into his forearm.

                                  SCHEER
                     Which one of you is Diggs?

                                   DIGGS (THE BALD MAN)
                     That's me, slick. This here's my
                     partner Burdon. Don't mind him. He
                     gets a little shy around strangers.

                                 SCHEER
                     What happened to his arm?

                                     DIGGS
                     `Pursuit last week. The guy took a
                     swing at him with a fireaxe. Didn't
                     stop Burdie though . `Took down that
                     fucker with one arm, didn't you?

      Burdon sips his drink. Scheer, underwhelmed, takes a seat.

                                SCHEER
                     You don't look like bounty hunters.

                                 DIGGS
                     Well we're on the job, see? And it
                     kind of helps if you bleed in. You
                     don't look like a bondman either.

                                SCHEER
                     I'm just an intermediary.

                                DIGGS
                     Now that's what people use when they
                     don't want to get their hands dirty.

      He grins, cannily. Scheer grimaces, a pro suffering an amateur.

                              SCHEER
                     I was told you also handled civil
                     bonds. Debt runners, data-thieves...

                                                               70.



                          DIGGS
              What we hunt depends on the bounty.

                          SCHEER
              It's worth ten platinum. Unmarked.

Diggs pauses at this. A huge amount. Suspiciously huge. He licks
some salt, downs a blue tequila shot and bites a slice of lime.

                            DIGGS
              What's the bond?

                         SCHEER
              The parties I represent want to limit
              the specific details. But let's just
              say industrial secrets are involved.

                         DIGGS
              Ten platinum. Must be big secrets.

That canny grin again. It raises Scheer's hackles-

                         SCHEER
              Any good at keeping them?

                         DIGGS
              Oh, me and Burdie, we're busy bees. We
              don't have time to file every report
              and we got real bad memories. But just
              so we understand each other, slick,
              we're talking about a bag job, right?

Scheer returns an equivocal look. Then dips in his pocket for two
digital slides - Lincoln and Ester's headshots, spinning in 3D.

                            DIGGS
              What's up with these tattoos? They
              look like fucking boondock types .

                         SCHEER
              All I'm authorized to tell you is they
              have no records in this state. Also
              that they're not armed or dangerous.

                         DIGGS
              How about we start with their names?

                          SCHEER
              John and Jane Doe...

                            DIGGS
              You're kidding me, right? No names?

                                                               71.



Scheer's look says he's serious. But Diggs is still confounded.

                          DIGGS
              The n - with all due respect - how the
              fuck d o you expect us to find them?

                             SCHEER
              Because you won't have to look. They
              jumped an overnight shuttle. They'll be
              headed for the terminal, trying to get
              out of state. It's strictly a recovery
              job. For you, it should be childsplay.

                          DIGGS
              The n why not do it yourself? Or is the
              dog ring just to impress the ladies?

The grin. Scheer moves his hand to cover the USMC ring, stiffly-

                         SCHEER
              The parties I represent want to stay at
              arm's length. And just so we understand
              each other that means no connection, no
              papertrail, no police interest...

                        DIGGS
              Is that everything?

                           SCHEER
              . . . no mistakes. They want these two
              brought in quickly and quietly and
              unharmed. Once you have them, you'll
              contact me for further instructions.

                       DIGGS
              I don't know. What do you say, Burdie?

B u r d o n looks over. Then suddenly stands bolt upright, diving into
his jacket, jerking out what looks like a pump-action shotgun.

                           BURDON
              F r a n k Hofstetter! This is a bond
              recovery! Step away from the bar!

F A C E S TURN as he swings aim across the bar - HOFSTETTER, slight,
wide-eyed, looking hunted - customers moving away, exposing him -
Burdon chambering a cartridge, emphatic - Hofstetter f r e e z e s - a
deer in the headlights - a moment of hesitation - then he runs.

- B O O M - BURDON FIRES but the shot misses, hitting the bartender -
exploding on impact with A BLINDING ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE - the
stunned bartender spasms and drops - Burdon pumps and chambers
another slug - his weapon now earned the name of a "thunderbolt".

                                                                            72.



      A STAMPEDE BEGINS - customers running scared - his quarry lost
      in the stampede, Burdon vaults over the table - Diggs pulls out
      what looks like a twin-barrel sawn-off and launches after him -
      Scheer stays seated, watching the hunt with remote curiosity--

      H O F S T E T T E R C L A W S THROUGH THE STAMPEDE - spotting Burdon and the
      thunderbolt close behind - he drops out of the firing line - onto
      his knees - crawling, banged about - almost at the exit, almost--
      T W I N BARRELS PRESS TO HIS HEAD - Diggs looks down - grinning,
      beckoning him upright - Hofstetter l o o k s up - bleak, defeated -
      A GIRL blunders into them - toppling over Hofstetter i n t o Diggs--

      H O F S T E T T E R T A K E S HIS CHANCE TO RUN - now scrambling against the
      stampede - Diggs disentangles himself and levels his weapon -
      the stampede parting - throwing themselves to the ground as--

      - B O O M - DIGGS FIRES - the scattershot hits Hofstetter a s he flees
      up some steps - peppering his leg - sparks off metal as Diggs
      keeps firing - his weapon now earned the name of a "rainmaker".
      H O F S T E T T E R R E A C H E S A CATWALK - his leg dragging, numbing from
      t h e tranquilizer cores - the catwalk dead-ends - blind panic now -
      He ducks under the rail, reaching for the dome - finding a
      precarious handhold, he swings across - trying to climb --

      D I G G S COMES UP BENEATH - looking up, grinning - the pathetic
      sight of Hofstetter - one leg useless - clinging to the dome
      like a fly trapped under glass - as Burdon goes to recover him -

                                   DIGGS
                      Don't bother. He'll drop by himself.
      B u r d o n pulls out some handcuffs and stands waiting. Diggs returns
      to the booth. Pouring out two tequila shots, he grins at Scheer -

                                    DIGGS
                      N o w . . . where were we?

104   EXT . THE DESERT - MORNING

      S u n l i g h t blinks off a chain of carriages, travelling the trench
      of a lodeway. The overnight shuttle slits through the desert.

105   INT . PASSENGER CAR - MORNING
      The sun is a muted orb behind polarized glass. Lincoln stares out
      of the window at the bleak new world blurring past. He's wearing
      Ozzie's ballcap o v e r his crosshatch, his former clothes discarded
      for some of the old man's ill-fitting denims. Perhaps a disguise
      or perhaps just to shed the memory. He glances across at Ester,
      dressed likewise, her hair teased to cover her crosshatch. She's
      dozing, head rested on the glass. A TICKET COLLECTOR comes up-

                                                                        73.



                               TICKET COLLECTOR
                      Tickets...
      Lincoln looks at the man in uniform, uncertain what he wants. The
      ticket collector shakes his head. These two look like deadbeats.

                                   T I C K E T COLLECTOR (CONT'D)
                      A d u l t fare is forty five currency
                      units. Do you have the money, sir?

      Lincoln assimilates. Money. The word is familiar. He pulls out
      the blue plastic card. The man in uniform looks encouraged. He
      gives him the card, watching him slot it into a handheld device,
      which briefly flashes, then the card is returned. Lincoln sees a
      strip at the top is now transparent, like a depleted reservoir.
      He assimilates. Not so different from the transactions in the
      world below. Then he notices Ester is awake and is looking at
      him. Her bright eyes, dim and troubled, somehow accusatory.

                                  LINCOLN
                      I t ' s going to be okay, Ester.

                                ESTER
                           (faint)
                      Is it?

                                LINCOLN
                      We just need to get out of state.

      Ester , disconsolate, looks out of the window. In her gaze, the
      forlorn air of a hatchling fallen from the nest. Lincoln watches
      her, knowing her troubles and knowing that he cannot relieve them.

106   EXT . PHOENIX - DAY

      The skyline stands reprised in daylight. A glimmering citadel.

107   EXT . SHUTTLE STOP - PHOENIX - DAY

      P a s s e n g e r s climb the steps from an underground gloom. Lincoln and
      Ester with them, jostled by the more certain flow. They cross the
      portal onto the street and stop, dazzled by the sunlight. Only to
      be dazzled again by the sudden, stunning prospect of the city...

      F i r s t there's the quality of light, a burning white, perhaps from
      depleted ozone, depicting everything in a surreal shimmer. Then
      there's the towers, darkly crystalline, facets of polarized glass
      rising to domes and spires, like monolothic f i n g e r s reaching for
      the sky. The traffic flashing past, the chassis identifiable as
      trucks, taxis, compacts, sedans, streamlined in a nautical trim,
      hull runners in place of wheels. The sound of claxons, more like
      fog horns than car horns. Then there's the street itself, a six-
      l a n e lodeway, lanes marked with buoys, bobbing around on cables.

                                                                            74.



      The graceful arcs of pedestrian bridges at the intersections. The
      citizens, strange hairstyles, fashions, all wearing sunglasses.
      Even to us it's a wondrous sight. The urbanism, the grandeur, as
      if here in the heart of southwest, Manhattan has met Venice.

                                  V O I C E (O.S.)
                      He y , man, spare a little green?

      A w e interrupted, Lincoln and Ester look around. Slouched by the
      street exit is A HOBO with a mangy dog. He grins toothlessly-

                                   T H E HOBO
                      A i n ' t eaten in two days, have we, boy?

      Lincoln and Ester step back as the dog rises to greet them. Tail
      wagging, it noses forward, sniffing. Then, abruptly, drops its
      tail and backs off, whining. Lincoln and Ester likewise back off.
      Both sides have just discovered a new species. The hobo pets his
      whining canine, watching the strangers walk off with curiosity.

108   EXT . STREET - DAY

      The sunlight flares off passing vehicles, hypnotic. The faces of
      pedestrians flash past. Lincoln and Ester wander in thrall up the
      street. Everywhere new sights, new curiosities bombard them...

      The storefronts, mysterious recesses behind polarized glass. The
      glass, alive with pixellated g r a p h i c s , marquees: "Temps! Temps!
      New Tech Opportunities!" - "Beauty Therapy! Manicures, Dermals,
      Follicle Grafts!" - "Discount Legal Service! Class Actions Only!"

      H o l o f r a m e b i l l b o a r d s loom over the street, huge shimmering
      panels like phantom jumbotrons, commercials playing on a loop:
      - - A businessman in a conference room, shrinking from a fierce
      negotiation; the scene replayed with the same businessman, now
      on his feet, stabbing his finger angrily in the air; a pill
      bottle in CU, a text super "Combatrine! The Aggression Enhancer"
      - - A teenager bemused by his homework: his parents escorting him
      into a clinic; the teenager hooded by an electronic dome; his
      parents clapping; the teenager smiling as he accepts a diploma;
      a text super "Intellex: Data Impression For A New Generation"

      Lincoln suddenly looks round, realizing Ester is gone from his
      side. He scans the sea of faces. Then spots her stepping through
      a doorway. Over the threshold is a holoform: a pig with wings,
      circled by the legend "Hog Heaven! Home Of The True Hamburger".

109   INT . HOG HEAVEN - DAY

      F a s t food outlets have evidently changed little. Promotional
      posters in 3D: "Ham Slam", "Porker Forkers", "Bacon Blitz".

                                                                     75.



      Service counter, seating area. Ester is looking around like
      Alice In Wonderland. Lincoln comes up, out of breath, edgy-

                              LINCOLN
                     I told you to stay with me.

                                     ESTER
                           ( i n n o c e n t , plaintive)
                     I'm hungry.

                                  LINCOLN
                     O k a y . Okay...

      He nods, realizing he is too. He plants Ester in a seat and looks
      around. People stand in line transacting, receiving food trays.
      Not unlike nutrition plaza. Lincoln ventures to the counter. He
      offers the blue card hopefully. THE SERVICE CLERK looks at him-

                                T H E SERVICE CLERK
                     A r e you gonna tell me what you want?

                                      LINCOLN
                            ( b e a t , no other reference)
                     What are my options?

                                  T H E SERVICE CLERK
                     K n o c k yourself out, buddy.

      He indicates a menu above. Lincoln assimilates, looking up at
      the menu. Understanding now, his face lifts to almost a smile.
      It's the first time he's been given an unrestricted choice.

110   INT . SEATING AREA - A FEW MINUTES LATER

      Lincoln returns to Ester with a tray of food and drink. She's
      staring off again, distant. He puts a burger and drink cup in
      front of her. She seems not to notice. He tries to engage her-

                              LINCOLN
                     I asked the man how to get to the
                     terminal. He said it's not far.

      But Ester just keeps staring, her brow now furrowing as A LITTLE
      GIRL skips past, maybe 11, sipping a soda. Now Lincoln sees her
      too and is transfixed. Now the little girl notices the strangers,
      staring at her. She hurries onward, uncomfortable. Lincoln and
      Ester's eyes follow. It's the first time they've seen a child.

111   EXT . PHOENIX TERMINAL - DAY

      A low rumble. A plume of smoke. A sudden eruption of fire. A bird
      rises from the flames and a phoenix spreads its wings. Widening,
      we reveal this is a holoform o v e r the terminal entrance.

                                                                        76.



      Union Station now looks more like Grand Central. A huge granite
      facade, a covered colonnade linking to pedestrian bridges at the
      corners. Here, in the flow of figures, we make out Lincoln and
      Ester, resembling tourists. Then, a short distance behind, we
      spot two more figures. The hobo and his timorous dog. Following.

112   INT . CONCOURSE - TERMINAL - DAY

      V a u l t e d . Arched windows, mosaiced i n polarized glass. Sunlight
      falls in filtered shafts. Footfalls echo off polished granite.
      Lincoln and Ester scan around. Ester looks daunted by the space.
      Lincoln looks focused. He sees people in line, transacting.

113   INT . TICKET WINDOW - DAY
      The sign on the window reads "Tickets". Lincoln assimilates. The
      word is familiar. He steps up to the counter with Ester. A TICKET
      CLERK - female, immaculately groomed - greets them with a glossy
      smile. Lincoln offers her the blue card. She seems not to notice.

                                    T H E TICKET CLERK
                     We l c o m e to Phoenix Union Station. What
                     is your date of travel, sir?

      Lincoln has to think. Dates mean nothing to him. He ventures-

                                 LINCOLN
                     Now...

                                T H E TICKET CLERK
                     An d what is your destination?

                                LINCOLN
                     O u t of state.

                                T H E TICKET CLERK
                     I'm sorry. Could you repeat that?

                               LINCOLN
                     We want to go out of state.

                                T H E TICKET CLERK
                     I'm sorry. Could you repeat that?

                                 V O I C E (O.S.)
                     L i k e talking to a wall, ain't it?

      Lincoln and Ester turn to look. The interceder is pale, bald,
      wearing leathers. A stranger to them, we recognize him as DIGGS-

                                       DIGGS
                     H o l o s e r v e . C h e a p e r than flesh and
                     blood but nothing between the ears.

                                                                     77.



      Diggs demonstrates, wafting his hand across the ticket counter.
      It cuts through the ticket clerk with a holographic ripple.

                                   DIGGS
                      F i r s t time I used one of these, I
                      asked her out on a date...

      He grins genially, examining their faces, verifying his quarry.
      Lincoln examines the pale man. The sense of danger is welling-

                                  LINCOLN
                      What do you want?

                                  DIGGS
                      J u s t wanted to help, that's all.
      D i g g s shrugs, disarming, trying to win them over, nice and easy
      per the mandate. Then he notices the eyes of his male quarry. The
      pupils, black and dilating. Suddenly the male jerks away, like a
      shying horse, drawing the female with him. Diggs, unperturbed,
      makes no attempt to follow. Turning his back on them, he touches
      a device concealed in his ear canal, a miniature two-way radio-

                                     D I G G S (INTO RADIO)
                      B u r d i e , it's them. East exit.

114   EXT . TERMINAL - DAY

      Lincoln and Ester emerge into the colonnade, rejoining the flow
      of figures. Lincoln presses the pace, alert, darting looks back.
      The pale man doesn't appear to be following. But the sense of
      danger is spurring him to gain distance. Ester, vicarious to the
      danger, stays close to Lincoln's side, scurrying to keep up.
      Neither of them notices the grey vehicle sliding up on them,
      kerbside. A commercial transit van known as a "cutter", it's a
      common sight on the streets. The driver leans out of the window -
      hair tied back, dressed in buckskins, we recognize BURDON-

                                 BURDON
                      You folks need a ride?

      Lincoln and Ester turn to look. The dark giant is just another
      stranger, cast in a demeanor of casual inquiry. He's offering an
      opportunity to gain distance but Lincoln remains hesitant. The
      sense of danger, turbulent, hard to read. Burdon sugars the way-

                                     BURDON
                      P r i v a t e cab. No state surcharge...

      He taps a button and the side-door slips open. Lincoln looks into
      the lightless c a v i t y , wavering, uncertain. Ester, hugging close,
      nervous. Figures passing, jostling them toward the cavity. The
      dark giant, looking on expectantly. The pause stretching, then-

                                                                78.



                           VOICE (O.S.)
               He y ! What the fuck are you doing, man?
B a c k down the colonnade, THE HOBO is gesticulating to Burdon-

                        T H E HOBO
               I told you! They went inside!

The hobo doesn't see Lincoln and Ester, unwitting that he's just
betrayed himself as their shadow... and Burdon as their predator.
His dog starts barking. Lincoln starts backing away with Ester,
his eyes blackening, the danger surging, the dog barking, the
giant's face dropping, the elements converging... They bolt.

                           BURDON
               Shit!

B U R D O N JAMS INTO REVERSE - but his pursuit is cut short by a
parked vehicle - he swings a look back, jabbing his earpiece-

                            B U R D O N (INTO RADIO)
               N o r t h Corner! North Corner!

LINCOLN AND ESTER RACE UP THE COLONNADE - against the flow of
figures - darting and weaving like fish swimming upstream --

D I G G S BURSTS FROM THE NORTH EXIT - launching up the north side
of the terminal - thinner foot traffic here, faster going --

LINCOLN AND ESTER SLOWING - the flow massing under the portico -
they peel through - the holoform p h o e n i x rumbling overhead --

D I G G S TURNING THE NORTH CORNER - pausing to touch his earpiece -
now launching south down the colonnade - towards the portico -
jerking a pair of handcuffs from his belt, ready for the snatch--

LINCOLN AND ESTER GAINING PACE - past the portico now, the way
opening - Lincoln's eyes flaring - a face in the distance ahead -
the pale man - he swings Ester around - doubling back to find --
B U R D O N COMING UP BEHIND - the flow of figures, no obstacle -
parting at his thunderous onset - his quarry, stopped and
staring at him - almost upon them - handcuffs at the ready--

LINCOLN FREEZES - caught between the dark giant and the pale man -
Ester cringing to his side - the dark giant charging up on them -
sunlight on metal - the sight of the handcuffs - TRIGGERING HIM--

LINCOLN GRABS ESTER - swinging her off the sidewalk - lowering
her into the lodeway - leaping down to join her - lode poles
pulsing, thrumming - rivets on their denims, rattling from the
polarity - traffic soaring past on lode-stream, chest-high -

                                                                       79.



      DARTING OUT INTO TRAFFIC - Lincoln leads Ester by the hand like
      a child - across the lanes, dodging, weaving through the gaps -
      claxons b l a r i n g , deafening - sunflashes, blinding - a sudden
      shadow - a huge freight truck bearing down, no gaps ahead --

      LINCOLN DRAGS ESTER TO THE GROUND - both flattening against the
      concrete lode-bed - the shadow engulfing them - the truck's hull
      runners shearing narrowly over their heads - the rush of air,
      sweeping off Lincoln's ballcap - rousing a storm of dust--

      LINCOLN AND ESTER CHOKING - crawling onward through the dust -
      hull runners scudding overhead - maybe only a foot of clearance -
      buoy cables whipping around like cheesewire - onwards, crawling
      across the concrete - fighting their way across the lode-stream--

      B U R D O N WATCHING from the sidewalk where Lincoln and Ester first
      dropped, scouring the trench for a sight of them. Now he spots
      them, climbing up onto the sidewalk the far side of the street.

      D i g g s now arrives at his side, sweating, out of breath. Now
      seeing their quarry take off up the far side of the street, he
      turns to his lumberous p a r t n e t , fury mixed with incredulity-

                                 DIGGS
                      Why the fuck d i d n ' t you go after them?!

      B u r d o n just looks at him, displaying the metal brace on his fore-
      a r m . Diggs, out of sheer frustration, gives him a pounding shove-

                                DIGGS
                      Fuck!

115   EXT . ALLEY - DAY
      The refuge of shadow. The alley is divided by a lodeway and the
      walls on each side are jutted with dumpsters. Lincoln and Ester
      run up the narrowed strip of sidewalk, forced into single file.

      A huge shape looms ahead. A garbage vehicle known as a "scow".
      Like a leviathan spreading its tentacles, the scow's tube-arrays
      dock with the dumpsters and start sucking the contents out.

      Lincoln glances back to find Ester has stopped and is cringing
      away from the tentacled monster. He returns to her, his eyes
      flicking around, aware that their real predators are close-

                                LINCOLN
                      We have to keep going.

      He takes Ester's hand, drawing her onward. But Ester recoils,
      shaking off his grip. Now he looks at her more closely. She's
      panting, shuddering, fraught with trauma. Her voice is haunted-

                                                                            80.



                                      ESTER
                     P l e a s e . . . Please, I want to go back...
      She shrinks into the shadows, shaking her head. The hatchling
      wanting to return to the nest. Lincoln meets her eye, deeply-

                                  LINCOLN
                     T h o s e men - that's what they want too.
      Ester holds his gaze, chest heaving. Then looks back towards the
      alley mouth. Her fingers reach for her belly, clawing a little.
      Then her eyes lower, assimilating, reason reasserting its heavy
      grip. Lincoln senses her turmoil. His voice is soft but sturdy-

                               LINCOLN
                     We have to keep going, Ester.

      Ester looks up at him again. The forlorn air seems to have faded.
      Her eyes, grimly set. Her face, a little haggard. Older somehow.
      She takes Lincoln's hand and together they head off up the alley.

116   EXT . ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

      The alley mouth darkens as a vehicle turns off the street. The
      grey cutter moves through the shadows, prowling and shark-like.

117   INT . CUTTER - DRIVING

      The drone of resistors. The throbbing glow of the drive console,
      a panoply of instrumentation. Burdon steers in silence, Diggs
      beside him, edgy, intent, combing the shadows for their quarry.

                                       DIGGS
                     S u n n a v a b i t c h ! What the fuck d o we do
                     now, huh? They could be anywhere...

                               BURDON
                     We go back to the office and run `em.

                               DIGGS
                     A s what? John and Jane Doe?

                               BURDON
                     We ask the guy.

                                  DIGGS
                     Y e a h , let's tell him we couldn't hack
                     it in kindergarten. See how long him
                     and his ten platinum stick around.

      He fires a barbed look. Burdon absorbs this, unflinched, thinking-

                                                                       81.



                                BURDON
                      I t was blue, right?

                                DIGGS
                      What?

                                  BURDON
                      The y were using a blue currency card.

118   EXT . STREET - DAY

      Lincoln and Ester walk up the street. Wary of attention, they go
      with the flow of figures, eyes peeled for predators. The sights
      of the city now seem hostile. Faces flash past, dead-eyed in sun-
      g l a s s e s . Traffic rushes like steel rapids. Storefronts construct
      a black wall. Holoframe b i l l b o a r d s loom, mocking, half-noticed:

      - - A woman in a bathroom, adjusting her sexy neglige; a crack in
      the door shows a man in bed, waiting; the woman closes the door
      and picks up what looks like a toothpaste tube; she arches her
      eyebrow; "F.I.G. F e m i n i n e Impulse Gel... Because who needs him?"
      - - A cemetery under a grim overcast sky; suddenly a frisbee flies
      across frame; an old woman, dressed like a teenager, catches it;
      she tosses it to an old man dressed likewise; a text super "Death
      Sucks!", a sting, "New Gaza Healthcare: Your Life Is Our Life."
      Lincoln and Ester stop at the corner. They look around, blindly,
      no coordinates, no frame of reference. Urban canyons, identical,
      gordian a n d chasmic. P a s s i n g figures jostle. Then Lincoln spots
      something across the street. It looks like an over-sized phone
      booth. Its beacon flashes; "C.I.N. - CITY INFORMATION NETWORK."

119   INT . CIN BOOTH - DAY

      A flourish of music greets Lincoln and Ester as they enter. The
      fanfare conjures a holoform i n mid-air. A cartoon rattlesnake,
      benignly rendered, welcomes them with a clownish, fanged smile:

                                THE SNAKE
                      H i there! I'm Tattletail! What e v e r you
                      want to know, wherever you want to go, I
                      got the answers! Let's look at the menu!

      A set of text frames appear: "Residential Listings", "Business
      Listings", "Transport Listings", "Hotel Listings". Lincoln
      assimilates. The terminologies are not unfamiliar.

                                 THE SNAKE (CONT'D)
                      N o w let's make a selection!

                                                                     82.



                                   LINCOLN
                         ( b e a t , venturing)
                     Transport...
                                  THE SNAKE
                     O k a y ! Let me open that directory for
                     you! I'll be with you in two shakes!

      The snake rattles accordingly and coils in a holding pattern.
      Then a tomographic map of the city appears. A red dot plants
      itself under a text flag "You Are Here!". Then other red dots
      scatter across the map, each flagging with transportation icons.

120   INT. CUTTER - STREETS - DRIVING - DAY

      B u r d o n steers calmly, scanning the streets. Diggs impatiently
      bashes the keys of a holocom on the drive console. A holoframe
      hovers, snowed with static. Then a secretary's face appears -
      sagging, older, primped and painted young. Her name is JANEEN-

                                  J A N E E N (ON HOLOCOM)
                     D i g g s & Burdon Bond Agency.

                                    DIGGS
                     J a n e e n , where the fuck have you been?

                                   J A N E E N (ON HOLOCOM)
                     B e a u t y therapy. I got a date tonight.

                                DIGGS
                     O h , Jesus... Listen, I want you to
                     punch into the currency stream for me.
                     Sweep for blue card transactions.

                                   J A N E E N (ON HOLOCOM)
                     You're kidding me, right? You have any
                     idea how long that's going to take?

                              DIGGS
                     I want serial numbers, batched a n d
                     cross-referenced. Start from Union
                     Station and work your way out...

      B e f o r e he can object he taps a key. The holoframe blinks out.

121   EXT . BUS STATION - LATE AFTERNOON

      A surging sound. A surface of water. A burst of spray. A dolphin
      leaps from the waves and hangs suspended. Text scrolls around:
      "Get Out Of State & Out Of Mind - Ride the Grey Dolphin Line!"
      This is the next incarnation of the greyhound. The blue facade,
      crested into waves. We make out Lincoln and Ester, now looking
      more like transients than tourists, dirty, worn and exhausted.

                                                                      83.



122   INT. CONCOURSE - BUS STATION

      Low roof. Flat lighting. The faces here seem less threatening,
      the young and the low-income. Lincoln and Ester look around. Not
      unlike the train terminal. People standing in line, transacting.

123   INT . TICKET WINDOW

      Lincoln and Ester step up to the ticket window. A TICKET CLERK -
      male, immaculately groomed - greets them with a polished smile.

                                     T I C K E T CLERK
                      We l c o m e to Grey Dolphin Bus Lines.
                      What is your destination, please?

      Lincoln squints at him. Then wafts his hand across the counter.
      The ticket clerk flinches at the impact. Then composes himself.
      A trace of camp as he smiles bashfully at the rugged customer-

                                  T I C K E T CLERK
                      I t ' s okay. Really. I get that a lot.
                      I'm sorry, now where were we again?

                               LINCOLN
                      I want to get out of state. Now.

                                     T I C K E T CLERK
                      B e l i e v e me, I know how you feel. So
                      where did you want to go exactly?

                                 LINCOLN
                      O u t of state...
                                  T I C K E T CLERK
                      J u s t wherever the wind takes you, huh?

                                     LINCOLN
                      Where's that?

                                   T I C K E T CLERK
                      We l l , if it was me, out to the west
                      coast. It's perfect this time of year.

      Lincoln nods, liking the sound of this. The ticket clerk smiles,
      enjoying the acceptance of his suggestion, he ventures hopefully-

                                        T I C K E T CLERK
                      T r a v e l l i n g alone, are we?

                                 LINCOLN
                      N o . With her.

      He gestures, then realizes Ester is gone from his side again.

                                                                     84.



      He scans the faces. The clerk, disappointed, taps some keys.

                                 T I C K E T COLLECTOR
                      T w o adults, let me see... I'm afraid I
                      can't get you seats till the morning.

124   INT . FOOD SERVICE AREA - BUS STATION

      A grill bar. A rank of vending machines. Ester moves through the
      seating area as if drawn. Now over the ambient noise, we isolate
      the cry of a baby. Ester is following the sound to its source.
      She finds a Mexican woman shushing her infant. The woman looks
      up and smiles. Ester just stands there, awe-struck. Lincoln now
      comes up to reclaim her. He's about to ask why she wandered off
      when she turns to him. He sees her eyes are brimming with tears.
      Tears of joy and sorrow. It's the first time she's seen a baby.

125   EXT . STREET - DUSK

      The winged pig flutters over the doors of "Hog Heaven". The
      milling customers are suddenly parted by Diggs, bursting out
      through the doors. He leaps into the grey cutter, parked
      kerbside. I t peels out with a flash of its halogen eyes.

126   INT . CUTTER - DRIVING - DUSK

      B u r d o n steers, glancing inquisitively at his partner. Diggs taps
      the holocom, urgently, galvanized. The holoframe resolves snowed
      with static. Janeen's face appears. Less primped, disgruntled-

                                   J A N E E N (ON HOLOCOM)
                      D i g g s & Burdon Bond Agency.

                                DIGGS
                      We got a positive on the serial number.
                      Punch in and pull up the transactions.
                      Start with the last hour and work back.

                                    JANEEN
                      G r e a t . So I got to park my ass in
                      front of a screen all night?

                                  DIGGS
                      I t ' s a platinum bond, Janeen. We get
                      this, I'll buy you a new ass, okay?

      He grins at Burdon. The thrill of the chase glows in his eyes.

127   INT . WAITING AREA - BUS STATION - NIGHT

      A blue glass partition wall looks out onto the depot. More like
      a marina with an embarcadero a n d a row of docks. "Liners" slot
      in and out, their nautical trim making them seem like ferries.

                                                                    85.



      Lincoln and Ester sit waiting. Lincoln, rigid, watchful. Ester,
      gazing across at the Mexican woman, who as the infant cradled
      asleep. Ester glances wistfully at Lincoln. Then she frowns-

                                      ESTER
                      Lincoln , what is that? On your face?

      Lincoln turns, touching his face. He feels stubble there. For
      the first time. His body is naturalizing but it feels unnatural
      to him. Ester reaches out and runs her fingers across his cheek.
      Lincoln stiffens a little, unused to this type of contact. But
      her touch is gentle and the contact is warming. Their eyes
      slowly meet, flickering, something passing between them. Then
      Ester's face contorts slightly. She emits a shallow cough.

                                 LINCOLN
                      A r e you alright?

      Ester clears her throat. But another cough follows.

                                ESTER
                      M y throat... it feels dry...

                                     LINCOLN
                      O k a y . . . I'll get you some water.

128   INT . FOOD SERVICE AREA - NIGHT

      E m p t y . The grill bar is closed. Only the vending machines are
      active. Lincoln considers them. Not unlike those he used to
      know. He finds one that offers water bottles. The sign reads
      "Arctic Melt". He pulls out his blue card and looks for the
      slot. Then pauses, picking up his reflection in the glass. He
      examines the shadowy growth on his face. Then he notices his
      eyes. They seem to be darkening. The pupils, welling open. Then
      he feels it. The sense of danger, surging up like a geyser.

129   INT . DEPARTURE AREA

      Ester sits waiting, anxious now, coughing persistently. Hearing
      footfalls, she looks round. But the face that greets her is not
      Lincoln. It's the pale man, the one who chased them. Before she
      can react, he forcefully pulls her upright, tapping his earpiece-

                                   D I G G S (ON RADIO)
                      P i e c e of cake, Burdie. J a n e Doe's in
                      the bag. Keep an eye out for John-Boy.

      Ester looks around in panic. Faces turn but none of them are
      Lincoln's. Diggs confronts the spectators, flashing a badge -

                                  DIGGS
                      Bond recovery... state license.

                                                                      86.



      He marches his female quarry towards the exit. Now she starts to
      struggle and he jerks her back, slapping a cuff onto her wrist-

                                 DIGGS
                     Play nice, little girl. Now you want
                     to tell me where your boyfriend is?

                                   LINCOLN (O.S.)
                     Behind you.

                                     DIGGS
                     What?

      - T H U D - LINCOLN HAMMERS HIS FIST into the pale man as he turns -
      dropping him, flat-on-his-ass - pulling Ester away from him -
      D I G G S JERKS OUT THE RAINMAKER - quick to his feet - more insulted
      than hurt - targeting his quarry - who suddenly duck down as--

      - B O O M - DIGGS FIRES - A WOMAN SCREAMS - the Mexican woman - her
      face, peppered with tranquilizer core - her baby starts crying--
      Ester FROZEN - horrified by the screaming woman - the bloody,
      slack grimace - the baby bawling - Lincoln dragging her down-

      - B O O M - THE BLAST OF THE THUNDERBOLT - Burdon positioned behind
      them - narrowly missing his target - hitting the partition wall -
      - C R A S H - THE PARTITION WALL EXPLODES in a blinding electrical
      discharge - shattering into a sudden TEMPEST OF GLASS SHARDS -

      LINCOLN AND ESTER SPIN ROUND to see the pale man retargeting -
      the dark giant reloading - exit blocked, they lunge towards --
      T H E PARTITION WALL - kicking through the hole in the glass -
      Ester's last glimpse of the screaming woman - the howling baby -

130   EXT . BUS DEPOT - NIGHT

      LINCOLN AND ESTER LEAP OUT onto the embarcadero - running -
      faces blur past - liners flash by with glaring halogens--

      D I G G S LEAPS OUT AFTER THEM - rainmaker poised - the embarcadero
      g l u t t e d with passengers - he can't get a bead on his quarry--
      LINCOLN AND ESTER VAULTING over the scattered luggage - the
      crowd thinning - the canopy opening onto the street beyond--

      D I G G S RIGHT ON THEIR TAIL - people screaming, parting as they
      see his weapon - the firing line clearing - he levels aim and--

                                     M E T R O PD OFFICER (O.S.)
                     M e t r o PD!      Drop it!

                                                                              87.



                                 DIGGS
                      I'm a bond agent!

                               M E T R O PD OFFICER
                      I said drop the fucking w e a p o n !

      D i g g s sees his quarry now escaping. With a scowl, he complies.
      He laces his fingers, tapping his earpiece in the process-

                                        D I G G S (INTO RADIO)
                      N o r t h b o u n d on Third. Get `em, Burdie -
                      and take off the fucking g l o v e s . . .

                                                                        C U T TO:
131   EXT . STREET - NIGHT

      T H E GREY CUTTER VEERS ROUND A CORNER - Burdon at the wheel - his
      quarry visible ahead - he jams the throttle - revs rising -

      LINCOLN AND ESTER SPRINT UP THE SIDEWALK - disorientation - the
      sudden diaspora o f lights and darkness - the sharp acoustics -

      T R A F F I C SWERVING - CLAXONS B L A R I N G - the cutter hurtling up the
      street, relentlessly - its halogen eyes, burning, growing -

      LINCOLN AND ESTER RACING FOR THE END OF THE BLOCK - towards a
      pedestrian bridge - trying to outpace the cutter -

      T H E GREY CUTTER CLOSING - Burdon punching a button - the side
      window slides open - he levels his thunderbolt, angling a shot-

      LINCOLN AND ESTER VEER LEFT - up onto the pedestrian bridge -
      rising above the traffic - claxons b l a r i n g beneath as --

      T H E GREY CUTTER PLOUGHS INTO THE INTERSECTION - banking into a u-
      t u r n - vehicles braking to avoid collision - LIGHTS, CLAXONS -

      LINCOLN AND ESTER - turmoil raging behind them - a glimpse of
      the cutter regaining pursuit - Lincoln sees an opening ahead--

132   EXT . ALLEY - NIGHT

      LINCOLN PULLS ESTER INTO THE SHADOWS - the sidewalk narrowing -
      they run onward, glancing off dumpsters - DULL BOOMS OF METAL -
      A FLOOD OF HALOGENS - the cutter banking sharply into the alley -
      pouring on the speed - the quarry trapped in its headlights--

      LINCOLN AND ESTER - nowhere to run - THE LIGHTS GROWING - THE
      RISING DRONE OF RESISTORS - Lincoln sees another opening --

                                                                        88.



133   EXT. PEDESTRIAN ALLEY - NIGHT

      LINCOLN PULLS ESTER INTO THE DARKNESS - a narrow access, barely
      lit, hard to see - a sudden dead-end - they SLAM INTO A BARRIER--

      A CHAINLINK F E N C E - the links shuddering - Lincoln looks up and
      sees it's scalable - claws into the links - STARTS CLIMBING-

      Ester TRYING TO CLIMB - rattled by coughing - fighting to
      breathe - her limbs shaking - her muscles failing - then--

      - B O O M - A BLINDING ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE - SUDDENLY THE FENCE IS
      ALIVE WITH ELECTRICITY - BURNING FINGERS JITTER ACROSS THE LINKS-

      LINCOLN AT THE TOP OF THE FENCE - jolted by the sudden shock -
      muscles in reflex - falling - landing the far side of the fence--

      Ester STILL CLIMBING - the jolt instantly toppling her back -
      landing the near side of the fence - more rattled than hurt --

      B U R D O N RUNNING TOWARDS THEM - thunderbolt smoking from the shot-
      LINCOLN ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE FENCE - recovering from the fall--

      Ester ON THE NEAR SIDE OF THE FENCE - cowering, coughing -

      B U R D O N JERKS HER UP BY THE HAIR - like a rapacious viking - he
      looks through the fence at Lincoln - sniffing her, almost bestial-

                               BURDON
                     G o ahead. I'll look after her.

      LINCOLN ' S EYES FLICKERING DARKLY - jaw clenching - the sense of
      danger urging him to run - but Ester is in the giant's grips -

      Ester CLAWING TO BREAK FREE - coughing, rasping - her fingers
      snag on the giant's arm-brace - TUGGING WITH ALL HER STRENGTH--

      B U R D O N YOWLING AT THE SUDDEN PAIN - lashing out - flinging Ester
      into the fence - dropping the thunderbolt - CLUTCHING HIS ARM--

      LINCOLN LEAPING ONTO THE FENCE - scrambling up the link - the
      dark giant momentarily off-guard - HE VAULTS OVER THE TOP --

      - T H U D - BURDON SPINS ROUND - takes the full brunt of Lincoln's
      impact - overbalancing - THEY CRASH TO THE GROUND -

      LINCOLN STRUGGLES UPRIGHT - winded, but forced to face the dark
      giant - who is already on his feet, his mighty fist SWINGING OUT-

      - T H U D - LINCOLN TAKES A PUNCH TO THE JAW - recoils, reciprocates
      throwing a left hook - hitting hard but the giant barely flinches-

                                                                      89.



      -THUD-THUD- BURDON POUNDS INTO HIM - a storm of punches - his
      quarry, ducking and blocking - now backed up against the fence--
      Ester RETRIEVING THE THUNDERBOLT - trying to work the mechanism -
      coughing - hands shaking - accidentally touching the trigger -

      - B O O M - THE SHOT BLASTS INTO THE AIR - enough of a distraction
      for Lincoln - he lands the giant with A BONE-JARRING LEFT HOOK-
      B U R D O N KEELS OVER INTO THE WALL - cracking the back of his head -
      his knees buckling - sliding down - just catching sight of--

      LINCOLN AND ESTER SCRAMBLING UP OVER THE FENCE - and then the
      quarry is lost from sight in A DOWNPOUR OF ELECTRICAL SPARKS.

134   EXT . BACKSTREET - NIGHT

      S I R E N S WAILING IN THE DISTANCE. Lincoln and Ester race down the
      sidewalk, along a construction hoarding. Ester slows, doubling
      over, rasping. Lincoln looks at her, her l i p s , blue, her face,
      pale. The sirens, getting louder. He sees a gap in the hoarding-

135   EXT . ENCANTO PARK - NIGHT

      Lincoln and Ester emerge through the gap onto a derelict tract.
      A once public park, now a construction site. Mounds and craters
      of earth. Dim shapes of huge vehicles, like sleeping dragons.
      Patches of parkland, as yet untouched. Bowed palms, dead grass,
      a stagnant lagoon, a dull mirror for the ascendant moon. On its
      shoreline is a dilapidated construct that was once a boathouse.

136   INT . BOATHOUSE - ENCANTO PARK - NIGHT

      The refuge of shadow. The collapsed   roof allowing streams and
      puddles of moonlight. Lincoln helps     Ester onto a rotted bench.
      She slumps down, exhausted, Lincoln     watches her, helplessly.
      She's fighting for breath, wheezing     and coughing in deep rasps.

                              ESTER
                     I can't... I can't breathe... my
                     throat... it's so... dry...

                                 LINCOLN
                     I ' l l find you some water.

      He looks around blindly. Some junk in the corner. He rummages,
      finds a rusted metal box. Pries it open, empties the contents.
      Gauzes, band-aids - evidently a first-aid box - then a bottle.
      He opens it, sniffs. It smells pungent. Alcohol, not water.
      Ester suddenly starts sobbing. Lincoln returns to her side-

                                 LINCOLN
                     I t ' s going to be okay, Ester.

                                                                90.



                            ESTER
               N o . . . no, it isn't...

                           LINCOLN
               I ' l l find you some water, okay?

Ester looks up at him, wheezing, tears streaming from her eyes-

                          ESTER
               An d then what, Lincoln?

                           LINCOLN
               I ' l l find another way. Out of state.

                          ESTER
               An d then what? What if they find us?

                           LINCOLN
               The n we'll keep going.

                        ESTER
               I can't... I can't run anymore...

Ester folds over, sobbing and coughing at the same time. Pitiful
to watch. Lincoln crouches, gaining her eyeline, very deliberate-

                            LINCOLN
               We ' l l keep going till we get there.

Ester traps a sob, reading his eyes, something reviving in her-

                          ESTER
               The Island... You mean, The Island?

Lincoln answers with a brief smile. If this will keep her going
then the truth is redundant. He eases her out of the moment-

                          LINCOLN
               N o w I'm going to get some water. But I
               want you to stay here. It'll be safer.

Ester wipes away her tears, sniffing. Her breaths, calming.

                            ESTER
               Don't go yet. Stay with me, Lincoln.
               Stay with me for a little while.

Lincoln looks puzzled by Ester's request. Even more puzzled as
she rests her head on his shoulder, nestling into his neck. He
feels her against him. The warmth spreading through him again.
His arm reaching, as if of its own accord, closing around her.
I t feels right somehow. And there he stays, holding her, looking
out across the dereliction. And the moon rises over Encanto P a r k .

                                                                      91.



137   EXT. METRO PD STATION - NIGHT

      The holoform l o g o of The Metro PD glows over the threshold.
      Diggs exits with a dark glower. The cutter is waiting kerbside.

138   INT . CUTTER - DRIVING - NIGHT

      Diggs climbs in an Burdon steers out into traffic. The thrill
      o f the chase is gone from them now. Both seem equally grim and
      determined. Diggs taps the holocom. A holoframe resolves, snows
      with static. Then Janeen's face appears, dishevelled, bitter-

                                 JANEEN (ON HOLOCOM)
                     What the fuck do you want now?

                                     DIGGS
                            (very calm, very cold)
                     Punch into the currency stream, close
                     the net on downtown and keep the search
                     active. The next time they use the card,
                     I want to be right on top of them...

      O f f his icy tone, Janeen nods without retort. Diggs hits a key
      and her face blinks out. And the cutter prowls into the night.

139   EXT . DOWNTOWN STREET - NIGHT

      The winged pig flutters over the doors of "Hog Heaven". Another
      franchise on a more downtrodden street. Lincoln emerges with a
      bag of food and drink. He considers the blue card. The reservoir,
      now close to the bottom, his resources almost exhausted. With a
      look of foreboding, he pockets the card and turns the corner.
      An d suddenly stops in his tracks. But it's not a vehicle that he
      sees. Or a predator. His eyes are fixed on a holoframe billboard:

      - - A football player in montage; pummeling into a defensive line;
      running for a touchdown; gyrating in the endzone; spinning in an
      NFL podium shot, super; "Nobody Stops The Juggernaut!"; a team
      logo, super; "Come See The Phoenix Admirals! Rulers of the AFC!"
      Lincoln recognizes the player's face but it's not possible. He
      waits for the loop to restart. There it is again. The face of
      Starkweather Two-Delta. Incredulous, he stops a pedestrian-

                                LINCOLN
                     The man, the man up there. Who is he?

                                 PEDESTRIAN
                     What planet `you been living on?
                     That's the Juggernaut, brother.

                                LINCOLN
                     The juggernaut...

                                                                          92.



                                     PEDESTRIAN
                     Jamil "The Juggernaut" Starkweather -
                     highest rushing total in the league.
                     `Least till that injury blew out his
                     gut. Now the doctors are saying he'll
                     be back on his feet next season. Those
                     fuckers sure can work miracles, huh?

      Lincoln doesn't respond. The pedestrian shrugs and heads on,
      writing him off. Lincoln lingers, staring up at the billboard.

140   INT . CIN BOOTH - NIGHT

      The flourish of music greets Lincoln as he enters. The cartoon
      rattlesnake appears and smiles his clownish, fanged smile:

                               THE SNAKE
                     Hi there! I'm Tattletail! What e v e r you
                     want to know, wherever you want to go, I
                     got the answers! Let's look at the menu!

      The set of text frames appears: "Residential Listings", "Business
      Listings", "Transport Listings", "Hotel Listings".

                                THE SNAKE
                     N o w let's make a selection!

      A heavy pause. Lincoln's voice comes with a slight tremor.

                              LINCOLN
                     Residential...

                                   THE SNAKE
                     Please give me the name.

                              LINCOLN
                     Starkweather...

                                  THE SNAKE
                     Okay! Let me find that listing for
                     you! I'll be with you in two shakes!

      The snake rattles and coils. Then a headshot a p p e a r s with the
      face of Jamil Starkweather , scaled across with a red line.

                                       THE SNAKE
                     Starkweather , Jamil... I'm sorry! This
                     listing is blocked from the directory!

      Lincoln stands, darkly intent on the face. Now irrefutably the
      same face he saw in his life below. The snake shakes its rattle-

                                                                           93.



                                THE SNAKE
                     You want me to find another listing?
      Lincoln looks at the snake, flicking its tongue, coiling.

                                                             F A D E TO BLACK.

141   EXT . DOWNTOWN STREET - MORNING

      A downtrodden neighborhood. The buildings look like remnants from
      our own era. A scruffy man slouches up to a gated storefront. He
      slots a key into a lock panel and the gate rolls up, squealing.
      We widen to a vehicle parked kerbside. A familiar grey cutter.

142   INT . STORE - MORNING

      L i g h t s flicker on to disclose a gunshop. The array of firearms
      a s fathomless as their purpose. The scruffy gunshop o w n e r slouches
      inside. Diggs and Burdon enter on his heels. He yawns at them-

                               G U N S H O P OWNER
                     We ain't open for another hour.

                                  DIGGS
                     Y e a h , well we ain't in the market.

                                       G U N S H O P OWNER
                     E v e r y o n e ' s in the market, pal. One end
                     of the barrel or the other...

                                  DIGGS
                     We ' r e chasing up a currency record from
                     last night. These two ring a bell?
      D i g g s displays two digital slides. The owner pauses, suspicious.

                                 G U N S H O P OWNER
                     What are you? Cops? Lawyers?
      D i g g s answers by jerking out the rainmaker. The twin barrels
      aimed at his head, the gunshop o w n e r loses his cool a little-

                                 G U N S H O P OWNER
                     H i m , I remember... Came in just before
                     closing... wanted a shooter but didn't
                     have no ID... settled for one of these.

      He displays a HUNTING KNIFE, unsheathing it, showing the blade.

                                DIGGS
                     Did he give you a name?

                                G U N S H O P OWNER
                     No.

                                                                    94.



                                DIGGS
                     Did he say where he was going?
                                 G U N S H O P OWNER
                     No.

      D i g g s cocks the hammer. The owner flinches. Then, off the knife-

                                  G U N S H O P OWNER
                     The r e was one thing. Kinda w e i r d .
                     He wanted to know how to use it...

143   EXT . APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

      An apartment building towers overhead, vaguely ominous. Lincoln
      approaches the entrance with Ester. We now see he has a band-aid
      covering his crosshatch. He takes Ester briefly aside, teasing
      some tresses over hers. As she gently smooths down her hair,
      Ester catches his eye. A look flickers between them. Then-

                                  D O O R M A N (O.S.)
                     Fancy dress, was it, sir?

      A DOORMAN is looking at them like they just rolled out of a club
      he wouldn't be seen dead in. Off their flustered looks, he gives
      an apologetic smile. Then opens the door and holds it for them.
      Lincoln reaches for Ester's hand. Then stiffly leads her inside.

144   INT . CORRIDOR - AN UPPER FLOOR - DAY

      The doors are set with small glowing orbs at peephole level. Like
      eyeballs, watching, as Lincoln and Ester proceed up the corridor.
      They stop at a door. Lincoln checks the number. Pauses heavily.
      Then looks for some type of doorbell. As his eyes cross the orb,
      it seems to blink. Then comes a sound of disengaging locks. Then
      the door swings open. Lincoln flinches, taken by surprise. Then
      frowns as he sees there is no one on the other side of the door.

145   INT . APARTMENT - DAY

      Lincoln enters, wary, scanning around. A living room. Framed
      pictures. A sofa, chairs. A coffee table, empty bottles,
      cigarette packs, a full ashtray. A bureau, some paperwork.
      Silence, stillness. No sign of life, no sense of danger. Lincoln
      moves across to the bureau and starts leafing through the
      papers. Ester ventures in through the door, curious-

                                 ESTER
                     What are you looking for?

                              LINCOLN
                     I don't know. Something. Just wait
                     there and make sure nobody's coming.

                                                                    95.



As he leafs the papers, Ester waits dutifully by the door. Her
eyes wander across the framed pictures. Then narrow onto a 3D
p h o t o g r a p h . A college boxing team photo, grinning cup winners.

                            ESTER
                L o o k at this...

Lincoln returns to her. Ester points to the photo. A face in the
row, blurred but eerily familiar. Lincoln seems not to react.
Ester, curiosity piqued, scans the other pictures. She alights
on a framed certificate - "Thomas R. Lincoln, Attorney-at-Law".

                            A MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                What the hell are you doing?

Lincoln turns to confront A MAN in a robe. Disheveled from sleep,
grey from a hangover... the man's face is unmistakably his own.
This is TOM LINCOLN, sponsor of Lincoln Six-Echo, his bleary
eyes now widening in disbelief as he recognizes his agnate-

                           TOM
                Oh, Jesus...

Lincoln is better prepared for this encounter but still stunned
by the sight of his double in the flesh. Sponsor and agnate stand
frozen. The only movement is Ester, her eyes flicking between
the same men, fraught, confused. Lincoln breaks the silence-

                           LINCOLN
                Who are you?

Lincoln steps closer, eyes piercing. Tom takes a step back.

                            TOM
                The y said... I'd never have to see you.

                           LINCOLN
                Who?
Lincoln takes another step closer. Tom takes another step back.

                           TOM
                The people...

                            LINCOLN
                What people?

Lincoln takes another step closer. Tom stiffens, gathers himself-

                             TOM
                Look, if you don't get out of here
                right now, I'm calling security...

                                                                  96.



Lincoln examines him, assimilating. His double seems to be as
belligerent as he is. Reasoning now, threat response kicking in.
Lincoln draws the hunting knife. Unused to it, he points it like
a gun. But it's enough of a threat for Tom, who swallows dryly-

                           TOM
                Why are you here? What do you want?

                         LINCOLN
                I want to know...

Tom grimaces at the ambiguity. That face. His f a c e . If not for
the pounding headache this would be a bad dream. He lowers onto
the sofa. Finds a cigarette and lights up. A drag, mind kicking
in. The knife cautioning him. With a slow exhale, he confesses-

                             TOM
                One of the partners at my firm... he
                told me about it. Gave me a referral.
                I thought he was joking at first. I
                went out there, took the sales tour.
                Even before that I knew it wasn't a
                joke. There was this discretion agree-
                ment. I never saw anything like it and
                I've seen a lot. Ironclad... breathe a
                word and they've got you by the balls.
                I don't know... There's cancer in my
                family. Maybe it was just to keep up.
                All the partners were on the policy.

                           LINCOLN
                The policy?

He looks at his agnate. Then realizes the level of ignorance.

                               TOM
                Christ, you have no idea, do you?

                             LINCOLN
                About what?

Tom drags his cigarette, fingers trembling. He shakes his head-

                         TOM
                I can't fucking do this...

                            LINCOLN
                What are you talking about?

Lincoln moves closer, pointing the knife. Tom flinches, then-

                                  TOM
                Insurance. You're an insurance policy.

                                                                   97.



                           LINCOLN
               What is that?

                             TOM
               Health insurance... medical...

                           LINCOLN
               What does that mean?

                         TOM
               If I get sick... if part of me gets
               sick... I take a healthy part from you.

                             LINCOLN
               Why?

                          TOM
               How do you expect me to answer that?
               It's just how it works, that's all.

Tom looks at his agnate. The insistent stare. The knife, pointing
at him like a finger. His fear yields to a flicker of anger-

                           TOM
               What do you want? A fucking apology?

                          LINCOLN
               Why do I look like you?

                              TOM
               Because you are me . . .

                        LINCOLN
               I don't understand.

                              TOM
               Because they made you from my cells...

                             LINCOLN
               Made me?

                             TOM
                      ( a flare of anger)
               That's right. You were made. Cooked up
               in a centrifuge like a fucking boiled
               egg. Every thought running through your
               head, every word coming out of your
               mouth, all of it, manufactured, made...

Lincoln frowns, trying to assimilate. Too much to process.

                             LINCOLN
               You . . . you're the one who made me?

                                                                98.



                         TOM
               No.

                          LINCOLN
               Who made me?

                        TOM
               I signed a contract. I can show you.

He gestures to a mirror on the wall. Lincoln steps back but his
eyes are unremitting. Tom rises, cautious, crossing to the wall.
He opens the mirror to reveal a wall safe. His trembling fingers
tap the keypad and the safe hisses open. He draws out a contract
folder embossed with a crosshatch. Then offers it to his agnate-

                           TOM
               It's all right there. Who, why...

Lincoln takes the contract folder and starts flipping the pages,
reading. A pendulous silence falls. Tom stands watching, smoking
nervously. Ester stands by the door, trying to take all this in.

                           TOM
               Look you've got what you wanted. Now
               why don't you just get out of here?

                                LINCOLN
                      (pause, looks at him)
               There are men out there, looking for
               us. I want you to make them stop.

                        TOM
               I can't...

Lincoln sets down the contract and brings up the knife again.

                          TOM
               I can't. Look, I'm a lawyer, I know how
               it works. The contract, everything, it's
               all laced with confidentiality clauses.
               It means they don't want this to get
               out. It means whatever I do, they're
               not going to stop. You understand?

Lincoln pauses, assimilating. His double's expression indicates
that he's telling the truth. Maybe try a more practical request-

                         LINCOLN
               Do you have transport?

                                 TOM
               Transport , yes... yes, parked
               downstairs... Bay 53... Take it...

                                                                      99.



                                LINCOLN
                     And then you'll call security?

      Lincoln steps closer, pointing the knife. Tom tries to stay dead-
      pan. The lawyer kicking in. Look them in the eye when you lie-

                                TOM
                     I'm not going to call security. I'm
                     not going to call anybody, okay?

      Lincoln looks at his double, reason now yielding to anger. Deep,
      roiling. Tom looks at his agnate, fear welling, deadpan cracking-

                                  TOM
                     Look, maybe there's something... maybe
                     there's a way to cancel the contract...

      Lincoln presses the tip of the blade to his double's cheek.

                                TOM
                     For Christ's sake! It's not my fault!

      Lincoln inches the blade deeper into the trembling face, drawing
      blood. The anger urging, hungry for more blood. Then suddenly-

                                     ESTER
                     Lincoln ! No!

      Lincoln looks at her, the anger interrupted, the knife still in
      place. He pauses. Then returns to his double. The dreading eyes,
      the trickle of blood down the face. His e y e s . His f a c e . A long,
      foreboding moment. Then suddenly Lincoln lashes out. His fist
      sends his double flying, falling in a flurry of contract pages.
      Lincoln stands over him, looking down, like a dominant species.
      His double is unmoving, unconscious. Lincoln abruptly spins away.

146   INT . ELEVATOR - DESCENDING

      The light panel flashes. Lincoln stands grimly, head lowered,
      trying to fathom the anger roiling within. Ester stares at him,
      wanly. Both held in the dark tableau. And the elevator descends.

147   INT . UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - DAY

      The vehicle parked in bay 53 is a hybrid of sportscar a n d speed-
      b o a t , a two-seater known as a "skiff". Lincoln and Ester climb
      in. Lincoln reviews the drive console, the controls, all of it,
      meaningless. His eyes cross an orb set in the steering wheel.

      The orb seems to blink and suddenly the drive console lights up.
      Lincoln reviews it. A screen in front of him is flashing:
      "PILOTING: MANUAL/AUTO?". He assimilates. Then ventures-

                                                                     100.



                                LINCOLN
                      Auto...

      The interface processes, then asks: "DESTINATION: NAME/ADDRESS?"

                                 LINCOLN
                      O u t of state... West...

      The interface processes, then reports "UNDOCKING". Lincoln and
      Ester jolt as the skiff shunts forward. Lode-poles pulsing ahead
      of them, the skiff moves out, as if pulled by a phantom tugboat.

148   EXT . STREET - DAY

      The skiff buckets off the ramp into a street inlet. Then stops
      rocking a little. The interface reports: "ESTABLISHING UPLINK".
      On another screen, a road map appears. A red dot plants at their
      point of origin then bleeds into a red line, plotting a course.

      The autopilot scans for traffic, then nudges forward on the
      throttle. The resistors drone, the steering wheel turns and the
      skiff noses onto the street. Finding its lane, it drops to
      cruise speed. Lincoln studies the interplay of steering wheel,
      throttle and brake. Then glances at Ester. She's plunged in
      thought, staring off. She turns to him with a haggard frown-

                                 ESTER
                      The man back there... who looked like
                      you... does it mean I have someone too?

      Lincoln looks at her blankly, unknowing. Ester stares off again,
      her brow knotting with unanswered questions. But Lincoln's gaze
      lingers. Her pale skin, her limpid eyes, her hair fluttering in
      the breeze. It's the first time he's really seen Ester's beauty.

149   EXT . PHOENIX SKYLINE - DAY

      The domes and spires glint in the sunlight. We isolate a glass
      steeple. A crosshatch insignia. A legend "Sanger Industries".

150   INT . CROWNE'S OFFICE - SANGER INDUSTRIES TOWER - DAY

      A corner office with a panoramic view of the city. Crowne sits
      at a console desk, reviewing some data on a holoframe screen. A
      knock on the door and HER SECRETARY enters, looking unsettled-

                               SECRETARY
                      I just thought I should warn you. I
                      have a sponsor holding. His name's
                      Thomas Lincoln. He sounded... angry.

                                                                      101.



151   EXT. STREET TUNNEL - DAY

      The skiff plunges into the shadow of an underpass. The interface
      flashes: "UPLINK INTERRUPT... AUTOPILOT DISENGAGING". Lincoln
      sits up, confused. The skiff is now slowing, drifting as if cut
      loose. He studies the controls again. Positions one hand on the
      steering wheel, the other on the throttle. Then he nudges it.

      The skiff lurches, veering out of its lane. Another vehicle zips
      narrowly past, rocking them with its invisible backwash. Ester
      looks at Lincoln, suddenly alarmed. Lincoln tries again, firm on
      the wheel, gentle on the throttle. And the skiff eases forward.

152   EXT . MOTEL - DOWNTOWN PHOENIX - LATE AFTERNOON
      D i s m a l . The kind of place that precedes a life on the street. We
      push in on a window, cracked glass, the drapes closed within.

153   INT . MOTEL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

      G l o o m y , musty. A "holovision" plays some type of NFL recap. But
      Scheer is not watching it. He is lying on the bed, staring at
      the ceiling, motionless. Off a beeping sound, he stirs. He taps
      a holocom on the nightstand. A holoframe appears, resolving:

                                  Merrick (ON HOLOCOM)
                     K a r l , there's been a complication.

154   EXT . INTERSTATE - SUNSET

      The sunset melts gold across the horizon as the skiff cruises
      westward. Eight lanes of lodeway rake through the salt flats.
      Lincoln is driving more confidently now. Ester is huddled asleep
      beside him. Suddenly the skiff starts to slow again. Lincoln
      reviews the controls. Throttle, forward, foot, off the brake.
      The interface flashes: "REMOTE LOCKDOWN E N G A G I N G " . The skiff is
      steering itself onto the hard shoulder. It now pulls to a dead
      halt. Ester is woken by the sudden inertia. She opens her eyes
      and looks around. They've stopped in the middle of nowhere.

155   EXT . THE SALT FLATS - SUNSET

      The sun sinks in a slow pink haze. Lincoln and Ester walk across
      the salt flats. Visible in the distance is a walled settlement.

156   EXT . THE HERITAGE PARK - SUNSET

      An adobe wall culminates at an arched wooden gateway. Lincoln
      and Ester approach. They haven't walked far but Ester is already
      short of breath. As they near the gateway a holoserve appears,
      like a sentry - Native American, buckskins, feathered headdress
      and facepaint. His voice seems as old as the wind-

                                                                     102.



                                    THE INDIAN HOLOGRAM
                     Welcome to Salt River Heritage Park,
                     home to the Hohokam Nation for over two
                     thousand years. The park is now closed.
                     Please come back during opening hours,
                     9am t o 5pm, Monday through Saturday...

      Ester steps closer. With the sun hazing through, the holoserve
      s e e m s angelic or ghostly. She's examining his striped facepaint-

                               ESTER
                     He has marks on his face like us.

      She turns to Lincoln with a flowering smile. Then rushes up to
      the gateway, suddenly galvanized, squeezing through a gap.

157   EXT . THE HERITAGE PARK - SUNSET

      A ring of Native American pueblos. Pithouses a n d coursed adobes,
      recreations and preserved ruins. Ester rushes around the ring,
      looking into the pueblos as if expecting to find them inhabited.
      She ducks into one of the pithouses. Lincoln follows her inside.

158   INT . PITHOUSE - SUNSET

      The mud walls show a skeleton of saguaro ribs, cholla branches.
      It's cosy in here, dim. The living area, recreated with mats and
      pottery. Lincoln finds Ester looking around, between excitement
      and confusion. She turns to him, her voice wavering, wheezing-

                               ESTER
                     Is this... is this place The Island?
      Lincoln answers with a softly negating look. Ester's face slowly
      falls, the energy draining from her eyes. She lowers onto one of
      the mats and lies down, huddling. She looks up to him, wheezing-

                                ESTER
                     I'm tired. Let me rest for a while.

159   EXT . PITHOUSE - NIGHT

      Silence prevails but for the faint rattle of Ester's breathing.
      Lincoln sits on low stool, in sentinel over her as she sleeps.
      In his eyes, we see the weight of foreboding. He doesn't know
      what they'll do when she wakes. Of a moaning sound he looks at
      Ester. Then realizes it isn't coming from her. The sound is far
      off, a rhythmic moaning. Now discernible as the chant of voices.

160   EXT . THE PLATFORM MOUND - NIGHT
      A blazing fire. Figures in silhouette, moving around, chanting.

                                                                     103.



      The platform mound is situated just beyond the heritage park. An
      ancient ceremonial site, stepped in ruins, dusted with caliche.
      Pima and Maricopa, descendants of the Hohokam, are congregated
      for a solstice ceremony. Off to the side, a group of horses are
      tethered, shuffling, snorting. Lincoln approaches, cautiously,
      but somehow like a moth to the flame. He stops at a distance,
      watching. The curiosity of congruent sound and movement.

                                VOICE (O.S.)
                     You look a little lost, my friend.

      Lincoln turns to a figure emerging from the night. A tall man -
      swarthy skin, mist-colored eyes. His tribal name is GREY DOVE-

                               GREY DOVE (cont'd)
                     Or did you come here for a reason?

      Lincoln examines the tall man. The face seems as deep and gentle
      as the voice. His sense of danger, unstirring, he concedes-

                              LINCOLN
                     I was looking for water.

                                GREY DOVE
                     Not the best place to look.

                               LINCOLN
                     My transport... it stopped working.

                              GREY DOVE
                     I see. And where were you going?

                                LINCOLN
                     Out of state...

      Lincoln sighs, the destination seeming very far away. Grey Dove
      considers him. This bruised, weary outsider is somehow childlike.

161   EXT . THE CEREMONY - LATER

      The fire blazes across the face of a shaman. Old, gnarled, and
      dry as the salt flats. With a sacred mutter, he slips a peyote
      button onto his tongue. Then flings back his head, casting his
      eyes to the stars. When he lowers his head again, we see his
      pupils dilating. He rises, chanting, moving in ceremonial steps
      around the fire. Tribespeople s i t in a ring, joining the chant.

      Beyond the ring, others are dining at a roasting pit. Roast
      rabbit. Cornflour bread. The food is as it might been two
      thousand years ago. Only the sight of plastic water gallons
      breaks the illusion. Lincoln stands apart with Grey Dove, eating
      ravenously, gulping from a water gallon. He looks around-

                                                                     104.



                                 LINCOLN
                     What is this place?

                               GREY DOVE
                     It is a sacred place. My people come
                     here to commune with their spirits.

      Lincoln looks at him, puzzled. Grey Dove smiles tolerantly.

                                     GREY DOVE
                     Not easy to understand perhaps. For us,
                     the spirit is like the shadow on the
                     rock. Sometimes close, sometimes far
                     away, sometimes the sky clouds and the
                     shadow fades. We come here to ask our
                     spirits to return to us. The man...
                           (gestures to the shaman)
                     He speaks to The Grandfather from whom
                     all spirits are born. The Great Spirit
                     who binds every living thing. He has no
                     name. But he is everywhere. In the sun
                     and the moon, the wind and the rain...

      The shaman's chanting grows louder, more insistent. His circuit
      around the fire becoming faster, building in religious fervor.

                                GREY DOVE
                     Now he asks for the gift of vision that
                     he may see through to the spirit shape
                     of things. To find the spirits of the
                     lost. To bring them into the light...

      The shaman's chanting suddenly stops. He is looking directly at
      Lincoln, pointing. His face, contorting with what might be anger
      or fear. He starts babbling in dialect, ardently. Lincoln frowns
      in confusion. Grey Dove quietly draws him away from the mound.

162   INT . PITHOUSE - NIGHT - LATER

      Ester stirs from slumber. On the ground beside her, she finds a
      bowl of food and a water gallon. Now through the gloom, she sees
      Lincoln, sitting on the stool like he never left, keeping vigil.
      Something seems different about him as he turns, registering her-

                                LINCOLN
                     A r e you alright?

                              ESTER
                     I feel better after I sleep.

      Lincoln nods absently and stares off out of the doorway. Ester
      moves closer, sensing something. He speaks as if from far away-

                                                                      105.



                                LINCOLN
                     The man out there... he said
                     everything has a spirit... every
                     living thing... but not...

      His voice cuts off. Ester looks at him, recognizing his pain.
      She doesn't understand what it is or what caused it. It's pain
      and it evokes a response in her. A feeling, taking her over. Her
      hand reaches out and strokes his hair. Lincoln looks up at her,
      questioning. With supreme knowing, Ester leans down and kisses
      him. At the touch of her lips, Lincoln pauses. The first kiss
      for both of them but Ester takes it in her stride. The calm
      ballet of nature. Fluidly peeling off her shirt, breasts
      steeping with moonlight. Lincoln rising to face her, feeling her
      proximity, her radiant heat. His fingers touching her breasts.
      Ester trembling, her lips once more finding his. Lincoln closing
      his eyes, the rush of sensation, overwhelming. He yields to it,
      returning the kiss, with hunger, with passion... with spirit.

163   EXT . THE INTERSTATE - DAWN

      The sun rises in the east, depicting the traffic in silhouette.
      A vehicle arcs from the fast lane onto the hard shoulder where
      the skiff sits abandoned. The grey cutter pulls to a halt.

164   EXT . HARD SHOULDER - DAWN

      D i g g s and Burdon move up on the skiff, cover positions, weapons
      levelled. Burdon spins in to the driver side, snapping aim with
      the thunderbolt. But the skiff is empty. The only sign of life
      is the interface, flashing red: "REMOTE LOCATOR TRANSMITTING".

      B u r d o n exchanges a look with Diggs. No dice. Diggs reaches in his
      pocket and pulls out what looks like an electronic telescope. He
      puts it to his eye and pans the salt flats. Burdon crouches at
      the roadside, looking for tracks. Then Diggs fixes on something-

                              DIGGS
                     I got thermals.

165   EXT . PLATFORM MOUND - SUNRISE

      The fire is now reduced to a heap of embers. The tribespeople
      a r e asleep around the mound, wrapped in ethnic blankets. Diggs
      and Burdon move up stealthily, weapons at the ready. The horses
      bristle and snort, betraying their approach. The tribespeople,
      stirred by the noise, awake. Diggs and Burdon swing aim around
      the ring as faces rise and stare at them. None of the faces have
      white skin. Diggs lowers his weapon and addresses the gathering-

                                DIGGS
                     I'm looking for two bond runners. They
                     ditched near here last night.

                                                                        106.



                                          DIGGS (cont'd)
                      One man, one woman. Tattoos on the
                      forehead...
                              (nothing, just silent stares)
                      Anyone's seen them, I got fifty green.
                              (still nothing, aggravated)
                      What the fuck are you? Deaf and dumb?

      The tribal faces just keep staring. Diggs scowls. Then suddenly
      swings aim with the rainmaker and fires. -BOOM- hitting one of
      the horses in the haunch. It rears up, whinnying, setting off
      the rest of the horses. Diggs turns back to the gathering-

                                     DIGGS
                     Somebody start talking.

      He scans around the ring. Then fixes on one of the women. She
      lifts a trembling finger to a man nearby. Grey Dove stiffens.

166   EXT . SALT MOUNTAINS - SUNRISE

      The sunrise depicts two silhouettes, moving across the ridge.
      Lincoln and Ester clamber over the calcified rocks. Ester now
      stops to catch her breath. She is wheezing again, fighting for
      air. As Lincoln looks on with concern, she musters a brave smile-

                              ESTER
                     I can make it.

167   EXT . SALT CANYON - EARLY MORNING

      A freight barge whooshes through the canyon, trailing a chain of
      low, arched containers, capacious in width rather than height.
      The conveyance is similar to a lodeway but wider, deeper, known
      as a "lode-canal". At each end of the canyon, it intersects with
      other lode-canals, converging to use the same passage, a system
      of signals and lockgates controlling the flow of freight traffic.
      High above, on the south rim of the canyon, we find Lincoln and
      Ester. Ester is no longer wheezing but rasping. She looks down at
      the passing vessel, daunted. Lincoln offers her small comfort-

                                  LINCOLN
                     Don't worry. The one we want goes the
                     other way. He said it goes slower.

      They exchange a smile. The chain of containers tailing off, the
      barge leaving the canyon with a blast of its resonant claxon.

168   EXT . THE SOUTH FACE - MORNING

      Lincoln and Ester descend the rocky slope toward the lode-canal.
      Ester stops, having to catch her breath every few steps. Lincoln
      tries to hide his concern, looking away towards the sunrise. The
      westbound vessel will be coming soon.

                                                                        107.



      They just need to get out of state... Now he frowns, sensing
      something. Faint but growing. His jaw clenches. His face
      tightens. His pupils start to dilate.

169   EXT . THE NORTH RIDGE - MORNING

      The north ridge is evidently threaded by a lodeway as we see the
      grey cutter pulling up. Diggs and Burdon get out and look down
      into the canyon. Diggs pulls out his scope and starts panning.
      Burdon peels off his jacket. It's early but it's already getting
      hot. Diggs now pauses, handing him the scope for his opinion-

                                DIGGS
                      Up there in the rocks. Three o'clock.
                      I'm not sure... it could be ambient.

170   EXT . THE SOUTH FACE - MORNING

      Lincoln and Ester hide in the shadow of a rock. Ester is muffling
      her breaths as best she can. Lincoln now hazards a look over the
      top. Two figures are climbing down the far side of the canyon,
      now pointing in their direction. He ducks back, assimilating.
      Hiding, no longer an option. Nor running, at least for Ester.
      His face sets in a grimace of conviction. His eyes glow darkly.

171   EXT . THE NORTH FACE - MORNING

      Diggs and Burdon reach the foot of the rocks. Neither speaks,
      communicating in hand-signals. Diggs slips into the lode-canal.
      Burdon covers, sweeping the thunderbolt across the south face.

      Diggs emerges from the far side of the lode-canal. He stays low,
      moving up into the rocks. Then, from above, a rock dislodges,
      rattling down. Diggs reacts instantly, targeting, opening fire-

      - B O O M - B O O M - The shots from the rainmaker swathe across the rock.
      The thunderbolt now adding to the barrage, Burdon firing from
      the far side - SHOTS, BOLTS, KICKING UP A STORM OF DUST --
      SUDDENLY HOLDING FIRE, waiting for the dust to clear, reloading.
      No sign of movement. Just a slide of rubble. Fading echoes.

      D I G G S STEALS ONWARDS UP THE ROCKS - into the fog of dust - the
      sunlight and shadow playing tricks on his eyes - then suddenly-
      LINCOLN BURSTS OUT OF THE DUST - from the left - tackling the
      pale man - both of them toppling - tumbling down the slope --

      THUDDING TO A HALT at the lip of the lode-canal - the rainmaker
      lost in the fall - the impact throwing up a billow of dust --
      THE DUSTCLOUD - Diggs and Lincoln struggling, clawing, punching -
      Lincoln, with surprise on his side, gaining with the upper hand--

                                                               108.



DIGGS' CLAWING FINGERS discover Lincoln's knife - tugging it from
his jacket - Lincoln grabbing his wrist, fighting for control -
THE KNIFE MOVING BETWEEN THEM - Diggs with better leverage - the
blade inching towards Lincoln's face - pressing into his cheek--

LINCOLN'S EYES - welling black, almost inhuman - the sense of
danger screaming in his ears - he grabs the pale man's throat -
DIGGS' EYES - bulging as he strains to push the knife home -
oxygen draining - conscious ebbing - he slumps back -

LINCOLN REGAINS THE KNIFE - the pale man seems to be out cold -
but he's not sure - he pauses holding the blade over him, then--
- B O O M - THE KNIFE FLIES FROM HIS GRIP IN A BURST OF DISCHARGE -

BURDON SNAPS AIM FOR ANOTHER SHOT - beading - his target moving
now - dropping out of the firing line - into the lode-canal--

BURDON INCHES TOWARD THE EDGE - thunderbolt angling downward -
into the trench - then suddenly he's GRABBED BY THE ANKLES -

LINCOLN STRAINING to overbalance the giant - feet up against the
wall - like trying to topple a tree - finally winning some give-

BURDON TOPPLES INTO THE TRENCH - his ankles clamped by his
quarry - both men meeting the concrete with a bone-shaking-

- THUD - LINCOLN IS CRUSHED BENEATH THE MASSIVE WEIGHT - the giant
already recovering from the fall - now dragging him upright--

- THUD - BURDON THROWS A PUNCH - mightily - hurling his quarry
across the trench - moving in quickly, following up with a kick--

- THUD - LINCOLN CRUMPLES as the boot smacks into him - then
another kick - then another - the world starts blurring --

BURDON TURNS AWAY - his quarry disabled for now - he recovers
his thunderbolt - turns back to administer the coup de grace--

LINCOLN LOOKS UP - the giant looming - the muzzle of his weapon
thrumming with energy - the rivets on his denims start rattling--

BURDON SPINS ROUND - the thunderbolt suddenly ripped from his
grasp - there, in the distance - AN EASTBOUND BARGE IS COMING -

LINCOLN SCRAMBLES UP THE WALL OF THE TRENCH - muscles straining,
feet slipping on the concrete - escaping the imminent vessel --

                                                               109.



DIGGS COMING TO - now seeing his quarry a short distance away -
emerging from the lode-canal - he looks around for a weapon, then-

                             BURDON (O.S.)
               Diggs! Get me outta here!

BURDON STRUGGLING TO CLIMB OUT OF THE TRENCH - with one arm,
it's almost impossible - fighting against his own weight--
DIGGS REACHING THE EDGE - seeing the eastbound barge coming -
grabbing his partner's outreached hand - pulling him upward -

BURDON'S PANIC - his other arm flinging away - HIS METAL BRACE
SNARED BY THE LODE-STREAM - the force shuddering his entire body-
DIGGS PULLING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT - feet slipping - locked in a
tug of war with the lodestream - THE BARGE IS CLOSING FAST--

BURDON'S HORROR - now suspended between the two forces - feet
kicking - THE BARGE IS ALMOST UPON HIM - he screams agonized--

                           BURDON
               Help me! HELP MEEEEE!

THE SCREAM IS INSTANTLY LOST in the whoosh of the barge. Diggs,
stunned, just looks at his hands, empty, spattered with blood.

                        DIGGS
               Burdie...?

THE SHADOW OF THE ROCK - Lincoln rejoins Ester - casting a look
back - the eastbound barge now plummeting into the distance--
D I G G S STOOPING AT THE EDGE OF THE TRENCH - looking down - all
that remains of his partner is a smear of blood at the concrete--

LINCOLN AND ESTER REACHING THE FOOT OF THE ROCKS - seeing THE
WESTBOUND BARGE against the sunrise - snaking into the passage--
DIGGS PULLING UPRIGHT - spotting his quarry - fire in his eyes -
drawing out a boot-knife - slipping it between his teeth--

THE WESTBOUND BARGE pulling through the canyon - lode-poles
pulsing ahead of it - polarity thrumming in opposing flow--
LINCOLN AND ESTER start running as the barge comes towards them -
Lincoln pulling Ester along - struggling to match the pace--

A SOUND LIKE A BEATING TYMPANY COMING TOWARDS THEM - they look
round to see - A SHADOW RUNNING ALONG THE TOP OF THE BARGE--
D I G G S FLINGING HIMSELF OFF THE BARGE - the blade in his teeth -
arms spread - for an instant, like a vulture against the sun--

                                                                110.



LINCOLN IS SUDDENLY CRUSHED by the weight of his landing - ESTER
IS HURLED SIDEWAYS - into a ditch - lost in a cloud of dust--
D I G G S PULLING HIMSELF UP, astride of Lincoln - snatching the
knife from his clenched teeth - the sound, like a whetstone--

LINCOLN SPITTING DIRT - suddenly grabbed by the scalp and tugged
sideways - twisted partways o n t o his back, forced to look up at--
A BLACK SPOT AGAINST THE SUN - Diggs' face set in a murderous
sneer - he wants to see this fucker's e y e s - the torment--

LINCOLN DAZZLED BY THE SUNLIGHT - but suddenly knowing the face
of death - now catching the brief glint of the knife as --
D I G G S PLUNGES THE BLADE DOWN - slicing into his quarry's hand as
he throws it up in defense - his quarry YOWLING WITH PAIN--

LINCOLN FEELING THE STAB - his deepest instinct suddenly awoken -
every impulse, every fiber brought into alignment - survival--
D I G G S IS HURLED INTO THE AIR as Lincoln surges upward - he
tumbles backward into the dust - losing hold of the boot-knife--

LINCOLN PUSHES HIMSELF UPRIGHT - only makes it half-way -
scrambling towards the pale man - all fours, like an animal--
D I G G S CLAWING AROUND IN THE DUST - fingers finding metal - the
boot-knife - he brings it up - slashing at his imminent quarry--

LINCOLN RECOILING - the blade nicking his face - sudden rage -
grabbing the pale man by the arm - swinging him round into--
- B O O M - THE MOVING WALL OF FREIGHT CONTAINERS - as the westbound
barge passes - Diggs bounces off - stumbling to keep balance--

LINCOLN ON THE RETREAT - the pale man coming at him with the
knife - another nick - seeing a gap now, shoving him backwards--
- B O O M - THE MOVING WALL RESOUNDS - Diggs howls - snagged by a
bolt - hurt, his fury becomes incandescent - he strikes madly--

LINCOLN STUMBLING BACK - the pale man coming at him - the blade
flashing to and fro - frenzied - like a threshing machine--
F O R C I N G HIM UP AGAINST THE ROCKS - the knife almost upon him -
he grits his teeth and lunges forward - charging like a bull --

DIGGS CAREENS BACKWARD, still swiping the blade - digging into
his quarry - headlong towards the moving wall - hitting with--
- W H U M P - no resonant boom - no bouncing back - Diggs has hit a
gap between the containers and HIS HEAD HAS BEEN LOPPED OFF -

                                                                       111.



      LINCOLN STANDS HORRIFIED - as the headless body is spun by the
      moving wall - dropping into the trench as the barge tails off-
      The westbound barge gains speed, leaving the canyon. But there
      is Ester, running after it, vainly, coughing and sputtering.

                                   LINCOLN
                     Ester! Stop! It's no use!

                               ESTER
                     We have to... get to... The Island...

                                 LINCOLN
                     It's going too fast!

                               ESTER
                     We have to... get to...

      Ester staggers a few more steps, then collapses to her knees,
      rasping for breath. As Lincoln reaches her, she slumps back into
      his arms. Her head lolling, eyes rolled back to white, a drool
      of blood spilling from her lips. Then the blast of a claxon c u t s
      the air as the westbound barge disappears into the distance.

                                                          F A D E TO BLACK.

172   EXT . SEDONA - LATE AFTERNOON

      A ranch home in the middle of nowhere. Long shadows.

173   INT . STUDIO - RANCH HOME - LATE AFTERNOON

      Late golden sunlight through a mist of sawdust. Abstract wood
      sculptures are visible. Juniper wood, carved along the bias of
      the grain, polished to accentuate the curves of natural growth.
      AN OLDER WOMAN runs a sander over a work in progress - 60's, in
      coveralls, gray her tied back, her face shielded by goggles and
      a bandana. She pauses to review her work, shutting down the
      sander, slipping off her goggles and bandana. Her face is eerily
      familiar. Her name is KATHERINE. She now moves to the window,
      catching sight of something outside. Curiously, she watches a
      vehicle coming down the long driveway. A dusty, grey cutter.

174   EXT . FRONT PORCH - RANCH HOME - LATE AFTERNOON

      Katherine opens the front door. The cutter is now docked in the
      port and a stranger is staggering towards her. In his arms, is
      an unconscious woman. Now Katherine can see the face - younger,
      but unmistakable even so. Her voice comes in a chilled whisper-

                                KATHERINE
                     O h , God... Oh, my God...

                                                                      112.



175   EXT. PHOENIX - LATE AFTERNOON

      A whisper cuts across the glistening skyline towards The Sanger
      Industries Tower. It circles in to land on a rooftop helipad.

176   INT . CROWNE'S OFFICE - SANGER INDUSTRIES TOWER

      Silence . Crowne sits at her desk. Merrick sits across from her.
      Waiting. The air stirs as the secretary ushers Dr. Sanger into
      the office. No greetings are exchanged. Sanger just lowers into
      a chair, a little unsettled to find Merrick has preceded him.

                              CROWNE
                     I take it you've heard the news.

                                DR. SANGER
                     The bond agents. Yes. Unfortunate.

                                      CROWNE
                     Unfortunate?
                            (pauses, lights a cigarette)
                     We're way past unfortunate, Henry.

                              DR. SANGER
                     I thought we'd covered ourselves.

                                CROWNE
                     The police won't connect the bond
                     agents to us. But that's not the
                     problem. It's the sponsor.

                                 DR. SANGER
                     What are you talking about?

                                MERRICK
                     The male agnate tracked him down.

                                  CROWNE
                     His name's Thomas Lincoln. It seems
                     they had a genetic reunion. Not a
                     h a p p y one. It was all I could do to
                     stop him going to the authorities.

                              DR. SANGER
                     I still don't see the problem.

                               CROWNE
                     He may not want a police involvement
                     but he's already threatened to file
                     suit. And he's one of the biggest
                     litigation attorneys in the city.

                                                              113.



                            DR. SANGER
              That's why we have you, Ellen.

                            CROWNE
              That's why I asked Bernard to come out
              here. To find out how it happened.

                       MERRICK
              I told her, Henry. About synesthesia.

S a n g e r casts a betrayed look at Merrick. Then returns to Crowne-

                        DR. SANGER
              I t was a marginal problem. And it was
              under control - according to Bernard.

                            CROWNE
              That's not the point. Whether or not
              it's a factor in this instance, it
              puts us in breach of the clone laws.

                        DR. SANGER
              I t doesn't even touch their genetics.

                           CROWNE
              I'm talking about self-awareness. The
              virtual humanity statutes require us
              t o give them consciousness to the
              l e v e l of functionality. But not beyond.

This gives Sanger pause. Crowne drags her cigarette acutely.

                              CROWNE
              L e g a l l y , we are naked on every level.
              Federal legislature, state licensing,
              sponsorship contract... But even if we
              did manage to weather the legal storm,
              we'd never survive the public scrutiny.

S a n g e r absorbs this, calmly shaking a pill from his pill bottle.

                          DR. SANGER
              I've spent my entire career facing down
              naysayers, Ellen. Don't think for a
              second I'm afraid of facing them now.

                         CROWNE
              You remember cryogenics? At the outset,
              people dismissed it as a rich man's
              folly. Eccentric millionaires freezing
              their brains, hoping to wake up in a new
              body.

                                                                114.



                                 CROWNE (cont'd)
               E v e n when cloning showed signs of
               m a k i n g it feasible, it wasn't moral
               a f f r o n t that caused the backlash. It
               w a s the scope. The scope, Henry. When
               t h e size of the customer base was
               e x p o s e d , it screamed inequality - one
               m e d i c i n e for the rich and one for the
               p o o r . The pressure for accessible cryo-
               genics a s good as buried the industry.
                       ( a pause for emphasis)
               O u r graves are being dug as we speak,
               g e n t l e m e n . Every passing second, they
               g e t deeper. If we're going to survive,
               w e have to act swiftly and decisively.

                               DR. SANGER
               A l r i g h t . What do you suggest?

S a n g e r dry swallows the pill. Ellen opens a contract folder.

                          CROWNE
               O u r security chief - I've been looking
               at his file. Ex-marine, served in South
               China - do we think he still has it in
               him?

                               DR. SANGER
                     ( r e a l i z i n g , suddenly harsh)
               A r e you insane?

The i r eyes deadlock. Crowne gives Merrick a sideways glance.

                           CROWNE
               ` You ever wondered why Henry takes
               those pills, Bernard? Why he doesn't
               avail himself of his own technology?

                         DR. SANGER
               An agnate could give me a new heart
               but to get it to function mentally...

                                CROWNE
               B u l l s h i t , Henry. Bullshit. You don't
               want to deal with reality. Only with
               concept. I may not have been there at
               the start but I heard the stories. You
               wanted in on every aspect of
               construction, from environmental
               design right down to the classical
               playlists. I t wasn't enough just to
               make it work, was it? No, you wanted
               your own little utopia.

                                                                       115.



                                    CROWNE (cont'd)
                     Swanning a r o u n d in your mountain
                     r e t r e a t like some self-appointed
                     d e i t y . But when it comes to getting

      S a n g e r crosses to the window, looking down onto the city.

                                DR. SANGER
                     You see that street down there...?
                     Running east from the stadium. My
                     father used to take me to church on
                     that street. An old Spanish church.

                                   CROWNE
                     What's your point?

                              DR. SANGER
                     I didn't know they'd torn it down.

177   INT . GUEST BEDROOM - KATHERINE'S HOUSE - EVENING

      A floral bedroom. Ester lies in bed, wheezing, semi-conscious.
      Katherine slips a pill between her lips and tips in some water.
      Lincoln stands watching. Katherine ushers him out of the room.

178   INT . KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

      The kitchen is arrayed with modern technology but softened with
      paintings and craftwork. A r t marginally overwhelming science.
      Katherine starts making some herb tea in the traditional manner.

                                 LINCOLN
                     What did you give her?

                                 KATHERINE
                     J u s t something to help her sleep. I
                     think she has a bronchial infection.
                     But I'm not sure I should give her an
                     antibiotic in case it effects the baby.

                               LINCOLN
                     S o you know about the baby...

      Katherine pauses, reality sinking its claws. She looks at him-

                                                                 116.



                            KATHERINE
               Is n ' t that why you came here?

                        LINCOLN
               I found your name in the listings. I
               wasn't sure. You don't look like her.

                           KATHERINE
               The y have a plan... For women like me.

                         LINCOLN
               S o you're the one who takes her baby.

Katherine winces at him. It's uttered so matter-of-factly. She
pauses, hanging her head, searching within herself.

                          KATHERINE
               You know when you're young? How you
               run around thinking you're immortal?

Lincoln ' s look says he has no idea. She seems not to notice.

                            KATHERINE
               The r e was a lodeway accident. I was...
               damaged. After that, I thought no man
               would ever want me. I was wrong. His
               name was John. He said he married me
               for my eyes. Ocean eyes, he called
               them. He always loved the ocean. Up
               there on the wall, that's John's boat.

O f f her gesture, Lincoln glances at the wall. A watercolor of a
yacht. Meaningless to him but Katherine gazes it at, fondly-

                            KATHERINE
               But I think there was always an unspoken
               regret between us. When we heard about
               the technology, it was like... forgive-
               n e s s , like a second chance. A child of
               our own, part of both of us. Sailing
               trips, fishing trips, so many plans...
                      ( a flat beat)
               J o h n got cancer a year ago. He died.

He r eyes mist, distant and bittersweet, talking to herself now.

                              KATHERINE
               I r o n i c . That the same technology could
               have saved his life. And now the baby
               is the only part of him I have left.
               And the boat. I still have the boat.

Lincoln looks discomfited. There's more to this than he thought.

                                                                     117.



179   INT. MOTEL ROOM - EVENING

      S c h e e r opens the door. Merrick stands at the threshold with an
      attache case. Scheer, seemingly unsurprised, brings him inside.

                              SCHEER
                     I told you we shouldn't have gone to
                     outside personnel. They were cowboys.

                               MERRICK
                     We had no choice, Karl. We had to keep
                     this away from The Institute.

                                  SCHEER
                     An d now?

      Merrick lowers in a chair, grim and leaden. He opens his attache
      and pulls out a contract folder. He hands it to Scheer.

                                   SCHEER
                     What's this?

                                 MERRICK
                     Your resignation papers. Maybe `early
                     retirement' would be more accurate...

      S c h e e r leans forward, frowning, curious.

                                MERRICK
                     T e n platinum bounty - if you sign the
                     papers, their loss becomes your gain.

                              SCHEER
                     A parachute... So there's a jump?

                                MERRICK
                     You understand that whatever happens,
                     The Institute must be able to deny it.

      S c h e e r says nothing. Merrick reaches in the attache and pulls out
      a case. Inside are a row of ampules and a pressure syringe-gun.

                               MERRICK
                     We use a chemical to dispose of waste
                     product. It's called di-halcyonate. I t
                     reacts on a molecular level to start a
                     process of internal combustion. The
                     subject is incinerated from the inside
                     out. In post-mortem application it's
                     done its job before rigor mortis. In a
                     live subject, well... you can imagine.

                                                                     118.



                                SCHEER
                     You want to dispose of your products.

                                 MERRICK
                     I t ' s a little more complicated than
                     that. We have to be very... thorough.
                     If you still have it in you, that is.

      S c h e e r gives him a sideways look. Then displays the USMC ring.

                                SCHEER
                     Why do you think I still wear this?

                              MERRICK
                     I don't know.

                               SCHEER
                     I was discharged from the marines for
                     insubordination. If you asked anyone
                     i n my unit, they'd call it heroism. I
                     disobeyed an order to fall back. I took
                     out a bunker complex single-handed.

                               MERRICK
                     S o you wear it is a badge of honor?

                                SCHEER
                     N o . It wasn't bravery. I wasn't afraid
                     of dying. I just didn't care. You see,
                     I suddenly realized I was just a sack
                     of flesh with a heartbeat. Life, death,
                     I just couldn't see the point anymore.

      Merrick allows a respectful pause, then-

                                   MERRICK
                     You'll find a vehicle parked outside.
                     It's unregistered, difficult to trace.
                     I take it we have an agreement...?

180   INT . KATHERINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

      A slant of light falls across Ester, writhing in her sleep,
      rasping. Katherine and Lincoln peer in through the doorway,
      checking on her. Then Katherine quietly closes the door.

181   INT . KATHERINE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

      Lincoln paces around, feeling useless. Katherine considers him-

                                 KATHERINE
                     What do I call you?

                                                                 119.



                               LINCOLN
               Lincoln . My name's Lincoln.

                               KATHERINE
               Lincoln , I think she needs professional
               help. I think she needs to see a doctor.

                          LINCOLN
               N o . They'll find her. They'll take her.

                          KATHERINE
               N o t if I don't want them to.

                          LINCOLN
               You don't understand. They don't want
               people to know about her. Either of us.

                          KATHERINE
               The doctor I'm thinking of, he's an
               old friend. He look after John in
               t h e final stages. I trust him.

                           LINCOLN
               Why ? So you can take her baby?

                          KATHERINE
               N o . No, that's not what I want.
O f f Lincoln's blunt look, she sighs, lowering into a chair.

                               KATHERINE
               M a y b e I didn't realize she'd      be so...
                      ( c u t s off, a deep pause)
               M a y b e I just didn't want to.      Either
               way, I was wrong. I want you          to know
               that. I was wrong... And I'm          sorry.

A heavy lull. Lincoln hangs his head, remembering.

                           LINCOLN
               The y make you believe there's a place
               called The Island. Then they take you
               upstairs and put you to sleep. They
               cut you open. They take pieces of you.

Katherine looks at him, intuiting. She allows a pause, then-

                           KATHERINE
               E v e n if I had taken her baby, I swear
               to you, I'd never have... They give
               you a choice, you see, to extend the
               sponsorship after... after d e l i v e r y .

                                                                 120.



                                LINCOLN
                     N o . I saw a lot of us go to The Island.
                     But I never saw anyone come back.

                                KATHERINE
                     You mean... Even if I had extended the
                     sponsorship, they'd have... and kept
                     taking the money? But that's inhuman.

                                    LINCOLN
                          ( b e a t , a lost look)
                     Is it? I wouldn't know.

182   INT . UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - EVENING

      A sleek low vehicle known as a "straker" pulls down the ramp.

183   INT . APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING

      The orbs on the doors eyeball Scheer, moving up the corridor. He
      stops at a doorway. Rings the bell. Tom Lincoln opens the door-

                                TOM
                     Yes?

                                SCHEER
                     I'm from the Sanger Institute.

                                 TOM
                     I've given you people enough of my
                     time already.

                                 SCHEER
                     I t ' s just a formality. I need to see
                     your sponsorship contract.

      T o m pauses then lets Scheer inside. He crosses to the wall safe,
      taps the keys. Then pulls out the contract folder. He offers it.

                               SCHEER
                     Is this the only copy?

                                TOM
                     Why would I make copies? Do you think
                     I want anyone else to know about this?

      S c h e e r accepts the folder. As Tom turns to close the safe, he
      sets it down. And grabs Tom from behind, by the scalp, pressing
      the syringe-gun into his jugular. A HISS. Tom clutches his throat
      like it's on fire. With a boiling gurgle, he staggers forward.
      Sweating, collapsing. Convulsing, belching steam. Then falling
      slack. His skin starts to smolder. Scheer pauses, then tosses
      t h e contract folder on top of him, leaving it to burn with him.

                                                                          121.



184   EXT. NEW GAZA HOSPITAL - PHOENIX - NIGHT

      E s t a b l i s h i n g . A clean facade of white steel and glass. A hatch-
      b a c k vehicle known as a "corsair" pulls down the parking ramp.

185   INT . UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - NEW GAZA HOSPITAL - NIGHT

      The corsair pulls up at the ER entrance, Lincoln at the wheel.
      Katherine gets out of the passenger side. A doctor is waiting -
      50's, caring face. His name is DR. ABRAMS. He looks curiously at
      the man at the wheel. Then greets Katherine with a hug -

                                        D R . ABRAMS
                      Katherine . . . It's good to see you. I
                      haven't seen you since John's funeral.

                                  KATHERINE
                      We l l I've been keeping busy. Trying
                      to. Thanks for coming down to meet me.

                                  D R . ABRAMS
                      Your call was a little cryptic. What
                      is it exactly that's wrong with you?

                                  KATHERINE
                      I t ' s not me... Not exactly.

      She opens the rear door of the corsair. Ester is lying on the
      back seat. Dr. Abrams frowns as he notices the resemblance.

186   EXT . THE RANCH HOUSE - SEDONA - NIGHT

      The straker p u l l s up into the port.

187   INT . THE STUDIO / MAIN HOUSE - SEDONA - NIGHT

      The shadow of Scheer moving outside the windows, looking for a
      point of entry. He inspects the studio door for alarms. Then
      elbows the glass. Reaching inside, turning the lock. He enters
      the studio, glancing at the sculptures. Moving through the home.

      S i l e n t l y , systematically, checking the rooms. He reaches the
      guest bedroom, looks around. Something catches his eye. Spots of
      blood of the linens. Eyes honing, he moves on into the kitchen.
      He discovers a holocom keypad on the counter. Taps some keys.
      The holoframe flashes "REDIALLING". The holoframe snows with
      static. Then a receptionist's face appears-

                                 R E C E P T I O N I S T (ON HOLOCOM)
                      N e w Gaza Hospital, how may I help you?

                                                                     122.



188   INT. WAITING ROOM - NEW GAZA HOSPITAL - NIGHT - LATER

      Lincoln stands waiting. There are chairs but he's too tense to
      sit. Katherine and Dr. Abrams now enter. Lincoln looks at them,
      expectantly. There's a pause. Then Dr. Abrams speaks-

                                 D R . ABRAMS
                     Your friend... she has pneumonia. At a
                     very advanced stage. Its progress has
                     been unchecked by her immune system.

                                LINCOLN
                     C a n you help her?

                                    D R . ABRAMS
                     We have two options... One is a super-
                     b i o t i c . But there's the risk her immune
                     system might bow out of the fight. The
                     other is a nodal transfusion. Katherine
                     has agreed to be the donor. But the new
                     antibodies may not conform fully. They
                     m a y decide to attack the baby...

                              LINCOLN
                     I don't understand any of this.

                               KATHERINE
                     He means that by trying to help her,
                     we could lose her. Or lose the baby.

                                D R . ABRAMS
                     Or , if we do nothing, both. Her immune
                     system is... remarkably unstable. If we
                     don't act, the infection will take over.

      Lincoln lowers into a chair. He feels a pain somewhere. He can't
      quite pin down where. Or what caused it. Or why it hurts so bad.

189   INT . HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
      Ester lies in bed, dozing, looking more relaxed. Her oxygen mask
      makes breathing easier. Lincoln enters and sits beside her. She
      stirs, meeting his eye with a faint smile. Lincoln returns it-

                                   LINCOLN
                     He l l o , stranger.

                                ESTER
                     You look tired, Lincoln.

                                 LINCOLN
                     Ester...

                                                                     123.



                                 ESTER
                     I t ' s okay. I know. Katherine told me.
      She sits up, lowering her mask. Her hand finding his.

                                ESTER
                     She told me a lot of things. About how
                     they used a tiny part of her to make me.
                     She said it wasn't so very different.

                                 LINCOLN
                     What do you mean?

                                      ESTER
                            ( t o u c h i n g her belly)
                     F r o m this... From having a baby.

      Lincoln nods. A pause. Ester continues, more troubled, wheezing-

                                ESTER
                     She told me how they use us... And I
                     keep thinking... about the others...
                     the ones we left behind, about how
                     they'll never know... how they'll...

      Ester ' s out of breath again, coughing. Lincoln helps her put the
      oxygen mask back over her mouth. Ester slumps back, relaxing.
      Off Lincoln's worried look, she smiles at him with her eyes-

                                ESTER
                     I'm going to be okay, Lincoln.

                               LINCOLN
                     I know.

      But even to his own ears, the affirmation sounds hollow.

      The stream of water gushes into Lincoln's hands. He splashes his
      face. Then looks at himself in the mirror. He looks sallow from
      sleeplessness. The facial hair makes him look like a shadow of
      his former self. For an instant he tenses at a light blinking in
      the glass. Blue light. Like etherscreen. Then he sees it's just
      a humidifier on the far wall. Tension ebbing, he splashes some
      more water. When he looks up again, he sees his pupils are
      dilating. The sense of danger. His voice comes in a cold whisper-

                               LINCOLN
                     No...

                                                                        124.



191   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

      Lincoln emerges from the restroom, scanning for the danger's
      source. Figures flash past in scrubs, white coats. Then he sees
      it. The figure emerging from the elevator. The face of Scheer...

192   INT . PREP ROOM - NIGHT

      A flurry of disturbance from the nurses as someone barges into
      the room. Dr. Abrams is prepping Katherine for the transfusion.
      Off the ruckus, he looks up. Lincoln comes up to them, urgently-

                               LINCOLN
                     We have to go. We have to get her out.

                                 KATHERINE
                     What are you talking about?

                                 LINCOLN
                     He's come for her. For us.

                                     D R . ABRAMS
                     What e v e r this is about, we can't move
                     her. She's already under sedation.

      Lincoln look to see Ester, asleep on the OR table beyond.

                                LINCOLN
                     How long before she wakes up?

                                D R . ABRAMS
                     The procedure takes three hours but...

                                   LINCOLN
                            ( t o Katherine, emphatic)
                     You'll take care of it, won't you? Take
                     her somewhere they can't find her...

      Katherine , understanding, simply nods. Lincoln takes a last look
      at Ester, then departs. Dr. Abrams, bemused, turns to Katherine-

                                       D R . ABRAMS
                     Katherine , what the hell's going on?

193   EXT . HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

      Lincoln moves up the corridor, purpose in his stride. His black
      gaze fixed on Scheer, making an inquiry at the nurse's station.
      Lincoln doesn't even break stride. He GRABS SCHEER FROM BEHIND--

      H U R L I N G HIM ACROSS THE NURSE STATION - INSTANT CONFUSION -
      NURSES RUNNING - PEOPLE SHOUTING - Lincoln takes off at a run--

                                                                      125.



      SCHEER RECOVERING - seeing his quarry through the confusion - no
      time for subtlety - he leaps over the nurse's station - pursuing-
      LINCOLN pauses at the emergency exit - checking to see his enemy
      is following - then pushing on through the doors into--

194   INT . STAIRWELL - NIGHT

      LINCOLN HAMMERS DOWN THE STEPS - an alarm sounding - shouting
      from beyond - FOOTFALLS BEHIND HIM - deeper into the gloom-

      S C H E E R VAULTING THE RAIL - shortcutting t h e flights of steps -
      catching sight of his quarry as he pushes through a door into--

195   INT . UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - NIGHT

      LINCOLN BURSTS OUT INTO THE PARKING LOT - flashes of light -
      vehicles pulling in and out - off across the parking docks -

      S C H E E R BURSTS OUT IN HIS WAKE - his quarry temporarily lost -
      now spotting him across the lot - leaping into a vehicle -
      LINCOLN FIRES UP THE CORSAIR - resistors droning - jamming the
      throttle - lurching out - NARROWLY MISSING ANOTHER VEHICLE -

      S C H E E R SPINNING ROUND as the corsair blurs past - it's heading
      for the exit ramp - he launches towards the straker -

196   EXT . EXIT RAMP - THE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

      T H E CORSAIR BURNS UP the parking ramp - SMASHING THE GATE ARM -
      plunging out into the street - bouncing across the lodestream -
      T H E STRAKER H U R T L E S UP close behind - into the snarl of traffic -
      steering expertly through - picking up the tail of the corsair -

197   EXT . STREETS OF PHOENIX - NIGHT

      T H E CORSAIR PLOUGHS UP THE STREET - TRAFFIC SWERVING out of its
      path - BUOYS CLANGING as it lurches from one lane to the next -

      LINCOLN JAMS THE THROTTLE - the resistors buzzing, growling with
      energy - he has one goal - draw his enemy away from Ester -

      S C H E E R COOLLY INTENT at the controls of the straker - keeping a
      certain distance - waiting for his quarry to make a mistake --

      A METRO PD OFFICER PULLS OUT - mounted on a hybrid of motorbike
      and jetski k n o w n as a "lode-runner" - SOUNDING THE SIREN--

      S C H E E R REACTING - the PD lode-runner pulling ahead of him - he
      can't allow a police intervention - he slips in behind --

                                                                             126.



      THE METRO PD OFFICER - darting looks back - headlamps b l i n d i n g
      his rear-view - another vehicle is coming up behind him fast -
      - C L A N G - THE STRAKER I M P A C T S - glancing the PD lode-runner which
      wobbles, corrects - the straker d r o p s back for a longer run up--

      T H E METRO PD OFFICER - yelling into his headset - inaudible over
      the siren - the headlamps a g a i n - the vehicle coming up behind--
      - C R A S H - THE PD LODE-RUNNER fishtails - its resistors suddenly
      clash with the prevailing polarity - A HUGE JOLT OF INERTIA-

      C A T A P U L T I N G THE METRO PD OFFICER through the air - plummeting
      down into obscurity - THE STRAKER W H O O S H I N G OVER HIS HEAD -
      T H E PD LODE-RUNNER LEFT SPINNING behind - resistors vying with
      the polarity - the drive system melting down - FUSING, SPARKING--

      - B O O M - THE PD LODE-RUNNER EXPLODES IN A FLASH OF ELECTRICAL FIRE-

      S C H E E R watches the fireball in his rear-view - there will be more
      police soon - he jams the throttle - he has to end this.

      LINCOLN SEEING THE STRAKER Z O O M I N G UP BEHIND - veering round
      another corner - the chassis tilting - A STEEP BANKING TURN -

      T H E CORSAIR HULL RUNNERS THUDDING across the buffers - recoil
      sending the chassis up against the concrete - SPARKS FLYING--

      S C H E E R TURNING THE CORNER - the windshield suddenly sprayed with
      sparks - jerking back on the throttle to avoid a collision -

      LINCOLN FIGHTING TO CORRECT THE STEERING - seeing the straker
      d r o p p i n g back - a chance to gain distance - JAMMING THE THROTTLE-

      A N INTERSECTION APPROACHING - Lincoln can't correct his steering
      in time - the corsair careens at full res over the intersection--

      C R A S H I N G THROUGH A GATE ARM - the ground dropping away into a
      steep ramp - suddenly the corsair is flying through the air--

      C R A S H I N G - SQUEALING ONWARDS - SCUDDING ACROSS VEHICLE ROOFS,
      finally nose-diving into an empty bay with a DEAFENING CRUNCH-

198   EXT . ENTRANCE - HOLSPAR STADIUM - NIGHT

      The straker p u l l s up at the smashed gate arm. In the booth, a
      holoserve p a r k i n g attendant greets the arrival with a smile-

                                     P A R K I N G ATTENDANT
                      We l c o m e to Holspar S t a d i u m , home of the
                      Phoenix Admirals, parking is fifteen
                      currency units...

                                                                          127.



      Scheer gets out of the straker. He looks down at the crashsite
      b e l o w . The parking lot, like a marina, is filled to capacity. A
      game is in progress. A corona of light coming from the stadium.
      Hoots, music, the roaring crowd. Over which, sirens can now be
      heard. Scheer draws the syringe-gun and heads down the ramp.

199   EXT . PARKING LOT - HOLSPAR STADIUM - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER

      D u s t blooms from the crashsite. S c h e e r crouches, peering down at
      the wrecked corsair. The burst windshield, the dangling driver
      side door shows his quarry has escaped the wreckage. He rises
      and scans around. On the concrete, a trail of blood is visible.

200   INT . STORAGE AREA - HOLSPAR STADIUM - MINUTES LATER

      The blood trail leads down a gloomy stairwell. The game is just
      audible overhead. Lincoln stumbles down the steps, clutching his
      bleeding arm. Between pain and concussion, he loses his footing
      and falls. He tumbles down the remaining steps to the bottom.

      I n the gloom we   see groundskeeping e q u i p m e n t , supplies - edgers,
      aerators, spray    rigs, drums of insecticides, herbicides. For a
      moment, Lincoln    lies stunned. Then hears a noise and rolls over.
      He looks up the    stairwell. A shadow is descending towards him.

      W i t h painful effort, Lincoln starts crawling across the floor,
      eyes fixed on the shadow. Tensing as A HANDGUN noses out of the
      darkness. Then A STADIUM SECURITY GUARD steps into the light -

                                 S E C U R I T Y GUARD
                     You , what are you doing down here?

      N o w he sees Lincoln more closely - injured, his arm bleeding.

                                S E C U R I T Y GUARD
                     O h , Jesus... Are you okay, son?

      Lincoln eases a little as he sees the security guard lower his
      weapon. Then suddenly the guard is JERKED BACK BY THE SCALP.
      A HISS. Now suddenly the guard jettisons the handgun, clutching
      his throat like it's on fire. With a boiling gurgle, he staggers
      forward. Streaming with sweat. Toppling across a herbicide drum.
      Convulsing, belching steam. Then suddenly his body falls slack.
      S c h e e r is at the foot of the steps, discarding the spent ampule
      from the syringe-gun. Now screwing a fresh ampule into place.

      Lincoln turns to him, realizing what he's just witnessed is a
      glimpse of his own fate. He pushes himself upright, bracing.
      S c h e e r looks at him. Clutching his bloody arm, barely able to
      stay upright, but still ready to fight for life. He half-smiles-

                                                                                 128.



                                  SCHEER
                       I'm jealous of you. You have a reason to
                       live. I can't say I've ever had that...

      Lincoln holds his gaze, looking deep in his eyes. Then, as if
      scared by what he sees there, starts inching away, glancing at--

      T H E GUARD'S BODY SMOLDERING - lowering, melting through the drum-
      S C H E E R MOVING FORWARD, the smile leaving his face. A mask of
      hollowness as he moves in on his quarry, the syringe-gun poised.

      LINCOLN STUMBLING - collapsing to his knees - hanging his head
      as if in surrender... then suddenly his hand flies up-
      - B O O M - A FLASH OF LIGHT as he fires THE HANDGUN - recovered from
      the ground - AN ENERGY PULSE impacting the wall, fizzling out--

      S C H E E R KEEPS COMING, syringe-gun ready, blank-faced, unflinching-

      T H E GUARD'S BODY CRACKLING INTO FLAME - the drum splitting open--
      - B O O M - ANOTHER FLASH - Lincoln fires again - clipping his enemy--

      S C H E E R KEEPS COMING, a charred wound in his shoulder, relentless-

      T H E GUARD'S BODY BURNING - sliding into the sands of herbicide -
      - B O O M - B O O M - B O O M - LINCOLN KEEPS FIRING - more hits than misses--

      S C H E E R KEEPS COMING, blank faced, his body PITTING WITH IMPACTS--

      A BLINDING FLARE OF LIGHT - THE HERBICIDE IGNITING - THE DRUM
      EXPLODING - STARTING A CHAIN REACTION - OTHER DRUMS IGNITING -
      EXPLODING - FIRE - SMOKE - ENGULFING ALL IN A BLAZING INFERNO...

                                                               D I S S O L V I N G TO:

201   INT . TOP OF STAIRWELL - NIGHT - MUCH LATER

      A cacophony of sirens can be heard outside. A thick grey smoke
      gulches up from the stairwell. Shadows are visible. The sound of
      extinguishers. A FIREMAN climbs up, emerging from the smoke, he
      pulls off his breathing mask to address a waiting PD officer-

                                         T H E FIREMAN
                       N o t h i n g . . . If there was anyone down
                       there, they're a pile of ashes now.

                                                               F A D E TO BLACK.

                                                                         129.



202   EXT. CEMETERY - SOME DAYS LATER

      P e a c e . Sunlight. A bell tolling in the background. We make out
      Katherine, dressed in black, standing at a grave. The headstone
      reads simply: "Here Lies Ester & Her Unborn Son - May They Rest
      In Peace". There are no dates. Katherine lays down some flowers
      then looks across at Dr. Abrams. As he escorts her away, we see
      Crowne crossing towards them. She introduces herself delicately-

                                CROWNE
                    M r s . Ester? My name is Ellen Crowne.

203   INT . CEO'S OFFICE - THE SANGER INDUSTRIES TOWER - DAY

      A celestial penthouse office. Katherine enters with Crowne.
      Merrick and Dr. Sanger rise to greet her. Strained solemnity.

                              DR. SANGER
                    M y name is Henry Sanger. I'd like to
                    offer my deepest condolences.

      His insincerity is transparent. Katherine just nods stiffly.

                                DR. SANGER
                    This is Bernard Merrick our facility
                    director. He knew Ester personally.

                               MERRICK
                    An d it's a terrible loss.

      M o r e insincerity. Katherine nods again. Then settles in a chair.
      Crowne allows a respectful pause. Then begins with due delicacy-

                                    CROWNE
                    L e g a l issues must seem trivial at this
                    time. But the sponsorship agreement has
                    certain conditions relating to confident-
                    i a l i t y . D e s p i t e this tragic t u r n of
                    events, those conditions remain binding.
                    We want to be sure you understand that.

                               KATHERINE
                    I see.

                                CROWNE
                    T h a t said, The Institute is likewise
                    bound by the terms of sponsorship and
                    while we reserve every right...

                               KATHERINE
                    You can stop there. I know why I'm
                    here. You wanted to know if I'm going
                    to sue you for breach of contract.

                                                             130.



                             DR. SANGER
              N o t h i n g so devious, Mrs. Ester. We
              simply wanted to find some way to
              heal the wounds from this incident.

                       KATHERINE
              I don't want restitution, Dr. Sanger.
              The reason I agreed to this meeting
              was to have the chance to talk to you.

                        DR. SANGER
              O f course. Please...

                         KATHERINE
              I never got to meet you when I visited
              The Institute. It was one of your sales-
              m e n who led the tour. I remember how
              h e described the agnates a s if they
              were some kind of mindless organisms.
              More like livestock than humanity...

                              CROWNE
              L e g a l l y , human rights don't apply.

                           DR. SANGER
              Don't interrupt, Ellen.

                       KATHERINE
              I remember how eager I was to believe
              him. But when I saw w h a t I'd created,
              in flesh and blood, when I touched h e r ,
              it was I who felt less than human.

                       DR. SANGER
              I understand.

He looks at her expressively. Perhaps he really does understand.

                               KATHERINE
              Ester ' s life was my responsibility and
              her death is my cross to bear alone. So
              I'm not going to sue you, Dr. Sanger...
                     ( b e a t , a sudden ominous tone)
              But I am going to blame y o u . Until the
              day I die, I will silently curse your
              name. That's w h a t I wanted you to know.

She drives it home with a horrible look. Sanger accepts it with
due gravity. There's an ugly pause. Katherine gets to her feet.

                         KATHERINE
              An d now I'd like to leave, please.

                                                                          131.



                               CROWNE
                     We do have other issues to discuss...

                                DR. SANGER
                     N o , Ellen, that's enough. I think Mrs.
                     Ester has said all there is to say.

204   EXT . STREET - OUTSIDE THE SANGER INDUSTRIES TOWER - DAY

      Katherine descends the steps from the entrance. She crosses to a
      black funeral sedan, parked kerbside. D r . Abrams stands waiting-

                              D R . ABRAMS
                     I hope you know what you're doing.

                              KATHERINE
                     I don't think they suspected anything.

                                 D R . ABRAMS
                     J u s t understand that I've put a lot on
                     the line for you, Katherine.

                              KATHERINE
                     I know... But it felt good. It felt
                     like something John would have done.

205   INT . ROOFTOP FLIGHTPAD - THE SANGER INDUSTRIES TOWER

      C r o w n e escorts Sanger and Merrick to the waiting whisper.

                                  CROWNE
                     We l l , I don't know about the two of
                     you but I'd say we got off lightly.

                                 DR. SANGER
                     Did we?

                                  CROWNE
                     Don't start getting maudlin, Henry.
                     It's a little too late in the game.

      She shakes their hands as they climb into the whisper. Then
      watches it take off, ascending into the blinding sunlight.

                                                            D I S S O L V E TO:
206   EXT . THE SANGER INSTITUTE - SOME WEEKS LATER

      A i r blasts up from the giant funnel. Widening, we re-establish
      the huge ring, the processing plant, the giant appendages of
      ducting, the immutable red rocks. The shot sequence, reprising.
      From the processing plant, over the main complex. From the front
      of the complex, to the dock.

                                                                           132.



      Following the lodeway out to the perimeter wall. The gateway now
      gliding open to disclose a view of the shimmering desert. Out in
      the distance, the institute liner emerging from the shimmer. The
      crosshatch insignia.

207   INT . ENTRANCE HALL - THE SANGER INSTITUTE - DAY

      T h r o u g h the polarized glass we see the liner has docked. A TOUR
      GROUP is disembarking. Another parade of plutocracy, aging
      bloated me and brittle young women. They filter inside to be
      greeted by the courtesy staff, led by the ever-perky LYDIA.

                                     LYDIA
                     L a d i e s and gentlemen, my name is Lydia
                     and on behalf of our staff, I'd like
                     t o welcome you to The Sanger Institute.
                     Before we start the tour, we'll be serv-
                     i n g r e f r e s h m e n t s in the visitor center
                     and circulating our standard discretion
                     agreements. I should add that today you
                     are all very lucky because our CEO and
                     founder, Dr. Henry Sanger, is with us
                     and will be leading the tour personally.

208   INT . VISITOR CENTER - THE SANGER INSTITUTE - DAY

      The tour group pick and mingle at a buffet. We isolate a
      casually dressed man, lightly bearded, in a Phoenix Admirals
      cap, crossing to Lydia. She turns to greet him with a smile-

                                   LYDIA
                     Yes . . . Mr. Thomas, isn't it?
      The man tilts up to reveal his face. We see he is LINCOLN...

                              LINCOLN
                     I can't find my sunglasses. I think I
                     left them on the shuttle.

                                 LYDIA
                     We l l we're about to start the tour.
                     But I can have someone check for you.

                                  LINCOLN
                     Don't worry. I'll catch up.

209   EXT . PROCESSING PLANT - DAY

      Lincoln moves quickly along the wall towards the back of the
      complex. Hugging the shadows, scanning for onlookers. There is
      the processing plant and there, the ring of funnels. The sight
      brings a sudden rush of memories, painful memories, horrors.

                                                                        133.



      Lincoln steels himself, then breaks from shadow and races for
      the nearest funnel. He makes a running lap. His fingers grab
      t h e lip of the funnel and he pulls himself up. Reaching the lip,
      he finds the funnel mouth has been gridded o v e r . Then he hears-

                                  A VOICE (O.S.)
                      S i r , this is a restricted area...

      Lincoln lowers back to the ground. He finds himself facing A
      TECHNICIAN in a hardhat. His uniform reads "Air Processing".

210   INT . ELEVATOR - PROCESSING PLANT

      The doors slide open and the technician enters, stiffly. Then
      suddenly topples forward, pistol whipped from behind. Lincoln
      enters the elevator, a familiar handgun clenched in his fist.

211   INT . ELEVATOR SHAFT

      L o o k i n g up an elevator shaft. The red pulse of the lode-poles,
      rippling downward as the elevator descends from the surface.

212   INT . ELEVATOR - DESCENDING

      Lincoln is now wearing the technician's uniform. He watches the
      panel lights flashing down. "Level 3: Harvest" "Level 5: Labor
      Decon", "Level 7: Labor Quarters". His pupils are dilating but
      his face is set with determination. He knows what he must do.
      His gaze drifts down to "Level Twenty: Agnate Containment".

213   INT . THE ETHER GRID

      The holographic rendering of containment spins in the vaulted
      chamber like a giant geometrical phantom. The ether blinks with
      blue dots in their hundreds as the agnates g o about their day.

214   INT . ETHER CONTROL ROOM

      O v e r l o o k i n g the ether, Ethercon sits at his console. The hiss of
      an opening door as someone enters. Ethercon looks round. He
      greets the technician's arrival with an inquisitive look. Then
      the technician takes off his hardhat. A crosshatch on his brow.
      Ethercon reacts almost instantly, reaching for the console. Then
      instantly freezes as Lincoln presses the handgun to his skull.

215   INT . CORRIDOR - LEVEL TWENTY SEVEN

      P a l e blue light. Ethercon leads the way down a silent corridor.
      Lincoln follows him, the handgun firmly levelled on his head.

                                                                            134.



216   INT. CHAMBER - LEVEL TWENTY SEVEN

      The pale blue light sustains. The chamber is reminiscent of the
      foundation chambers. The walls lined with tanks. But instead of
      amber fluid, these contain blocks of ice. Beside each tank is a
      grid of bio-monitors. E t h e r c o n stumbles into frame, prodded by
      Lincoln. Then, with a trembling finger points to one of the
      tanks. Lincoln holds aim on him and considers the glass facet.
      He wipes the condensation off the glass. Suspended in the block
      of ice is a shadow. A human figure. A device is attached to his
      stomach. Lincoln looks at the bio-monitors. A screen reads:

      " P R O D U C T ID: STARKWEATHER/ FOUNDATION: II/ GENERATION: DELTA".

      Lincoln looks across the EKG, the cardiograph, indications that
      Starkweather is still alive. Then he fixes on the RFI m o n i t o r . A
      resonant image of the brain. The shifting aura showing a level of
      consciousness. What thoughts must be going through that mind?
      The fate of the agnates s p a r e d from expiration. To be kept on
      i c e for future harvest. With a haggard look, Lincoln rests his
      hand on the glass where Starkweather hangs frozen. Connecting.

217   INT . SALES HALL - THE INSTITUTE - DAY

      An embryo in mutated effigy hangs suspended in the amber fluid.
      Dr. Sanger stands at the wall of display tanks, mid-way through
      his sales pitch. He delivers it now with noticeably less gusto-

                                       DR. SANGER
                     C a s e in point, the clone. Back in the
                     beginning, the mapping of the human
                     genome was declared a historic landmark-
                     to break the curse of heredity, to
                     correct congenital defect... genetic
                     engineering became the brave new world
                     of medical science. A bright future
                     that led to a dark age and much of...
                            ( a n abrupt pause, a frown)
                     . . . l e g i s l a t i o n we know today. But while
                     the clone laws may have narrowed the
                     field, science marches on. Only to...
                            ( a n o t h e r abrupt pause)
                     I'm sorry, I'm f...

      S u d d e n l y he clutches his arm, emitting a guttural gasp.

                                LYDIA
                     DR. SANGER?

      S a n g e r just looks at her. Then jolts from a spasm, clawing at
      his chest. His knees buckling, he topples against a display
      case. Pawing at the glass, he slides dreadfully to the ground.

                                                                        135.



                                 LYDIA
                     He's having a heart attack! A doctor!
                     Somebody get a doctor in here!

      The tour group keeps their distance, unsettled by the face of
      mortality. Sanger is now lying in contortion on the floor, his
      gaping eyes fixed on the display tank. The embryo in mutated
      effigy, rocking about in the amber fluid. The sight of this
      little human monster is one that will follow him to the grave.

218   INT . DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - CONTAINMENT

      The glass wall looks down on the avenue and the agnates m i l l i n g
      beneath. Merrick sits at his console. Business as usual. Off a
      buzz, he taps a button. The door opens and A CENSOR bursts in-

                                 CENSOR
                     S i r , I've been trying to contact you.
                     It's the ether... Something's wrong.

      Merrick taps another button and the glass wall frosts over. It
      pixellates o n t o an image of his own face. A recorded playback-

                                  Merrick (P/B O N ETHERSCREEN)

      I N T E R C U T T I N G : Agnates a t workstations watching on visors. In the

      We are still   in the apartment when the playback cuts out. The
      agnate looks    around as every piece of glass dissolves to trans-
      parency. The    mirror panels, the frosted walls, the window, which
      now shows no    view at all. Just the gleam of a holographic lens.

220   INT . DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

      Merrick looks down from the glass wall at the agnates m a s s e d in
      the avenue beneath. They are all looking directly up at him.

221   INT . ETHER CONTROL ROOM

      Alarms sounding. The ether grid blinking with red dots. Ethercon
      sitting frozen at the console, the handgun pressed to his head.
      Lincoln stands over him. His face cast in a chill of vengeance.

222   INT . RESIDENTIAL BLOCK - DAY

      A glass facade. A noise from within. A primal, guttural noise,
      building to a roar. Now warping as we drop to slow motion. The
      glass webbing, bursting open from within, the facade exploding
      in a GLITTERING SHOWER OF SHARDS...

                                                             S L O W FADE TO BLACK.

223   INT . BASEMENT - A YEAR LATER

      No windows. No clue of where we may be. A safehouse somewhere.
      The passage of time is marked on Lincoln's face, careworn, long
      hair, a full beard. He sits in front of a data tablet, his image
      recorded on its screen. His voice also seems older as he speaks-

                                                                   137.



                                    LINCOLN
                    I t ' s been a year since the breakout. A
                    year in hiding, waiting for things to
                    quiet down. I don't know how many made
                    i t out or how many who did, survived. I
                    know there are people called politicians
                    trying to say it never happened. That's
                    why I've kept this journal. To keep the
                    truth alive. Alive... I've learned what
                    that means but it still confuses me. In
                    functional terms, I've been alive for ten
                    years. In human terms, more than thirty.
                    Human... I'm not sure about that one
                    either. They say I'm not human because
                    I have no mother or father. I guess I
                    have more to learn. But one word I do
                    understand is hope. So maybe this
                    j o u r n a l will give hope - to those like
                    me, who may be out there. To know
                    t h e y ' r e not alone. My name is Lincoln
                    S i x - E c h o and this is my testament...

      He sits back, contemplating the screen with an air of closure.
      Then he stirs at a sound. At first just a gurgle. Then a moan.
      Becoming the sound of A BABY CRYING. Lincoln crosses to a cot.
      He lifts up a baby boy, 6 months old, bawling and squirming.

                              A WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Is he hungry again? I just fed him.

      Ester steps into the room, sleep-mussed, her beauty deepened by
      maternity. The baby reaches out for her. Lincoln hands him over-

                                   LINCOLN
                    Lincoln Junior, huh? It still doesn't
                    sound right. That name.

                                ESTER
                    I t ' s the name of his father.
      She lovingly kisses him. Lincoln smiles at her, then the baby,
      sweeping the hair from the forehead. Unscarred, blemishless.

                              LINCOLN
                    We should finish packing.

224   EXT . JETTY - THE PACIFIC COAST - DAWN

      A private jetty stretches out to a pile of supply canisters. A
      yacht is moored. We recognized it as John's boat. And we recognize
      Katherine, holding the baby as Lincoln and Ester finish loading.
      The last canister stowed, Lincoln comes up to her. He smiles at
      the sight of her with the baby. Then prompts her gently-

                                                                       138.



                                 LINCOLN
                     Time to go.
      Katherine hesitates, part of her unwilling to let the baby go.
      Then she plants a lingering kiss on his downy hair and lets
      Ester take him. Lincoln presents her with the data tablet-

                                   LINCOLN
                     You'll make sure this gets out?

                                 KATHERINE
                     Yes . There are people sympathetic to
                     the cause. I'm going to get it to them.

                                  LINCOLN
                     Thank you, Katherine. For everything.

      He smiles. Katherine points to a canister left on the dock.

                                  KATHERINE
                     Don't forget that. It has the
                     operating manuals for the boat.

                                 LINCOLN
                     I've been looking at them for months.

                                KATHERINE
                     But the maps, the charts...

                                   LINCOLN
                         ( b e a t ; a meaningful look)
                     I don't need them either.
      Katherine nods, understanding. Nothing more to say, she hugs him.
      Then turns to Ester with the baby. She folds them in a yearning,
      almost maternal embrace. Tears well in her eyes. Then the sorrow
      turns to laughter as the baby starts tugging at her gray hair.

225   EXT . THE PACIFIC - DAWN

      The sun rises in the east, casting the coastline in silhouette.
      The light glows across Lincoln's face, at the helm of the yacht,
      staring back to the shore. He looks at Ester sitting beside him,
      the baby swaddled in a blanket at her breast. Then he looks out
      to the west, to the soft reach of dawn and the boundless horizon
      of sea. There never was an island. But perhaps there will be...

JASON X - Revised Rough Draft

 
	JASON-X
	BY TOD FARMER
	REVISED ROUGH DRAFT
	MAY 24, 1999

	FADE IN:

	DARKNESS.

	A scream rises to an ominous crescendo as we SHOCK CUT INTO -

	MONTAGE of fast moving clips.  Death, destruction, fear.  All images 
	taken from the previous ten Friday The 13ths.  

	AGAIN, DARKNESS.

								OPEN ON:

	The year is 2455. The place is Old Earth. Barren, void of life, a 
	hazardous and violent planet. The sky is blood red with spiked clouds of 
	dark gray.  It is beautiful, but frighteningly foreign.

	BLUE LIGHTNING CRACKLES as several figures rush through a DUST STORM 
	below. 

	Small groups of people, wearing thick dusters, goggles and masks, work 
	nearby. Some dig in the cracked earth, others take assorted readings 
	with strange devices.

	This is an archeological expedition.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  DARK PLACE

	The dust storm rages outside. Two figures are looking closely at a small 
	object buried in the dirt. One of them pulls a device out of their pouch 
	and slowly, gently picks up the object. The other uses a magnetic tool 
	to remove the dirt.

				FEMALE VOICE
		Careful . . .

				MALE VOICE
		I know.

	They take off their masks and goggles. They are both young. ADRIENNE 
	female (17) watches as STONEY male (18) studies the object closely.

				STONEY
			(reading)
		Not guaranteed, if used After 2198.

	CLOSE UP of the object. It's an unopened condom.

				ADRIENNE
			(smiles)
		You thinking what I'm thinking?

	Stoney tosses the high tech equipment over his shoulder and rips open 
	the condom as Adrienne rips her clothes off.

	PULL BACK TO REVEAL

	They are in a half buried mini-van.  It rocks violently from the raging 
	storm outside and from the raging lust inside.

	BACK INSIDE THE VAN.

				ADRIENNE
			(breathless)
		What about Kkinsa?

	STONEY is desperately trying to take off her bra.

				STONEY
		It's over between us. You're the
		only one for me!

	METAL SCREECHES! THE FLOOR COLLAPSES!

	They fall some ten feet, RUBBLE RAINING down on top of them.

	INT.  DARK CORRIDOR

	A rusty metal ladder. Debris everywhere. Half inch layers of dust cover 
	everything. Dead. Lifeless.

				STONEY
		You okay?

	Adrienne sits up, shines her light down the long metal corridor. She 
	turns her light on STONEY then sees something over his shoulder.

	SHE SCREAMS A BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM.

	We PULL BACK, out of the tunnel, through the van as the sounds of the 
	storm drown out ADRIENNE'S SCREAM.

								CUT TO:
	EXT.  BASE CAMP

	The digging and readings have stopped. A group approaches a time scarred 
	shuttle and begin loading their packs into the cargo belly.

	FAT LOU (40), rail thin, possible female, pilot, appears at the top of 
	the shuttle ramp.

				FAT LOU
			(yelling over the wind)
		Let's go! Time to load up!

	YLLO(33), a professor of archaeology lowers his veil. 

				YLLO
			(yelling)
		I'm missing two!

				FAT LOU
		Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have
		left this rock an hour ago!

				BOEMAN
			(eyes a device)
		North three clicks.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. MINI-VAN - DAY

	YLLO and the rest of the group run into view. BOEMAN (18), husky, 
	physical; holds out a device and checks the reading.

	He points to the rusted out mini-van sitting on its belly.

				BOEMAN
			(yelling)
		There!

	KICKER(30), bulky, short on temper, rushes up wearing futuristic 
	military garb -

				KICKER
		Yo, Teach, what the fuck?

				YLLO
		We're missing two of the kids!

				KICKER
		Get your ass back to the shuttle.
		I'll check it out.

	KICKER moves past the group and into the Van.

				YLLO
		Not without me!

	The rest of the gang look at each other and climb into the Van.

	INT. ANCIENT CORRIDOR

	YLLO and the others climb down a rusted ladder. Metallic walls, 
	graffiti, cluttered floors. No Stoney or Adrienne. A sign from the 
	ceiling states -

	CRYSTAL LAKE RESEARCH FACILITY.

	They all take off the goggles and masks. The rest of the group consists 
	of DELONGPRE(18) good looking, smart ass; JANESSA(17) sexual, scheming 
	AZRAEL(17) SMALL, COCKY; KKINSA(16), insecure, problematic; 
	THORGAN(17), a nerd but doesn't know it.

				YLLO
		Amazing! But, how . . I've been coming
		here for ten years. We never picked this up on
		our . . . KAY-EM?

	KAY-EM 14, a cybernetics science droid, removes her veil. She's 
	gorgeous, but there's something off about her look. Something synthetic.

				KAY-EM 14
		The air's laced with type two ozone,
		it reads as a solid.

				THORGAN
		Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.

				KAY-EM 14
		In twenty-eighty-two many of the survivors moved
		their facilities underground to escape . . .

				KICKER
		All right, all right, enough with the history
		lesson. Lets find these two quick . . so I can kick
		some little punk ass.

	Kkinsa shines a flashlight around the dark tunnel.

				KKINSA
		I have an idea, why don't you go find
		them and we'll get the hell out of here!

	KKINSA turns and finds herself face to face with - -

	A CORPSE! Easily two-hundred years old it hangs from the wall, impaled 
	through the forehead by an iron spike. 

	KKINSA SCREAMS!

	Kicker yanks a weapon from his back, locks and loads as 

	JANESSA falls back and lands in the lap of another corpse. She screams! 

	KAY-EM 14 SCREAMS at the top of her lungs. Everyone looks at the droid.

				KAY-EM 14
		Was that out loud?

				DELONGPREE
		Thorgan, have you been screwing with . . .

	THORGAN grabs the head off the CORPSE, with the spike through it's head.

				THORGAN
		Cool! This is an automatic "A".

	Azrael dumps the contents of his bag on the ground, an old boot, some 
	cds, and an ancient box of PLAYTEX . . . starts shoving the corpse into 
	his pack.
				AZRAEL
		I've got my project. What are you losers
		gonna do?

				KICKER
		Back to the shuttle! All of you!
		I'll find them.

				YLLO
		Relax, Soldier boy, this is amazing.
		These remains are two hundred years old.

	Yllo's light hits a sign hanging from the ceiling. DANGER. STAY OUT.

				BOEMAN
		Creepy.

				THORGAN
		Cool.

				KKINSA
		Okay, I'm outta here.

				YYLO
		Kay-Em, any thoughts?

				KAY-EM 14
		Girth is better than length and
		women prefer a shaved scrotum during
		oral sex.

	Yllo glares a Thorgan.

				THORGAN
		I'm trying to give her some personality.

				YLLO
		Well stop messing with her. I don't want
		a science droid with a personality. Now
		let's find them and get back. I want to
		get clearance to stay back and study this . . .

				KKINSA
		No way! I'm not staying here any longer . . .
		I have a life you know.

	A radio crackles.

				FAT LOU(V.O.)
		Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze!
		Get your ass back hre!

				YLLO
			(into radio)
		Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it.
		You won't believe what we found.
			(calls out)
		Adrienne! Stoney!

	Yllo rushes past the corpse. The others reluctantly follow. They pass 
	another hanging sign - Danger - THEY PASS ANOTHER CORPSE LYING ON THE 
	FLOOR, it's torso separated from it's legs. And this is just the 
	beginning. As they move down the corridor there are bodies everywhere.

				BOEMAN
		There was a hall of a battle down here.

	S they move further they break a laser beam . . . sparks fly. A WARNING 
	VOICE sounds.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Dan-danger. Do not enter-er.

	But the group keeps moving. 

				KKINSA
		I feel compelled to ask why we are
		ignoring that.

	A corpse lies on the floor before them, it's skeletal hand beneath a 
	warning written in ancient blood . . .

	HELP ME . . .

	Suddenly another CORPSE LEAPS at them, screaming like a banshee! 
	Everyone SCREAMS - It lands on Kkinsa, who totally freaks trying to get 
	the corpse off her. 

	DELONGPREE and YLLO help Kkinsa fight the rotting corpse. They hear 
	hysterical laughter and look up to see -

	ADRIENNE and STONEY . . . emerge from the shadows laughing 
	uncontrollably.

				DELONGPREE
		Damnit!

				YLLO
		What the hell are you two doing?!

	Kkinsa eyes Adrienne, then glares at Stoney.

				KKINSA
		You're toast, mister.

				YLLO
		You're both toast!

				ADRIENNE
		You gotta see this!

	They turn down the right corridor, passing beneath ceiling consisting of 
	a jumbled mess of jagged metal.

				THORGAN
			(re: ceiling)
		That's a strange design, don't you think?

				KICKER
		We don't have time for this shit.

	As they pass we see a section of the jagged metal ceiling twitch and 
	squeeze together. That can't be a good thing . . .

	STONEY and Adrienne stop at a huge metal door. Above the door . . . 
	CRYOGENICS LAB.

	Adrienne points to a small window in the door.

				DELONGPREE
		Yeah, so? I had Cryo 101 last year.

				ADRIENNE
		Check it out.

	With a smirk, Adrienne wipes the condensation from the small window in 
	the door. Drawn from the inside, in blood, is a final warning -

	A SKULL AND CROSSBONES 

				KKINSA
		So don't open the door.

				ADRIENNE
		Look beyond it, yesterday's news.

	Yllo pushes his way to the window.

	Shocked faces.

	INSIDE the blue tinted room we see a huge domed Cryo cylinder. It's 
	massive, but our attention is pulled to the corner of the room. Curled 
	up into a ball, is a body - female, young.

				YLLO
		Is that?

				KAY-EM 14
		The room's still operational.
		She's perfectly preserved.

	Yllo's face lights up, grabs his radio.

				YLLO
			(into radio)
		Fat Lou, bring the ship to the
		following coordinates. Call Grendel,
		have them power up the labs, we're bringing
		in the find of the century!

				KICKER
		Now wait a minute! I don't think you
		should open that door.

				YLLO
		This is a science excursion corporal.
		Just stay out of the way.

	Yllo turns to the kids. He's very excited.

				YLLO
		Okay, no screwing around. This is the real
		thing. Do exactly what I say. Okay Thorgan, 
		open it up.

	Thorgan pops the cover from a control panel and hooks up a small gadget.

				KKINSA
		You're opening the door?
		What about the . . . ?

	She points to the skull and crossbones. 

				DELONGPREE
		I'm thinking we should call in some
		experts.

				YLLO
		This is your find people. You want to
		give your credit away?

				DELONGPREE
		I was just saying . . .

				THORGAN
		The cryo unit leaked. The computers
		sealed the room. No airborne viruses
		no hazardous materials. I've shut down the
		until. Alright, stand back. 

				KAY-EM 14
		Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses
		will render you unconcious.

				DELONGPREE
		Knock you on your ass pal. 

	They don their face masks as  . . . Fshhhhhshshsh. The metallic door 
	cracks open causing a powerful backdraft. The freezing cold air mixes 
	with the air outside the chamber creating a strange gray gas. Ice 
	crystals crack and fall to the floor.

	EXT.  CRYO CELL

				YLLO
		Kay-Em!

	Kay moves into the room ahead of the others.

	INT.  CRYO CELL

	CLOSE ON KAY-EM'S EYES

	They are not human. Mechanical, digital, but alluring. They dilate, open 
	up. Colored lasers shoot forth, slicing through the gas, scanning the 
	body.

	--which itself is slumped over. An icicle of frozen blood from, the 
	wound in her shoulder, props the body up.

	The other enter the icy chamber.

				DELONGPREE
		I speak on behalf of the group
		when I say . . . that's fucked.

				KAY-EM 14
		Female, nineteen years old, eight months . . .
		34-26-34 . . . bitch is built like a brick
		shit house.

				YLLO
		Thorgan?!!!

				THORGAN
		Sorry. I'll fix her when we get back.

				KAY-EM 14
		Time of hibernation 2049.
		Crystallization at seventeen percent.
		Suggest extensive Nanotech. Chances of
		rejuvenation eight-one percent.

				KKINSA
		What's going on?

				DELONGPREE
		She's dying.

				JANESSA
		Bitch looks dead to me.

	The RADIO CRACKLES . . .

				SERGEANT BRODSKI(V.O.)
		Yllo, Sergeant Brodski. Get your ass
		back to the shuttle!!

				YLLO
		Janessa, stretcher.
			(into radio)
		Keep your shirt on, sergeant. We have
		a medical emergency here not tot mention the
		discovery of a lifetime.

				SERGEANT BRODSKI(V.O.)
		Kicker! Get them the hell out of there!

	Janessa removes a Metallic cube from her backpack, clicks a button and a 
	flat stretcher expands and hovers a few feet off the ground.

	Kicker grabs Yllo.

				KICKER
		We're outta here!

	Yllo pulls away, leans over the frozen girl, grabs the frozen string of 
	blood and -CRACK-breaks it off.

				YLLO
		Fine, grab that end.


	Kicker sighs and helps Yllo lift the frozen girl and place her curled 
	body on the stretcher.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As thorgan stands at the massive Cryo-Unit -

				THORGAN
		Hey check this out!

	Protruding from the door is the tip of a machete.

				THORGAN
		This caused the leak and there's an
		occupant. 

	Thorgan yanks the door open.

				KICKER
		Don't touch that!

	Gas rolls out. Suddenly ALARMS SOUND and LIGHTS STROBE.

				KKINSA
		This is bad, no?

				THORGAN
		Relax, it's only a  glitch in the
		system. 

				JANESSA
		First field trip and you think
		you're a Scientist. Move out of the
		way geek. 

	JANESSA moves to look inside the chamber. 

	As the gas and steam clear - we hear the sound of CRACKING ICE, see a 
	jagged mass of frozen crystals . . . and within it . . . a body. A chunk 
	of ice CRACKS and falls tot he floor then THE MASK of JASON VOORHEES 
	looms forward!

	JANESSA screams as JASON'S BODY, stiff as a board, CRASHES to the ground 
	sending ice shrapnel everywhere!

				DELONGPREE
		Jesus, used to make the suckers big
		didn't they?

	Again, Kay-Em's eyes scan the frozen body.

				KAY-EM 14
		Subject was dead prior to incubation.

	Yllo moves to get a good look at Jason.

				YLLO
		My God, look at him. Why would they freeze
		a dead body?
			(a beat)
		Alright, load him up, and let's get out
		of here!

	OVER HIS SHOULDER - HALL

	A pair of three foot metallic spiders drop on thin wires to the floor.

	BACK INSIDE 

	One of Boeman's gadgets starts to BEEP.

				BOEMAN
		Er, guy? I'm picking up some movement.

	FZZZZT . . . Azrael screams as a laser slices into the room. His left 
	arm falls to the ground!

	Kay-Em rushes to him. Her finger pops open. A needle appears. She 
	injects him. The drugs take immediate effect.

				AZRAEL
		Cool . . . check out my arm.

	CLINK - CLINK, CLINK, CLINK, CLINK.

	HALL

	The metallic spiders, lasers attached to their bodies, CLANK towards our 
	heroes. 

				YLLO
		Kicker!

				KICKER
		Defense droids. I'm on it.

	Kicker slams the Cryo door shut as lasers slice into it.


				KKINSA
		There goes prom night.

	Kicker clicks at a gadget attached to his forearm.

				KICKER
		They're only class two. I can
		handle this. No problem.

				AZRAEL
		Not a problem?!

	Kay-Em injects him again.

				AZRAEL
		I'm missing a fucking arm heeeerrrr-
			(re:shot)
		Oh, that's dreamy.

	The lasers begin strategically slicing through hinges.

				JANESSA
		Okay rent-a-cop, do your shit.
		I gotta date tonight.

				KICKER
		Stand back!

	He pulls a gadget from his pack, punches in a series of buttons.

				YLLO
		We have to get these two back in one piece!

	Kay-Em turns to the frozen girl.

				KAY-EM 14
		Subject is critical. Needs nano stabilization
		immediately.

				YLLO
		Kicker! Do something!

				ADRIENNE
		Oh Gawd! I wish it would stop doing that.

	At her feet, Azrael's arm twitches spastically.

				AZRAEL
			(drugged up)
				That is soooo cool!

	Kicker cracks the door and tosses his gadget.

	KAFOOM!

				KICKER
				Come on!

	Kicker throws open the door and starts BLASTING! Yllo and the kids 
	follow him into the hall, the two stretches in tow. They disappear 
	around the bend - towards the exit.

	A beat then . . . screaming. They run back into view. Behind them - -

	CLINK, CLINK, CLINK, CLINK, CLINK.

	A dozen laser wielding spiders make chase! Some are old and rusty, other 
	slump over and short out, but those that work . . . work well.

	INT.  LONG CORIDOOR

	Kicker is running backwards, BLASTING with his weapon. Lasers FLASHING 
	all around our group. 


				KKINSA
		Have I told you guys how much I hate this class?

				KICKER
		We need another exit! I'll hold 'em off!
		Teach, find a way out!

				BOEMAN
		I'm on it!

				KICKER
		Sorry kid, leave this to the pros.

				BOEMAN
			(re: gadget)
		Left at the end of the hall!

	A laser strikes the body of Jason Voorhees, breaking off a chunk of ice.

				THORGAN
			(reading from device)
		They're not after us. Their sensors are
		locked in on . . . him!

	Thorgan points to JASON'S STRETCHER.

				KICKER
		Leave him behind!

				YLLO
		No! He's coming with us!

	They round a corner . . .

				BOEMAN
		Here. We're one meter from the surface!

				KICKER
		Then duck.

	CHA-CHUNK . . he cocks his grenade launcher and fires at the ceiling.

	KABLOOM!! Rocks and falling debris reveal the violent surface above.

				DELONGPREE
		It's too high!

	Kicker rolls around the corner and starts blasting!

				KICKER
		Make it happen!

				JANESSA
		They're just subclass B droids.
		I'm so not impressed.

				BOEMAN
		Stoney, you catch.

	Stonet leaps, grabs the lip and tosses his feet up and over in a very 
	acrobatic move.

	Boeman kneels, cups his hands to make a step. He begins tossing his 
	friends up to Stoney as Kicker makes war in the hall!

	Soon, Boeman and Kicker are the only two left.

				BOEMAN
		We're clear! Let's go!

	Boeman leaps up, grabs the lip and pulls himself to safety. 
	He spins around and holds his arm out for Kicker.

	Kicker leaps, grabs Boeman's hand. Boeman strains to pull him up as 
	spider's cover the floor below them, then -

	A spider crawls up Kicker's leg - a spike shoots out into Kicker's 
	thigh. He screams.

				KICKER
		They've got me! Let go!

				BOEMAN
		No!

	Boeman ROARS and pulls harder. Kicker's pack RIPS from his body - the 
	spiders falling with the pack.

	EXT. SURFACE - DAY

	The sand storm is raging on the surface. Kicker lands on top of Boeman.

				BOEMAN
		That wasn't so bad.

	Kicker bites the pin from a grenade, tosses it into the hole.

				KICKER
			(yells)
		This will be!

	The others dive for the ground as -  - 

	KAFOOM! A FIREBALL rises up out of the hole!

				THORGAN
		Nice touch.

				BOEMAN
		And you said high school was boring.

	Our team fights the winds and rushes up the ramp of the waiting shuttle.

	FAT LOU is waiting at the ramp. He looks at the two stretchers.

				FAT LOU
		Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .

				YLLO
		Just get us to the ship!

	Azrael stops in a panic!

				AZRAEL
		Oh shit I forgot my arm!

				ADRIENNE
		Here. Dumbass.

	She hands him the severed limb as they race up the ramp.

	The door closed, the SHUTTLE LIFTS OFF THE GROUND and soars into the 
	sky.

								CUT TO:

	EXT.  ORBIT AROUND OLD EARTH - LATE

	THE SHUTTLE maneauvers through the junk that now floats in orbit. Old 
	satellites, the front quarter of a Space Shuttle, etc.

	INT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT

	Navigating through the debris, FAT LOU grabs a radio mike.

				FAT LOU
		This is Beowulf approaching from
		sector fifteen.

	Through the front windshield we see - - 

	GRENDEL, a class IV Catamaran Transport. It looks like two huge 
	torpedoes attached by three thin walkways. Not new, but by no means old.

				BERNIE(V.O.)
		I've got you, Beowulf. Proceed with docking.
		And by the way, Brodski's pissed.

	INT.  DOCKING BAY

	The shuttle doors open revealing SERGEANT BRODSKI and six E-X GRUNTS 
	standing with weapons at the ready.

	As the group gather their equipment and begin to move the two 
	stretchers, Brodski stepsi n front of YLLO.

				BRODSKI
		What the hell were you thinking?

	YLLO ignores him, turns to his team.

				YLLO
		Get them in the lab!

				BRODSKI
		Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.

	The E-X Grunts step in front of kids.

				YLLO
			(to the grunts)
		Back off!

				YLLO
			(back to the kids)
		Get them to the labs . . . Now!

	The team moves through the Grunts.

				YLLO
		What the hell are you doing?

	Brodski looks down at the stretcher with the young woman's body on it.

				BRODSKI
		My god! This is way over your head, pal.
		We need to call some experts and . . .

				YLLO
		I am an expert!

				BRODSKI
		You're a teacher.

				YLLO
		Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me.
		She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab,
		she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking
		head!

				BRODSKI
		What if they're carrying? Did you even check?

				KAY-EM 14
		Subjects scan virus clean . . .

	Brodski attempts to shove Kay-Em out of his way . . . BUT she stands her 
	ground . . . grabs his crotch.

				KAY-EM 14
		Mmm, you like the rough stuff don't you, big boy?

	Brodski and Yllo look at Thorgan.

				BRODSKI AND YLLO
		Thorgan!!

				THORGAN
		Sorry . . . I'll fix her . . . I promise.

				BRODSKI
		How do you know that piece of cursed rock down
		there doesn't carry something metal tits can't
		detect?

				YLLO
		Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.

				BRODSKI
		Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.

				YLLO
		I don't give a shit. This one's prime for
		decryonization. We're brining her back.

				BRODSKI
		I still think we should send for a team of
		real scientists.

				YLLO
		I am a scientist you asshole! This could be
		the most important discovery in 400 years. Do
		you have any idea what a find like this could
		mean?

				BRODSKI
		Right now, I care only for the safety of this
		crew. You don't know anything about these two -

	The stretcher with JASON moves by them. Brodski looks down.

				BRODSKI
		Jesus what the hell is that?

				YLLO
		That's exactly what we need to find out.
		Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you
		where discovery is concerned. Now step aside.
		I have a medical emergency to deal with.

	Reluctantly, Brodski steps aside. As the kids follow, Azrael bumps into 
	DALLAS, one of the E-X GRUNTS. Azrael glares at him, brandishing the 
	severed limb.

				AZRAEL
		Watch it punk, I'm armed.

				DALLAS
		Punk?

	Dallas slaps Azrael across the back of the head as he passes.

				AZRAEL
		You'll pay for that.

	Dallas and the grunts laugh.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE

	FAT LOU and BERNIE, a synthetic pilot existing only from the waist up in 
	his pilot's chair, set course for home.

				BERNIE
		Gravitation nominal. Thrusters engaged.

				FAT LOU
			(into radio)
		Grendel to Grendel's mother, we are enroute.

				GRENDEL'S MOTHER(V.O.)
		Copy that, Grendel. Computer ovverides deployed.
		See you in two days.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  LABS

	Dark, quiet, until the lights glare on.

	LAB ONE doubles as a Medical Research center and Sick Bay. GLASS JARS 
	filled with some of the strangest creatures ever seen cover the back 
	wall.

	Yllo and the students bring the girl in. Their movements are hurried and 
	economical . . .but they're excited.

				YLLO
		Get her prepped for the soup.
			(to Adrienne)
		Take the other one to lab two.

				ADRIENNE
		Yllo, this is my find. My project.
		I want to be in here.

				YLLO
		I know, dear, but this is too big a 
		discovery. I need you to prep the second
		body.

				ADRIENNE
		But, I want . . .

				YLLO
		This is a discovery that we will all share.
		We have to work as  a team. Now go. Stoney
		go with her.

	Thorgan and Delongpre lift the Girl onto the rejuvenation table.

	Stoney whispers something to Kkinsa before he exits with Adrienne.

	Kkkinsa nods and wheels a huge SCANNING MACHING over to the Girl. She 
	starts the scan as Delongpree and Thorgan cut the clothes off their 
	"find".

				THORGAN
		Have I told you guys how much I love this class?

	Delongpree brushes some of the melting crystals from her face.

				DELONGPREE
		She's beautiful . . .

	Thorgan cuts her shirt off.

				THORGAN
		Damn! Talk about your hard nipples.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Adrienne and Stoney push Jason into the lab.

	LAB TWO is smaller and less high-tech than LAB one. They shove JASON'S 
	body onto the EXAM TABLE. 

				ADRIENNE
		Fucking Yllo! Thinks he can push me aside.
		This is my find!

	She removes chucks of ice from JASON'S FACE.

				STONEY
		You know even though we both found this guy ,
		I'll let you take the credits. You can take it 
		from here.

				ADRIENNE
		Oh thanks . . . fine go. It's just another
		dissection. You'll only get in my way.

				STONEY
		Cool. Besides, you're into this shit.

	Stoney leaves Adrienne alone with Jason . . . and he is THAWING.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Yllo walks around the room, overseeing all the action. He's excited and 
	cocky.

				YLLO
		Hands on training is rare. You should consider
		yourself lucky.

				AZRAEL
		Lucky?!

	Azrael sits in a large machine. This is . . .

	The NANO-TECH 2000. It can repair non-fatal injuries with the use of 
	Nano-Technology. 

	Azrael is scanned by the NT-2000 and so is his injury. It goes into 
	action as articulated mechanics begin to re-attach his arm.

				AZRAEL
		Another hour and I'd have lost
		the arm.

				JANESSA
		Oh, was that the hand you beat off with?

				AZRAEL
		I better get extra credit for this shit.

				YLLO
		Delongpree, Status. How you doing?

	Delongpree cuts her underpants from her body and tosses them over his 
	shoulder.

				DELONGPREE
			(swallows hard)
		I'm Okay.

				STONEY
		Well she's definitely a blond.

				JANESSA
		Oh that's scientific.

				DELONGPREE
		You think all girls from the past
		looked this good?

				JANESSA
		She's not that great.

				THORGAN
		400 years . . . I bet she'll be horny.

				YLLO
		Okay, people, we need to Learn everything
		there is to learn about our two guests. And
		if all goes well, I'll mention each one of
		you when I make my nobel prize speech.

				DELONGPREE
			(underbreath)
		Yeah, right.

	Delongpre presses a button on the table. The edges of the table RISE UP 
	to create a clear dome around the table. A hot gel-like substance shoots 
	out of small tubes. The FROZEN BODY is covered in the NANO-GEL.

	Thorgan checks a monitor.

				THORGAN
		Everything looks good.

	Yllo smiles - gushing self-satisfaction.

				YLLO
		Turn up the heat.

	Adrienne is wearing a metal eyepiece while staring at a computer screen. 
	No hands. 

				ADRIENNE
		Done. Crystallization remains
		seventeen percent.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Adrienne scans Jason with a machine identical to the one Kkinsa was 
	using in LAB ONE.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Crystallization at sixty percent
		Subject classification . . . deformity.

				ADRIENNE
		Put it on the screen.

	A monitor lights up with a scan of Jason's body. The internal organs are 
	distorted and bloated. She keys into the next lab. 

	Back to lab one.

				ADRIENNE(V.O.)
			(over speaker)
		Guys, check out beef-cakes scan.

	Jason's 3-D scan appears on one of the big monitors.

				ADRIENNE(V.O.)
		Look at the brain.

	Within Jason's skull is a brain the size of a golf-ball.

				JANESSA
		It's just like Thorgan's.
		What do you think this means?

	Thorgan grabs his crotch.

				THORGAN
		This is what it means right here.

				JANESSA
		Small brains make your balls itch?

				DELONGPRE
		And what's with the headgear?

				KAY-EM 14
		The mask is an artifact from a
		sport outlawed in twenty-twelve.

				BOEMAN
		Hockey.

				KAY-EM 14
		A medieval sport where two teams
		club one another with elongated
		sticks. Very sexy.

				YLLO
		What do you expect from a culture that
		sucked its planet dry of resources.

	She eyes Stoney. He smiles knowingly.

				KKINSA
		This bores me.

				DELONGPRE
		She's red. Body temp 98.6. This
		is so cool.

				YLLO
		Prep defib and start the cell 
		reconstruction.

	KAY-EM 14 presses a series of buttons. A long needle punctures the 
	GIRL'S NECK. Jason's scan is replaced by the girl's. We see 
	Nanotechnology going to work replacing her wounds and damaged cells.

				THORGAN
		Cool!

	Kkinsa and Stoney back out of the room unnoticed.

				YLLO
		Is she stable?

				KAY-EM 14
		Subject is stable and cell
		reconstruction has begun.

				DELONGPRE
		Now what?

				YLLO
		We wait. I need about fifteen.
		Call me if there are any changes.
		If she farts I want a full report.

				AZRAEL
		Don't I deserve a sick day or some
		shit like that?

	Yllo exits.
								CUT TO:

	INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

	The door swishes open. Stoney enters with Kkinsa close behind. Kkinsa 
	raises her hand.

				KKINSA
		Adrienne?! Of all people!

				STONEY
		You're jealous.

	Stoney moves back. Kkinsa moves close hand raises above her head.

				KKINSA
		Adrienne?!

				STONEY
		It's over between us. You're the
		one I want.

	Kkinsa grabs the back of her shirt and pulls it over her head.

				KKINSA
		Bed!

	A bed slides out from the wall, hitting Stoney in the back of the legs, 
	causing him to fall on the bed. Kkinsa straddles him. Stoney grabs her. 
	The two fall into a feverish kiss.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Adrienne is prepping various medical tools. JASON'S BODY is laying on an 
	autopsy table. Steam rises from his body as thick ooze drips from his 
	thawing flesh.

	She turns on a computer monitor.

				ADRIENNE 
		Prepare organ vats.

	Two metal sinks hiss as liquid nitrogen flows.

				ADRIENNE
		Okay big boy . . . 

	She picks up a long, sharp chrome tool and walks over to Jason's body.

				ADRIENNE
			(continuing)
		. . . let's see what you're made of.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  YLLO'S CABIN

	Yllo enters and approaches a computer console. The door behind him 
	opens. Janessa enters.

				JANESSA
		All this science shit, makes me horny.
			(removes her shirt)
		Take off your cloths, we don't have much
		time.

	She drops her shirt to the floor. Yllo retrieves it, hands it back.

				JANESSA
		You're quicker than usual.

				YLLO
		Later.

				JANESSA
		You prefer an apple?

	He forces her into the hall, closes the door, locks it. He returns to 
	the console.

				YLLO
			(to console)
		Secure line. Perez, Joshua,
		Solaras Space Lab. Connect.

	EXT.   SOLARAS SPACE LAB - EST.

	A huge cylindrical ship, floats quietly. We hear a BEEPING sound.

	INT.   SOLARAS SPACE LAB - PEREZ QUARTERS

	Joshua Perez rolls over, clicks on a light. He fumbles for a button, 
	presses it. A wall monitor lights up revealing Yllo's face.

	INTERCUT AS NEEDED

				PEREZ
		You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?

				YLLO
		We just left old Earth. You'll never believe
		what we found.

	Yllo inserts a disk into the console.

				YLLO
		I'm sending you the files.

				PEREZ
			(testy)
		Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient
		Farrari . . .

		YLLO
		Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels.
		See what kind of payday we're looking at.

				PEREZ
			(begins download)
		Alright, I'm . . .
			(reacts to file)
		No way . . . is this a joke?

	Yllo smiles.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Adrienne leans over JASON'S THAWING body. Oozing goo drips from the 
	slab.

	She is inches away from his steaming mask. She taps it with her tool.

	She begins working at the straps of the mask, cutting the overgrown 
	flesh away.

	INT.  YLLO'S CABIN

	Yllo studies a monitor. On screen: a document entitled, EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS 
	OF DISCOVERY. He talks on the secure line.

				YLLO
		Hypothetically, how much are we talking?

				PEREZ(V.O.)
		If you're for real, you're looking at a million
		credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include
		touring and guest lectures. When can you get them
		here?

				YLLO
		I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?

				PEREZ(V.O.)
		See you then . . . doctor.

	Yllo's face glows with thoughts of fame and fortune.

					QUICK CUT TO:

	INT.  HALL OUTSIDE YLLO'S QUARTERS

	Janessa has hooked up a small device to the door. She's heard every 
	word.

	INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

	Kkinsa rips off Stoney's shirt. Stoney grab her and rolls on top of her.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	CLOSE ON JASON'S HAND - it curls, the frozen joints CRACKLE.

	Adrienne turns from Jason's mask. A large wad of goo hits the floor. She 
	turns back to her work. Slicing flesh away from the mask.

	INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

	Stoney and Kkinsa kiss passionately as they wrestle to get each other's 
	pants off.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Adrienne tries to pry the Mask off . . . but it holds firm.

	She stick s a long sharp tool into an eye hole. We hear disgusting 
	noises as she probes JASON'S EYE SOCKET.

	She removes the tool, and on the end is Jason's eye!

	Holding it close she looks at it. It is bloated and distorted. She drops 
	it in a specimen jar and takes it over to her work station.

	INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

	Kkinsa rolls on top of Stoney. She holds his arms down as she whispers 
	in his ear.

				KKINSA
		How bad do you want it?

	Stoney gets his arms free and rolls on top of her.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	JASON'S LEG JERKS!

	Adrienne turns again, then approaches.

				ADRIENNE
		Interesting. Record. Thawing has
		caused possible muscle spasms.

	She frowns at the disgusting ooze. A mixture of swamp waters, blood, and 
	other thawing bodily fluids, puddle around Jason's body.

	She moves back to her work station and picks up JASON'S BLOATED EYE. She 
	takes out an autopsy laser and cuts through the center of the eye.

	The laser slices through the fatty tissue as thick black goop drips out 
	of the eye. Adrienne stares into a microscope. This is all very 
	interesting.

	INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

	Stoney lies on top of Kkinsa.

				KKINSA
		Yes . . . yes . . . that's it!

	. . . a moment, then both GASP as he enters her.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	JASON sits up!

	CLOSE on ADRIENNE as she studies the dripping eye. She puts the laser 
	down and turns to the slab and freezes.

	JASON IS GONE!

	She spins around only to find Jason standing behind her. He grabs her by 
	the throat! She can't scream. She kicks wildly as he studies her.

					QUICK CUT TO:

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Delongpre, Boemen, Kay-Em 14 and Thorgan wait and watch girl in the 
	NANO-GEL. Thorgan is getting impatient. He can't find something.

				THORGAN
		Anybody seen the reticulator?

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Adrienne is thrown into a work light. The room goes dark. 

	INT.  LAB ONE

				DELONGPRE
		Try next door, there was one there
		yesterday.

	Thorgan exits.

	INT.  LAB TWO'S OBSERVATION ROOM

	The lights go. Thorgan looks around. Through the thick glass, where 
	JASON is killing Adrienne, is blackness.

				THORGAN
		Wakey wakey love birds . . . Yllo's
		gonna be pissed if he catches you fooling
		around instead of working.

	Thorgan roots through a drawer, his back to the glass.

	ANTE ROOM

	Through the glass beside him we see Adrienne screaming. But NO SOUND. 
	All rooms are air tight. Her head is smashed on the glass!

	Still screaming, her face recedes back into the darkness as Thorgan 
	looks over his shoulder.

				THORGAN
		Bye, lovebirds . . . Stoney, you dog.

	He exits.

	BACK TO JASON

	As he - -

	DUNKS Adrienne's head INTO ONE OF THE METAL SINKS. Her body goes limp. He 
	pulls her head up and stares at her frozen head, eyes open, mouth locked 
	in a scream.

	He thumps the head against a wall. IT SHATTERS! Jason drops the body 
	with a thud then turns to the - -

	DISSECTION TOOLS. He chooses a long silver cleaver.

	JASON'S BACK!

	EXT.  LAB ONE CORRIDOR

	Jason walks into the corridor from LAB TWO, steam still rising from his 
	cold body. He heads away from LAB ONE as soon as he's out of sight, YLLO 
	appears.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Delongpre wakes as Yllo enters.

				YLLO
		All right, lets do this. Thorgan
		begin the Defib program, Delongpre,
		ready the drainage units. Boerman get the
		others in here.

	Boeman grabs a wall mike.

	INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

	Kkinsa straddles Stoney.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		We've got a heartbeat!

	Her back arches in ecstasy.

				KKINSA
		No shit, we've got a heart beat!

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Stoney, you copy? She's awake.
		You coming?

				STONEY
		Hell yeah I'm coming!

				KKINSA
		No . . . not yet!

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Yes, right now!

				STONEY
		YES !!!

				KKINSA
		NO!!! NO!!! NO!!! YES!!!

				STONEY
		YES!!!!!!

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Stoney, put your pants on and get
		your ass down here!

	They jump up grab their clothes and rush to the door. Stoney hits the 
	door release and the door SWISHES open revealing - -

	JASON VOORHEES!

	Standing in the hall. He swings the silver cleaver.

	Stoney sidesteps as Kkinsa SCREAMS. Stoney SLAMS his palm into the door 
	panel. The door SWISHES to close but Jason's hand reaches out and stops 
	it.

	ENGINES WINE as JASON STRUGGLES to force the door open.

	Stoney keeps POUNDING the panel, trying to make the door close but 
	Jason's too strong!

	Jason grabs Stoney by the arm, jerks him into the doorway and releases 
	the door.

	The door closes! Splitting Stoney from forehead to crotch!

	Splashed with blood, Kkinsa falls to the floor cowering . . .
	mumbling nonsensically. 

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Yllo, Janessa, Thorgan, Boemen and Delongpre anxiously huddle around the 
	Frozen Girl's body. Probes dangle in the gel.

				YLLO
		It's time.

				DELONGPRE
		What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?

				YLLO
		I've waited long enough.
		Kay . . . you know what to do.

	Kay presses buttons. We hear the whine of something powering up . . .

	Brodski enters the lab.

				YLLO
		What the hell are you doing?

				BRODSKI
		My job.

				YLLO
		Fine, just stay out of my way.
			(turns to Kay)
		Hit it. 

	An electrical noise flares THE SCREEN TO WHITE:

								SMASH CUT TO:

	INT.  DARK CORRIDOR

	OUR VIEW FROM A JERKY POV

	Running, freshly killed bodies at our feet. HEAVY BREATHING.

	Small fists beat against a door.

				GIRL'S VOICE
		Mom! Dad! It's loose! He's loose!

	The door swishes open revealing the dead bodies of a couple in their 
	forties.

	CLOSE ON THE GIRL

	We recognize her as the frozen girl. Her name, RIZZO (18), pretty.
	She screams. Turns.

	HER POV

	Standing at the end of the corridor, back lit and ominous is JASON 
	VOORHEES! He marches towards her.

	She runs. Snatches a headset from a wall mount.

				RIZZO
		Help me! Anyone! Somebody help me!

	STATIC from the radio. Jason closing.

	She reaches down and grabs a shot gun from a dead Security Guard. Chick-
	chick. KABLAM!

	Jason keeps coming.

	She runs.

	As she rounds a corner, we  see - -

	CRYOGENICS LAB

	She opens the door and enters the cold room. Slips on the wet frozen 
	ground, nearly falls.

	ON JASON as he rounds the corner, sees the open door.

	INT.   CRYO LAB

	Jason enters, his machete held ready. He stares at the Huge Cryo unit. 
	Door open. Otherwise the room is empty.

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		Hey!

	Jason turns. Rizzo is standing in the hall, the shotgun ready.

				RIZZO
		You son of a bitch!

	KABLAM! Jason slides backwards on the slick floor.

	KABLAM! Further, he nearly falls. 

	KABLAM! He stumbles, falls backwards into the cryo-unit.

	Rizzo slams her palm onto a console, the Cryo-unit door closes, JASON 
	INSIDE.

	RIZZO tosses the gun to the floor and types on a keypad.

	Steam HISSES, engines hum to life. The Cryo-Unit, Bucks violently.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Cryo-Unit activated.

	Slowly the unit goes silent, still. Rizzo stares at it, approaches 
	slowly, staring at the fogging glass -


	KA-CHING!

	The MACHETE BURSTS THROUGH THE GLASS, slicing into Rizzo's shoulder!

	ALARMS SOUND. The cryo lab's main door SLAMS shut.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Cryo-Unit leak. Lock down in progress.
		Security measures on line.

				RIZZO
		Nooooooo!

	She rushes toward the door. It won't budge.

				RIZZO
		Somebody! No!

	CHSHSHSHSHSH!

	Gas filters into the room from the leak in the Cryo-Unit.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Subject in computer unit has reached
		full incubation.

	Rizzo begins to fade. She stumbles.

				RIZZO
		No . . . 

	Cryo gas rolls along the floor . . .

	As blood pours from her wound, she reaches her bloody hand to the glass 
	window and draws -

	A SKULL AND CROSSBONES.

	-then passes out.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	RIZZO'S EYES pop open. She gasps for breath. Coughing and splitting the 
	Gel-like substance. She's sitting in a foot of gel, naked; Yllo, Brodski 
	and the kids around her.

				THORGAN
		That one did it!

	Yllo moves close to Rizzo.

				YLLO
		We should expect a moment of
		disorientation.

	WHAM! Rizzo punches Yllo in the nose.

				DELONGPRE
		Spunky . . .

				YLLO
		She broke my fucking nose!

				KAY-EM 14
		Again proving that your ancestors were savages.

				BRODSKI
		I like her already.

				KAY-EM 14
		Live signs full strength. Heart rate above normal - 

	Rizzo's disoriented, confused. Gel slops all around her.

				RIZZO
		Where..? Who . . .?
			(shock)
		I'm alive. You brought me back.

				YLLO
			(rubbing his nose)
		Obviously so.

	Rizzo looks down at her body, gel dripping off her naked flesh.

				RIZZO
		What the hell is this shit?

	Delongpre gives her a blanket. She covers herself.

				RIZZO
		How did I get here, how did you bring me back?

				YLLO
		Nanotechnology.

				RIZZO
		Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.

				YLLO
		We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.

				RIZZO
		30? How long was I out?

	Rizzo finally takes a good look at where she is. Something is very wrong 
	in her world.

				YLLO
		The year is 2455. You've been frozen
		for the past four hundred years.

	Rizzo gasps -- a shocking revelation.

				YLLO
		Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some 
		questions...

				RIZZO
		JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!

				THORGAN
		The hockey player? He a friend of yours?

				RIZZO
		Hockey player? He's not a ...

				THORGAN
		He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!

				RIZZO
		Old Earth?

				YLLO
		We need to do some tests...I'd like to ask you a
		few questions.

				RIZZO
		But...I...400 years?

				YLLO
		That's right, now if you could...

	Delongpre frowns at Yllo and moves to Rizzo.

				DELONGPRE
		It can wait. Let's get you cleaned up.

	Delongpre helps Rizzo off the table.

				YLLO
		Wait a minute...I need...

				BRODSKI
		Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time.

				DELONGPRE
		Come on.

	INT.  LAB FOUR

	Rizzo stands at a small window looking out into space. Cleaned up she is 
	quite beautiful.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Rizzo?

	Rizzo is startled. She looks around.

				RIZZO
		Yeah?

	Delongpre comes through the door with a plate of food. 

				DELONGPRE
		I thought that after 400 hundred years,
		you just might have a little bit of an appetite.

	He puts the food on a small table and moves to the window.

				DELONGPRE
		You're on Grendel, a class IV Catamaran 
		transport.
		It's basically a school bus. We're on our way 
		back to Earth II.
		It's finals week.

	She turns back to the window.

				RIZZO
		You're telling me I'm a friggen class project?

	Delongpre flinches, expecting to be hit.

				DELONGPRE
			(a beat)
		Sort of. I mean, no, not really ...

	She collapses onto the bed.

				DELONGPRE
		I'll give you a moment alone. Do you
		want me to come get you when we start
		the dissection?

	Rizzo shrugs. She's lost everyone and everything. She's lot 400 years.

	Delongpre backs out of the room, closing the door behind him.

	Rizzo stares at the pile of her old clothes. She reaches into the pocket 
	of her tattered jacket and removes a set of keys. The key chain holds a 
	picture...a picture of her parents. She sits on the bed and starts to cry.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	As Delongpre enters all eyes turn to him.

				YLLO
		Well?

				DELONGPRE
		She needs a little time.

				YLLO
		More time...shit, she's had 400 years...

	Yllo laughs at his own joke.

				DELONGPRE
		That's really funny.

				YLLO
		I'd want her statements before we reach porch.
		Jesus, women.

				DELONGPRE
		Yeah, like you'd be a rock after everything
		she went through?

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		Dissection?

	Theyturn. Rizzo approaches Delongpre and Yllo.

				RIZZO
		Jason? He's on this ship?!

				YLLO
		Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in
		400 years...except for you, of course. Look if 
		you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking
		and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the
		publicity.

				RIZZO
			(glares)
		Are you finished?

	Yllo nods then --

	WHAM!

	Rizzo punches him again.

				YLLO
		God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!

				DELONGPRE
		Oh I like her a lot.

				BRODSKI
		I'm with you kid.

				RIZZO
		Where is he?

				BRODSKI
			(points)
		Lab two, relax. What's the matter?
		He's dead.

				RIZZO
		No, you're dead! You're all dead!

	She shoves Delongpre out of the way and out the door.

	INT.  LAB TWO - MOMENTS LATER

	The others enter to find Rizzo leaning over Adrienne's headless body.

				YLLO
		Jesus!

				JANESSA
		Oh my God! Adrienne?

				THORGAN
		What have you done?

				RIZZO
		What have I done?! Idiots.

	Thorgan throws up.

		BOEMAN
			(into a mike)
		Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an
		emergency!

				DELONGPRE
		Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?

				RIZZO
		I'll tell you where he is. He's walking
		around this ship, killing anything that
		moves.

				JANESSA
		Maybe she tripped.

	Brodski and Kicker burst into Lab Two, they react to the carnage.

				BRODSKI
		Jesus, God!

				KICKER
		Oh man, what the hell happened?

				RIZZO
		Jason! Can't you see? He did this.

				YLLO
		Impossible! He was dead before he entered
		Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could
		be alive.

				RIZZO
		I didn't say he was alive.

	There's nothing Azrael can do. He's a goner. Then --

	FZZT! A blast from elsewhere DISINTERGRATES THE CREATURE. MOVE TO 
	REVEAL--

	DALLAS, the grunt Azreael had words with earlier.

				DALLAS
		That's nine to four, geek-boy.

				AZRAEL
		You got lucky.

				DALLAS
		You got lucky. I could have waited until he
		ate your head.

				AZRAEL
		Speaking of which, duck!

	Dallas hits the deck as Azrael FIRES, disintegrating another. Beyond it 
	lunge a half dozen more.  Dallas and Azrael scramble to their feet,
	take aim, when --

	ONE OF THE ALIENS IS CUT IN HALF!

	GREEN GOO squirts from its body.

				AZRAEL
		What the?!

	JASON VOORHEES 

	SLASHES THROUGH another alien, splitting it down the middle.
	Then another.

				DALLAS
		He's good.

	Azrael smiles knowingly. He takes aim and lets loose a blast at Jason. 
	Aliens scatter as the blasts hits Jason dead on. Dallas joins in
	unloading on the hulinking terror.

	THeir assault has no effect on Jason whatsoever.

				DALLAS
		That sucks. Why won't he go down?

				AZRAEL
		Pause play.

	Suddenly the aliens freeze in place. Jason stares at them, then turns to 
	Dallas and Azrael.

				DALLAS
		He's not part of the program.

				AZRAEL
		Hey cool. They brought ancient
		hockey guy back to life.

	Jason walks up to them. Titls his head like a dog hearing a high-pitched 
	whistle.

	Why aren't they running.

				AZRAEL
		Hey! We're playing a game here.
		Get off the court!

	Jason raises his silver blade high.

				DALLAS
		No, we're playing a game...not you numbnuts...

	SLASH! The blade slices through Azrael's shoulder to the bottom of his 
	rib cage. Blood spurts
	as his right side pulls away from his body. Azrael does not seem hurt, 
	only pissed.

				AZRAEL
		Asshole that does not count as a kill.

				DALLAS
		Yes it does.

				AZRAEL
		Oh, come on!

	JASON is confused. He spins and slashed taking Dallas' head clean off. 
	The head falls to the ground, then Dallas speaks.

				DALLAS
		Okay, enough of this shit.

				AZRAEL
		Alright, asshole.

	The sound of an ENGINE SHUTTING DOWN.

	Jason finds himself standing alone on a huge open court, all white, 
	sterile.

	No creatures, no Dallas or Azrael. A both ends of the white garganuan 
	room we see a small tinted glass.

	Azrael's voice booms over a loud speaker.

				AZRAEL(V.O.)
		Clear off the court, asshole.

	INT.  BOOTH ONE

	Azrael sits before a huge console wearing a virtual reality suit.

	INT.  BOOTH TWO

	Dallas is in his own suit from the opposite booth.

				DALLAS
		I don't have all day, kid.

				AZRAEL
		Yeah yeah I better call the labs,
		see what the hell is going on.

	Jason stares at the tinted glass of Azrael's booth.

				AZRAEL
			(into mike)
		Lab...this is AZ in the game grid.
		Your guy got out and runined our game.

	INTERCUT AS NECESSARY:

	INT   LAB TWO

	The reaction to the broadcast.

				YLLO
		Azrael can you repeat that?

				RIZZO
		Get him out of there!

				AZRAEL
			(into mike)
		I said the guy in the mask is in here
		ruining our game.

	Jason starts to close in on Azrael's pod.

				AZRAEL
			(continuing)
		Send someone to the grid to pick
		him up. He looks lost.

				YLLO
		That's impossible.

				RIZZO
		I told you! Get them out of there!
			(grabs mike)
		Get out of there! Get out of there now!

				AZRAEL
			(into mike)
		All right fine, we'll head back--

	Suddenly, JASON shoves his fist through the glass.

				DALLAS
		Jesus!

	The sounds of Azrael's DEATH broadcast over the lab.

	When Jason retrieves his hand, he holds a bloody mass of Azrael's 
	insides.

	IN THE LAB, Brodski takes charge.

				BRODSKI
		Dallas! That you? Come back!

				DALLAS
			(into mike)
		Sarge! Get the fuck down here!
		We got a real shitstorm in the --

	DALLAS fights to get out of his virtual reality suit and get himself 
	into combat mode...BUT...

	JASON hears the movement. Turns, flings his silver blade.

	It flies across the room, throught the glass and impales Dallas' throat 
	to his chair.

	The blade shrots out the electronics in the grid and plunges the room to 
	black.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	As the connection goes to static.

				BRODSKI
			(into mike)
		Dallas?! Dallas?! Do you copy?

	Nothing. Finally...

				RIZZO
		He's dead. They're both dead. You
		don't understand what is on this ship.
		This is a being that kills. That's what
		he does. That's all he does. And he is very
		good at it.

				BRODSKI
		Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell
		me what the hell is going on!

	She gets up and heads for the door.

				DELONGPRE
		Where are you going?

				RIZZO
		We have to get off this ship.

	Yllo who has been losing control takes on the lead again.

				YLLO
		That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.

				RIZZO
		Why don't you get it? He's going to kill
		us all!

				BRODSKI
		I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever
		your ancient hockey player can throw at us.

				RIZZO
		Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship...
		and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the
		only way you're going to live.

				DELONGPRE
		You just need to relax. Rizzo ti's the future.
		We have soldiers on board, E-X Grunts, the baddest of
		the bad...and their weapons? I'm sure are slightly more
		advanced than what you're used to.

				RIZZO
		I hope so.

	EXT.  GAME GRID CORRIDOR

	Sven and Kicker approach the door. Casually, weapons slung low. The 
	doors hiss open, the black maw of the game grid on the other side.

				KICKER
		Damn. Are they playing?

				SVEN
		Dallas?! Azrael!

	Their combat sense perks up a bit. Something's not right. They turn on 
	their lights and ready their weapons.

	INT.  GAME GRID

	WIDE:  Hard beams of light search for anything.

	Sven, as his beam hits Azrael's pod.

				SVEN
		Oh shit.

	From inside pod as Sven and Kicker approach. THe blood splattered inside
	 the glass glows in the throws of their lights.

	Kicker breaks off to inspect the other POD Sven tries to hold down his 
	lunch.

				SVEN
		Sarge, this is bad. The kid's
		His guts are ripped out.

				BRODSKI
			(over radio)
		Dead?

				SVEN
		Oh yeah.

	Kicker reaches the other POD. the darkness looms behind him as he finds
	his friend.
				KICKER
			(into radio)
		Sarge, this is Kicker. Dallas got
		it to. Real slice and dice. What
		should we do?

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Everyone is in shock except Brodski...he's a pro.

				BRODSKI
		Report to weapons. We're going
		on a hunt.

	KICKER IN THE GRID

				KICKER
		Roger that.
			(to himself)
		Time to kick some ass!

	From behind him a shape materializes. A hand reaches out of the 
	darkness.

	KICKER JUMPS! Spins around with his weapon at the ready!

	IT'S SVEN!

				SVEN
		Sorry!

				KICKER
		Don't friggen do that!

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Brodski is in assault mode.

				BRODSKI
		Yllo, what's your head count?

				YLLO
		Looks like we're missing two.
		Stone and Kkinsa.

				JANESSA
		You know, Stoney's done everyone
		on this trip but me..what's up with that?

	Brodski scans the room - a tactical assessment.

				BRODSKI
		This place should be safe. Get them
		back here. I don't want to be hunting
		around and kill one of your kids by accident.
		As much as I've dreamed of doing that.

	Brodski goes to Rizzo while Yllo buzzes Stoney's cabin.

				BRODSKI
		I need to know what you know about this guy.

				RIZZO
		Don't go out there. You can't win.
		We need to get off this ship. That's
		all there is to it.

				BRODSKI
		Not an option. I'm going to hunt this
		son of a bitch down.

	Rizzo shakes her head. She can't get through to this guy.

				BRODSKI
		I've been a grunt for fifteen years.
		There's not a problem I can't fix with
		enough ammunition.

	Yllo is getting no response.

				YLLO
		Stoney! Stoney if you can hear me,
		get your ass down to the lab immediately!
			(beat)
		I'm going to see if I can find them.

	Yllo opens the door and Kkinsa is there! Half-naked, covered in blood. 
	Janessa SCREAMS and the others gasp.

	Kkinsa falls to the floor..whimpering, in shock. Boeman rushes over
	to her with a blanket.

				KKINSA
		Sstoney's dead!

	They all look to each other, searching for what to say or do...Rizzo 
	puts her head in her hands...not again.

	INT.  CORRIDOR

	Brodski double-checks his sidearm as Yllo follows him down the hall.

				YLLO
		ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab,
		couple of hours no more. Let them take a
		look at our friends.

				BRODSKI
		Not a chance.

				YLLO
		JUst don't go in there half cocked.
		You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and
		ask questions later.

				BRODSKI
		You got that right.

	They arrive at the door of the WEAPONS ROOM.

				YLLO
		This thing could be worth a great deal....
		scientifically...not to mention what the fat cats
		on Earth II would pay for it! Look, I'll split it with
		you 50/50...

	The door opens. The E-X Grunts are all there. Weapons in a rack on one 
	wall. They are in various states of battle dresss. Yllo follows Brodski in. 
	Brodski turns and faces him, his men behind.

				BRODSKI
		You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch!
		If that...that thing is out there, it's
		dead! You got it!!!

				KICKER
		Fuckin A...

				BRODSKI
		Now get out of our way...get back to the
		lab and baby sit your snot nosed brats...
		we've got a job to do!

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Yllo enters pissed off. The others are standing around not sure what to 
	do.

				YLLO
		That bastard! Boemen turn on the
		tracking monitors.

	Rizzo walks over to Kay-em 14. Thorgon is working on her.

				RIZZO
		Robot huh?

				KAY-EM 14
		Kay-em 14.

				RIZZO
		Barbie from hell...

				KAY-EM 14
		Cybernetics science droid,
		fluent in over six...

				RIZZO
		Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS,
		now how about you help me get
		out of this coffin, Barbie...

				KAY-EM 14
		I'm afraid I cannot assist.

	Rizzo is very frustrated.

				RIZZO
		I'm surrounded by idiots.

				KAY-EM 14
		You need to get laid!

	Thorgon looks up from his work.

				THORGON
		Sorry, I'm working on it.

				DELONGPRE
		Are all twenty-first century girls like you?

				RIZZO
		He'll kill us all. You know that, don't you?

	AN ALARM SOUNDS.

				THORGON
			(re:monitor)
		There's been an unauthorized entrance to the
		Cargo Bay.

				BRODSKI
		Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to
		Lab two and cover out backs.

				YLLO
			(into the mic)
		At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?

				BRODSKI (v.o.)
		I'll try.

								CUT TO:
	INT. CARGO DOOR - MIDSHIP

	kicker, sven, CONDOR, BRIGGS, and GEKO are locked and loaded. Dressed in 
	full armor,
	packing massive high tech weaponry, they are a sight to see. Jason may 
	have met his
	match.

				BRODSKI
		Alright, the teach requests we take this guy
		out at the knees. I say shoot to kill.

	The boys fidget with excitment. Bout time they see some action.

				BRODSKI
		So after you've killed him, put one in his knee
		so we can say we tried.

	The men LAUGH and high five.

				BRODSKI
		Go to infrared, stay in radio contact.
			(into headset)
		Teach you there?

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Yllo walks in and sits at a bank of monitors. Through one, we see the 
	team standing at the cargo doors.

				YLLO
		Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.

				BRODSKI(V.O.)
		You just keep an eye out.

				YLLO
		Yeah yeah. Got it.

	Yllo removes his head set and quickly turns to a separate console. He 
	has his own agenda.

	INT.  CARGO DOOR - MIDSHIP

				BRODSKI
		Let's move out.

	The doors HISS open.

	INT. CARGO BAY

	A massive room. Boxes stacked hihg, some to the ceilin,g creating a 
	maze.

				BRODSKI
		Two teams, Port, starboard.

	They split up.

	INT. LAB ONE

	The kids are standing at a schematic of the ship. Several small blips 
	are entering the cargo area.

				BRODSKI(V.O.)
		Kicker, anything?

				KICKER(V.O.)
		Negative.

	Rizzo stands over Thorgan to see the monitor.

				THORGAN
		Each blip represents a trained killer.
		It's men like that fought off the pirates
		on Earth II, battled Jauntuns on the solar 
		moons...

	For the moment, Rizzo looks distantly hopeful.

				RIZZO
		So, you're saying thse guys have like,
		lasers and stuff? They could hack him
		to pieces?

				THORGAN
		Exactly.

	INT.  CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE

	Briggs and Geko move side by side. Condor brings up the rear. Suddenly 
	he is jerked out
	of view. 

	CLOSE ON CONDOR'S FACE, jason's hand around his throat. SNAP. The eyes 
	go dead, the neck broken.

	INT. LAB ONE

	Rizzo sees something. Her hopes fade.

				RIZZO
		WHAT'S IT MEAN WHEN ONE OF YOUR BLIPS 
	DISAPPEARS?

	All eyes turn to the schematic as one of the blips FLICKERS and FADES.

				KAY-EM 14
		E-x Grunt Condor has flatlined.

				BOEMAN
			(into mic)
		Sergeant, this is Boemen...

	INT.  CARGO BAY - STARBOARD

	Sergeant Brodski stops.

				BOEMAN(v.o.)
		You've lost Condor.

				BRODSKI
		Briggs, Geko, talk to me!

	INT.  CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE

	Briggs and Geko stare at each other.

				BRIGGS
		He was...he was right here!

	BACK TO BRODSKI

				BRODSKI
		DAMNIT to hell! We're coming to you!

	INT.  LAB ONE 

	A BLIP flashes for a second on the screen.

				THORGAN
		You see that?

				BOEMAN
		Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed
		fuselage.

	INT. CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE

				BRIGGS
		Got it.

	BRIGGS and GEKO split up, moving around a large metallic tank.

	BRIGGS INFARED POV

	Gun ready, he moves around the crated fuselage slowly.

				BRIGGS
		I don't see anything.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	The blip flashes again.

	INT.  CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		He's right there! In front of you!

	INFARRED POV reveal GEKO moving toward him.

				BRIGGS
		That's GEKO. mAYBE you kids should
		stay out of this.

	Briggs removes his gogles only to find Jason standing before him, 
	holding Geko's body...impaled
	onto his silver blade.

	BRIGGS fires...screams.

	INT.  LAB ONE

				BRIGGS(V.O.)
		He doesn't show up on...

	PAINFUL GURGLES then two more blips disappear.

				THORGAN
			(turns)
		Jesus, is this what it was like on your...

	Rizzo is cowering on the floor, her hands over her ears. She's sweating, 
	convulsing.

				BOEMAN
		Sergeant, you've lost two more men!

	INT. CARGO BAy - PORTSIDE

	Brodski and his remaining men double-time-it to the slaughter. Briggs 
	and Geko lie dEAD
	AT THEIR FEET.

				KICKER
		Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?

				BRODSKI
		Teach! Where the hell are you?!
		Where's our visuals?!!

	INT. LAB TWO

	Yllo is talking on  aseparate mike. Unwaakre of the slaughteri n the 
	next room.

				YLLO
		Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the
		Solaras Space Lab.

				FAT LOU(V.O.)
		I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.

				YLLO
		We've got a situation here! Just do
		as  you're told!

				FAT LOU(V.O.)
		Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon
		as we've passed Tara's rings we'll
		make the course correction.

	BACK TO YLLO.

				YLLO
		Thank you.

	Yllo disconnects, and turns to the other console.

				YLLO
			(into mic)
		Ok Sarge, what's your status?

				BRODSKI(V.O.)
		wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three
		men and your worthless fuck! After I

	INT.  CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE

	GUNFIRE ERUPTS!

				SVEN(V.O.)
		I got him! I got him!

	INT. LAB ONE

	CHEERS from everyone except Rizzo who knows better. She shakes her head.

				THORGAN
		Yes!

				RIZZO
		Listen up duck fuckers, you can't
		kill this thing.

				BOEMAN
		Duck fuckers?

				RIZZO
		He's either unconcious or playing dead,
		whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay,
		you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.

				DELONGPRE
		Outta here?

				RIZZO
		Isn't there an escape POD on this ship?
		Something?

				THORGON
		There's a shuttle.

				RIZZO
		Alright, been nice knowing you.
		Who's with me?

				KKINSA
		I'll go.

				BOEMEN
		Yllo said stay here.

				KKINSA
		Fuck Yllo!

				BOEMEN
		They got him! You're not leaving!

	INT. CARGO BAY - MIDSHIP

	Sven is kneeling over Jason's body. 

				SVEN
		Big sucker too.

	Suddenly, Jason reaches up, grabs the back of Sven's head and SLAMS it 
	into his mask.
	Sven's forehead shatters.

	ON BRODSKI

	As he races around a crate. Sven's body is within sight. His killer 
	nowhere to be seen.

				BRODSKI
		Kicker? Where are you?

	Elsewhere we hear GUNFIRE followed closely by a SCREAM!

	ELSEWHERE

	Kicker crawls across the floor, blood spews from his mouth.

	PULL BACK TO RVEAL

	He's been split in half at the wait...his entrails dragging behind him..
	SHUNK! A machete throught the back of the neck puts him out of his 
	misery.

	INT. LAB ONE

				RIZZO
		Do something!!!

				THORGON
		Don't look at me! I'm in high school!

	INT. CARGO BAY

	Brodski runs. He's spooked. Twisting and turning in every direction.

				BRODSKI
		Find Crutch! Set up an ion field
		around the cargo bay. We'll torch
		the sucker! Yllo...you're a dead man!

	Brodski races toward the Cargo exit.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	ON MONITOR

	We see Brodski racing towards us. We also see Jason, lying in wait, 
	hidden by one 
	of the crates.

				YLLO
		Sergeant!

				BRODSKI
			(stops)
		What?

	Yllo considers then.
				YLLO
		Nothing.

	On the monitor we see Brodski move forward. He never saw Jason coming.
	BRODSKI SCREAMS.  Yllo turns his head.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	The kids stand in shock, silently staring at one another, listening to 
	the
	static of the dead communications. Boeman reaches over and clicks off 
	the radio.
	Silence.  Rizzo leaps to her feet.

				RIZZO
		Lesson number one, kiddies. You wanna
		get home safely then we get off this boat.

	Kkinsa starts t cry.

				KKINSA
		I don't understand...what does he want?

				RIZZO
		He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone
		on this ship.

	Rizzo looks at everyone.

				RIZZO
		Any questions?

	A side door HISSES OPEN. Yllo enters.

				YLLO
		You're not going anywhere.

				RIZZO
		You wanna die?

				YLLO
			(ignores her)
		Are we locked down?

				BOEMAN
		That door's the only way in or out and it
		won't open without the code.

				YLLO
		Then we wait. We're docking with Space Lab
		in less than an hour.

				RIZZO
		What good will that do?

				YLLO
		They can deal with this sort of thing.

				RIZZO
		More soldiers?

				YLLO
		Scientists. Very intellegent men.

				RIZZO
		That's great. I bet they'll kick Jason's
		ass at a spelling bee!

				JANESSA
		Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out
		and let us handle this?

				YLLO
		Try to calm down. Just think, you're going
		to be famous!

				RIZZO
			(to kids)
		Guys, please come with me!

				YLLO
		4You're not going anywhere.

	Rizzo starts for the door but Yllo grabs her arms, holds them behind 
	her.

				DELONGPRE
		Now hold on! We should hear her out!

				THORGAN
		She's obviously dealt with this guy before.

				YLLO
		Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!

				DELONGPRE
		No shit. I got no problem with that.

	Janessa readies a hypo.

				THORGAN
		Maybe if we knew a little bit more about
		what we're delaing with here...

	Janessa moves behind Rizzo with the sedative.  Suddenly Rizzo throws her 
	head back, Salmming it into Yllo's nose. He CRIES OUT in pain.

	Janessa lunges with the syringe but Rizzo snatches her wrist, grabbing 
	the hypo, burying it into Janessa's left breast.

				RIZZO
		tNighty-night.

	Janessa collapses.  Yllo rushes Rizzo again, but this time Boeman 
	stands, blocks his path.

				CRUTCH
		Leave her be.

				RIZZO
		Ok, who do I gotta fuck to get off this boat?

	Thorgan timidly raises his hand.

				RIZZO
		Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship.
		Come with me.

				THORGAN
		Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space?
		We'll die oout there.

	Rizzo rushes the door. There's a code box on the wall.

				RIZZO
		How do you open the damn door?

				YLLO
		You're crazy!

	Kkinsa punches in the code. The door HISSES open.

				DELONGPRE
		Rizzo, he's out there.

				RIZZO
		Yeah and he'll be here soon enough.
			(looks at Delongpre)
		Last chance.

	The others stare at her. She's crazy.

				RIZZO
		Fine. Bye.

	She and Kkinsa exit, the door SWISHES CLOSED behind them.

				YLLO
			(favoring his nose)
		Pack your shit. We'll disembark in an hour.
		The guys at Space Lab have the necessary
		equipment to contain this thing and then we
		can study it.

	But the kids aren't so sure.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Yllo enters, makes sure he wasn't followed then approaches a console.

				YLLO
		Computer on line.

	A series of beeps.

				JANESSA(O.S.)
		What are you doing?

				YLLO
			(jumps)
		Jesus! Can't you knock?
			(back to console)
		Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf.

		En-en-en-en...Eta-Eta...

	Fat Lou stares up in shock just before JASON SLAMS Bernie's torso ontop 
	of her.

	PULL BACK TO REVEAL

	FAT LOU'S upper body has disappeared. In other words, Bernie now has 
	legs.
	Little good they'll do him.

	THROUGH WINDSHIELD.

	Far in the distance we see a tiny space station -- SPACE LAB.
	A monitor reads ...

	SPACE LAB ETA 00:35:59 and counting.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	Rizzon and Kkinsa enter.

				RIZZO
		Which way?

	Kkinsa points. They head in that direction. Then Rizzo suddenly stops.

				KKINSA
		What?

				RIZZO
		Ssh.

	Rizzo pulls Kkinsa close to one of the crates.

				RIZZO
		He's in here.

	Kkinsa opens her mouth to scream. Rizzo slaps her hand over Kkinsa's 
	mouth.

				RIZZO
		You scream I'll snap your neck.
		Got it?

	Kkinsa nods. Rizzo releases her.

				KKINSA
			(whispers)
		How do you know?

				RIZZO
			(dread)
		I just know.

	INT.  LAB ONE 

	The crew has packed their essentials and now wait to dock with Space 
	Lab. Yll is standing
	before the others holding Jason's machete.

				YLLO
		We must assume the machete was an
		intricate part of the game of hockey.

				DELONGPRE
		I'm thinking Rizzo was right.

				YLLO
		Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?

				DELONGPRE
		Maybe we should go with them. Like you said,
		your Space Lab connections can deal with this 
	thing.
		At least we'll be safe.

				YLLO
		They are not going anywhere. I cut power to
		the  shuttle.

	The kids and Crutch stare at him. Cold hearted.

	INT.  SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	Rizzo and Kkinsa approach. 

				RIZZO
		Open the doors.

	Kkinsa punches in a series of buttons. Nothing.

				KKINSA
		Something's wrong.

				RIZZO
		Keep trying!

	INT.  LAB ONE

				YLLO
		Everyone ready?

	Yllo grabs a mike from a console.

				YLLO
		Fat Lou, what's the ETA?

	STATIC.

				YLLO
		Lou, goddamjnit! Bernie, where's Lou?!

	STATIC.

	Boeman moves to one of the consoles, clicks a few buttons.

	ON MONITOR

	We see the view from the bridge security camera. Lots of blood and the 
	mangled combination of Lou and Bernie.

				THORGAN
		Yuck.

				DELONGPRE
		We're screwed.

				YLLO
		The ship doesn't need pilots to dock.
		We'll disembark and you'll see.
		Everything will be fine.

				BOEMAN
		Uh...that's gonna be a problem.
		The ship's not on auto-pilot.
		We're flying blind.
			(a beat)
		Thirty minutes till impact.

	All eyes turn to Yllo, for guidance, his back to the outer door.

				YLLO
		I guess...we'll have to go to the bridge.

				THORGAN
		But...

	Jason is out there. Then --

	WHAM-WHAM-WHAM!

	The outer door bucks and dents! Everyone jumps!

	WHAM-WHAM-WHAM!

								QUICK-CUT TO:

	INT. SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	Over the headsets, Rizzo and Kkinsa hear the SCREAMS.

				RIZZO
		Damnit, he's got them.

	Kkinsa keeps trying the code box. Nothing.

				KKINSA
		Rizzo, I think Yllo must have done
		something. The door won't open.

	INT.  LAB ONE

				YLLO
		It's alright. He can't get in here!

	WHAM! WHAM!!! But the door is starting to give.

	Through the confusion, Crutch moves to one of the consoles. Clicks
	away at the keyboard.

	INT.   SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	The shuttle hums to life.

				KKINSA
		The power's back up!

				RIZZO
		Then open the doors!

				KKINSA
		Thirty seconds.

	INT.   LAB ONE

	WHAM! WHAM! WHAM!

				JANESSA
		What do we do?!!

				YLLO
		Crutch?

				CRUTCH
		Help me up.

	Boeman helps Crutch to the top of a table. Crutch goes to work on a  
	ceiling
	vent, removing screws.

				JANESSA
		Okay, I'm guessing you should hurry.

	The top corner of the door bends...Jason peers through.

				THORGAN
		Jesus, tell this asshole I don't
		play hockey!

				CRUTCH
		Okay!

	Our group starts climbing the table and into the ceiling space.

				YLLO
		Will that take us to the bridge?

				CRUTCH
		It's a maze up there, but yes.

				YLLO
		We'll engage auto-pilot!
		Everything'll be fine!

	With that, the door gives!

	Boeman heaves Crutch into the crawl space then follows himself.  Jason 
	pauses,
	staring at Kay-Em --

				KAY-EM 14
		Heart beat irregular...no blood flow...
		impossible...this....this... does not
		make sense.

	Jason's heard enough. He swings his cleaver, but Kay-Em ducks. Turns and 
	leaps
	through the hole in the celing.

	INT.  CEILING WALK SPACE

	Yllo grips the ledge.

				YLLO
		Move it people!

	Then Yllo screams. Jason has him from below. Boeman grabs his arms.

				BOEMAN
		Help me!

	DeLongpre grabs hold and pulls. Suddenly Yllo is jerked out of their
	grasp. They fall onto their backs breathing heavily.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Yllo leaps to his feet. Jason looms over him.

				YLLO
		Now hold on! Have you considered
		how valuable you are? Credit, fame,
		you can have it all. And ladies. I 
		mean, how long has it been?

	Jason stands there, but his attention isn't on Yllo. It's on the machete 
	sticking through
	Yllo's belt. Jason reaches for it. Yllo backs into a wall.

	Jason slowly removes the machete from Yllo's belt and stares at it. He 
	drops
	the cleaver to the ground.

				YLLO
			(chuckles)
		That's all you wanted?

	INT.  SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	The shuttle doors slide open as we hear over the headset --

				YLLO(V.O.)
		It's okay, he just wanted his machete.

				RIZZO
			(knowingly)
		Three...two...one...

	Yllo screams.

	INT.  CEILING WALK SPACE

	Yllo's SCREAMS turn to GURGLES. All eyes stare at the opening in the 
	walkway, then --

	YLLO'S HEAD LANDS IN BOEMAN'S LAP!

				KAY-EM 14
		Now that's just gross.

	JASON STICKS HIS HEAD THROUGH.  EVERYONE JUMPS, SCREAMS.

				DELONGPRE
		GO, GO, GO!

	They race down the walkway, over huge pipes and through electrical 
	wires, Crutch 
	in the lead.

	INT.  SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	Kkinsa enters the shuttle, turns to Rizzo.

				KKINSA
		Rizzo, come on!

	But, Rizzo hesitates. We can still hear the PANICKED SCREAMS over the 
	headset.

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		Go-go-go-go-go!!!!

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		He's right behind us!

				RIZZO
		Damn!
			(to Kkinsa)
		Close the door! I'll be right back.

				KKINSA
			(panicked)
		What?!!

				RIZZO
		I gotta go back.

				KKINSA
		But?!!

	Rizzo turns and races through the maze of boxes and crates leaving 
	Kkinsa nearly
	insane.

	INT.  CELING WALK SPACE

				KAY-EM 14
		I'm quite sure I wasn't designed for this.

	Crutch comes to a fork in the walkway.

				CRUTCH
		Okay, we need to ...

				BOEMAN
		You forgot didn't you, you old
		fart?

	At the back of the line, Delongpre turns as Jason rounds the bend behind 
	him.

				DELONGPRE
		Shit! Move it! He's coming!

	Delongpre leaps forward creating a pile out of Janessa and Thorgan

				DELONGPRE
		Go!

	Racing forward the group stays just out of Jason's grasp. Leaping
	over and under and through whatever blocks the path.

				DELONGPRE
		Faster!

	Jason swings his machete at DeLongpre! It just misses him.

				DELONGPRE
		FASTER!!!

	Crutch comes to ascreened panel. Boeman kicks it open.
	They leap down onto a catwalk crossing the --

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	They are twenty feet off the ground as --

	Rizzo stops, stares straight up.

	HER POV

	the group races across the catwalk as Json leaps down behind them.

				DELONGPRE
		He's right on my ass!

	Then Jason grabs Delongpre, who screams.

	RIZZO,

	spots a gun left by one of the marines. She snatches it, points it 
	towards
	Jason and Delongpre then aims a little high.

	FZZZT!

	It slices through a metal cord holding the catwalk to the ceiling.

	The catwalk jerks. Everyone tumbles. Jason loses his grip on Delongpre.

	Suddenly, METAL SCREECHES, as the catwalk gives under the weight. It 
	RIPS in half,dumping both
	heroes and Jason.

	RIZZO dives out of the way as a pile of metal and bodies crash to the 
	ground!

	Janessa sits up rubbing her head.

				JANESSA
		That was fun.

	Kay-Em 14 sits up, sings.

				KAY-EM 14
		I got a brand new pair of
		roller-skates, you got a brand new key...

				JANESSA
		Thorgan?!

				THORGAN
		I didn't do it. The fall scattered her
		programming..wait. Where's? Shit!

	He's lying on top of Jason. He scrambles to his feet. But Jason doesn't 
	move.

				THORGAN
		Hey, I think the fall killed him.

	The group slowly gathers around. Jason sits up and swings at Thorgan. 
	Boeman pulls him out of
	the way just in time.

	Jason starts to stand when RIZZO comes up behind him.

	KA-FWAM! She brings the barrel of a high tech gun down on the top of 
	Jason's head.
	He collapses. The surrounded faces look happily suprised.

				RIZZO
		Trust me, it's temporary.

	Boeman takes the gun from Rizzo.

				BOEMAN
		Better let me.

				THORGAN
		Where'd you get the gun?

	Rizzo gestures at what's left of Geko's body.

				CRUTCH
		The bridge is this way!

	They take off running.

				RIZZO
		Wait!

	Everyone stops, turns --

				KAY-EM 14
		There's not enough time.

	Rizzo catches up.

				RIZZO
		Forget the bridge, the shuttle's
		waiting!

				BOEMAN
			(to Kay-Em)
		What do you mean, not enough time?

				KAY-EM 14
			(switches voice)
		You know what you get if you shove
		two bananas up your ass? Two shit covered
		bananas.

				JANESSA
		I think your metal lover's losing it.

				KAY-EM 14
			(normal voice)
		Impact in ten minutes. It will take 
		fifteen to reach the bridge.
			(switches voices, sings)
		Mamma's little baby love shortnin,
		shortnin, mamma's little baby love 
		shotnin bread...

				DELONGPRE
		Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes.

				RIZZO
		Guys!!! The shuttle?

	The kids look at one another as if this were a stroke of genius.

				RIZZO
		Idiots.

				CRUTCH
		This way!

	Crutch again leads them through the maze. Delongpre stops at
	another Grunt body, removes a chain gun. THorgan takes a high
	tech laser from another.

				THORGAN
		I feel better. Now how do you
		fire this damn thing?

				DELONGPRE
		Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!

				CRUTCH
			(jokingly)
		Just around this bend...

	Jason steps out in front of Crutch, his machete held poised in front of 
	him.
	Crutch runs right up onto the blade.

				BOEMAN
		Nooooo!

	Alrhoguh he's meat on a stick, Crutch doesn't give up. He SLAMS his 
	fists into
	Jason's torso.

	Thorgan turns to fire --Boeman KNOCKS the barrel high.

				BOEMAN
		You'll hit crutch!

	Boeman tosses his weapon to Janessa and leaps on Jason's back, locking 
	his arms 
	around his neck.

				RIZZO
		What are you doing? You can't save him!

	Delongpre smashes the back of Jason's knee with the chaingun.
	Jason topples on top of Boeman. Crutch is thrown free.

	Janessa and Thorgan help Crutch to his feet as Jason sees Rizzo for the
	first time in 400 hundred years.

	It's either love at first sight or one hell of a grudge. He leaps to his
	feet and races towards her.

				RIZZO
		Don't just stand there! Shoot him!

				DELONGPRE
			(to Jason)
		No you don't!

	BRAAAAAAATTTT!

	The chaingun dances Jason backwards. He CRASHES through the side of one 
	of the 
	cargo boxes. EVERYONE STOPS.

				RIZZO
		Don't stop!

	She jerks the gun from Delongpre and races to the crate.

				RIZZO
		You never stop when he's down!

	But the crate is empty.

				RIZZO
		Shit!!!!

	They spin around, searching.

				CRUTCH
			(weak)
		Forget him. Come on.

	Carrying Crutch, they move toward the shuttle bay.

	INT. SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	panel, clicks some buttons, then --

				BOEMAN
		Uh-oh.

				JANESSA
		What?!

				BOEMAN
		Kkinsa! Open the doors!

	INT. SHUTTLE COCKPIT


	Kkinsa sits in the pilot's seat. She's terrified.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Kkinsa! He's coming! Open the doors!

	INT.  CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

	DeLongpre shoves Boeman out of the way.

				DELONGPRE
		Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!

				RIZZO
		Yeah, that's it, scare the hell
		out of here, that'll work.

	INT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT

				RIZZO(V.O.)
			(calming)
		Kkinsa, it's me, Rizzo. He's not
		out here right now, so please let us in.

	Kkinsa doesn't move.

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt! We need access to
		the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die.

	INT.  CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

				DELONGPRE
		Med-kit?

				RIZZO
		I guessed.

	INT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT

	Kkinsa considers. She reaches for a button marked SHUTTLE 
	DOORS...hesitates.

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		We're going to be okay, Kkinsa.
		Just relax.

	INT.  SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	Kay-Em 14 steps forward.

				KAY-EM 14
		Allow me. I'm trained in all aspects
		of the human psyche.

	Rizzo backs away -- as Kay-Em nears the mike ...

				KAY-EM 14
		Kkinsa, dear, it is I, KAY-EM 14...
		open the fucking door you silly bitch!

	Rizzo shoves Kay-Em out of the way.

				KAY-EM 14
		I didn't say I was good at it.

	INT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		Oh shit! There he is!

	INT.  CARGO BAY SHUTTLE

	Jason is standing at the entrance to the Cargo Shuttle Bay.

	INT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT

	Kkinsa leans forward and presses --

	LAUNCH.

	INT.   CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

	The Shuttle ROARS to life and begins pulling away from the ship.

				BOEMAN
		Kkinsa! No!!!

	EXT.   GRENDEL CLASS IV

	The shuttle moves slowly away from the docking position.

	INT.   CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

	Rizzo opens fire! Thorgan and Delongpre join in.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As boxes and cargo shatter under the heaby fire. Smoke rises. It's 
	impossible
	to see where Jason is. RIZZO stops FIRING.

				RIZZO
		DON'T WASTE YOUR AMMO!

	But, they don't let up. Boxes explode, crates collapse until -- 
	Thorgan's gun clicks empty.
	Then Delongpre's.

	SILENCE.

	The smoke slowly clears revealing the rubble.

				THORGAN
		Did we get him?

	Suddenly, Jason again steps into the Cargo entrance.

				DELONGPRE
		We're screwed!

				RIZZO
		400 years in the future and these
		pea-shooters are the best you can do?!

	They are trapped. Jason blocks the only exit. He slowly moves towards 
	them.

				RIZZO
		Just make a break for the door.
		He'll get some of us, but that's the
		breaks.

				BOEMAN
		We're not leaving Crutch!

				RIZZO
		We don't have time to argue!

	But Jason has locked in on Rizzo. He moves towards her.

				JANESSA
		Okay, tell you what. You die, we'll run.

	Rizzo and the others back into a corner. Jason has them. There's nothing 
	they
	can do.

	Rizzo holds the gun steady, waiting for point blank range. 

	INT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE

	THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

	SPACE LAB, which was only a dot the last time we saw it, suddenly looms 
	toward us.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Collision eminent.

	EXT.  GRENDEL CLASS IV

	The left side of Grendel SMASHES into the side of Space Lab!

	INT.  CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

	Suddenly everything shifts toward the bridge. Boxes, cargo, kids, and 
	Jason!

	EXT.  GRENDEL CLASS IV

	Grendel SLIDES along SPACE LAB, ripping huge chunks of metal from both.
	SPARK fly. There are interior EXPLOSIONS on Space Lab, then --

	KA-FOOM!

	Space Lab EXPLODES!

	INT.  CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

	The entire ship shifts upwards. Cargo, crew, and Jason fly into the air.

	ELECTRICAL fires sprout up all over. Cargo boxes SHATTER, contents 
	SPILLING.

	RIZZO loses her gun.

	EXT.  GRENDEL CLASS IV

	Debris from Space Lab TEARS into the side of the ship and beyond.

	EXT.  SHUTTLE

	One huge chunk heads right towards the Shuttle.

	INT.  SHUTTLE

	Kkinsa stares out the window as the huge chunk flies toward her.

	EXT.  SHUTTLE 

	IMPACT! THE SHUTTLE IMPLODES! ONE BRIGHT RED FIREBALL.

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	Everything piled and in tatters. Our heroes slowly regain their 
	bearings.

				BOEMAN
		Everyone okay?

				THORGAN
		I think I broke my arm.

				KAY-EM 14
		I seem to have misplaced mine.

	Kay-Em 14's right arm is missing, wires sticking out of the stump.

				JANESSA
		You geeks wanna gimmie a hand?

	Janessa is buried beneath a pile of rubble. Boeman helps her to her 
	feet.

				DELONGPRE
			(quiet)
		We lost crutch.

	Rizzo stands and watches as the other sgather around Crutch's body.
	It's battered and twisted all out of place. Boeman falls next to the 
	body.

				BOEMAN
		Goodbye old friend.

				RIZZO
		Okay, he was a great guy, now
		let's move out.

				BOEMAN
			(snaps)
		Could you show a little compassion?!

	Rizzo stares at Boeman.

				RIZZO
		Look, I'm sorry. I really am, but aren't you
		forgetting about ...

	SUDDENLY a pile of rubble EXPLODES.

	Jason rises, his back to them.

				DELONGPRE
		Back to the labs!

	But Jason has other plans. Seemingly unfazed by the past events he 
	rushes after them.

	INT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Dam-damage port side 59 percent.
		Decompression 40 percent. Gravity-y rotors
		failing.

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	Our kids race toward the door, Jason right behind them --

	Thorgan slams the door panel with his good arm. SPARKS fly.
	The door won't open.

				THORGAN
		Oh shit.

	They turn as Jason looms toward them, then --

	EVERYTHING STARTS TO FLOAT

	Cargo and debris. Our heroes. Jason.

	The loss of gravity and Jason's steamrollering momentum SLAMS him into 
	the 
	cargo doors, BREAKING them open and sending him tumbling backwards.

				JANESSA
		This is just great.

				KAY-EM 14
		Engage magnetics.

	Kay-Em 14's left hand magnetically locks to the Cargo frame a

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Jason grabs Rizzo's ankle. Boeman, floating close, punches Jason in the 
	back of the head.

	Still holding Rizzo's ankle, Jason topples, spinning the two out of 
	frame.

	The force of the punch sends Boeman in the opposite direction.

				THORGAN
		This is crazy, we can't do anything like this!

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Rizzo KICKS Jason in the top of the head, sending him SLAMMING into the 
	ceiling.

	A SEVERED ARM

	floats past DeLongpre. There's a chain gun still clutched by the  hand.
	Delongpre grabs both and turns the gun on Jason.

	BRAAATTTT...

	Jason is sent further back, but the force of the chaingun SLAMS 
	Delongpre into a back wall.
	He's knocked unconcious.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As Thorgan manages to grab Kay-Em 14 around the neck.

				THORGAN
		Grab my hand!

	Janessa takes his hand and in turn reaches out and snags the unconcious 
	dELONGPRE'S FOOT.

				JANESSA
		Boeman, can you reach DeLongpre?
		We'll push you in.

	CARGO - MIDSHIP

	Jason is floating toward the other end of the Cargo Bay,
	unable to stop himself.

	BOEMAN

	reaches for DeLongpre. Inches away. Finally he grabs Delongpre by the 
	locks of his
	hair, pulls himself closer.

				DELONGPRE
		Hey! That hurts.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Rizzo is floatin g up near the ceiling. She manages to grab hold of a 
	hanging piece of
	busted catwalk.

				DELONGPRE
			(to Rizzo)
		Push off toward us.

				JANESSA
		Forget her, she's a pain in the ass.
		Let her hang there.

	Crutch's body floats into our heroes, his intestines spilling from his 
	open gut,
	tangling around our heroes.

				THORGAN
		I'm gonna spew.

				JANESSA
		That ought'a help the situation.

				DELONGPRE
		Do it Rizzo! We'll catch you.

	RIZZO'S POV

	Rizzo stares at the human rope that consists of Thorgan, Janessa, 
	Boeman, and Delongpre.

				RIZZO
		What if you miss?

				DELONGPRE
		What if we don't?

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	AS JASON steadies himself against a wall, focuses in one Rizzo, then 
	pushes off with his feet.

	HE ROCKETS toward her!

				DELONGPRE
		He's coming right at you!

	Rizzo spots Jason and pushes off! But her aim was HURRIED...
	and bad. She's gonna miss them.

	Boeman flips in the air!

				BOEMAN
			(to Delongpre)
		Grab my feet!

	Delongpre does and Boeman reaches out and snags Rizzo. The momentum 
	spins the human
	chain into a near wall --KAFWAM-- nearly breaking it apart.

				JANESSA
		Okay that hurt.

				BOEMAN
		Thorgan, pull us in.

	Jason SLAMS into the ceiling, then careens off of the wall --

	As Thorgan pulls the group out of the Cargo bay.

				THORGAN
		What now?

	They watch as Jason grabs a hold of the walkway.

				JANESSA
		Shit. He's gonna send himself right at us.

	Jason takes aim.

								QUICK CUT TO:

	INT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE

				COMPUTER VOICE
		System repair activated. Back up power on line.

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	Jason again ROCKETS THROUGH THE AIR -- when

	GRAVITY IS RESTORED.

	He drops to the cargo floor like a rock! Falling cargo -- huge crates, 
	gargantuan machines,
	a forklift -- buries him.

	Our heroes tumble to the ground.

				JANESSA
			(to Rizzo)
		Get off of me!

	They stand slowly, eyeing the rubble.

				THORGAN
			(rubbing his arm)
		You think it killed . . .
			(off Rizzo's stare)
		Yeah, I guess not.

				JANESSA
		Let's just get out of here.

				BOEMAN
		The ship's in bad shape. Back to
		the labs. Let's check out status.

	INT. SHIP CORRIDORS

	Our group makes their way back toward the labs.

	ELECTRICAL fires are everywhere. Systems are shorting out all over the 
	ship.

	INT. LAB ONE

	Rizzo, in the lead, enters the lab, when the ship BUCKS and QUAKES! A 
	portion of the hall
	collapses behind her.

	INT. CORRIDOR

	Boeman and the others dive back out of the way.

				BOEMAN
		Shit!

				THORGAN
		The hull's imploding!

				BOEMAN
		Rizzo! Can you hear me?!

	INT.  LAB ONE

				RIZZO
		Yeah. Are you guys okay?

	Boeman peers through a crack in the collapsed hull.

				BOEMAN
		There's a red lever on the wall
		beside you. Pull it!

	Rizzo turns, spots the red lever. EMERGENCY PRESSURIZATION STABILIZER.
	It's bolted.

				RIZZO
		It's locked!

				BOEMAN
		Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's
		going to depressurize!

	Rizzo kicsk the metal leg from a table. BASHES the bolt with it, until 
	it breaks.

				BOEMAN
		Hurry Rizzo! You have to reverse
		the pressurization.

	She grabs the lever...then hesitates. Backs away.

				BOEMAN
		What are you doing?!!

				RIZZO
		If the ship goes, so does Jaso.

				BOEMAN
		Rizzo pull the fucking lever!

				RIZZO
		No.

				DELONGPRE
		Rizzo?!

				RIZZO
		It's better this way. If we were rescued
		Jason would just get off the ship. You want
		him on your precious Earth II?

	INT.  CORRIDOR

	Boeman and the other start tearing the debris out of the way!

				THORGAN
		Hurry! She's lost it!

				JANESSA
		So what else is new?

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Boeman climbs through a hole in the rubble. He grabs the lever.

				RIZZO
		Boeman don't. You know I'm right.

				JANESSA
		Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!

	Boeman yanks the lever.

	As the others climb into the lab --

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Depressurization inconclusive.

				KAY-EM 14
		We've lost too much pressure. An hour, tops.

				JANESSA
			(to Rizzo)
		You happy? You've killed us all!

	Thorgan rushes over to the big Nano-tech machine. Places his broken arm 
	on the slab.
	The machine quickly goes to work.

	A schematic of his arm appears on the wall.

	Janessa stares at him.

				JANESSA
		What's the point?

	Delongpre shrugs.

				DELONGPRE
		So that's it then.

	It seems it is.

	Janessa stands over Yllo's decapitated body. It's obvious their 
	relationship
	went beyond just teacher/student. There is a loud METALLIC WHINE from 
	the ship's
	hull.

				RIZZO
		What's that?

				BOEMAN
		THat's the sound of deep space attacking the
		integrity of the ship.

				KAY-EM 14
		No...
			(signing)
		That's the sound of the men working
		on the chain gang.

				RIZZO
		Are there any other shuttles?

				JANESSA
		No.

				RIZZO
		Teleportation? Some way to beam us the
		hell out of dodge?

				THORGAN
		You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?

				JANESSA
		A little late to be thinking about
		escape, isn't it?

				KAY-EM 14
		I'll never experience my fantasy of
		three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod.
		Damn.

				THORGAN
		Am I in there?

				KAY-EM 14
		Sory...

				RIZZO
		Hey.

				DELONGPRE
		That's a good fantasy, though.
		Kinky, but good.

				RIZZO
		Hey!!

	All heads turn to Rizzo. She's staring at a schematic of the ship. The 
	left hull
	of the two hulled ship is lit up with blinking light denoting the 
	various 
	system failures. Rizzo points to the right hull.

				RIZZO
		What's this?

				DELONGPRE
		It's the engine, reactors, audiometers,
		it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.

	Rizzo points at the thin walk-ways connecting the two hulls.

				RIZZO
		Can we get through these?

				THORGAN
		Sure but what good will that do?

				BOEMAN
		When the left hull goes, so will the
		right.

				RIZZO
		What if we blow the walkways first?
		Leave Jason over here to go up with
		the ship?

	They stare at her.

				JANESSA
		You know, Yllo seemed to think we could
		catch this guy alive, well, he'd be worth
		millions.

	The others stare at her as if she were crazy.

				RIZZO
		Any connection between your reality and mine
		is purely coincidental.

				JANESSA
		I'm just saying.

				RIZZO
			(to others)
		Come on. You got all these gadgets and shit.
		Why can't we get inside the right hull, seal up
		the doors and blow the walkways?

				DELONGPRE
		We'd need charges.

				BOEMAN
		We could convert fission transistors.

				THORGAN
		We're not supposed to do that.

				BOEMAN
		What are you gonna do, tell me?

		DELONGPRE
		The engine room will have molecular welders.
		We could seal up the hull.

	A moment of consideration. Could this actually work?

				JANESSA
		YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big
		guy distracted with a blow job.

				THORGAN
		Would you?

				KAY-EM 14
		Now this is getting exciting.

				DELONGPRE
		Remember to roll his balls around a bit.

				RIZZO
		You got a better plan?

	Obviously they don't. They got to work. Boeman grabs a number of devices 
	from under
	a cabinet.

				BOEMAN
		I'll need system four converters.

				THORGAN
		They're back here.

				DELONGPRE
		How many?

				BOEMAN
		Bring 'em all. Let's move!

	Thorgan's still hooked up to the Nano-Tech machine.

				THORGAN
		Hey! I'm not ready.

				BOEMAN
		Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley
		one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there.
		Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.

				JANESSA
		You're so bossy.

				THORGAN
		You're leaving me here alone?

	Delongpre tosses the chaingun next to him.

				DELONGPRE
		Don't blow your foot off.

	They climb through the hole in the corridor and disappear.

				KAY-EM 14
		It's just you and me, then.

				THORGAN
		Come here, might as well fix that arm.

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	Boeman, Janessa, Delongpre, and Rizzo slowly move through the piles of 
	debris.
	Still burning cargo creates a ghastly image of flickering shadows.

				DELONGPRE
		See anything?

	They move toward the rubble that had buried Jason before.

	CLOSE on the rubble.

	There is an obvious hole dug out from the middle.

				DELONGPRE
		I think I speak on behalf of the group
		when I say this is bad news.

				BOEMAN
			(into headset)
		Thorgan? You coming?!

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Thorgan is fooling around in the back of Kay-Em 14's head. The nano-tech 
	maching is 
	doing a full diagnostics.

				THORGAN
			(into headset)
		Almost done.

				KAY-EM 14
		Ow!

				THORGAN
		Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.

				KAY-EM 14
		Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.

	INT. WALKWAY ONE

	Boeman enters, throws his pack to the ground and goes to work ttaching a 
	device to
	the wall of the huge glass connector.

	INT. WALKWAY TWO

	Janessa enters and goes through the same motions.

	INT. WALKWAY THREE

	Delongpre and Rizzo attach a device to the wall.

				DELONGPRE
		Put your finger here.

	SHe does so. Delongpre connects several wires. Rizzo looks nervous. 
	Delongpre notices.

				DELONGPRE
		My father wanted me to be a businessman.

	Silence.

				DELONGPRE
		That's why I'm here.

				RIZZO
		So, you thought you'd be cool. Go against
		your father's wishes? Yeah, that's grown up.

	Delongpre looks at her like she's crazy.

				DELONGPRE
		My father's company imports and exports. Archaeology 
		is part of the business. We happen to get along just 
	fine,
		smartass. Look, why don't you bust somebody else's 
	balls
		for a change.

				RIZZO
		I thought you meant...

				DELONGPRE
		You thought I meant...too tough to apologize, huh?
		You must have been a very lonely girl.

	Silence. Neither speaks.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Thorgan rips a metallic sink from the wall. It CRASHES to the floor.

				THORGAN
		Sorry, sorry.

				KAY-EM 14(O.S.)
		Who are you apologizing to?

				THORGAN
		Good point.

	INT.  WALKWAY ONE

	Boeman attaches another charge. He's sweating. Nervous. Keeps looking
	over his shoulder. Standing alone on this long walkway is a creepy 
	sight.

	INT.  WALKWAY TWO

	Janessa stops working, listens.

	KA-THUMP -- There's anoise in the Cargo Bay.

	She covers the mike on her headset and calls out.

				JANESSA
		Thorgan, you little shit, is that you?

	No answer. She quickly turns to her pack and pulls out the bottle of 
	tranquillizer
	and a monster syring.e She fills this rhino syringe with a massive 
	dosage. Enough to
	bring down a Rhino...or Jason maybe?

	She starts moving down the walkway toward the Cargo Bay.
	Surely she's not that stupid.

	INT.  WALKWAY THREE

	Rizzo is staring at Delongpre as he works on another device.
	Then --

				RIZZO
		When I was four, the ocean quit producing
		life. Too many pollutants. Nuclear testing,
		the occasional terrorist bombing...the
		atmosphere was shit by the time I was eight.
		We moved underground when I was twelve.

	Delongpre stares at her. He doesn't want to speak and screw up this
	rare moment of sharing.

	INT.   CARGO BAY

	Janessa enters. Looks around.

	The cargo bay is dark and looming. Lights flicker. Emergency lights
	strobe. It's hard to make anything out.

	We hear Rizzo speaking Off Screen.

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		My father was an army Scientist.
		Genetics. The army thought they could
		develop humans able to survive the Earth
		we had created

	Janessa moves through the debris.

	ANOTHER POV

	We see Janessa come into view.

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		Jason seemed to have the right stuff.
		Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell
		damage, didn't matter. He just kept
		going.

	INT.  WALKWAY THREE

				DELONGPRE
		Were you close to your father?

	Thorgan interrupts over the headset.

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		Delongpre? What did you do with the
		chain gun?

	Delongpre frowns.

				DELONGPRE
			(into mike)
		It's on the table where I left it!
		What the hell are you doing?!
		Hurry up!

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		I'm on my way.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Thorgan, quit screwing around and
		come on!

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		I'm coming, I'm coming.

				DELONGPRE
		Sorry, you were saying?

	INT. CARGO BAY

	WATCHER'S POV

	JANESSA approaches the pile of debris where Jason was buried.

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		I got along great with my father,
		my mother too. Dad and the others thought
		they could learn a great deal from this 
		thing the army had been keeping on ice for
		over a hundred years.

	Janessa moves the debris around with her foot.

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		They were all wrong. They couldn't control
		him.

	INT. WALKWAY THREE

				DELONGPRE
		And what happend to ...?

	Rizzo begins to tear up.

				RIZZO
		I couldn't save them.

				DELONGPRE
		Well, we'd be dead without you.
		You know that, don't you?

	She stares at him.

				DELONGPRE
		It's true.
			(chuckles)
		You caused enough stink that we
		were at least a little cautious.
		Of course this is the first field
		trip I went on that had a body count.

	She gives him a  half smile.

				DELONGPRE
		I'm not much, but I promise, I won't
		let this guy get you.

	Another half smile. It's a sweet gesture, but what can this guy really 
	do?

	INT. CARGO BAY

	JASON'S POV

	He watches Janessa from a  distance. Moving slowly and silently toward 
	her.

	She stands and turns as --

	SERGEANT BRODSKI grabs her!

	She SCREAMS.

	He's covered in blood from a gaping wound in his gut.

				BRODSKI
		Where is everybody? What happened?

				JANESSA
		Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!

				BRODSKI
		Give me a break! What happened?

				JANESSA
		Jason. He's what happened. Then 
		Grendel hit Space Lab.

				BRODSKI
		Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands
		on Yllo.

				JANESSA
		Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.

				BRODSKI
		Takes more than a steelbalde to take
		this old dog down.

	KA-THUNK! 

	JASON"S MACHETE THRUSTS though Brodski's gut. Jason spins Brodski around 
	and tosses him to the floor!

				BRODSKI
		Yup, that ought'a do it.

	Jason turns on Janessa.

	She stands frozen in fear.

	Jason raises his machete and --

	JANESSA

	Lights a flare, blinding Jason for the moment. Then she sinks the Rhino 
	syringe 
	into his chest! Jason stumbles...falls hard on his ass and sits there 
	staring
	at her.

				JANESSA
		Well go on! Pass out!

	Jason tears the syringe away and tosses it aside.

				JANESSA
		Shit.

	Jason starts to climb to his feet. Janessa turns to run.

				BRODSKI
			(weak)
		He-help me...

	He holds his hand out to her. Then--

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		I'm blowing Walkway One. Hold on.

	KA-FOOM! The SHIP BUCKS!

	Janessa runs, leaving the sergeant behind.

	INT.  CARGO BAY - OUTSIDE WALKWAY THREE

	Delongpre closes the door, then --

				DELONGPRE
		We're blowing three. Hang on.

	He throws a switch!

	INT. CARGO BAY - BRIDGE SIDE

	Boeman vaults over a pile of rubble.

				BOEMAN
		Janessa, we're on our way to you!

	INT. WALKWAY TWO

	Holding hands, Delongpre and Rizzo enter. They stop...stand...stare.

	The walkway is empty. Janessa is gone.

	Boeman rushes up behind them.

				BOEMAN
		Where is...?

				DELONGPRE
		You tell me! She's only set one
		charge. And it's not finished!

	With that Janessa tears into the walkway. She's out of breath. She can 
	barely speak.

				BOEMAN
		Where have you been?!!

				JANESSA
		He....He...

				DELONGPRE
		He's coming!!!

	THEIR POV

	JASON moves through the debris. He's coming straight for them.

				BOEMAN
		Run!!

	They race down the length of the walkway. Jason right behind them.

				RIZZO
		We can't lead him into the other hull!

				BOEMAN
		We don't have a choice!

	Boeman slams the door panel. The door slowly rises.

	Jason approaches, stops, stares at his future victims. If he could smile
	with anticipation...he would. He raises his Machete --

	Then stops. Lowers it.

	CHA-CHUNG. CHA-CHUNG. CHA-CHUNG.

	He turns his back on our heroes. They crane their necks to see what has 
	pulled
	his attention.

	THORGAN marches down the walkway with KAY-EM 14. The new and imporved 
	KAY-EM 14.

	Where her severed arm had once been, a chain gun is now attached. A 
	laser cannon is
	mounted over her shoulder. Her body has been reinforced with steel from 
	around the lab.
	Sinks, trays, you name it. She's the junk yard man's terminator. Then --

				KAY-EM 14
		Do I have to?

				THORGAN
		Yes, I've reprogrammed you.
		You are very brave. Bad ass.

				KAY-EM 14
		Oh, alright.

	KAY-EM 14 INTERNAL SCAN POV

	We see a somewhat computerized image of Jason through Kay-Em's personal 
	scan.
	One the display we see:

	SUBJECT: DEAD
	CHANCES OF FUNCTION: 100 PERCENT
	DOES NOT COMPUTE . . . DESTROY SUBJECT

				KAY-EM 14
		Come on, boy. Let's see if we can
		open up  can'a whoop ass!

	BRAAAATTTT! The chain gun rings! Jason is SLAMMED into the HULL DOORS.

				DELONGPRE
		Holy shit!

	JASON jumps up and rushes at Kay-Em who catches him and tosses him down 
	the walkway --

	BRAAAATTT! Kay-Em opens up again. Kay-Em's weaponry shoves Jason out 
	into the cargo
	bay witha  blur of bullets.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

				BOEMAN
		What are we waiting for?!!
		Come on!!

	Our heroes rush down the walkway toward the cargo bay. Boeman and 
	Delongpre go to
	work setting the charges.

				BOEMAN
			(to Janessa)
		Where the hell were you?!!

				JANESSA
		He came for me, I had to run!

				THORGAN
			(into mike)
		Kay-Em, you okay?

	INT. CARGO BAY

				KAY-EM 14
		Don't worry about me. I live for this shit.

	And with that, Kay-Em BLOWS the now standing Jason into another wall 
	with the laser 
	cannon.

	INT. WALKWAY TWO

				BOEMAN
		Toss me a chip.

	Delongpre pulls a trinket from his pack and pitches it to Boeman.

				BOEMAN
		Thorgan, you're brilliant.
		Have I told you that lately?

	Thorgan is standing at the end of the walkway staring into the cargo 
	bay.
	He looks sad.

				THORGAN
			(quietly)
		See you around.

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	Kay-Em 14 marches toward the downed Jason, and starts singing an old Sea 
	Shanty.

				KAY-EM 14
		She's the Yellow Rose of Taegu,
		the girl that I adore. Her cunt
		it smells like cock juice; she's
		a good two-dollar whore. You may
		talk to me of Seoul girls or whores
		from Tokyo, but the yellow rose of 
		Taegu beats them all, I'd you know.

	BRATTTT!!!

	Kay-Em blows Jason into --

	INT. HALL BETWEEN LABS AND CARGO

	She kicks him down the long corridor.

	INT. WALKWAY TWO 

	The hull SCREAMS from the exterior pressure. The ship RUMBLES.

				BOEMAN
		I'd say we have about ten minutes tops.

				DELONGPRE
		Then stop talking and work faster!

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Jason BURSTS through the debris that had been blocking the Lab!
	Kay-Em enters behind him.

				KAY-EM 14
			(still singing)
		She was a young and charming girl;
		her age was scarce sixteen.

	JASON rushes KAY-EM 14!

				KAY-EM 14
		She took me in and she kicked out
		a sailor and marine.

	KA-CHING!!!!

	His machete bounces off of Kay-Em's new armor.

				KAY-EM 14
		She had no titties on her chest;
		that didn't bother me,

	WHAM!

	Kay-Em 14 back hands Jason across the room. He crashes into the glass
	speciments. Goo and formaldehyde covering him.

				KAY-EM 14
		For what she had between her legs
		was big enough for three.

	INT. WALKWAY TWO

	Boeman and Delongpre are finishing up.

				BOEMAN
		Okay, Janessa, give me your last charge.

	Janessa looks around, then --

				JANESSA
		I...I don't know what I did...

				DELONGPRE
		You lost the charge?

				JANESSA
		He was chasing me!

				RIZZO
		Can we blow it with just two?

				BOEMAN
		If we don't sever the hull completely
		she'll drag us down with her.

				DELONGPRE
		Then what do we do?!

				BOEMAN
		I don't know!

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Kay-Em stands over Jason. And for the first time in ten films Jason is 
	in bad shape.
	But still climbs to his feet...slowly.

				KAY-EM 14
		Why you low life, scum sucking,
		rat dick blowing, sum bitch.
		Your mamma must'a had some huge balls.

	Of course, as anyone knows, you don't diss Jason's mother.

	Jason leaps, tacking Kay-Em 14! They roll into another glass case. 
	Glass, formaldehyde and specimens
	rain down on top of them.

	Having lost his machete, Jason BASHES at Kay-Em with his fists. OVER and 
	OVER. He
	catches a rhythm. Kay-Em is trapped below.

	INT. WALKWAY TWO

				DELONGPRE
		Well, it was a good plan.

	They look at one another -- hopless. Then --

				BRODSKI(O.S.)
		You stupid bitch!

	Everyone jumps as Sergeant Brodski leans against the walkway door frame.
	He's bound his wounds with a make-shift tourniquet wrapped around his 
	mid-section.

				BRODSKI
		Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!

				BOEMAN
		Sergeant? We thought you were...

				BRODSKI
		Yeah, yeah.
			(to Janessa)
		Well, what have you got to say for yourself?

				JANESSA
		I don't know...sorry?

				RIZZO
		Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.

				BRODSKI
		Bomb?

				BOEMAN
		Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.

	The sergeant tosses his pack to the ground.

				BRODSKI
		How much you need?

	INT. LAB ONE

	WHAM...WHAM...WHAM... A RAIN of firststaking on this droid from the 
	future.

	Finally, Jason stops. Straddling KAy-Em 14 he stares at his kill...until 
	--

				KAY-EM 14
			(condescending)
		That was very good. You should
		feel very good about yourself
		right now. Good effort.
			(tough voice)
		How could you hit a girl you sumbitch?!

	Kay-Em 14 places the chaingun over Jason's chest.

	BRAAAATTTT!!!!

	Jason is blown across the room!

				KAY-EM 14
		Okay, dip shit. Time to finish
		you off so I can go home and boink
		your momma with a corndog. The kinky
		bitch.

	Chaingun and laser cannon UNLEASH A MASSIVE DISPLAY on the fleshly body 
	of
	JASON VOORHEES.

	The top portion of Jason's mask shatters!

	hIS RIGHT LEG IS TURNED INTO A PILE OF MEAT, then blown clean off for 
	good measure!
	Jason falls on his ass!

	He raises his machete arm. A last ditch effort. Could he be that lucky?
	To throw a machete and stop this onslaught?

	CHA-CHING!

	NOPE.

				KAY-EM 14
			(singing)
		Bang, bang Maxewells silver hammer
		came down upon his head. Doo-pee-
		do-do. Bang, bang Maxewell's silver
		hammer made sure that he was dead...

	Jason climbs to his one good leg but i t only serves as a better aim
	for Kay-Em 14.

	KA-FOOM! The laser cannon blows Jason's left arm to hell.

	KA-FOOM! KA-FOOM!

	Two more blasts send Jason flying through the back wall and sliding 
	across the floor.

	KAY-EM 14'S INTERNAL SCAN POV

	This time, Jason's body doesn't move.

	SUBJECT: DEAD
	CHANCE OF FUNCTION: ZERO PERCENT
	MISSION OF OBJECTIVES: COMPLERED

				KAY-EM 14
		Oh...my...god. What have I done?
			(crying)
		Thorgan!

	Kay-Em turns and races down the hall.

				KAY-EM 14
		Thorgan I'm a murderer!

	INT.  WALKWAY TWO

	Boeman and Delongpre hustle to set the final charge.

				BRODSKI
		Blowing the walkway? You come up
		with that yourself?

				BOEMAN
		Rizzo did.

	CHA-CHUNG...CHA-CHUNG. Kay-Em steps into the walkway. She's covered in
	blood.

				THORGAN
		Kay-Em!

				BOEMAN
		What are you doing back?!!

				KAY-EM 14
			(sad)
		Sumbitch won't be giving us
		anymore trouble.

				RIZZO
		You killed him?

				KAY-EM 14
			(regret)
		Blew half his skull away, one leg,
		one arm and left his entrails
		stretched across the lab. And look
		at me! I'm covered in his filthy blood!

				THORGAN
		You did good, Kay-Em. I'm proud of you.

				KAY-EM 14
		A real mamma's boy that one.
		Dissed his mamma and he nearly
		threw a tantrum. Little good it did him.

				RIZZO
		His mother?

				BOEMAN
		What?

				RIZZO
		I don't know. Nothing.

	Suddenly the ship's hull SCREAMS. The ship BUCKS. Everyone tumbles.

				BOEMAN
		Hurry up people! We're running out
		of time.

	INT.  LAB ONE 

	Jason's body is propped up against a machine in the same position we saw 
	it before. This
	mass of torn flesh doesn't move.

	The ship BUCKS again.

	The machine HUMS to life. BUZZING and BEEPING. Suddenly a laser scans 
	Jason's
	body.

	PULL BACK TO REVEAL

	Jason is leaned up against the Nano-Tech machine.

	INT. WALKWAY TWO

	Thorgan runs wire to each device.

				THORGAN
		As long as they're connected we can 
		blow them all simultaneously from
		a safe distance.

				BOEMAN
		Two more charges to go.

	INT. LABE ONE - NANO-TECH MACHINE

	We see a schematic of Jason's battered body on the monitor. Nano-
	technology
	is already at work.

	Hoses and wires now encircle Jason's body. We follow one of the hoses 
	until it ends
	over --

	A WASTE BEND

	nside we see pile of bullets. Stuff falls from the hose. Bullets from 
	the chaingun,
	bullets from  every previous Jason movie. A broken machete blade drops 
	to the pile.
	The tip of an arrow. A couple of knives. A pair of pliers. An ink pen. 
	The skeleton
	of a fish.

	The scanning lasers move to the stump at Jason's shoulder. We see the 
	image as a new arm, fuzzy
	adn distorted, is being constructed.

	On the schematic, we see Jason's internal organs being repaired.

	By now  we've figured out ...nothing good can come of this.

	INT.  WALKWAY TWO

	Kay-Em 14 hits a button. The door begins to slide down slowly.

				THORGAN
		Done!

				BOEMAN
		Let's move out!

				BRODSKI
		Kid, you ever thought about the marine corp?

	Delongpre calls fromthe far end of the walkway, welder in his hand.

				DELONGPRE
		I need another minute. Come on!

	ON OUR HEROES

	Suddenly there is a GRINDING SOUND. Engines WHINE from behind them.

	The group stops and turns.

	The cargo door is starting to smoke. It SQUEALS as it slowly opens.

				BRODSKI
		Well fuck me.

				KAY-EM 14
		No, fuck me.

	The door opens and Jason steps into the walkway.

	But he's no Jason we've ever seen before. His leg and arm are now
	SHINY METAL. His clothes are BLACK, no longer tattered. His mask is 
	CHROME.
	We can't see them, but we know...his insides are in better shape than 
	ever.

				THORGAN
		Kay-Em? Re-engage killer instinct.

				KAY-EM 14
		Yeeee-haw!!!!

	BRAAAATTTTT!

	Kay-em firs. But, this time it doesn't seem to faze Jason. SPARKS fly as
	bullets vounce off of his metal limbs.

	Jason swings his new improved machete. It CLANGS off of Kay-Em's armor, 
	removing a hunk of metal.

	Jason grabs her and swings her into the glass walkway. Glass CRACKS.
	One of the wires, connecting two charges severs.

				BOEMAN
		Shit!

	Kay-em does a back flip, kicking Jason in the chest. He's shoved 
	backwards.

	Boeman attempts to splice the wires back together as the battle ensues.

	IT'S MASSIVE! Intellectual synthetic droid verses psychotic metallic 
	killer.
	SPARKS FLY. GUNFIRE SOUNDS. Then Kay-Em does a round house kick, but 
	Jason uses 
	his machete as a shield. Kay-Em's leg is nearly sliced off at the knee.

	She stumbles...falls to the ground.

				THORGAN
		Kay-Em!!!

	Boeman splices the wires together.

				BOEMAN
		Done!!

	Then turns to see Jason approaching.

				BOEMAN
		RUN!!

	But Jason's too close. He grabs Boeman.

	ON KAY-EM

	As her body separates from her legs mid-thigh. CHCHHHHH!
	THRUSTERS IGNITE from her lower thighs.

	As Jason raises his machete to do Boeman in --

	KA-FWAM! Kay-Em slams into him! Knocking Boeman free.

	Jason and the now hovering Kay-Em go at it again.

	CHANG! CLANG! CLUNK! Metal against metal. Kay-Em hovers up the walls, 
	over Jason's 
	head...but Jason has come into his own with these new body parts. She's 
	no match. Finally --

	JASON EMBEDS HIS MACHETE IN KAY-EM'S THROAT

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Jason rears back and shoves his fist though Kay-Em's chestplate! his 
	fist from Kay-Em's
	chest and wraps his metallic hand around he throat.

				THORGAN
		Kay-Em! Get away!

	Thorgan moves toward his robotic love but Boeman grabs him and pulls him 
	down
	the hall.

				KAY-EM 14
		That's the best you can do?

	Jason yanks his machete from the side of Kay-Em's neck. Severing her 
	head
	from her body. It flies down the hallway behind the kids.

				KAY-EM 14
		Is that it? Come back and fight like a man!

	JASON 

	Turns his glare on our heroes racing toward Delongpre at the other end.

	DELONGPRE

				DELONGPRE
		Done!

	Delongpre lifts his welder's mask to call to the others when he sees 
	JASON.

				DELONGPRE
		Shit, hurry!

	OUR HEROES

	Run toward the door. But, Thorgan stops.

				BOEMAN
		What...?

	Thorgan turns, runs back toward Jason.

				BOEMAN
		What are you doing?!!

	Thorgan is running to retrieve Kay-Em 14's head. It lies between he and 
	Jason.
	He'll never make it!  Thorgan hits the floor, slides and scoops up the 
	head.

				KAY-EM 14
		I think I'm going to throw up...

	BUT IT'S TOO LATE.

	Jason raises his machete from his belt and --

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		Hey, dickhead!

	JASON TURNS AS --

	KA-CHUNG!!!! Rizzo nails him with a metal ar.

				RIZZO
			(to Thorgan)
		Go!

	Jason stumbles backwards then whirls on Rizzo.

				RIZZO
		Oh, yeah, you remember me.

	He sure does.

	She turnsa dn runs.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As the others race into the engien room they turn to watch.

				BOEMAN
		Hurry!

				DELONGPRE
		Faster! Don't we have another gun?

	Rizzo catches up to Thorgan but they have a long way to go
	and Jason is gaining.

				JANESSA
		They're not gonna make it. Close the door
		before he gets us all.

				DELONGPRE
		They'll make it.

				JANESSA
		Close the fucking door!

				DELONGPRE
		NO!

	JANESSA leaps forward and hits the switch. The door begins sliding 
	slowly shut.

				DELONGPRE
		Damnit!

	Boeman hits the button again.

				DELONGPRE
			(glares at Janessa)
		Forget it. I had to rewire it.
		Once it's started it won't stop.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	JASON

	TWENTY PACES BEHIND

	INT.  ENGINE ROOM

				DELONGPRE
		Get ready to blow it.

	Rizzo dives, slides under the closing door.

	Thorgan follows her lead, but his slide doesn't have the same force. He 
	stops with the door
	coming down on his lower back.

	Luckily, Delongpre snatches his arms and yanks him through.

	The door closes!

				DELONGPRE
		Now!

	Boeman turns the switch.

	INT.  MIDSHIP WALK WAY

	The charges BLOW! A FIREBALL rushes toward the running JASON!

	INT.  ENGINE ROOM

	CLOSE ON DOOR

	AS KA-FWAM!!!

	JASON'S BODY IMPRINTS IN THE NOW SEALED DOOR.

	EXT. GRENDEL

	The walkway explodes, severing Grendel into two separate hulls. 
	The left damaged hull, sinks out of view as the engine side begins
	to pull away. Then --

	KA-FOOM!!

	Grendel's LEFT HULL finallay EXPLODES!! They barely amde it.

	INT.  ENGINE ROOM

	The right hull BUCKS from the force of the blast. Our heroes are 
	aireborne for a moment 
	then crash to the floor.

				BRODSKI
		Damage?

	Boeman climbs to a console.

				BOEMAN
		Minimal.

				RIZZO
		We made it?

				DELONGPRE
		I think...I think maybe we did.

	CHEERS

	Thorgan looks into Kay-Em 14's severed head.

				THORGAN
		Kay-Em we made it!

				KAY-EM 14
		Oh, goody. I'm so pleased.
		I'd clap if I could.

	Boeman CLICKS on a console keyboard.

				BOEMAN
		I've changed the course for Earth II.
		And I sent a distress signal.

				VOICE(V.O.)
		Roger, Grendel. What's the problem?

				BOEMAN
			(into mike)
		Our ship has been damaged, most of
		the crew dead. We need evac.

				VOICE
		Copy that Grendel. Rescue enroute.
		You should hit EARTH II orbit in fifteen
		minutes. Rescue ETA twenty minutes.

	CHEERS!

				BOEMAN
		We're going home people.

	More CHEERS.

	Rizzo turns to find Delonpre staring at her.

				DELONGPRE
			(big smile)
		See? We're not so bad.

				RIZZO
		Not so bad.

	There's that moment when we think the two might kiss. She takes a step
	toward him. Yes, they are going to kiss --

	BOOM!

	WARNING LIGHTS. WARNING ALARMS. The sound of SUCKING WIND. AS JASON,
	still very alive shoves his fist through the imprinted door with his
	metal hand!

	As he rips a bigger hole to gain entrance our heroes are fighting to 
	hold
	on to anything.

	The Hole is sucking everything not tied down out into space.

	Boeman is the first to reach the reactor room door.

				BOEMAN
		This way!

	He pulls Sergeant Brodski through the door as -- 

	JASON

	Fights his way through the opening in the hull.

	The engines BUCK and begin to SMOKE.

				BOEMAN
		The pressures cause the engines to overheat!
		Hurry!

	Delongpre helps Rizzo and Thorgan to safety.

	Janessa crawls across the floor digging her fingers into the steel mesh.

	SERGEANT BRODKSI

	Lying in the door's threshold reaches out and snags her hand.

				JANESSA
		Pull me in!

				BRODSKI
		I'm pulling, damnit!

	But Jason grabs Janessa's ankle and jerks. She's pulled from the 
	Sergeant's
	grasp.

	She flops around in the sucking wind as Jason watches. He lets go.

	She flies toward the hole, slams into it.

	Everything goes quiet for a moment. As he body has sealed the hole then 
	--

	SHHHHHHHHOOOOOK!

	She's sucked into space in a most grotesque manner.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

				BRODSKI
		Well, that's a shame.

	INT. REACTOR CORE

	Hug cylindrical machines run the length of this enormous room.
	They HUM quietly as our group enters.

				BRODSKI
		We need weapons.

				RIZZO
		Weapons? All this technology and
		what good has it done?!

				DELONGPRE
		It bought us some time.

				BOEMAN
		And now we're all out of it.

	Everyone stares at Boeman. He's standing at another console.

				BOEMAN
		The ship's depressurizing, the engines
		overheating. When it  reaches the core,
		we're done.

				RIZZO
		Done?

				THORGAN
		Kaboom.

				DELONGPRE
		Again?! Jesus!

				RIZZO
		Why am I not surprised?

	Thorgan still clutches Kay-Em 14's severed head.

				KAY-EM 14
		You must shut down the engines.

				DELONGPRE
		Then do it. The rescue ship can
		find us here right?

				BRODSKI
		Can't shut em' down from here.

				BOEMAN
		Somebody's gonna have to go back
		to the engine room.

				DELONGPRE
		You ain't catching my ass in there again.

	Brodski, still bleeding, pale, struggling to stand --

				BRODSKI
		I'll go.

	The kids give him the "are you crazy?" stare.

				BOEMAN
		You're too weak. I'll go.

	KA-FWAM! Everyone jumps but this time it's only Rizzo. She broke a metal 
	stand and has
	yanked one of the legs free.

				RIZZO
		You know, this future shit sucks.
		I'll fucking do it.

				DELONGPRE
		You?

				RIZZO
			(mumbling)
		Wait around on your asses all day.
			(turns to Thorgan)
		I'll need a distraction.

				THORGAN
		What kind of a distraction?

	INT. ENGINE ROOM

	JASON is pounding on the reactor room door. A difficult act with the 
	continued pressure 
	trying to suck him into space.

	THEN
				RIZZO
		HEY!

	Jason turns to find Rizzo standing in the doorway behind him. 

				RIZZO
		You want some of me?

	Jason whirls around and lurches toward her clinging to machinery as he 
	goes.


	INT.  ENGINE ROOM CORRIDOR

	Rizzo backs slowly as Jason closes in.

	As he reaches the corridor, she turns and runs.

	RIZZO

				RIZZO
		Come on, keep up.

	Jason barrels toward her.

				RIZZO
		You want some of me or not?

	She stops at a door, but doesn't attmept ot open it.

	Jason comes closer..and closeer...but Rizzo doesn't move --

	Jason moves in for the kill, raises his machete, and --

				RIZZO
		Take your best shot --

	SLASH!

	RIZZO'S CHEST IS SPLIT OPEN!

				RIZZO
			(laughs)
		I'm melting! I'm melting!

	SLASH! Her arm falls to the ground!

				RIZZO
		See now that was stupid.
		Persistent, yes, but stupid.

	Jason shoves his fist, through her chest and into the wall.

				RIZZO
		Not this time, asshole. This time
		I'm gonna watch you burn in hell.

	INT.  ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 

	The real RIZZO rips off her virtual reality helmet.

				RIZZO
		Make it fast. He's coming.

	Delongpre is punching numbers into the keypad. Both are wearing 
	headsets.

				DELONGPRE
		Almost got it.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As Jason returns to the engine room, none too pleased at being tricked.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue
		ship on radar.

				RIZZO
		Delongpre! Out of time!

				DELONPRE
		Got it!

	Rizzo jersk Delonpre and both spill into the reactor
	corridor. Rizzo slaps the panel. the door closes!
	Shutting out Jason's image.

				DELONGPRE
		Damn that was close!

	WHAM!

	THE ENGINE ROOM door RIPS in half. JASON CLIMBS through.

	RIZZO AND DELONGPRE RUN!

				RIZZO
			(into radio)
		Guys, he's right behind us!

		THORGAN(V.O.)
		It's okay.

		DELONGPRE
		Okay?!!

		THORGAN(V.O.)
		Just come on, I've got an idea.

	They race down the long corridor toward the reactor room.
	JASON IN PURSUIT.

	INT. DOCKING BAY

	Thorgan is typing like mad at small portable keyboard.
	Boeman stares out the docking bay window.

	HIS POV 

	There's damage, lots of it.

				BOEMAN
			(into radio)
		The docking bay was damaged after the
		explosion. Meet us at the airlock.

	INT. REACTOR ROOM corridor.

				DELONGPRE
		Got it.
			(to Rizzo)
		You ever space walked?

				RIZZO
		Oh sure, all the time.

	They leap through a door, closing it behind them, then keep running.

	BEHIND THEM

	KA-FWAM! Jason barrels right through the door.

				RIZZO
			(into headset)
		Damit, Thorgan, whatever you're doing...
		you'd better hurry!
			(growls)
		I hate the future!

	INT.  REACTOR CORE

	Rizzo and Delongpre enter in a  mad rush. Delongpre closes the door.
	Little good it'll do.

	INT. REACTOR ROOM CORRIDOR

	JASON kicks the door with his metallic leg!

	KA-FWAM! The door shatters and he stumlbes into --

	EXT.  CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	Forest, cabins, the lake. Everything as we and Jason remember.
	But somehow distroted. A strange hue covers everything.

	No, on second look, it's not exactly the way we remember. The trees are
	strange looking. Not the Pines and Oaks of Connecticut, but something 
	foreign.
	The cabins look a little too advanced to be stuck in the middle of a 
	camp.
	But the image will do.
					QUICK CUT TO:

	INT.  REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY

	Thorgan stands at a keyboard clicking away. Boeman is wearing a space 
	suit.
	He's helping sergeatn Brodski into his.

	At the other end of the huge room, Jason wanders ... with confusion.

				THORGAN
		Don't worry. He can't see us.

	Rizzo glances out the docking bay window.

				RIZZO
		Is that...?

	THROUGH WINDSHIELD

	We see a planet much the same color as Earth, but the continents are 
	wrong.

				DELONGPRE
		Earth II.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Suit up.

	Delongpre leads Rizzo to a suit.

				DELONGPRE
		I'll help you in.

				THORGAN
			(into headset)
		Kay-Em, you've saved our lives,
		you know that don't you?

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Kay-Em 14's head sits on the floor in the center of room.

				KAY-EM 14
		It was my pleasure, my love.
		Perhaps if all works for the best
		you can rebuild me and we can try that
		doggie style thing again.

	DOCKING BAY

	The others stare at Thorgan...he looks embarrassed to say the least.

				DELONGPRE
		I knew you were a little sick, but Geez.

	ON KAY-EM

				KAY-EM 14
			(singing happily)
		I get no kick from champaign, mere
		alcohol doesn't faze me at all,
		but I get a kick out of you.

				THORGAN
			(under his breath)
		Goodbye, my love.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Thorgan, suit up.

				THORGAN
			(to Rizzo)
		This is gonna work. If he sticks to the
		program. Will he? Stick to the program?

				RIZZO
		His mother was killed before his eyes.
		That's what drove him insane. It'll work.

				DELONGPRE
		That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of
		that future shit.

				RIZZO
		Eat me.

	She smiles as she jersk the helmet out of his hand.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Jason slowly walks beside Kay-Em 14.

					QUICK-CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	Jason is walking along the lake when he sees --

	A CAMPFIRE off in the distance. LAUGHTER, SINGING.
	CAMPERS!!!

	He takes off toward the campfire, then hears --

	SPLASHING. 

	He turns.

	HIS POV

	Within the distorted lake, someone is drowning. Could it be a little 
	boy?
	A little Jason from many years ago?

				WOMAN
		Help me!
			(gurgles)
		Jason help me!

	JASON

	Moves toward the beach. Steps partly into the water.

	HIS POV

	THE WOMAN, THE VOICE. IT'S JASON'S MOTHER!

	He turns toward the campfire, back to his mother...what to do?! Then --

	JASON TEARS INTO THE WATER, TRYING TO REACH HER.

				MRS. VOORHEES
		Help me, Jason, please! Help your mother!

	Jason moves closer.

				MRS. VOORHEES
		Don't let me die again!

	As he draws near, she reaches out her hands to him.

	JASON

	Pauses staring at the please for help.

	He stares into her pleading face. HIS MOTHER! After all these years!

	He places his hand over her face, gently, then --

	PUSHES HER UNDER!

	He holds her there.

								QUICK-CUT TO:

	INT. REACTOR ROOM

				KAY-EM 14
		Uh-oh. That's not a part of the program.
		Thorgan, we've got a problem!

	EXT.  CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE 

	Camp Cyrstal lake begins to jerk and fade.

	INT.  REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY

	Everyone is suited up. Delongpre, the last, is adjusting his helmet.

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		Oh, shit. He's going to see us.

				DELONGPRE
		Well, do something!

	Thorgan grabs the portable keyboard and starts typing away!

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	Suddenly the image solidifies then a number of the aliens from the game
	grid appear. But Jason's seen these guys before. He tears through them.

	INT. REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY

				THORGAN
		Shit!

	Boeman hits the door panel to the docking bay. It begins to slowly rise.

				BOEMAN
		Just a little more time.

	EXT.  CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	Jason stands atop a pile of dead alien like some strange Conan in space.
	The image flickers...he  catches a glimpse of our heroes at the end fo 
	the 
	room. He starts toward them.

	Then a huge white fluffy bunny with huge breasts appears before him.

				WHITE FLUFFY BUNNY
			(sings; deep african american voice)
		I'm'a big fluffy bunny...a big white fluffy bunny...

	SWISH! The bunny's head is severed. The image distortss. Again we see 
	our 
	heroes. Jason is closer.

	INT.  REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY

	The door is halway open. Our heroes start ducking under.

	Jason is almost on them.

				RIZZO
		Thorgan!!!!

	He's clicking away like a mad man.

	EXT.  CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	A ROCK BAND appears playing some futuristic metal. Then CHEERLEADERS in 
	scantily clad outfits. Then a MIDGIT in a cowboy hat riding by on a 
	tricycle. We have now entered Thorgan's twisted streams of conciousness.

	Jason tears through the aboe. His goal now clear. The distractions no
	longer fool him.

	A volley ball court appears with naked girls bouncing around.
	A fat man wearing only a spiked leather Speedo. A huge turtle.
	A couple of goats.

	Nothing is stopping Jason.

	INT.  REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY

	Boeman reaches out and jerks Thorgan into the inner air lock.

	EXT.  CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	The image finally disintergrates.

	Jason finds himself staring at our heroes. He lunges for the air lock, 
	but --

	Sergeant Brodski dives, hitting Jason in the chest and knocking him to 
	the
	floor.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Sergeant!

				BRODSKI(V.O.)
		Get out of here!

	SERGEANT BRODSKI, still in Jason's clutches, kicks at the door panel.

	The door starts to close as Jason begins hacking with his machete.

				BRODSKI(V.O.)
		That all you got?!!

	Jason hacks and hack, stabbing through the space suit, until finally, 
	the tough
	old leather neck is silent for good.

	INT.  AIR LOCK

	The door is sealed.

				RIZZO
		He saved our lives.

	Boemen hits another button, and the outer door begins to open.

				DELONGPRE
		Boeman, the ships not here.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Use the thrusters and you'll
		be fine. We'll huddle together
		out there.

	EXT.  WHAT'S LEFT OF THE GRENDEL

	AS THE OUTER DOOR OPENS, RIZZO UNCOMFORTABLY FIDGETS WITH HER SUIT.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Hey, easy now.

	He points to where her hand hovers over some buttons on her sleeve.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		You wanna release your air tanks?

				RIZZO(V.O.)
			(nervous)
		Okay, good tip.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		You'll be fine.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters.
		We'll be fine.

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around.
		So far so good.

	WHAM!

	Jason starts pounding from the other side.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Don't worry. He can't get through that door.

	Delongpre's right. This isn't some thin interior door or some
	walkway door reinforced by a high school kid. This is an air lock
	door. Built to withstand laser cannons and meteors.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Thrusters.

	CHSHSHSHSH. CHSHSH.

	Our group enters deep space.

	EXT.  WHAT'S LEFT OF GRENDEL

	Rizzo, Thorgan, Boeman and Delongpre look tiny next to the massive
	right hull. They thrust slowly into space.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Rizzo, you okay?

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		No I'm not okay! I don't
		know what the hell I'm doing!

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		You're doing fine. I won't let
		anything happen to you, remember?

					QUICK CUT TO:

	INT. DOCKING BAY

	Jason finally gives up with the massive pounding. He steps back.
	Turns, stares at the sergeants' dead body, then looks at --

	THE DOOR PANEL

	He preses the button

	the ari lock door begins to open. Air is suddenly sucked out of the 
	room!

	Sergeant Brodski's body flies out into space. Everything not tied down 
	races out 
	along with him.

	ON KAY-EM 14'S HEAD

	AS it skitters across the floor --

				KAY-EM 14
		Ahhhhh!

	-- and right out the air lock

	JASON 

	holds onto a machine until the door is open, then lets go!
	He shoots out into space.

	EXT. GRENDEL

	Jason flies out of the air lock.

	HIS POV

	He's rocketing right toward one of the space suits!

	ANOTHER ANGLE

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time?

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		I think I had some when I was eight.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Did you like it?

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		I think so, why?

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		He's trying to ask you out on a date.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Shut up, Thorgan!

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		Delongpre, you don't even know me.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		I know you.

	Suddenly Rizzo is SLAMMED from behind. She and Jason go spinning away 
	from
	the others.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Nooooooo!!

	RIZZO

	grapples with Jason, but JASON IS JUST TOO STRONG.

	Jason holds HER with his good hand and REARS his metallic hand back. 
	He's
	going to punch a hole right through her helmet, most likely throat her 
	head,
	when --

	WHAM!

	Delongpre rockets into Jason, but Jason's got one of his arms
	sticking through one of Rizzo's harnesses. THe three go tumbling.

	Delongpre clings to Jason's back.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Rizzo, pull away!

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		I'm stuck!

	Jason reaches back, grabs Delongpre and jersk him over his head until 
	he's holding Delongpre
	around the thoat. He'll pop his helmet like a cork!

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	AS Thorgan and Boeman thrust towards the tumbling mass...

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		We're too far away!

	BACK TO JASON

	AS he tightens his grip around Delongpre's neck. He can't fight back.

	RIZZO is fighting to untangle her harness. We can hear
	Delongpre CHOKING over the radio.

	The three are spinning even closer and closer towards EARTH II.

	Then, Rizzo reaches down. She grabs Delongpre's leg and CLICKS a button 
	on her sleeve.

	KA-CHSSHSH!!!

	HER AIR TANK BLOWS!

	JASON IS THROWN OFF OF THEM!

	But he's still tangled in Rizzo's hoses. And now she has no air.

	Jason turns...grabs the hoses and begins pulling himself
	toward Rizzo and Delongpre.

	He has them...when --

	WHAM!

	BRODSKI

	Still barely alive barrels into Jason, vlinging to his back.
	He turns, slashes with his knife and severs the hoses.

	Jason and Brodski tumble towards EARTH II.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Rizzo's turning blue. She's about to pass out, when --

	Delongpre pulls a hose from his suit and hooks it into her tank.

	CHSHSHSH...

	AIR BEGINS TO FLOW.

	Rizzo takes a big GASP...coughs.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		You okay?!

				RIZZO(V.O.)
			(breathing steadily)
		Oh great...yeah, having a great
		time, and you?

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		No thank you, you crazy old woman.

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		Old woman?

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Well I mean, technically you are old
		enough to be my great, great, great...

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		I get it.

	Suddenly Boeman and Thorgan grab them.  The four survivors huddle 
	together.

				KAY-EM 14
		Hello? A little assistance here?

	They turn to see Kay-Em's head floating close by. Thorgan graps at her 
	and pulls
	her head into his arms.

	THE GROUP CHEERS.

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		Kay-em you okay?

				KAY-EM 14
		I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		I missed you too.

				KAY-EM 14
		I love you.

	Those two aren't the only two.

	CLOSE ON RIZZO AND DELONGPRE

	Their glass face masks are touching. They stare into each other's 
	eyes.

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		Chinese, huh?

	They laugh and turn to stare toward EARTH II.

	EXT.  EARTH II -- ORBIT

	Suddenly Jason's body comes into view. It's racing toward Earth II.
	Brodski riding it like Slim Pickens.

				BRODSKI
		Yeee---Haaaaa!!

	Slowly they begin entering the atmosphere.

	Immediately Brodski is engulfed in flames and is gone. He was a good
	man...stay to the end to make sure the job was done right.

	Spread eagle and alone, facing the planet below, Jason continues his
	descent.

	His fingers wiggle as his chrome mask begins to heat up.
	It begins to glow. His metallic arm and leg glow.

	Flames build as he rockets towards Earth II.

	Flesh BUBBLES and OOZES.

	His legs and arms begin to flail as hunks of burning flesh fall from his 
	body!

	EXT.  CAMP SIGHT

	Four kids sit on futuristic sleeping bags around an old fashion 
	campfire.

				KID # 1
		Hey! Check that out!

	They look up and see a blaze shooting towards Earth II.

				KID # 2
		A falling star!

				KID # 3
		It's a meteor dickhead.

				KID # 2
		It's still cool.

	It LIGHTS up the night, then --

	EXPLODES IN A BRILLIANT FIREWORKS DISPLAY!

				KID # 1
		Cool!!!

	From the explosion, one small smoldering chunk falls toward Earth II.

	EXT.  CRYSTAL RESERVOIR

	OUR POV

	As the chunk falls closer and closer we see that it is a glowing chrome
	hockey mask!

	IT HITS THE WATER with a SSSSS!!!!

	BACK TO KIDS

				KID # 4
		Damn! It his the reservoir.

				KID # 1
		Let's go check it out!

	The others agree as they grab their flashlights and head in toward what
	could be a wonderful new discovery.

								DISSOLVE INTO:

	A STREAM.

	The hockey mask washes down the stream, comes to a halt at a pair of
	grusomely charred hands. 

	THE FINGERS,

	TWITCH, curl around the mask, lifting it off camera. AND WE --

	FADE OUT, a familiar KI-KI-KI-KI-HA-HA-HA-HA, resonating as we --

	THE END
JASON-X
	BY TOD FARMER
	REVISED ROUGH DRAFT
	MAY 24, 1999

	FADE IN:

	DARKNESS.

	A scream rises to an ominous crescendo as we SHOCK CUT INTO -

	MONTAGE of fast moving clips.  Death, destruction, fear.  All images 
	taken from the previous ten Friday The 13ths.  

	AGAIN, DARKNESS.

								OPEN ON:

	The year is 2455. The place is Old Earth. Barren, void of life, a 
	hazardous and violent planet. The sky is blood red with spiked clouds of 
	dark gray.  It is beautiful, but frighteningly foreign.

	BLUE LIGHTNING CRACKLES as several figures rush through a DUST STORM 
	below. 

	Small groups of people, wearing thick dusters, goggles and masks, work 
	nearby. Some dig in the cracked earth, others take assorted readings 
	with strange devices.

	This is an archeological expedition.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  DARK PLACE

	The dust storm rages outside. Two figures are looking closely at a small 
	object buried in the dirt. One of them pulls a device out of their pouch 
	and slowly, gently picks up the object. The other uses a magnetic tool 
	to remove the dirt.

				FEMALE VOICE
		Careful . . .

				MALE VOICE
		I know.

	They take off their masks and goggles. They are both young. ADRIENNE 
	female (17) watches as STONEY male (18) studies the object closely.

				STONEY
			(reading)
		Not guaranteed, if used After 2198.

	CLOSE UP of the object. It's an unopened condom.

				ADRIENNE
			(smiles)
		You thinking what I'm thinking?

	Stoney tosses the high tech equipment over his shoulder and rips open 
	the condom as Adrienne rips her clothes off.

	PULL BACK TO REVEAL

	They are in a half buried mini-van.  It rocks violently from the raging 
	storm outside and from the raging lust inside.

	BACK INSIDE THE VAN.

				ADRIENNE
			(breathless)
		What about Kkinsa?

	STONEY is desperately trying to take off her bra.

				STONEY
		It's over between us. You're the
		only one for me!

	METAL SCREECHES! THE FLOOR COLLAPSES!

	They fall some ten feet, RUBBLE RAINING down on top of them.

	INT.  DARK CORRIDOR

	A rusty metal ladder. Debris everywhere. Half inch layers of dust cover 
	everything. Dead. Lifeless.

				STONEY
		You okay?

	Adrienne sits up, shines her light down the long metal corridor. She 
	turns her light on STONEY then sees something over his shoulder.

	SHE SCREAMS A BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM.

	We PULL BACK, out of the tunnel, through the van as the sounds of the 
	storm drown out ADRIENNE'S SCREAM.

								CUT TO:
	EXT.  BASE CAMP

	The digging and readings have stopped. A group approaches a time scarred 
	shuttle and begin loading their packs into the cargo belly.

	FAT LOU (40), rail thin, possible female, pilot, appears at the top of 
	the shuttle ramp.

				FAT LOU
			(yelling over the wind)
		Let's go! Time to load up!

	YLLO(33), a professor of archaeology lowers his veil. 

				YLLO
			(yelling)
		I'm missing two!

				FAT LOU
		Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have
		left this rock an hour ago!

				BOEMAN
			(eyes a device)
		North three clicks.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. MINI-VAN - DAY

	YLLO and the rest of the group run into view. BOEMAN (18), husky, 
	physical; holds out a device and checks the reading.

	He points to the rusted out mini-van sitting on its belly.

				BOEMAN
			(yelling)
		There!

	KICKER(30), bulky, short on temper, rushes up wearing futuristic 
	military garb -

				KICKER
		Yo, Teach, what the fuck?

				YLLO
		We're missing two of the kids!

				KICKER
		Get your ass back to the shuttle.
		I'll check it out.

	KICKER moves past the group and into the Van.

				YLLO
		Not without me!

	The rest of the gang look at each other and climb into the Van.

	INT. ANCIENT CORRIDOR

	YLLO and the others climb down a rusted ladder. Metallic walls, 
	graffiti, cluttered floors. No Stoney or Adrienne. A sign from the 
	ceiling states -

	CRYSTAL LAKE RESEARCH FACILITY.

	They all take off the goggles and masks. The rest of the group consists 
	of DELONGPRE(18) good looking, smart ass; JANESSA(17) sexual, scheming 
	AZRAEL(17) SMALL, COCKY; KKINSA(16), insecure, problematic; 
	THORGAN(17), a nerd but doesn't know it.

				YLLO
		Amazing! But, how . . I've been coming
		here for ten years. We never picked this up on
		our . . . KAY-EM?

	KAY-EM 14, a cybernetics science droid, removes her veil. She's 
	gorgeous, but there's something off about her look. Something synthetic.

				KAY-EM 14
		The air's laced with type two ozone,
		it reads as a solid.

				THORGAN
		Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.

				KAY-EM 14
		In twenty-eighty-two many of the survivors moved
		their facilities underground to escape . . .

				KICKER
		All right, all right, enough with the history
		lesson. Lets find these two quick . . so I can kick
		some little punk ass.

	Kkinsa shines a flashlight around the dark tunnel.

				KKINSA
		I have an idea, why don't you go find
		them and we'll get the hell out of here!

	KKINSA turns and finds herself face to face with - -

	A CORPSE! Easily two-hundred years old it hangs from the wall, impaled 
	through the forehead by an iron spike. 

	KKINSA SCREAMS!

	Kicker yanks a weapon from his back, locks and loads as 

	JANESSA falls back and lands in the lap of another corpse. She screams! 

	KAY-EM 14 SCREAMS at the top of her lungs. Everyone looks at the droid.

				KAY-EM 14
		Was that out loud?

				DELONGPREE
		Thorgan, have you been screwing with . . .

	THORGAN grabs the head off the CORPSE, with the spike through it's head.

				THORGAN
		Cool! This is an automatic "A".

	Azrael dumps the contents of his bag on the ground, an old boot, some 
	cds, and an ancient box of PLAYTEX . . . starts shoving the corpse into 
	his pack.
				AZRAEL
		I've got my project. What are you losers
		gonna do?

				KICKER
		Back to the shuttle! All of you!
		I'll find them.

				YLLO
		Relax, Soldier boy, this is amazing.
		These remains are two hundred years old.

	Yllo's light hits a sign hanging from the ceiling. DANGER. STAY OUT.

				BOEMAN
		Creepy.

				THORGAN
		Cool.

				KKINSA
		Okay, I'm outta here.

				YYLO
		Kay-Em, any thoughts?

				KAY-EM 14
		Girth is better than length and
		women prefer a shaved scrotum during
		oral sex.

	Yllo glares a Thorgan.

				THORGAN
		I'm trying to give her some personality.

				YLLO
		Well stop messing with her. I don't want
		a science droid with a personality. Now
		let's find them and get back. I want to
		get clearance to stay back and study this . . .

				KKINSA
		No way! I'm not staying here any longer . . .
		I have a life you know.

	A radio crackles.

				FAT LOU(V.O.)
		Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze!
		Get your ass back hre!

				YLLO
			(into radio)
		Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it.
		You won't believe what we found.
			(calls out)
		Adrienne! Stoney!

	Yllo rushes past the corpse. The others reluctantly follow. They pass 
	another hanging sign - Danger - THEY PASS ANOTHER CORPSE LYING ON THE 
	FLOOR, it's torso separated from it's legs. And this is just the 
	beginning. As they move down the corridor there are bodies everywhere.

				BOEMAN
		There was a hall of a battle down here.

	S they move further they break a laser beam . . . sparks fly. A WARNING 
	VOICE sounds.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Dan-danger. Do not enter-er.

	But the group keeps moving. 

				KKINSA
		I feel compelled to ask why we are
		ignoring that.

	A corpse lies on the floor before them, it's skeletal hand beneath a 
	warning written in ancient blood . . .

	HELP ME . . .

	Suddenly another CORPSE LEAPS at them, screaming like a banshee! 
	Everyone SCREAMS - It lands on Kkinsa, who totally freaks trying to get 
	the corpse off her. 

	DELONGPREE and YLLO help Kkinsa fight the rotting corpse. They hear 
	hysterical laughter and look up to see -

	ADRIENNE and STONEY . . . emerge from the shadows laughing 
	uncontrollably.

				DELONGPREE
		Damnit!

				YLLO
		What the hell are you two doing?!

	Kkinsa eyes Adrienne, then glares at Stoney.

				KKINSA
		You're toast, mister.

				YLLO
		You're both toast!

				ADRIENNE
		You gotta see this!

	They turn down the right corridor, passing beneath ceiling consisting of 
	a jumbled mess of jagged metal.

				THORGAN
			(re: ceiling)
		That's a strange design, don't you think?

				KICKER
		We don't have time for this shit.

	As they pass we see a section of the jagged metal ceiling twitch and 
	squeeze together. That can't be a good thing . . .

	STONEY and Adrienne stop at a huge metal door. Above the door . . . 
	CRYOGENICS LAB.

	Adrienne points to a small window in the door.

				DELONGPREE
		Yeah, so? I had Cryo 101 last year.

				ADRIENNE
		Check it out.

	With a smirk, Adrienne wipes the condensation from the small window in 
	the door. Drawn from the inside, in blood, is a final warning -

	A SKULL AND CROSSBONES 

				KKINSA
		So don't open the door.

				ADRIENNE
		Look beyond it, yesterday's news.

	Yllo pushes his way to the window.

	Shocked faces.

	INSIDE the blue tinted room we see a huge domed Cryo cylinder. It's 
	massive, but our attention is pulled to the corner of the room. Curled 
	up into a ball, is a body - female, young.

				YLLO
		Is that?

				KAY-EM 14
		The room's still operational.
		She's perfectly preserved.

	Yllo's face lights up, grabs his radio.

				YLLO
			(into radio)
		Fat Lou, bring the ship to the
		following coordinates. Call Grendel,
		have them power up the labs, we're bringing
		in the find of the century!

				KICKER
		Now wait a minute! I don't think you
		should open that door.

				YLLO
		This is a science excursion corporal.
		Just stay out of the way.

	Yllo turns to the kids. He's very excited.

				YLLO
		Okay, no screwing around. This is the real
		thing. Do exactly what I say. Okay Thorgan, 
		open it up.

	Thorgan pops the cover from a control panel and hooks up a small gadget.

				KKINSA
		You're opening the door?
		What about the . . . ?

	She points to the skull and crossbones. 

				DELONGPREE
		I'm thinking we should call in some
		experts.

				YLLO
		This is your find people. You want to
		give your credit away?

				DELONGPREE
		I was just saying . . .

				THORGAN
		The cryo unit leaked. The computers
		sealed the room. No airborne viruses
		no hazardous materials. I've shut down the
		until. Alright, stand back. 

				KAY-EM 14
		Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses
		will render you unconcious.

				DELONGPREE
		Knock you on your ass pal. 

	They don their face masks as  . . . Fshhhhhshshsh. The metallic door 
	cracks open causing a powerful backdraft. The freezing cold air mixes 
	with the air outside the chamber creating a strange gray gas. Ice 
	crystals crack and fall to the floor.

	EXT.  CRYO CELL

				YLLO
		Kay-Em!

	Kay moves into the room ahead of the others.

	INT.  CRYO CELL

	CLOSE ON KAY-EM'S EYES

	They are not human. Mechanical, digital, but alluring. They dilate, open 
	up. Colored lasers shoot forth, slicing through the gas, scanning the 
	body.

	--which itself is slumped over. An icicle of frozen blood from, the 
	wound in her shoulder, props the body up.

	The other enter the icy chamber.

				DELONGPREE
		I speak on behalf of the group
		when I say . . . that's fucked.

				KAY-EM 14
		Female, nineteen years old, eight months . . .
		34-26-34 . . . bitch is built like a brick
		shit house.

				YLLO
		Thorgan?!!!

				THORGAN
		Sorry. I'll fix her when we get back.

				KAY-EM 14
		Time of hibernation 2049.
		Crystallization at seventeen percent.
		Suggest extensive Nanotech. Chances of
		rejuvenation eight-one percent.

				KKINSA
		What's going on?

				DELONGPREE
		She's dying.

				JANESSA
		Bitch looks dead to me.

	The RADIO CRACKLES . . .

				SERGEANT BRODSKI(V.O.)
		Yllo, Sergeant Brodski. Get your ass
		back to the shuttle!!

				YLLO
		Janessa, stretcher.
			(into radio)
		Keep your shirt on, sergeant. We have
		a medical emergency here not tot mention the
		discovery of a lifetime.

				SERGEANT BRODSKI(V.O.)
		Kicker! Get them the hell out of there!

	Janessa removes a Metallic cube from her backpack, clicks a button and a 
	flat stretcher expands and hovers a few feet off the ground.

	Kicker grabs Yllo.

				KICKER
		We're outta here!

	Yllo pulls away, leans over the frozen girl, grabs the frozen string of 
	blood and -CRACK-breaks it off.

				YLLO
		Fine, grab that end.


	Kicker sighs and helps Yllo lift the frozen girl and place her curled 
	body on the stretcher.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As thorgan stands at the massive Cryo-Unit -

				THORGAN
		Hey check this out!

	Protruding from the door is the tip of a machete.

				THORGAN
		This caused the leak and there's an
		occupant. 

	Thorgan yanks the door open.

				KICKER
		Don't touch that!

	Gas rolls out. Suddenly ALARMS SOUND and LIGHTS STROBE.

				KKINSA
		This is bad, no?

				THORGAN
		Relax, it's only a  glitch in the
		system. 

				JANESSA
		First field trip and you think
		you're a Scientist. Move out of the
		way geek. 

	JANESSA moves to look inside the chamber. 

	As the gas and steam clear - we hear the sound of CRACKING ICE, see a 
	jagged mass of frozen crystals . . . and within it . . . a body. A chunk 
	of ice CRACKS and falls tot he floor then THE MASK of JASON VOORHEES 
	looms forward!

	JANESSA screams as JASON'S BODY, stiff as a board, CRASHES to the ground 
	sending ice shrapnel everywhere!

				DELONGPREE
		Jesus, used to make the suckers big
		didn't they?

	Again, Kay-Em's eyes scan the frozen body.

				KAY-EM 14
		Subject was dead prior to incubation.

	Yllo moves to get a good look at Jason.

				YLLO
		My God, look at him. Why would they freeze
		a dead body?
			(a beat)
		Alright, load him up, and let's get out
		of here!

	OVER HIS SHOULDER - HALL

	A pair of three foot metallic spiders drop on thin wires to the floor.

	BACK INSIDE 

	One of Boeman's gadgets starts to BEEP.

				BOEMAN
		Er, guy? I'm picking up some movement.

	FZZZZT . . . Azrael screams as a laser slices into the room. His left 
	arm falls to the ground!

	Kay-Em rushes to him. Her finger pops open. A needle appears. She 
	injects him. The drugs take immediate effect.

				AZRAEL
		Cool . . . check out my arm.

	CLINK - CLINK, CLINK, CLINK, CLINK.

	HALL

	The metallic spiders, lasers attached to their bodies, CLANK towards our 
	heroes. 

				YLLO
		Kicker!

				KICKER
		Defense droids. I'm on it.

	Kicker slams the Cryo door shut as lasers slice into it.


				KKINSA
		There goes prom night.

	Kicker clicks at a gadget attached to his forearm.

				KICKER
		They're only class two. I can
		handle this. No problem.

				AZRAEL
		Not a problem?!

	Kay-Em injects him again.

				AZRAEL
		I'm missing a fucking arm heeeerrrr-
			(re:shot)
		Oh, that's dreamy.

	The lasers begin strategically slicing through hinges.

				JANESSA
		Okay rent-a-cop, do your shit.
		I gotta date tonight.

				KICKER
		Stand back!

	He pulls a gadget from his pack, punches in a series of buttons.

				YLLO
		We have to get these two back in one piece!

	Kay-Em turns to the frozen girl.

				KAY-EM 14
		Subject is critical. Needs nano stabilization
		immediately.

				YLLO
		Kicker! Do something!

				ADRIENNE
		Oh Gawd! I wish it would stop doing that.

	At her feet, Azrael's arm twitches spastically.

				AZRAEL
			(drugged up)
				That is soooo cool!

	Kicker cracks the door and tosses his gadget.

	KAFOOM!

				KICKER
				Come on!

	Kicker throws open the door and starts BLASTING! Yllo and the kids 
	follow him into the hall, the two stretches in tow. They disappear 
	around the bend - towards the exit.

	A beat then . . . screaming. They run back into view. Behind them - -

	CLINK, CLINK, CLINK, CLINK, CLINK.

	A dozen laser wielding spiders make chase! Some are old and rusty, other 
	slump over and short out, but those that work . . . work well.

	INT.  LONG CORIDOOR

	Kicker is running backwards, BLASTING with his weapon. Lasers FLASHING 
	all around our group. 


				KKINSA
		Have I told you guys how much I hate this class?

				KICKER
		We need another exit! I'll hold 'em off!
		Teach, find a way out!

				BOEMAN
		I'm on it!

				KICKER
		Sorry kid, leave this to the pros.

				BOEMAN
			(re: gadget)
		Left at the end of the hall!

	A laser strikes the body of Jason Voorhees, breaking off a chunk of ice.

				THORGAN
			(reading from device)
		They're not after us. Their sensors are
		locked in on . . . him!

	Thorgan points to JASON'S STRETCHER.

				KICKER
		Leave him behind!

				YLLO
		No! He's coming with us!

	They round a corner . . .

				BOEMAN
		Here. We're one meter from the surface!

				KICKER
		Then duck.

	CHA-CHUNK . . he cocks his grenade launcher and fires at the ceiling.

	KABLOOM!! Rocks and falling debris reveal the violent surface above.

				DELONGPREE
		It's too high!

	Kicker rolls around the corner and starts blasting!

				KICKER
		Make it happen!

				JANESSA
		They're just subclass B droids.
		I'm so not impressed.

				BOEMAN
		Stoney, you catch.

	Stonet leaps, grabs the lip and tosses his feet up and over in a very 
	acrobatic move.

	Boeman kneels, cups his hands to make a step. He begins tossing his 
	friends up to Stoney as Kicker makes war in the hall!

	Soon, Boeman and Kicker are the only two left.

				BOEMAN
		We're clear! Let's go!

	Boeman leaps up, grabs the lip and pulls himself to safety. 
	He spins around and holds his arm out for Kicker.

	Kicker leaps, grabs Boeman's hand. Boeman strains to pull him up as 
	spider's cover the floor below them, then -

	A spider crawls up Kicker's leg - a spike shoots out into Kicker's 
	thigh. He screams.

				KICKER
		They've got me! Let go!

				BOEMAN
		No!

	Boeman ROARS and pulls harder. Kicker's pack RIPS from his body - the 
	spiders falling with the pack.

	EXT. SURFACE - DAY

	The sand storm is raging on the surface. Kicker lands on top of Boeman.

				BOEMAN
		That wasn't so bad.

	Kicker bites the pin from a grenade, tosses it into the hole.

				KICKER
			(yells)
		This will be!

	The others dive for the ground as -  - 

	KAFOOM! A FIREBALL rises up out of the hole!

				THORGAN
		Nice touch.

				BOEMAN
		And you said high school was boring.

	Our team fights the winds and rushes up the ramp of the waiting shuttle.

	FAT LOU is waiting at the ramp. He looks at the two stretchers.

				FAT LOU
		Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .

				YLLO
		Just get us to the ship!

	Azrael stops in a panic!

				AZRAEL
		Oh shit I forgot my arm!

				ADRIENNE
		Here. Dumbass.

	She hands him the severed limb as they race up the ramp.

	The door closed, the SHUTTLE LIFTS OFF THE GROUND and soars into the 
	sky.

								CUT TO:

	EXT.  ORBIT AROUND OLD EARTH - LATE

	THE SHUTTLE maneauvers through the junk that now floats in orbit. Old 
	satellites, the front quarter of a Space Shuttle, etc.

	INT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT

	Navigating through the debris, FAT LOU grabs a radio mike.

				FAT LOU
		This is Beowulf approaching from
		sector fifteen.

	Through the front windshield we see - - 

	GRENDEL, a class IV Catamaran Transport. It looks like two huge 
	torpedoes attached by three thin walkways. Not new, but by no means old.

				BERNIE(V.O.)
		I've got you, Beowulf. Proceed with docking.
		And by the way, Brodski's pissed.

	INT.  DOCKING BAY

	The shuttle doors open revealing SERGEANT BRODSKI and six E-X GRUNTS 
	standing with weapons at the ready.

	As the group gather their equipment and begin to move the two 
	stretchers, Brodski stepsi n front of YLLO.

				BRODSKI
		What the hell were you thinking?

	YLLO ignores him, turns to his team.

				YLLO
		Get them in the lab!

				BRODSKI
		Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.

	The E-X Grunts step in front of kids.

				YLLO
			(to the grunts)
		Back off!

				YLLO
			(back to the kids)
		Get them to the labs . . . Now!

	The team moves through the Grunts.

				YLLO
		What the hell are you doing?

	Brodski looks down at the stretcher with the young woman's body on it.

				BRODSKI
		My god! This is way over your head, pal.
		We need to call some experts and . . .

				YLLO
		I am an expert!

				BRODSKI
		You're a teacher.

				YLLO
		Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me.
		She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab,
		she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking
		head!

				BRODSKI
		What if they're carrying? Did you even check?

				KAY-EM 14
		Subjects scan virus clean . . .

	Brodski attempts to shove Kay-Em out of his way . . . BUT she stands her 
	ground . . . grabs his crotch.

				KAY-EM 14
		Mmm, you like the rough stuff don't you, big boy?

	Brodski and Yllo look at Thorgan.

				BRODSKI AND YLLO
		Thorgan!!

				THORGAN
		Sorry . . . I'll fix her . . . I promise.

				BRODSKI
		How do you know that piece of cursed rock down
		there doesn't carry something metal tits can't
		detect?

				YLLO
		Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.

				BRODSKI
		Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.

				YLLO
		I don't give a shit. This one's prime for
		decryonization. We're brining her back.

				BRODSKI
		I still think we should send for a team of
		real scientists.

				YLLO
		I am a scientist you asshole! This could be
		the most important discovery in 400 years. Do
		you have any idea what a find like this could
		mean?

				BRODSKI
		Right now, I care only for the safety of this
		crew. You don't know anything about these two -

	The stretcher with JASON moves by them. Brodski looks down.

				BRODSKI
		Jesus what the hell is that?

				YLLO
		That's exactly what we need to find out.
		Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you
		where discovery is concerned. Now step aside.
		I have a medical emergency to deal with.

	Reluctantly, Brodski steps aside. As the kids follow, Azrael bumps into 
	DALLAS, one of the E-X GRUNTS. Azrael glares at him, brandishing the 
	severed limb.

				AZRAEL
		Watch it punk, I'm armed.

				DALLAS
		Punk?

	Dallas slaps Azrael across the back of the head as he passes.

				AZRAEL
		You'll pay for that.

	Dallas and the grunts laugh.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE

	FAT LOU and BERNIE, a synthetic pilot existing only from the waist up in 
	his pilot's chair, set course for home.

				BERNIE
		Gravitation nominal. Thrusters engaged.

				FAT LOU
			(into radio)
		Grendel to Grendel's mother, we are enroute.

				GRENDEL'S MOTHER(V.O.)
		Copy that, Grendel. Computer ovverides deployed.
		See you in two days.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  LABS

	Dark, quiet, until the lights glare on.

	LAB ONE doubles as a Medical Research center and Sick Bay. GLASS JARS 
	filled with some of the strangest creatures ever seen cover the back 
	wall.

	Yllo and the students bring the girl in. Their movements are hurried and 
	economical . . .but they're excited.

				YLLO
		Get her prepped for the soup.
			(to Adrienne)
		Take the other one to lab two.

				ADRIENNE
		Yllo, this is my find. My project.
		I want to be in here.

				YLLO
		I know, dear, but this is too big a 
		discovery. I need you to prep the second
		body.

				ADRIENNE
		But, I want . . .

				YLLO
		This is a discovery that we will all share.
		We have to work as  a team. Now go. Stoney
		go with her.

	Thorgan and Delongpre lift the Girl onto the rejuvenation table.

	Stoney whispers something to Kkinsa before he exits with Adrienne.

	Kkkinsa nods and wheels a huge SCANNING MACHING over to the Girl. She 
	starts the scan as Delongpree and Thorgan cut the clothes off their 
	"find".

				THORGAN
		Have I told you guys how much I love this class?

	Delongpree brushes some of the melting crystals from her face.

				DELONGPREE
		She's beautiful . . .

	Thorgan cuts her shirt off.

				THORGAN
		Damn! Talk about your hard nipples.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Adrienne and Stoney push Jason into the lab.

	LAB TWO is smaller and less high-tech than LAB one. They shove JASON'S 
	body onto the EXAM TABLE. 

				ADRIENNE
		Fucking Yllo! Thinks he can push me aside.
		This is my find!

	She removes chucks of ice from JASON'S FACE.

				STONEY
		You know even though we both found this guy ,
		I'll let you take the credits. You can take it 
		from here.

				ADRIENNE
		Oh thanks . . . fine go. It's just another
		dissection. You'll only get in my way.

				STONEY
		Cool. Besides, you're into this shit.

	Stoney leaves Adrienne alone with Jason . . . and he is THAWING.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Yllo walks around the room, overseeing all the action. He's excited and 
	cocky.

				YLLO
		Hands on training is rare. You should consider
		yourself lucky.

				AZRAEL
		Lucky?!

	Azrael sits in a large machine. This is . . .

	The NANO-TECH 2000. It can repair non-fatal injuries with the use of 
	Nano-Technology. 

	Azrael is scanned by the NT-2000 and so is his injury. It goes into 
	action as articulated mechanics begin to re-attach his arm.

				AZRAEL
		Another hour and I'd have lost
		the arm.

				JANESSA
		Oh, was that the hand you beat off with?

				AZRAEL
		I better get extra credit for this shit.

				YLLO
		Delongpree, Status. How you doing?

	Delongpree cuts her underpants from her body and tosses them over his 
	shoulder.

				DELONGPREE
			(swallows hard)
		I'm Okay.

				STONEY
		Well she's definitely a blond.

				JANESSA
		Oh that's scientific.

				DELONGPREE
		You think all girls from the past
		looked this good?

				JANESSA
		She's not that great.

				THORGAN
		400 years . . . I bet she'll be horny.

				YLLO
		Okay, people, we need to Learn everything
		there is to learn about our two guests. And
		if all goes well, I'll mention each one of
		you when I make my nobel prize speech.

				DELONGPREE
			(underbreath)
		Yeah, right.

	Delongpre presses a button on the table. The edges of the table RISE UP 
	to create a clear dome around the table. A hot gel-like substance shoots 
	out of small tubes. The FROZEN BODY is covered in the NANO-GEL.

	Thorgan checks a monitor.

				THORGAN
		Everything looks good.

	Yllo smiles - gushing self-satisfaction.

				YLLO
		Turn up the heat.

	Adrienne is wearing a metal eyepiece while staring at a computer screen. 
	No hands. 

				ADRIENNE
		Done. Crystallization remains
		seventeen percent.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Adrienne scans Jason with a machine identical to the one Kkinsa was 
	using in LAB ONE.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Crystallization at sixty percent
		Subject classification . . . deformity.

				ADRIENNE
		Put it on the screen.

	A monitor lights up with a scan of Jason's body. The internal organs are 
	distorted and bloated. She keys into the next lab. 

	Back to lab one.

				ADRIENNE(V.O.)
			(over speaker)
		Guys, check out beef-cakes scan.

	Jason's 3-D scan appears on one of the big monitors.

				ADRIENNE(V.O.)
		Look at the brain.

	Within Jason's skull is a brain the size of a golf-ball.

				JANESSA
		It's just like Thorgan's.
		What do you think this means?

	Thorgan grabs his crotch.

				THORGAN
		This is what it means right here.

				JANESSA
		Small brains make your balls itch?

				DELONGPRE
		And what's with the headgear?

				KAY-EM 14
		The mask is an artifact from a
		sport outlawed in twenty-twelve.

				BOEMAN
		Hockey.

				KAY-EM 14
		A medieval sport where two teams
		club one another with elongated
		sticks. Very sexy.

				YLLO
		What do you expect from a culture that
		sucked its planet dry of resources.

	She eyes Stoney. He smiles knowingly.

				KKINSA
		This bores me.

				DELONGPRE
		She's red. Body temp 98.6. This
		is so cool.

				YLLO
		Prep defib and start the cell 
		reconstruction.

	KAY-EM 14 presses a series of buttons. A long needle punctures the 
	GIRL'S NECK. Jason's scan is replaced by the girl's. We see 
	Nanotechnology going to work replacing her wounds and damaged cells.

				THORGAN
		Cool!

	Kkinsa and Stoney back out of the room unnoticed.

				YLLO
		Is she stable?

				KAY-EM 14
		Subject is stable and cell
		reconstruction has begun.

				DELONGPRE
		Now what?

				YLLO
		We wait. I need about fifteen.
		Call me if there are any changes.
		If she farts I want a full report.

				AZRAEL
		Don't I deserve a sick day or some
		shit like that?

	Yllo exits.
								CUT TO:

	INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

	The door swishes open. Stoney enters with Kkinsa close behind. Kkinsa 
	raises her hand.

				KKINSA
		Adrienne?! Of all people!

				STONEY
		You're jealous.

	Stoney moves back. Kkinsa moves close hand raises above her head.

				KKINSA
		Adrienne?!

				STONEY
		It's over between us. You're the
		one I want.

	Kkinsa grabs the back of her shirt and pulls it over her head.

				KKINSA
		Bed!

	A bed slides out from the wall, hitting Stoney in the back of the legs, 
	causing him to fall on the bed. Kkinsa straddles him. Stoney grabs her. 
	The two fall into a feverish kiss.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Adrienne is prepping various medical tools. JASON'S BODY is laying on an 
	autopsy table. Steam rises from his body as thick ooze drips from his 
	thawing flesh.

	She turns on a computer monitor.

				ADRIENNE 
		Prepare organ vats.

	Two metal sinks hiss as liquid nitrogen flows.

				ADRIENNE
		Okay big boy . . . 

	She picks up a long, sharp chrome tool and walks over to Jason's body.

				ADRIENNE
			(continuing)
		. . . let's see what you're made of.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  YLLO'S CABIN

	Yllo enters and approaches a computer console. The door behind him 
	opens. Janessa enters.

				JANESSA
		All this science shit, makes me horny.
			(removes her shirt)
		Take off your cloths, we don't have much
		time.

	She drops her shirt to the floor. Yllo retrieves it, hands it back.

				JANESSA
		You're quicker than usual.

				YLLO
		Later.

				JANESSA
		You prefer an apple?

	He forces her into the hall, closes the door, locks it. He returns to 
	the console.

				YLLO
			(to console)
		Secure line. Perez, Joshua,
		Solaras Space Lab. Connect.

	EXT.   SOLARAS SPACE LAB - EST.

	A huge cylindrical ship, floats quietly. We hear a BEEPING sound.

	INT.   SOLARAS SPACE LAB - PEREZ QUARTERS

	Joshua Perez rolls over, clicks on a light. He fumbles for a button, 
	presses it. A wall monitor lights up revealing Yllo's face.

	INTERCUT AS NEEDED

				PEREZ
		You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?

				YLLO
		We just left old Earth. You'll never believe
		what we found.

	Yllo inserts a disk into the console.

				YLLO
		I'm sending you the files.

				PEREZ
			(testy)
		Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient
		Farrari . . .

		YLLO
		Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels.
		See what kind of payday we're looking at.

				PEREZ
			(begins download)
		Alright, I'm . . .
			(reacts to file)
		No way . . . is this a joke?

	Yllo smiles.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Adrienne leans over JASON'S THAWING body. Oozing goo drips from the 
	slab.

	She is inches away from his steaming mask. She taps it with her tool.

	She begins working at the straps of the mask, cutting the overgrown 
	flesh away.

	INT.  YLLO'S CABIN

	Yllo studies a monitor. On screen: a document entitled, EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS 
	OF DISCOVERY. He talks on the secure line.

				YLLO
		Hypothetically, how much are we talking?

				PEREZ(V.O.)
		If you're for real, you're looking at a million
		credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include
		touring and guest lectures. When can you get them
		here?

				YLLO
		I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?

				PEREZ(V.O.)
		See you then . . . doctor.

	Yllo's face glows with thoughts of fame and fortune.

					QUICK CUT TO:

	INT.  HALL OUTSIDE YLLO'S QUARTERS

	Janessa has hooked up a small device to the door. She's heard every 
	word.

	INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

	Kkinsa rips off Stoney's shirt. Stoney grab her and rolls on top of her.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	CLOSE ON JASON'S HAND - it curls, the frozen joints CRACKLE.

	Adrienne turns from Jason's mask. A large wad of goo hits the floor. She 
	turns back to her work. Slicing flesh away from the mask.

	INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

	Stoney and Kkinsa kiss passionately as they wrestle to get each other's 
	pants off.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Adrienne tries to pry the Mask off . . . but it holds firm.

	She stick s a long sharp tool into an eye hole. We hear disgusting 
	noises as she probes JASON'S EYE SOCKET.

	She removes the tool, and on the end is Jason's eye!

	Holding it close she looks at it. It is bloated and distorted. She drops 
	it in a specimen jar and takes it over to her work station.

	INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

	Kkinsa rolls on top of Stoney. She holds his arms down as she whispers 
	in his ear.

				KKINSA
		How bad do you want it?

	Stoney gets his arms free and rolls on top of her.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	JASON'S LEG JERKS!

	Adrienne turns again, then approaches.

				ADRIENNE
		Interesting. Record. Thawing has
		caused possible muscle spasms.

	She frowns at the disgusting ooze. A mixture of swamp waters, blood, and 
	other thawing bodily fluids, puddle around Jason's body.

	She moves back to her work station and picks up JASON'S BLOATED EYE. She 
	takes out an autopsy laser and cuts through the center of the eye.

	The laser slices through the fatty tissue as thick black goop drips out 
	of the eye. Adrienne stares into a microscope. This is all very 
	interesting.

	INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

	Stoney lies on top of Kkinsa.

				KKINSA
		Yes . . . yes . . . that's it!

	. . . a moment, then both GASP as he enters her.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	JASON sits up!

	CLOSE on ADRIENNE as she studies the dripping eye. She puts the laser 
	down and turns to the slab and freezes.

	JASON IS GONE!

	She spins around only to find Jason standing behind her. He grabs her by 
	the throat! She can't scream. She kicks wildly as he studies her.

					QUICK CUT TO:

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Delongpre, Boemen, Kay-Em 14 and Thorgan wait and watch girl in the 
	NANO-GEL. Thorgan is getting impatient. He can't find something.

				THORGAN
		Anybody seen the reticulator?

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Adrienne is thrown into a work light. The room goes dark. 

	INT.  LAB ONE

				DELONGPRE
		Try next door, there was one there
		yesterday.

	Thorgan exits.

	INT.  LAB TWO'S OBSERVATION ROOM

	The lights go. Thorgan looks around. Through the thick glass, where 
	JASON is killing Adrienne, is blackness.

				THORGAN
		Wakey wakey love birds . . . Yllo's
		gonna be pissed if he catches you fooling
		around instead of working.

	Thorgan roots through a drawer, his back to the glass.

	ANTE ROOM

	Through the glass beside him we see Adrienne screaming. But NO SOUND. 
	All rooms are air tight. Her head is smashed on the glass!

	Still screaming, her face recedes back into the darkness as Thorgan 
	looks over his shoulder.

				THORGAN
		Bye, lovebirds . . . Stoney, you dog.

	He exits.

	BACK TO JASON

	As he - -

	DUNKS Adrienne's head INTO ONE OF THE METAL SINKS. Her body goes limp. He 
	pulls her head up and stares at her frozen head, eyes open, mouth locked 
	in a scream.

	He thumps the head against a wall. IT SHATTERS! Jason drops the body 
	with a thud then turns to the - -

	DISSECTION TOOLS. He chooses a long silver cleaver.

	JASON'S BACK!

	EXT.  LAB ONE CORRIDOR

	Jason walks into the corridor from LAB TWO, steam still rising from his 
	cold body. He heads away from LAB ONE as soon as he's out of sight, YLLO 
	appears.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Delongpre wakes as Yllo enters.

				YLLO
		All right, lets do this. Thorgan
		begin the Defib program, Delongpre,
		ready the drainage units. Boerman get the
		others in here.

	Boeman grabs a wall mike.

	INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

	Kkinsa straddles Stoney.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		We've got a heartbeat!

	Her back arches in ecstasy.

				KKINSA
		No shit, we've got a heart beat!

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Stoney, you copy? She's awake.
		You coming?

				STONEY
		Hell yeah I'm coming!

				KKINSA
		No . . . not yet!

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Yes, right now!

				STONEY
		YES !!!

				KKINSA
		NO!!! NO!!! NO!!! YES!!!

				STONEY
		YES!!!!!!

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Stoney, put your pants on and get
		your ass down here!

	They jump up grab their clothes and rush to the door. Stoney hits the 
	door release and the door SWISHES open revealing - -

	JASON VOORHEES!

	Standing in the hall. He swings the silver cleaver.

	Stoney sidesteps as Kkinsa SCREAMS. Stoney SLAMS his palm into the door 
	panel. The door SWISHES to close but Jason's hand reaches out and stops 
	it.

	ENGINES WINE as JASON STRUGGLES to force the door open.

	Stoney keeps POUNDING the panel, trying to make the door close but 
	Jason's too strong!

	Jason grabs Stoney by the arm, jerks him into the doorway and releases 
	the door.

	The door closes! Splitting Stoney from forehead to crotch!

	Splashed with blood, Kkinsa falls to the floor cowering . . .
	mumbling nonsensically. 

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Yllo, Janessa, Thorgan, Boemen and Delongpre anxiously huddle around the 
	Frozen Girl's body. Probes dangle in the gel.

				YLLO
		It's time.

				DELONGPRE
		What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?

				YLLO
		I've waited long enough.
		Kay . . . you know what to do.

	Kay presses buttons. We hear the whine of something powering up . . .

	Brodski enters the lab.

				YLLO
		What the hell are you doing?

				BRODSKI
		My job.

				YLLO
		Fine, just stay out of my way.
			(turns to Kay)
		Hit it. 

	An electrical noise flares THE SCREEN TO WHITE:

								SMASH CUT TO:

	INT.  DARK CORRIDOR

	OUR VIEW FROM A JERKY POV

	Running, freshly killed bodies at our feet. HEAVY BREATHING.

	Small fists beat against a door.

				GIRL'S VOICE
		Mom! Dad! It's loose! He's loose!

	The door swishes open revealing the dead bodies of a couple in their 
	forties.

	CLOSE ON THE GIRL

	We recognize her as the frozen girl. Her name, RIZZO (18), pretty.
	She screams. Turns.

	HER POV

	Standing at the end of the corridor, back lit and ominous is JASON 
	VOORHEES! He marches towards her.

	She runs. Snatches a headset from a wall mount.

				RIZZO
		Help me! Anyone! Somebody help me!

	STATIC from the radio. Jason closing.

	She reaches down and grabs a shot gun from a dead Security Guard. Chick-
	chick. KABLAM!

	Jason keeps coming.

	She runs.

	As she rounds a corner, we  see - -

	CRYOGENICS LAB

	She opens the door and enters the cold room. Slips on the wet frozen 
	ground, nearly falls.

	ON JASON as he rounds the corner, sees the open door.

	INT.   CRYO LAB

	Jason enters, his machete held ready. He stares at the Huge Cryo unit. 
	Door open. Otherwise the room is empty.

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		Hey!

	Jason turns. Rizzo is standing in the hall, the shotgun ready.

				RIZZO
		You son of a bitch!

	KABLAM! Jason slides backwards on the slick floor.

	KABLAM! Further, he nearly falls. 

	KABLAM! He stumbles, falls backwards into the cryo-unit.

	Rizzo slams her palm onto a console, the Cryo-unit door closes, JASON 
	INSIDE.

	RIZZO tosses the gun to the floor and types on a keypad.

	Steam HISSES, engines hum to life. The Cryo-Unit, Bucks violently.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Cryo-Unit activated.

	Slowly the unit goes silent, still. Rizzo stares at it, approaches 
	slowly, staring at the fogging glass -


	KA-CHING!

	The MACHETE BURSTS THROUGH THE GLASS, slicing into Rizzo's shoulder!

	ALARMS SOUND. The cryo lab's main door SLAMS shut.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Cryo-Unit leak. Lock down in progress.
		Security measures on line.

				RIZZO
		Nooooooo!

	She rushes toward the door. It won't budge.

				RIZZO
		Somebody! No!

	CHSHSHSHSHSH!

	Gas filters into the room from the leak in the Cryo-Unit.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Subject in computer unit has reached
		full incubation.

	Rizzo begins to fade. She stumbles.

				RIZZO
		No . . . 

	Cryo gas rolls along the floor . . .

	As blood pours from her wound, she reaches her bloody hand to the glass 
	window and draws -

	A SKULL AND CROSSBONES.

	-then passes out.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	RIZZO'S EYES pop open. She gasps for breath. Coughing and splitting the 
	Gel-like substance. She's sitting in a foot of gel, naked; Yllo, Brodski 
	and the kids around her.

				THORGAN
		That one did it!

	Yllo moves close to Rizzo.

				YLLO
		We should expect a moment of
		disorientation.

	WHAM! Rizzo punches Yllo in the nose.

				DELONGPRE
		Spunky . . .

				YLLO
		She broke my fucking nose!

				KAY-EM 14
		Again proving that your ancestors were savages.

				BRODSKI
		I like her already.

				KAY-EM 14
		Live signs full strength. Heart rate above normal - 

	Rizzo's disoriented, confused. Gel slops all around her.

				RIZZO
		Where..? Who . . .?
			(shock)
		I'm alive. You brought me back.

				YLLO
			(rubbing his nose)
		Obviously so.

	Rizzo looks down at her body, gel dripping off her naked flesh.

				RIZZO
		What the hell is this shit?

	Delongpre gives her a blanket. She covers herself.

				RIZZO
		How did I get here, how did you bring me back?

				YLLO
		Nanotechnology.

				RIZZO
		Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.

				YLLO
		We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.

				RIZZO
		30? How long was I out?

	Rizzo finally takes a good look at where she is. Something is very wrong 
	in her world.

				YLLO
		The year is 2455. You've been frozen
		for the past four hundred years.

	Rizzo gasps -- a shocking revelation.

				YLLO
		Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some 
		questions...

				RIZZO
		JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!

				THORGAN
		The hockey player? He a friend of yours?

				RIZZO
		Hockey player? He's not a ...

				THORGAN
		He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!

				RIZZO
		Old Earth?

				YLLO
		We need to do some tests...I'd like to ask you a
		few questions.

				RIZZO
		But...I...400 years?

				YLLO
		That's right, now if you could...

	Delongpre frowns at Yllo and moves to Rizzo.

				DELONGPRE
		It can wait. Let's get you cleaned up.

	Delongpre helps Rizzo off the table.

				YLLO
		Wait a minute...I need...

				BRODSKI
		Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time.

				DELONGPRE
		Come on.

	INT.  LAB FOUR

	Rizzo stands at a small window looking out into space. Cleaned up she is 
	quite beautiful.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Rizzo?

	Rizzo is startled. She looks around.

				RIZZO
		Yeah?

	Delongpre comes through the door with a plate of food. 

				DELONGPRE
		I thought that after 400 hundred years,
		you just might have a little bit of an appetite.

	He puts the food on a small table and moves to the window.

				DELONGPRE
		You're on Grendel, a class IV Catamaran 
		transport.
		It's basically a school bus. We're on our way 
		back to Earth II.
		It's finals week.

	She turns back to the window.

				RIZZO
		You're telling me I'm a friggen class project?

	Delongpre flinches, expecting to be hit.

				DELONGPRE
			(a beat)
		Sort of. I mean, no, not really ...

	She collapses onto the bed.

				DELONGPRE
		I'll give you a moment alone. Do you
		want me to come get you when we start
		the dissection?

	Rizzo shrugs. She's lost everyone and everything. She's lot 400 years.

	Delongpre backs out of the room, closing the door behind him.

	Rizzo stares at the pile of her old clothes. She reaches into the pocket 
	of her tattered jacket and removes a set of keys. The key chain holds a 
	picture...a picture of her parents. She sits on the bed and starts to cry.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	As Delongpre enters all eyes turn to him.

				YLLO
		Well?

				DELONGPRE
		She needs a little time.

				YLLO
		More time...shit, she's had 400 years...

	Yllo laughs at his own joke.

				DELONGPRE
		That's really funny.

				YLLO
		I'd want her statements before we reach porch.
		Jesus, women.

				DELONGPRE
		Yeah, like you'd be a rock after everything
		she went through?

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		Dissection?

	Theyturn. Rizzo approaches Delongpre and Yllo.

				RIZZO
		Jason? He's on this ship?!

				YLLO
		Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in
		400 years...except for you, of course. Look if 
		you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking
		and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the
		publicity.

				RIZZO
			(glares)
		Are you finished?

	Yllo nods then --

	WHAM!

	Rizzo punches him again.

				YLLO
		God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!

				DELONGPRE
		Oh I like her a lot.

				BRODSKI
		I'm with you kid.

				RIZZO
		Where is he?

				BRODSKI
			(points)
		Lab two, relax. What's the matter?
		He's dead.

				RIZZO
		No, you're dead! You're all dead!

	She shoves Delongpre out of the way and out the door.

	INT.  LAB TWO - MOMENTS LATER

	The others enter to find Rizzo leaning over Adrienne's headless body.

				YLLO
		Jesus!

				JANESSA
		Oh my God! Adrienne?

				THORGAN
		What have you done?

				RIZZO
		What have I done?! Idiots.

	Thorgan throws up.

		BOEMAN
			(into a mike)
		Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an
		emergency!

				DELONGPRE
		Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?

				RIZZO
		I'll tell you where he is. He's walking
		around this ship, killing anything that
		moves.

				JANESSA
		Maybe she tripped.

	Brodski and Kicker burst into Lab Two, they react to the carnage.

				BRODSKI
		Jesus, God!

				KICKER
		Oh man, what the hell happened?

				RIZZO
		Jason! Can't you see? He did this.

				YLLO
		Impossible! He was dead before he entered
		Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could
		be alive.

				RIZZO
		I didn't say he was alive.

	Something watching Azrael, his back to us. Azrael moves. The stalker
	closes in.

	Suddenly Azrael hits, rolls and comes up Blasting right at us.

	HIS POV

	A HUGE ALIEN CREATURE, fangs, claws and so on, leaps at him. THe big
	blaster hits home. The alien DISINTERGRATES.

	Sitting on the floor, Azrael sighs and wipes his brow.

	SUddenly, another alien rises up behind him with a hideos Screech. 
	There's nothing Azrael can do. He's a goner. Then --

	FZZT! A blast from elsewhere DISINTERGRATES THE CREATURE. MOVE TO 
	REVEAL--

	DALLAS, the grunt Azreael had words with earlier.

				DALLAS
		That's nine to four, geek-boy.

				AZRAEL
		You got lucky.

				DALLAS
		You got lucky. I could have waited until he
		ate your head.

				AZRAEL
		Speaking of which, duck!

	Dallas hits the deck as Azrael FIRES, disintegrating another. Beyond it 
	lunge a half dozen more.  Dallas and Azrael scramble to their feet,
	take aim, when --

	ONE OF THE ALIENS IS CUT IN HALF!

	GREEN GOO squirts from its body.

				AZRAEL
		What the?!

	JASON VOORHEES 

	SLASHES THROUGH another alien, splitting it down the middle.
	Then another.

				DALLAS
		He's good.

	Azrael smiles knowingly. He takes aim and lets loose a blast at Jason. 
	Aliens scatter as the blasts hits Jason dead on. Dallas joins in
	unloading on the hulinking terror.

	THeir assault has no effect on Jason whatsoever.

				DALLAS
		That sucks. Why won't he go down?

				AZRAEL
		Pause play.

	Suddenly the aliens freeze in place. Jason stares at them, then turns to 
	Dallas and Azrael.

				DALLAS
		He's not part of the program.

				AZRAEL
		Hey cool. They brought ancient
		hockey guy back to life.

	Jason walks up to them. Titls his head like a dog hearing a high-pitched 
	whistle.

	Why aren't they running.

				AZRAEL
		Hey! We're playing a game here.
		Get off the court!

	Jason raises his silver blade high.

				DALLAS
		No, we're playing a game...not you numbnuts...

	SLASH! The blade slices through Azrael's shoulder to the bottom of his 
	rib cage. Blood spurts
	as his right side pulls away from his body. Azrael does not seem hurt, 
	only pissed.

				AZRAEL
		Asshole that does not count as a kill.

				DALLAS
		Yes it does.

				AZRAEL
		Oh, come on!

	JASON is confused. He spins and slashed taking Dallas' head clean off. 
	The head falls to the ground, then Dallas speaks.

				DALLAS
		Okay, enough of this shit.

				AZRAEL
		Alright, asshole.

	The sound of an ENGINE SHUTTING DOWN.

	Jason finds himself standing alone on a huge open court, all white, 
	sterile.

	No creatures, no Dallas or Azrael. A both ends of the white garganuan 
	room we see a small tinted glass.

	Azrael's voice booms over a loud speaker.

				AZRAEL(V.O.)
		Clear off the court, asshole.

	INT.  BOOTH ONE

	Azrael sits before a huge console wearing a virtual reality suit.

	INT.  BOOTH TWO

	Dallas is in his own suit from the opposite booth.

				DALLAS
		I don't have all day, kid.

				AZRAEL
		Yeah yeah I better call the labs,
		see what the hell is going on.

	Jason stares at the tinted glass of Azrael's booth.

				AZRAEL
			(into mike)
		Lab...this is AZ in the game grid.
		Your guy got out and runined our game.

	INTERCUT AS NECESSARY:

	INT   LAB TWO

	The reaction to the broadcast.

				YLLO
		Azrael can you repeat that?

				RIZZO
		Get him out of there!

				AZRAEL
			(into mike)
		I said the guy in the mask is in here
		ruining our game.

	Jason starts to close in on Azrael's pod.

				AZRAEL
			(continuing)
		Send someone to the grid to pick
		him up. He looks lost.

				YLLO
		That's impossible.

				RIZZO
		I told you! Get them out of there!
			(grabs mike)
		Get out of there! Get out of there now!

				AZRAEL
			(into mike)
		All right fine, we'll head back--

	Suddenly, JASON shoves his fist through the glass.

				DALLAS
		Jesus!

	The sounds of Azrael's DEATH broadcast over the lab.

	When Jason retrieves his hand, he holds a bloody mass of Azrael's 
	insides.

	IN THE LAB, Brodski takes charge.

				BRODSKI
		Dallas! That you? Come back!

				DALLAS
			(into mike)
		Sarge! Get the fuck down here!
		We got a real shitstorm in the --

	DALLAS fights to get out of his virtual reality suit and get himself 
	into combat mode...BUT...

	JASON hears the movement. Turns, flings his silver blade.

	It flies across the room, throught the glass and impales Dallas' throat 
	to his chair.

	The blade shrots out the electronics in the grid and plunges the room to 
	black.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	As the connection goes to static.

				BRODSKI
			(into mike)
		Dallas?! Dallas?! Do you copy?

	Nothing. Finally...

				RIZZO
		He's dead. They're both dead. You
		don't understand what is on this ship.
		This is a being that kills. That's what
		he does. That's all he does. And he is very
		good at it.

				BRODSKI
		Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell
		me what the hell is going on!

	She gets up and heads for the door.

				DELONGPRE
		Where are you going?

				RIZZO
		We have to get off this ship.

	Yllo who has been losing control takes on the lead again.

				YLLO
		That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.

				RIZZO
		Why don't you get it? He's going to kill
		us all!

				BRODSKI
		I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever
		your ancient hockey player can throw at us.

				RIZZO
		Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship...
		and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the
		only way you're going to live.

				DELONGPRE
		You just need to relax. Rizzo ti's the future.
		We have soldiers on board, E-X Grunts, the baddest of
		the bad...and their weapons? I'm sure are slightly more
		advanced than what you're used to.

				RIZZO
		I hope so.

	EXT.  GAME GRID CORRIDOR

	Sven and Kicker approach the door. Casually, weapons slung low. The 
	doors hiss open, the black maw of the game grid on the other side.

				KICKER
		Damn. Are they playing?

				SVEN
		Dallas?! Azrael!

	Their combat sense perks up a bit. Something's not right. They turn on 
	their lights and ready their weapons.

	INT.  GAME GRID

	WIDE:  Hard beams of light search for anything.

	Sven, as his beam hits Azrael's pod.

				SVEN
		Oh shit.

	From inside pod as Sven and Kicker approach. THe blood splattered inside
	 the glass glows in the throws of their lights.

	Kicker breaks off to inspect the other POD Sven tries to hold down his 
	lunch.

				SVEN
		Sarge, this is bad. The kid's
		His guts are ripped out.

				BRODSKI
			(over radio)
		Dead?

				SVEN
		Oh yeah.

	Kicker reaches the other POD. the darkness looms behind him as he finds
	his friend.
				KICKER
			(into radio)
		Sarge, this is Kicker. Dallas got
		it to. Real slice and dice. What
		should we do?

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Everyone is in shock except Brodski...he's a pro.

				BRODSKI
		Report to weapons. We're going
		on a hunt.

	KICKER IN THE GRID

				KICKER
		Roger that.
			(to himself)
		Time to kick some ass!

	From behind him a shape materializes. A hand reaches out of the 
	darkness.

	KICKER JUMPS! Spins around with his weapon at the ready!

	IT'S SVEN!

				SVEN
		Sorry!

				KICKER
		Don't friggen do that!

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Brodski is in assault mode.

				BRODSKI
		Yllo, what's your head count?

				YLLO
		Looks like we're missing two.
		Stone and Kkinsa.

				JANESSA
		You know, Stoney's done everyone
		on this trip but me..what's up with that?

	Brodski scans the room - a tactical assessment.

				BRODSKI
		This place should be safe. Get them
		back here. I don't want to be hunting
		around and kill one of your kids by accident.
		As much as I've dreamed of doing that.

	Brodski goes to Rizzo while Yllo buzzes Stoney's cabin.

				BRODSKI
		I need to know what you know about this guy.

				RIZZO
		Don't go out there. You can't win.
		We need to get off this ship. That's
		all there is to it.

				BRODSKI
		Not an option. I'm going to hunt this
		son of a bitch down.

	Rizzo shakes her head. She can't get through to this guy.

				BRODSKI
		I've been a grunt for fifteen years.
		There's not a problem I can't fix with
		enough ammunition.

	Yllo is getting no response.

				YLLO
		Stoney! Stoney if you can hear me,
		get your ass down to the lab immediately!
			(beat)
		I'm going to see if I can find them.

	Yllo opens the door and Kkinsa is there! Half-naked, covered in blood. 
	Janessa SCREAMS and the others gasp.

	Kkinsa falls to the floor..whimpering, in shock. Boeman rushes over
	to her with a blanket.

				KKINSA
		Sstoney's dead!

	They all look to each other, searching for what to say or do...Rizzo 
	puts her head in her hands...not again.

	INT.  CORRIDOR

	Brodski double-checks his sidearm as Yllo follows him down the hall.

				YLLO
		ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab,
		couple of hours no more. Let them take a
		look at our friends.

				BRODSKI
		Not a chance.

				YLLO
		JUst don't go in there half cocked.
		You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and
		ask questions later.

				BRODSKI
		You got that right.

	They arrive at the door of the WEAPONS ROOM.

				YLLO
		This thing could be worth a great deal....
		scientifically...not to mention what the fat cats
		on Earth II would pay for it! Look, I'll split it with
		you 50/50...

	The door opens. The E-X Grunts are all there. Weapons in a rack on one 
	wall. They are in various states of battle dresss. Yllo follows Brodski in. 
	Brodski turns and faces him, his men behind.

				BRODSKI
		You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch!
		If that...that thing is out there, it's
		dead! You got it!!!

				KICKER
		Fuckin A...

				BRODSKI
		Now get out of our way...get back to the
		lab and baby sit your snot nosed brats...
		we've got a job to do!

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Yllo enters pissed off. The others are standing around not sure what to 
	do.

				YLLO
		That bastard! Boemen turn on the
		tracking monitors.

	Rizzo walks over to Kay-em 14. Thorgon is working on her.

				RIZZO
		Robot huh?

				KAY-EM 14
		Kay-em 14.

				RIZZO
		Barbie from hell...

				KAY-EM 14
		Cybernetics science droid,
		fluent in over six...

				RIZZO
		Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS,
		now how about you help me get
		out of this coffin, Barbie...

				KAY-EM 14
		I'm afraid I cannot assist.

	Rizzo is very frustrated.

				RIZZO
		I'm surrounded by idiots.

				KAY-EM 14
		You need to get laid!

	Thorgon looks up from his work.

				THORGON
		Sorry, I'm working on it.

				DELONGPRE
		Are all twenty-first century girls like you?

				RIZZO
		He'll kill us all. You know that, don't you?

	AN ALARM SOUNDS.

				THORGON
			(re:monitor)
		There's been an unauthorized entrance to the
		Cargo Bay.

				BRODSKI
		Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to
		Lab two and cover out backs.

				YLLO
			(into the mic)
		At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?

				BRODSKI (v.o.)
		I'll try.

								CUT TO:
	INT. CARGO DOOR - MIDSHIP

	kicker, sven, CONDOR, BRIGGS, and GEKO are locked and loaded. Dressed in 
	full armor,
	packing massive high tech weaponry, they are a sight to see. Jason may 
	have met his
	match.

				BRODSKI
		Alright, the teach requests we take this guy
		out at the knees. I say shoot to kill.

	The boys fidget with excitment. Bout time they see some action.

				BRODSKI
		So after you've killed him, put one in his knee
		so we can say we tried.

	The men LAUGH and high five.

				BRODSKI
		Go to infrared, stay in radio contact.
			(into headset)
		Teach you there?

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Yllo walks in and sits at a bank of monitors. Through one, we see the 
	team standing at the cargo doors.

				YLLO
		Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.

				BRODSKI(V.O.)
		You just keep an eye out.

				YLLO
		Yeah yeah. Got it.

	Yllo removes his head set and quickly turns to a separate console. He 
	has his own agenda.

	INT.  CARGO DOOR - MIDSHIP

				BRODSKI
		Let's move out.

	The doors HISS open.

	INT. CARGO BAY

	A massive room. Boxes stacked hihg, some to the ceilin,g creating a 
	maze.

				BRODSKI
		Two teams, Port, starboard.

	They split up.

	INT. LAB ONE

	The kids are standing at a schematic of the ship. Several small blips 
	are entering the cargo area.

				BRODSKI(V.O.)
		Kicker, anything?

				KICKER(V.O.)
		Negative.

	Rizzo stands over Thorgan to see the monitor.

				THORGAN
		Each blip represents a trained killer.
		It's men like that fought off the pirates
		on Earth II, battled Jauntuns on the solar 
		moons...

	For the moment, Rizzo looks distantly hopeful.

				RIZZO
		So, you're saying thse guys have like,
		lasers and stuff? They could hack him
		to pieces?

				THORGAN
		Exactly.

	INT.  CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE

	Briggs and Geko move side by side. Condor brings up the rear. Suddenly 
	he is jerked out
	of view. 

	CLOSE ON CONDOR'S FACE, jason's hand around his throat. SNAP. The eyes 
	go dead, the neck broken.

	INT. LAB ONE

	Rizzo sees something. Her hopes fade.

				RIZZO
		WHAT'S IT MEAN WHEN ONE OF YOUR BLIPS 
	DISAPPEARS?

	All eyes turn to the schematic as one of the blips FLICKERS and FADES.

				KAY-EM 14
		E-x Grunt Condor has flatlined.

				BOEMAN
			(into mic)
		Sergeant, this is Boemen...

	INT.  CARGO BAY - STARBOARD

	Sergeant Brodski stops.

				BOEMAN(v.o.)
		You've lost Condor.

				BRODSKI
		Briggs, Geko, talk to me!

	INT.  CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE

	Briggs and Geko stare at each other.

				BRIGGS
		He was...he was right here!

	BACK TO BRODSKI

				BRODSKI
		DAMNIT to hell! We're coming to you!

	INT.  LAB ONE 

	A BLIP flashes for a second on the screen.

				THORGAN
		You see that?

				BOEMAN
		Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed
		fuselage.

	INT. CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE

				BRIGGS
		Got it.

	BRIGGS and GEKO split up, moving around a large metallic tank.

	BRIGGS INFARED POV

	Gun ready, he moves around the crated fuselage slowly.

				BRIGGS
		I don't see anything.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	The blip flashes again.

	INT.  CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		He's right there! In front of you!

	INFARRED POV reveal GEKO moving toward him.

				BRIGGS
		That's GEKO. mAYBE you kids should
		stay out of this.

	Briggs removes his gogles only to find Jason standing before him, 
	holding Geko's body...impaled
	onto his silver blade.

	BRIGGS fires...screams.

	INT.  LAB ONE

				BRIGGS(V.O.)
		He doesn't show up on...

	PAINFUL GURGLES then two more blips disappear.

				THORGAN
			(turns)
		Jesus, is this what it was like on your...

	Rizzo is cowering on the floor, her hands over her ears. She's sweating, 
	convulsing.

				BOEMAN
		Sergeant, you've lost two more men!

	INT. CARGO BAy - PORTSIDE

	Brodski and his remaining men double-time-it to the slaughter. Briggs 
	and Geko lie dEAD
	AT THEIR FEET.

				KICKER
		Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?

				BRODSKI
		Teach! Where the hell are you?!
		Where's our visuals?!!

	INT. LAB TWO

	Yllo is talking on  aseparate mike. Unwaakre of the slaughteri n the 
	next room.

				YLLO
		Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the
		Solaras Space Lab.

				FAT LOU(V.O.)
		I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.

				YLLO
		We've got a situation here! Just do
		as  you're told!

				FAT LOU(V.O.)
		Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon
		as we've passed Tara's rings we'll
		make the course correction.

	BACK TO YLLO.

				YLLO
		Thank you.

	Yllo disconnects, and turns to the other console.

				YLLO
			(into mic)
		Ok Sarge, what's your status?

				BRODSKI(V.O.)
		wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three

	INT.  CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE

	GUNFIRE ERUPTS!

				SVEN(V.O.)

	INT. LAB ONE

	CHEERS from everyone except Rizzo who knows better. She shakes her head.

				THORGAN
		Yes!

				RIZZO
		Listen up duck fuckers, you can't
		kill this thing.

				BOEMAN
		Duck fuckers?

				RIZZO
		He's either unconcious or playing dead,
		whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay,
		you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.

				DELONGPRE
		Outta here?

				RIZZO
		Isn't there an escape POD on this ship?
		Something?

				THORGON
		There's a shuttle.

				RIZZO
		Alright, been nice knowing you.
		Who's with me?

				KKINSA
		I'll go.

				BOEMEN
		Yllo said stay here.

				KKINSA
		Fuck Yllo!

				BOEMEN
		They got him! You're not leaving!

	INT. CARGO BAY - MIDSHIP

	Sven is kneeling over Jason's body. 

				SVEN
		Big sucker too.

	Suddenly, Jason reaches up, grabs the back of Sven's head and SLAMS it 
	into his mask.
	Sven's forehead shatters.

	ON BRODSKI

	As he races around a crate. Sven's body is within sight. His killer 
	nowhere to be seen.

				BRODSKI
		Kicker? Where are you?

	Elsewhere we hear GUNFIRE followed closely by a SCREAM!

	ELSEWHERE

	Kicker crawls across the floor, blood spews from his mouth.

	PULL BACK TO RVEAL

	He's been split in half at the wait...his entrails dragging behind him..
	SHUNK! A machete throught the back of the neck puts him out of his 
	misery.

	INT. LAB ONE

				RIZZO
		Do something!!!

				THORGON
		Don't look at me! I'm in high school!

	INT. CARGO BAY

	Brodski runs. He's spooked. Twisting and turning in every direction.

				BRODSKI
		Find Crutch! Set up an ion field
		around the cargo bay. We'll torch
		the sucker! Yllo...you're a dead man!

	Brodski races toward the Cargo exit.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	ON MONITOR

	We see Brodski racing towards us. We also see Jason, lying in wait, 
	hidden by one 
	of the crates.

				YLLO
		Sergeant!

				BRODSKI
			(stops)
		What?

	Yllo considers then.
				YLLO
		Nothing.

	On the monitor we see Brodski move forward. He never saw Jason coming.
	BRODSKI SCREAMS.  Yllo turns his head.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	The kids stand in shock, silently staring at one another, listening to 
	the
	static of the dead communications. Boeman reaches over and clicks off 
	the radio.
	Silence.  Rizzo leaps to her feet.

				RIZZO
		Lesson number one, kiddies. You wanna
		get home safely then we get off this boat.

	Kkinsa starts t cry.

				KKINSA
		I don't understand...what does he want?

				RIZZO
		He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone
		on this ship.

	Rizzo looks at everyone.

				RIZZO
		Any questions?

	A side door HISSES OPEN. Yllo enters.

				YLLO
		You're not going anywhere.

				RIZZO
		You wanna die?

				YLLO
			(ignores her)
		Are we locked down?

				BOEMAN
		That door's the only way in or out and it
		won't open without the code.

				YLLO
		Then we wait. We're docking with Space Lab
		in less than an hour.

				RIZZO
		What good will that do?

				YLLO
		They can deal with this sort of thing.

				RIZZO
		More soldiers?

				YLLO
		Scientists. Very intellegent men.

				RIZZO
		That's great. I bet they'll kick Jason's
		ass at a spelling bee!

				JANESSA
		Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out
		and let us handle this?

				YLLO
		Try to calm down. Just think, you're going
		to be famous!

				RIZZO
			(to kids)
		Guys, please come with me!

				YLLO
		4You're not going anywhere.

	Rizzo starts for the door but Yllo grabs her arms, holds them behind 
	her.

				DELONGPRE
		Now hold on! We should hear her out!

				THORGAN
		She's obviously dealt with this guy before.

				YLLO
		Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!

				DELONGPRE
		No shit. I got no problem with that.

	Janessa readies a hypo.

				THORGAN
		Maybe if we knew a little bit more about
		what we're delaing with here...

	Janessa moves behind Rizzo with the sedative.  Suddenly Rizzo throws her 
	head back, Salmming it into Yllo's nose. He CRIES OUT in pain.

	Janessa lunges with the syringe but Rizzo snatches her wrist, grabbing 
	the hypo, burying it into Janessa's left breast.

				RIZZO
		tNighty-night.

	Janessa collapses.  Yllo rushes Rizzo again, but this time Boeman 
	stands, blocks his path.

				CRUTCH
		Leave her be.

				RIZZO
		Ok, who do I gotta fuck to get off this boat?

	Thorgan timidly raises his hand.

				RIZZO
		Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship.
		Come with me.

				THORGAN
		Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space?
		We'll die oout there.

	Rizzo rushes the door. There's a code box on the wall.

				RIZZO
		How do you open the damn door?

				YLLO
		You're crazy!

	Kkinsa punches in the code. The door HISSES open.

				DELONGPRE
		Rizzo, he's out there.

				RIZZO
		Yeah and he'll be here soon enough.
			(looks at Delongpre)
		Last chance.

	The others stare at her. She's crazy.

				RIZZO
		Fine. Bye.

	She and Kkinsa exit, the door SWISHES CLOSED behind them.

				YLLO
			(favoring his nose)
		Pack your shit. We'll disembark in an hour.
		The guys at Space Lab have the necessary
		equipment to contain this thing and then we
		can study it.

	But the kids aren't so sure.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Yllo enters, makes sure he wasn't followed then approaches a console.

				YLLO
		Computer on line.

	A series of beeps.

				JANESSA(O.S.)
		What are you doing?

				YLLO
			(jumps)
		Jesus! Can't you knock?
			(back to console)
		Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf.

		En-en-en-en...Eta-Eta...

	Fat Lou stares up in shock just before JASON SLAMS Bernie's torso ontop 
	of her.

	PULL BACK TO REVEAL

	FAT LOU'S upper body has disappeared. In other words, Bernie now has 
	legs.
	Little good they'll do him.

	THROUGH WINDSHIELD.

	Far in the distance we see a tiny space station -- SPACE LAB.
	A monitor reads ...

	Rizzon and Kkinsa enter.

				RIZZO
		Ssh.

	Rizzo pulls Kkinsa close to one of the crates.

				RIZZO
		He's in here.

	Kkinsa opens her mouth to scream. Rizzo slaps her hand over Kkinsa's 
	mouth.

				RIZZO
		You scream I'll snap your neck.
		Got it?

	Kkinsa nods. Rizzo releases her.

				KKINSA
			(whispers)
		How do you know?

				RIZZO
			(dread)
		I just know.

	INT.  LAB ONE 

	The crew has packed their essentials and now wait to dock with Space 
	Lab. Yll is standing
	before the others holding Jason's machete.

				YLLO
		We must assume the machete was an
		intricate part of the game of hockey.

				DELONGPRE
		I'm thinking Rizzo was right.

				YLLO
		Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?

				DELONGPRE
		Maybe we should go with them. Like you said,
		your Space Lab connections can deal with this 
	thing.
		At least we'll be safe.

				YLLO
		They are not going anywhere. I cut power to
		the  shuttle.

	The kids and Crutch stare at him. Cold hearted.

	INT.  SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	Rizzo and Kkinsa approach. 

				RIZZO
		Open the doors.

	Kkinsa punches in a series of buttons. Nothing.

				KKINSA
		Something's wrong.

				RIZZO
		Keep trying!

	INT.  LAB ONE

				YLLO
		Everyone ready?

	Yllo grabs a mike from a console.

				YLLO
		Fat Lou, what's the ETA?

	STATIC.

				YLLO
		Lou, goddamjnit! Bernie, where's Lou?!

	STATIC.

	Boeman moves to one of the consoles, clicks a few buttons.

	ON MONITOR

	We see the view from the bridge security camera. Lots of blood and the 
	mangled combination of Lou and Bernie.

				THORGAN
		Yuck.

				DELONGPRE
		We're screwed.

				YLLO
		The ship doesn't need pilots to dock.
		We'll disembark and you'll see.
		Everything will be fine.

				BOEMAN
		Uh...that's gonna be a problem.
		The ship's not on auto-pilot.
		We're flying blind.
			(a beat)
		Thirty minutes till impact.

	All eyes turn to Yllo, for guidance, his back to the outer door.

				YLLO
		I guess...we'll have to go to the bridge.

				THORGAN
		But...

	Jason is out there. Then --

	WHAM-WHAM-WHAM!

	The outer door bucks and dents! Everyone jumps!

	WHAM-WHAM-WHAM!

								QUICK-CUT TO:

	INT. SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	Over the headsets, Rizzo and Kkinsa hear the SCREAMS.

				RIZZO
		Damnit, he's got them.

	Kkinsa keeps trying the code box. Nothing.

				KKINSA
		Rizzo, I think Yllo must have done
		something. The door won't open.

	INT.  LAB ONE

				YLLO
		It's alright. He can't get in here!

	WHAM! WHAM!!! But the door is starting to give.

	Through the confusion, Crutch moves to one of the consoles. Clicks
	away at the keyboard.

	INT.   SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	The shuttle hums to life.

				KKINSA
		The power's back up!

				RIZZO
		Then open the doors!

				KKINSA
		Thirty seconds.

	INT.   LAB ONE

	WHAM! WHAM! WHAM!

				JANESSA
		What do we do?!!

				YLLO
		Crutch?

				CRUTCH
		Help me up.

	Boeman helps Crutch to the top of a table. Crutch goes to work on a  
	ceiling
	vent, removing screws.

				JANESSA
		Okay, I'm guessing you should hurry.

	The top corner of the door bends...Jason peers through.

				THORGAN
		Jesus, tell this asshole I don't
		play hockey!

				CRUTCH
		Okay!

	Our group starts climbing the table and into the ceiling space.

				YLLO
		Will that take us to the bridge?

				CRUTCH
		It's a maze up there, but yes.

				YLLO
		We'll engage auto-pilot!
		Everything'll be fine!

	With that, the door gives!

	Boeman heaves Crutch into the crawl space then follows himself.  Jason 
	pauses,
	staring at Kay-Em --

				KAY-EM 14
		Heart beat irregular...no blood flow...
		impossible...this....this... does not
		make sense.

	Jason's heard enough. He swings his cleaver, but Kay-Em ducks. Turns and 
	leaps
	through the hole in the celing.

	INT.  CEILING WALK SPACE

	Yllo grips the ledge.

				YLLO
		Move it people!

	Then Yllo screams. Jason has him from below. Boeman grabs his arms.

				BOEMAN
		Help me!

	DeLongpre grabs hold and pulls. Suddenly Yllo is jerked out of their
	grasp. They fall onto their backs breathing heavily.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Yllo leaps to his feet. Jason looms over him.

				YLLO
		Now hold on! Have you considered
		how valuable you are? Credit, fame,
		you can have it all. And ladies. I 
		mean, how long has it been?

	Jason stands there, but his attention isn't on Yllo. It's on the machete 
	sticking through
	Yllo's belt. Jason reaches for it. Yllo backs into a wall.

	Jason slowly removes the machete from Yllo's belt and stares at it. He 
	drops
	the cleaver to the ground.

				YLLO
			(chuckles)
		That's all you wanted?

	INT.  SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	The shuttle doors slide open as we hear over the headset --

				YLLO(V.O.)
		It's okay, he just wanted his machete.

				RIZZO
			(knowingly)
		Three...two...one...

	Yllo screams.

	INT.  CEILING WALK SPACE

	Yllo's SCREAMS turn to GURGLES. All eyes stare at the opening in the 
	walkway, then --

	YLLO'S HEAD LANDS IN BOEMAN'S LAP!

				KAY-EM 14
		Now that's just gross.

	JASON STICKS HIS HEAD THROUGH.  EVERYONE JUMPS, SCREAMS.

				DELONGPRE
		GO, GO, GO!

	They race down the walkway, over huge pipes and through electrical 
	wires, Crutch 
	in the lead.

	INT.  SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	Kkinsa enters the shuttle, turns to Rizzo.

				KKINSA
		Rizzo, come on!

	But, Rizzo hesitates. We can still hear the PANICKED SCREAMS over the 
	headset.

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		Go-go-go-go-go!!!!

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		He's right behind us!

				RIZZO
		Damn!
			(to Kkinsa)
		Close the door! I'll be right back.

				KKINSA
			(panicked)
		What?!!

				RIZZO
		I gotta go back.

				KKINSA
		But?!!

	Rizzo turns and races through the maze of boxes and crates leaving 
	Kkinsa nearly
	insane.

	INT.  CELING WALK SPACE

				KAY-EM 14
		I'm quite sure I wasn't designed for this.

	Crutch comes to a fork in the walkway.

				CRUTCH
		Okay, we need to ...

				BOEMAN
		You forgot didn't you, you old
		fart?

	At the back of the line, Delongpre turns as Jason rounds the bend behind 
	him.

				DELONGPRE
		Shit! Move it! He's coming!

	Delongpre leaps forward creating a pile out of Janessa and Thorgan

				DELONGPRE
		Go!

	Racing forward the group stays just out of Jason's grasp. Leaping
	over and under and through whatever blocks the path.

				DELONGPRE
		Faster!

	Jason swings his machete at DeLongpre! It just misses him.

				DELONGPRE
		FASTER!!!

	Crutch comes to ascreened panel. Boeman kicks it open.
	They leap down onto a catwalk crossing the --

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	They are twenty feet off the ground as --

	Rizzo stops, stares straight up.

	HER POV

	the group races across the catwalk as Json leaps down behind them.

				DELONGPRE
		He's right on my ass!

	Then Jason grabs Delongpre, who screams.

	RIZZO,

	spots a gun left by one of the marines. She snatches it, points it 
	towards
	Jason and Delongpre then aims a little high.

	FZZZT!

	It slices through a metal cord holding the catwalk to the ceiling.

	The catwalk jerks. Everyone tumbles. Jason loses his grip on Delongpre.

	Suddenly, METAL SCREECHES, as the catwalk gives under the weight. It 
	RIPS in half,dumping both
	heroes and Jason.

	RIZZO dives out of the way as a pile of metal and bodies crash to the 
	ground!

	Janessa sits up rubbing her head.

				JANESSA
		That was fun.

	Kay-Em 14 sits up, sings.

				KAY-EM 14
		I got a brand new pair of
		roller-skates, you got a brand new key...

				JANESSA
		Thorgan?!

				THORGAN
		I didn't do it. The fall scattered her
		programming..wait. Where's? Shit!

	He's lying on top of Jason. He scrambles to his feet. But Jason doesn't 
	move.

				THORGAN
		Hey, I think the fall killed him.

	The group slowly gathers around. Jason sits up and swings at Thorgan. 
	Boeman pulls him out of
	the way just in time.

	Jason starts to stand when RIZZO comes up behind him.

	KA-FWAM! She brings the barrel of a high tech gun down on the top of 
	Jason's head.
	He collapses. The surrounded faces look happily suprised.

				RIZZO
		Trust me, it's temporary.

	Boeman takes the gun from Rizzo.

				BOEMAN
		Better let me.

				THORGAN
		Where'd you get the gun?

	Rizzo gestures at what's left of Geko's body.

				CRUTCH
		The bridge is this way!

	They take off running.

				RIZZO
		Wait!

	Everyone stops, turns --

				KAY-EM 14
		There's not enough time.

	Rizzo catches up.

				RIZZO
		Forget the bridge, the shuttle's
		waiting!

				BOEMAN
			(to Kay-Em)
		What do you mean, not enough time?

				KAY-EM 14
			(switches voice)
		You know what you get if you shove
		two bananas up your ass? Two shit covered
		bananas.

				JANESSA
		I think your metal lover's losing it.

				KAY-EM 14
			(normal voice)
		Impact in ten minutes. It will take 
		fifteen to reach the bridge.
			(switches voices, sings)
		Mamma's little baby love shortnin,
		shortnin, mamma's little baby love 
		shotnin bread...

				DELONGPRE
		Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes.

				RIZZO
		Guys!!! The shuttle?

	The kids look at one another as if this were a stroke of genius.

				RIZZO
		Idiots.

				CRUTCH
		This way!

	Crutch again leads them through the maze. Delongpre stops at
	another Grunt body, removes a chain gun. THorgan takes a high
	tech laser from another.

				THORGAN
		I feel better. Now how do you
		fire this damn thing?

				DELONGPRE
		Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!

				CRUTCH
			(jokingly)
		Just around this bend...

	Jason steps out in front of Crutch, his machete held poised in front of 
	him.
	Crutch runs right up onto the blade.

				BOEMAN
		Nooooo!

	Alrhoguh he's meat on a stick, Crutch doesn't give up. He SLAMS his 
	fists into
	Jason's torso.

	Thorgan turns to fire --Boeman KNOCKS the barrel high.

				BOEMAN
		You'll hit crutch!

	Boeman tosses his weapon to Janessa and leaps on Jason's back, locking 
	his arms 
	around his neck.

				RIZZO
		What are you doing? You can't save him!

	Delongpre smashes the back of Jason's knee with the chaingun.
	Jason topples on top of Boeman. Crutch is thrown free.

	Janessa and Thorgan help Crutch to his feet as Jason sees Rizzo for the
	first time in 400 hundred years.

	It's either love at first sight or one hell of a grudge. He leaps to his
	feet and races towards her.

				RIZZO
		Don't just stand there! Shoot him!

				DELONGPRE
			(to Jason)
		No you don't!

	BRAAAAAAATTTT!

	The chaingun dances Jason backwards. He CRASHES through the side of one 
	of the 
	cargo boxes. EVERYONE STOPS.

				RIZZO
		Don't stop!

	She jerks the gun from Delongpre and races to the crate.

				RIZZO
		You never stop when he's down!

	But the crate is empty.

				RIZZO
		Shit!!!!

	They spin around, searching.

				CRUTCH
			(weak)
		Forget him. Come on.

	Carrying Crutch, they move toward the shuttle bay.

	INT. SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	panel, clicks some buttons, then --

				BOEMAN
		Uh-oh.

				JANESSA
		What?!

				BOEMAN
		Kkinsa! Open the doors!

	INT. SHUTTLE COCKPIT


	Kkinsa sits in the pilot's seat. She's terrified.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Kkinsa! He's coming! Open the doors!

	INT.  CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

	DeLongpre shoves Boeman out of the way.

				DELONGPRE
		Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!

				RIZZO
		Yeah, that's it, scare the hell
		out of here, that'll work.

	INT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT

				RIZZO(V.O.)
			(calming)
		Kkinsa, it's me, Rizzo. He's not
		out here right now, so please let us in.

	Kkinsa doesn't move.

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt! We need access to
		the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die.

	INT.  CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

				DELONGPRE
		Med-kit?

				RIZZO
		I guessed.

	INT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT

	Kkinsa considers. She reaches for a button marked SHUTTLE 
	DOORS...hesitates.

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		We're going to be okay, Kkinsa.
		Just relax.

	INT.  SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	Kay-Em 14 steps forward.

				KAY-EM 14
		Allow me. I'm trained in all aspects
		of the human psyche.

	Rizzo backs away -- as Kay-Em nears the mike ...

				KAY-EM 14
		Kkinsa, dear, it is I, KAY-EM 14...
		open the fucking door you silly bitch!

	Rizzo shoves Kay-Em out of the way.

				KAY-EM 14
		I didn't say I was good at it.

	INT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		Oh shit! There he is!

	INT.  CARGO BAY SHUTTLE

	Jason is standing at the entrance to the Cargo Shuttle Bay.

	INT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT

	Kkinsa leans forward and presses --

	LAUNCH.

	INT.   CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

	The Shuttle ROARS to life and begins pulling away from the ship.

				BOEMAN
		Kkinsa! No!!!

	EXT.   GRENDEL CLASS IV

	The shuttle moves slowly away from the docking position.

	INT.   CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

	Rizzo opens fire! Thorgan and Delongpre join in.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As boxes and cargo shatter under the heaby fire. Smoke rises. It's 
	impossible
	to see where Jason is. RIZZO stops FIRING.

				RIZZO
		DON'T WASTE YOUR AMMO!

	But, they don't let up. Boxes explode, crates collapse until -- 
	Thorgan's gun clicks empty.
	Then Delongpre's.

	SILENCE.

	The smoke slowly clears revealing the rubble.

				THORGAN
		Did we get him?

	Suddenly, Jason again steps into the Cargo entrance.

				DELONGPRE
		We're screwed!

				RIZZO
		400 years in the future and these
		pea-shooters are the best you can do?!

	They are trapped. Jason blocks the only exit. He slowly moves towards 
	them.

				RIZZO
		Just make a break for the door.
		He'll get some of us, but that's the
		breaks.

				BOEMAN
		We're not leaving Crutch!

				RIZZO
		We don't have time to argue!

	But Jason has locked in on Rizzo. He moves towards her.

				JANESSA
		Okay, tell you what. You die, we'll run.

	Rizzo and the others back into a corner. Jason has them. There's nothing 
	they
	can do.

	Rizzo holds the gun steady, waiting for point blank range. 

	INT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE

	THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

	SPACE LAB, which was only a dot the last time we saw it, suddenly looms 
	toward us.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Collision eminent.

	EXT.  GRENDEL CLASS IV

	The left side of Grendel SMASHES into the side of Space Lab!

	INT.  CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

	Suddenly everything shifts toward the bridge. Boxes, cargo, kids, and 
	Jason!

	EXT.  GRENDEL CLASS IV

	Grendel SLIDES along SPACE LAB, ripping huge chunks of metal from both.
	SPARK fly. There are interior EXPLOSIONS on Space Lab, then --

	KA-FOOM!

	Space Lab EXPLODES!

	INT.  CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

	The entire ship shifts upwards. Cargo, crew, and Jason fly into the air.

	ELECTRICAL fires sprout up all over. Cargo boxes SHATTER, contents 
	SPILLING.

	RIZZO loses her gun.

	EXT.  GRENDEL CLASS IV

	Debris from Space Lab TEARS into the side of the ship and beyond.

	EXT.  SHUTTLE

	One huge chunk heads right towards the Shuttle.

	INT.  SHUTTLE

	Kkinsa stares out the window as the huge chunk flies toward her.

	EXT.  SHUTTLE 

	IMPACT! THE SHUTTLE IMPLODES! ONE BRIGHT RED FIREBALL.

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	Everything piled and in tatters. Our heroes slowly regain their 
	bearings.

				BOEMAN
		Everyone okay?

				THORGAN
		I think I broke my arm.

				KAY-EM 14
		I seem to have misplaced mine.

	Kay-Em 14's right arm is missing, wires sticking out of the stump.

				JANESSA
		You geeks wanna gimmie a hand?

	Janessa is buried beneath a pile of rubble. Boeman helps her to her 
	feet.

				DELONGPRE
			(quiet)
		We lost crutch.

	Rizzo stands and watches as the other sgather around Crutch's body.
	It's battered and twisted all out of place. Boeman falls next to the 
	body.

				BOEMAN
		Goodbye old friend.

				RIZZO
		Okay, he was a great guy, now
		let's move out.

				BOEMAN
			(snaps)
		Could you show a little compassion?!

	Rizzo stares at Boeman.

				RIZZO
		Look, I'm sorry. I really am, but aren't you
		forgetting about ...

	SUDDENLY a pile of rubble EXPLODES.

	Jason rises, his back to them.

				DELONGPRE
		Back to the labs!

	But Jason has other plans. Seemingly unfazed by the past events he 
	rushes after them.

	INT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Dam-damage port side 59 percent.
		Decompression 40 percent. Gravity-y rotors
		failing.

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	Our kids race toward the door, Jason right behind them --

	Thorgan slams the door panel with his good arm. SPARKS fly.
	The door won't open.

				THORGAN
		Oh shit.

	They turn as Jason looms toward them, then --

	EVERYTHING STARTS TO FLOAT

	Cargo and debris. Our heroes. Jason.

	The loss of gravity and Jason's steamrollering momentum SLAMS him into 
	the 
	cargo doors, BREAKING them open and sending him tumbling backwards.

				JANESSA
		This is just great.

				KAY-EM 14
		Engage magnetics.

	Kay-Em 14's left hand magnetically locks to the Cargo frame a

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Jason grabs Rizzo's ankle. Boeman, floating close, punches Jason in the 
	back of the head.

	Still holding Rizzo's ankle, Jason topples, spinning the two out of 
	frame.

	The force of the punch sends Boeman in the opposite direction.

				THORGAN
		This is crazy, we can't do anything like this!

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Rizzo KICKS Jason in the top of the head, sending him SLAMMING into the 
	ceiling.

	A SEVERED ARM

	floats past DeLongpre. There's a chain gun still clutched by the  hand.
	Delongpre grabs both and turns the gun on Jason.

	BRAAATTTT...

	Jason is sent further back, but the force of the chaingun SLAMS 
	Delongpre into a back wall.
	He's knocked unconcious.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As Thorgan manages to grab Kay-Em 14 around the neck.

				THORGAN
		Grab my hand!

	Janessa takes his hand and in turn reaches out and snags the unconcious 
	dELONGPRE'S FOOT.

				JANESSA
		Boeman, can you reach DeLongpre?
		We'll push you in.

	CARGO - MIDSHIP

	Jason is floating toward the other end of the Cargo Bay,
	unable to stop himself.

	BOEMAN

	reaches for DeLongpre. Inches away. Finally he grabs Delongpre by the 
	locks of his
	hair, pulls himself closer.

				DELONGPRE
		Hey! That hurts.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Rizzo is floatin g up near the ceiling. She manages to grab hold of a 
	hanging piece of
	busted catwalk.

				DELONGPRE
			(to Rizzo)
		Push off toward us.

				JANESSA
		Forget her, she's a pain in the ass.
		Let her hang there.

	Crutch's body floats into our heroes, his intestines spilling from his 
	open gut,
	tangling around our heroes.

				THORGAN
		I'm gonna spew.

				JANESSA
		That ought'a help the situation.

				DELONGPRE
		Do it Rizzo! We'll catch you.

	RIZZO'S POV

	Rizzo stares at the human rope that consists of Thorgan, Janessa, 
	Boeman, and Delongpre.

				RIZZO
		What if you miss?

				DELONGPRE
		What if we don't?

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	AS JASON steadies himself against a wall, focuses in one Rizzo, then 
	pushes off with his feet.

	HE ROCKETS toward her!

				DELONGPRE
		He's coming right at you!

	Rizzo spots Jason and pushes off! But her aim was HURRIED...
	and bad. She's gonna miss them.

	Boeman flips in the air!

				BOEMAN
			(to Delongpre)
		Grab my feet!

	Delongpre does and Boeman reaches out and snags Rizzo. The momentum 
	spins the human
	chain into a near wall --KAFWAM-- nearly breaking it apart.

				JANESSA
		Okay that hurt.

				BOEMAN
		Thorgan, pull us in.

	Jason SLAMS into the ceiling, then careens off of the wall --

	As Thorgan pulls the group out of the Cargo bay.

				THORGAN
		What now?

	They watch as Jason grabs a hold of the walkway.

				JANESSA
		Shit. He's gonna send himself right at us.

	Jason takes aim.

								QUICK CUT TO:

	INT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE

				COMPUTER VOICE
		System repair activated. Back up power on line.

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	Jason again ROCKETS THROUGH THE AIR -- when

	GRAVITY IS RESTORED.

	He drops to the cargo floor like a rock! Falling cargo -- huge crates, 
	gargantuan machines,
	a forklift -- buries him.

	Our heroes tumble to the ground.

				JANESSA
			(to Rizzo)
		Get off of me!

	They stand slowly, eyeing the rubble.

				THORGAN
			(rubbing his arm)
		You think it killed . . .
			(off Rizzo's stare)
		Yeah, I guess not.

				JANESSA
		Let's just get out of here.

				BOEMAN
		The ship's in bad shape. Back to
		the labs. Let's check out status.

	INT. SHIP CORRIDORS

	Our group makes their way back toward the labs.

	ELECTRICAL fires are everywhere. Systems are shorting out all over the 
	ship.

	INT. LAB ONE

	Rizzo, in the lead, enters the lab, when the ship BUCKS and QUAKES! A 
	portion of the hall
	collapses behind her.

	INT. CORRIDOR

	Boeman and the others dive back out of the way.

				BOEMAN
		Shit!

				THORGAN
		The hull's imploding!

				BOEMAN
		Rizzo! Can you hear me?!

	INT.  LAB ONE

				RIZZO
		Yeah. Are you guys okay?

	Boeman peers through a crack in the collapsed hull.

				BOEMAN
		There's a red lever on the wall
		beside you. Pull it!

	Rizzo turns, spots the red lever. EMERGENCY PRESSURIZATION STABILIZER.
	It's bolted.

				RIZZO
		It's locked!

				BOEMAN
		Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's
		going to depressurize!

	Rizzo kicsk the metal leg from a table. BASHES the bolt with it, until 
	it breaks.

				BOEMAN
		Hurry Rizzo! You have to reverse
		the pressurization.

	She grabs the lever...then hesitates. Backs away.

				BOEMAN
		What are you doing?!!

				RIZZO
		If the ship goes, so does Jaso.

				BOEMAN
		Rizzo pull the fucking lever!

				RIZZO
		No.

				DELONGPRE
		Rizzo?!

				RIZZO
		It's better this way. If we were rescued
		Jason would just get off the ship. You want
		him on your precious Earth II?

	INT.  CORRIDOR

	Boeman and the other start tearing the debris out of the way!

				THORGAN
		Hurry! She's lost it!

				JANESSA
		So what else is new?

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Boeman climbs through a hole in the rubble. He grabs the lever.

				RIZZO
		Boeman don't. You know I'm right.

				JANESSA
		Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!

	Boeman yanks the lever.

	As the others climb into the lab --

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Depressurization inconclusive.

				KAY-EM 14
		We've lost too much pressure. An hour, tops.

				JANESSA
			(to Rizzo)
		You happy? You've killed us all!

	Thorgan rushes over to the big Nano-tech machine. Places his broken arm 
	on the slab.
	The machine quickly goes to work.

	A schematic of his arm appears on the wall.

	Janessa stares at him.

				JANESSA
		What's the point?

	Delongpre shrugs.

				DELONGPRE
		So that's it then.

	It seems it is.

	Janessa stands over Yllo's decapitated body. It's obvious their 
	relationship
	went beyond just teacher/student. There is a loud METALLIC WHINE from 
	the ship's
	hull.

				RIZZO
		What's that?

				BOEMAN
		THat's the sound of deep space attacking the
		integrity of the ship.

				KAY-EM 14
		No...
			(signing)
		That's the sound of the men working
		on the chain gang.

				RIZZO
		Are there any other shuttles?

				JANESSA
		No.

				RIZZO
		Teleportation? Some way to beam us the
		hell out of dodge?

				THORGAN
		You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?

				JANESSA
		A little late to be thinking about
		escape, isn't it?

				KAY-EM 14
		I'll never experience my fantasy of
		three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod.
		Damn.

				THORGAN
		Am I in there?

				KAY-EM 14
		Sory...

				RIZZO
		Hey.

				DELONGPRE
		That's a good fantasy, though.
		Kinky, but good.

				RIZZO
		Hey!!

	All heads turn to Rizzo. She's staring at a schematic of the ship. The 
	left hull
	of the two hulled ship is lit up with blinking light denoting the 
	various 
	system failures. Rizzo points to the right hull.

				RIZZO
		What's this?

				DELONGPRE
		It's the engine, reactors, audiometers,
		it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.

	Rizzo points at the thin walk-ways connecting the two hulls.

				RIZZO
		Can we get through these?

				THORGAN
		Sure but what good will that do?

				BOEMAN
		When the left hull goes, so will the
		right.

				RIZZO
		What if we blow the walkways first?
		Leave Jason over here to go up with
		the ship?

	They stare at her.

				JANESSA
		You know, Yllo seemed to think we could
		catch this guy alive, well, he'd be worth
		millions.

	The others stare at her as if she were crazy.

				RIZZO
		Any connection between your reality and mine
		is purely coincidental.

				JANESSA
		I'm just saying.

				RIZZO
			(to others)
		Come on. You got all these gadgets and shit.
		Why can't we get inside the right hull, seal up
		the doors and blow the walkways?

				DELONGPRE
		We'd need charges.

				BOEMAN
		We could convert fission transistors.

				THORGAN
		We're not supposed to do that.

				BOEMAN
		What are you gonna do, tell me?

		DELONGPRE
		The engine room will have molecular welders.
		We could seal up the hull.

	A moment of consideration. Could this actually work?

				JANESSA
		YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big
		guy distracted with a blow job.

				THORGAN
		Would you?

				KAY-EM 14
		Now this is getting exciting.

				DELONGPRE
		Remember to roll his balls around a bit.

				RIZZO
		You got a better plan?

	Obviously they don't. They got to work. Boeman grabs a number of devices 
	from under
	a cabinet.

				BOEMAN
		I'll need system four converters.

				THORGAN
		They're back here.

				DELONGPRE
		How many?

				BOEMAN
		Bring 'em all. Let's move!

	Thorgan's still hooked up to the Nano-Tech machine.

				THORGAN
		Hey! I'm not ready.

				BOEMAN
		Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley
		one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there.
		Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.

				JANESSA
		You're so bossy.

				THORGAN
		You're leaving me here alone?

	Delongpre tosses the chaingun next to him.

				DELONGPRE
		Don't blow your foot off.

	They climb through the hole in the corridor and disappear.

				KAY-EM 14
		It's just you and me, then.

				THORGAN
		Come here, might as well fix that arm.

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	Boeman, Janessa, Delongpre, and Rizzo slowly move through the piles of 
	debris.
	Still burning cargo creates a ghastly image of flickering shadows.

				DELONGPRE
		See anything?

	They move toward the rubble that had buried Jason before.

	CLOSE on the rubble.

	There is an obvious hole dug out from the middle.

				DELONGPRE
		I think I speak on behalf of the group
		when I say this is bad news.

				BOEMAN
			(into headset)
		Thorgan? You coming?!

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Thorgan is fooling around in the back of Kay-Em 14's head. The nano-tech 
	maching is 
	doing a full diagnostics.

				THORGAN
			(into headset)
		Almost done.

				KAY-EM 14
		Ow!

				THORGAN
		Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.

				KAY-EM 14
		Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.

	INT. WALKWAY ONE

	Boeman enters, throws his pack to the ground and goes to work ttaching a 
	device to
	the wall of the huge glass connector.

	INT. WALKWAY TWO

	Janessa enters and goes through the same motions.

	INT. WALKWAY THREE

	Delongpre and Rizzo attach a device to the wall.

				DELONGPRE
		Put your finger here.

	SHe does so. Delongpre connects several wires. Rizzo looks nervous. 
	Delongpre notices.

				DELONGPRE
		My father wanted me to be a businessman.

	Silence.

				DELONGPRE
		That's why I'm here.

				RIZZO
		So, you thought you'd be cool. Go against
		your father's wishes? Yeah, that's grown up.

	Delongpre looks at her like she's crazy.

				DELONGPRE
		My father's company imports and exports. Archaeology 
		is part of the business. We happen to get along just 
	fine,
		smartass. Look, why don't you bust somebody else's 
	balls
		for a change.

				RIZZO
		I thought you meant...

				DELONGPRE
		You thought I meant...too tough to apologize, huh?
		You must have been a very lonely girl.

	Silence. Neither speaks.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Thorgan rips a metallic sink from the wall. It CRASHES to the floor.

				THORGAN
		Sorry, sorry.

				KAY-EM 14(O.S.)
		Who are you apologizing to?

				THORGAN
		Good point.

	INT.  WALKWAY ONE

	Boeman attaches another charge. He's sweating. Nervous. Keeps looking
	over his shoulder. Standing alone on this long walkway is a creepy 
	sight.

	INT.  WALKWAY TWO

	Janessa stops working, listens.

	KA-THUMP -- There's anoise in the Cargo Bay.

	She covers the mike on her headset and calls out.

				JANESSA
		Thorgan, you little shit, is that you?

	No answer. She quickly turns to her pack and pulls out the bottle of 
	tranquillizer
	and a monster syring.e She fills this rhino syringe with a massive 
	dosage. Enough to
	bring down a Rhino...or Jason maybe?

	She starts moving down the walkway toward the Cargo Bay.
	Surely she's not that stupid.

	INT.  WALKWAY THREE

	Rizzo is staring at Delongpre as he works on another device.
	Then --

				RIZZO
		When I was four, the ocean quit producing
		life. Too many pollutants. Nuclear testing,
		the occasional terrorist bombing...the
		atmosphere was shit by the time I was eight.
		We moved underground when I was twelve.

	Delongpre stares at her. He doesn't want to speak and screw up this
	rare moment of sharing.

	INT.   CARGO BAY

	Janessa enters. Looks around.

	The cargo bay is dark and looming. Lights flicker. Emergency lights
	strobe. It's hard to make anything out.

	We hear Rizzo speaking Off Screen.

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		My father was an army Scientist.
		Genetics. The army thought they could
		develop humans able to survive the Earth
		we had created

	Janessa moves through the debris.

	ANOTHER POV

	We see Janessa come into view.

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		Jason seemed to have the right stuff.
		Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell
		damage, didn't matter. He just kept
		going.

	INT.  WALKWAY THREE

				DELONGPRE
		Were you close to your father?

	Thorgan interrupts over the headset.

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		Delongpre? What did you do with the
		chain gun?

	Delongpre frowns.

				DELONGPRE
			(into mike)
		It's on the table where I left it!
		What the hell are you doing?!
		Hurry up!

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		I'm on my way.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Thorgan, quit screwing around and
		come on!

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		I'm coming, I'm coming.

				DELONGPRE
		Sorry, you were saying?

	INT. CARGO BAY

	WATCHER'S POV

	JANESSA approaches the pile of debris where Jason was buried.

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		I got along great with my father,
		my mother too. Dad and the others thought
		they could learn a great deal from this 
		thing the army had been keeping on ice for
		over a hundred years.

	Janessa moves the debris around with her foot.

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		They were all wrong. They couldn't control
		him.

	INT. WALKWAY THREE

				DELONGPRE
		And what happend to ...?

	Rizzo begins to tear up.

				RIZZO
		I couldn't save them.

				DELONGPRE
		Well, we'd be dead without you.
		You know that, don't you?

	She stares at him.

				DELONGPRE
		It's true.
			(chuckles)
		You caused enough stink that we
		were at least a little cautious.
		Of course this is the first field
		trip I went on that had a body count.

	She gives him a  half smile.

				DELONGPRE
		I'm not much, but I promise, I won't
		let this guy get you.

	Another half smile. It's a sweet gesture, but what can this guy really 
	do?

	INT. CARGO BAY

	JASON'S POV

	He watches Janessa from a  distance. Moving slowly and silently toward 
	her.

	She stands and turns as --

	SERGEANT BRODSKI grabs her!

	She SCREAMS.

	He's covered in blood from a gaping wound in his gut.

				BRODSKI
		Where is everybody? What happened?

				JANESSA
		Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!

				BRODSKI
		Give me a break! What happened?

				JANESSA
		Jason. He's what happened. Then 
		Grendel hit Space Lab.

				BRODSKI
		Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands
		on Yllo.

				JANESSA
		Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.

				BRODSKI
		Takes more than a steelbalde to take
		this old dog down.

	KA-THUNK! 

	JASON"S MACHETE THRUSTS though Brodski's gut. Jason spins Brodski around 
	and tosses him to the floor!

				BRODSKI
		Yup, that ought'a do it.

	Jason turns on Janessa.

	She stands frozen in fear.

	Jason raises his machete and --

	JANESSA

	Lights a flare, blinding Jason for the moment. Then she sinks the Rhino 
	syringe 
	into his chest! Jason stumbles...falls hard on his ass and sits there 
	staring
	at her.

				JANESSA
		Well go on! Pass out!

	Jason tears the syringe away and tosses it aside.

				JANESSA
		Shit.

	Jason starts to climb to his feet. Janessa turns to run.

				BRODSKI
			(weak)
		He-help me...

	He holds his hand out to her. Then--

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		I'm blowing Walkway One. Hold on.

	KA-FOOM! The SHIP BUCKS!

	Janessa runs, leaving the sergeant behind.

	INT.  CARGO BAY - OUTSIDE WALKWAY THREE

	Delongpre closes the door, then --

				DELONGPRE
		We're blowing three. Hang on.

	He throws a switch!

	INT. CARGO BAY - BRIDGE SIDE

	Boeman vaults over a pile of rubble.

				BOEMAN
		Janessa, we're on our way to you!

	INT. WALKWAY TWO

	Holding hands, Delongpre and Rizzo enter. They stop...stand...stare.

	The walkway is empty. Janessa is gone.

	Boeman rushes up behind them.

				BOEMAN
		Where is...?

				DELONGPRE
		You tell me! She's only set one
		charge. And it's not finished!

	With that Janessa tears into the walkway. She's out of breath. She can 
	barely speak.

				BOEMAN
		Where have you been?!!

				JANESSA
		He....He...

				DELONGPRE
		He's coming!!!

	THEIR POV

	JASON moves through the debris. He's coming straight for them.

				BOEMAN
		Run!!

	They race down the length of the walkway. Jason right behind them.

				RIZZO
		We can't lead him into the other hull!

				BOEMAN
		We don't have a choice!

	Boeman slams the door panel. The door slowly rises.

	Jason approaches, stops, stares at his future victims. If he could smile
	with anticipation...he would. He raises his Machete --

	Then stops. Lowers it.

	CHA-CHUNG. CHA-CHUNG. CHA-CHUNG.

	He turns his back on our heroes. They crane their necks to see what has 
	pulled
	his attention.

	THORGAN marches down the walkway with KAY-EM 14. The new and imporved 
	KAY-EM 14.

	Where her severed arm had once been, a chain gun is now attached. A 
	laser cannon is
	mounted over her shoulder. Her body has been reinforced with steel from 
	around the lab.
	Sinks, trays, you name it. She's the junk yard man's terminator. Then --

				KAY-EM 14
		Do I have to?

				THORGAN
		Yes, I've reprogrammed you.
		You are very brave. Bad ass.

				KAY-EM 14
		Oh, alright.

	KAY-EM 14 INTERNAL SCAN POV

	We see a somewhat computerized image of Jason through Kay-Em's personal 
	scan.
	One the display we see:

	SUBJECT: DEAD
	CHANCES OF FUNCTION: 100 PERCENT
	DOES NOT COMPUTE . . . DESTROY SUBJECT

				KAY-EM 14
		Come on, boy. Let's see if we can
		open up  can'a whoop ass!

	BRAAAATTTT! The chain gun rings! Jason is SLAMMED into the HULL DOORS.

				DELONGPRE
		Holy shit!

	JASON jumps up and rushes at Kay-Em who catches him and tosses him down 
	the walkway --

	BRAAAATTT! Kay-Em opens up again. Kay-Em's weaponry shoves Jason out 
	into the cargo
	bay witha  blur of bullets.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

				BOEMAN
		What are we waiting for?!!
		Come on!!

	Our heroes rush down the walkway toward the cargo bay. Boeman and 
	Delongpre go to
	work setting the charges.

				BOEMAN
			(to Janessa)
		Where the hell were you?!!

				JANESSA
		He came for me, I had to run!

				THORGAN
			(into mike)
		Kay-Em, you okay?

	INT. CARGO BAY

				KAY-EM 14
		Don't worry about me. I live for this shit.

	And with that, Kay-Em BLOWS the now standing Jason into another wall 
	with the laser 
	cannon.

	INT. WALKWAY TWO

				BOEMAN
		Toss me a chip.

	Delongpre pulls a trinket from his pack and pitches it to Boeman.

				BOEMAN
		Thorgan, you're brilliant.
		Have I told you that lately?

	Thorgan is standing at the end of the walkway staring into the cargo 
	bay.
	He looks sad.

				THORGAN
			(quietly)
		See you around.

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	Kay-Em 14 marches toward the downed Jason, and starts singing an old Sea 
	Shanty.

				KAY-EM 14
		She's the Yellow Rose of Taegu,
		the girl that I adore. Her cunt
		it smells like cock juice; she's
		a good two-dollar whore. You may
		talk to me of Seoul girls or whores
		from Tokyo, but the yellow rose of 
		Taegu beats them all, I'd you know.

	BRATTTT!!!

	Kay-Em blows Jason into --

	INT. HALL BETWEEN LABS AND CARGO

	She kicks him down the long corridor.

	INT. WALKWAY TWO 

	The hull SCREAMS from the exterior pressure. The ship RUMBLES.

				BOEMAN
		I'd say we have about ten minutes tops.

				DELONGPRE
		Then stop talking and work faster!

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Jason BURSTS through the debris that had been blocking the Lab!
	Kay-Em enters behind him.

				KAY-EM 14
			(still singing)
		She was a young and charming girl;
		her age was scarce sixteen.

	JASON rushes KAY-EM 14!

				KAY-EM 14
		She took me in and she kicked out
		a sailor and marine.

	KA-CHING!!!!

	His machete bounces off of Kay-Em's new armor.

				KAY-EM 14
		She had no titties on her chest;
		that didn't bother me,

	WHAM!

	Kay-Em 14 back hands Jason across the room. He crashes into the glass
	speciments. Goo and formaldehyde covering him.

				KAY-EM 14
		For what she had between her legs
		was big enough for three.

	INT. WALKWAY TWO

	Boeman and Delongpre are finishing up.

				BOEMAN
		Okay, Janessa, give me your last charge.

	Janessa looks around, then --

				JANESSA
		I...I don't know what I did...

				DELONGPRE
		You lost the charge?

				JANESSA
		He was chasing me!

				RIZZO
		Can we blow it with just two?

				BOEMAN
		If we don't sever the hull completely
		she'll drag us down with her.

				DELONGPRE
		Then what do we do?!

				BOEMAN
		I don't know!

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Kay-Em stands over Jason. And for the first time in ten films Jason is 
	in bad shape.
	But still climbs to his feet...slowly.

				KAY-EM 14
		Why you low life, scum sucking,
		rat dick blowing, sum bitch.
		Your mamma must'a had some huge balls.

	Of course, as anyone knows, you don't diss Jason's mother.

	Jason leaps, tacking Kay-Em 14! They roll into another glass case. 
	Glass, formaldehyde and specimens
	rain down on top of them.

	Having lost his machete, Jason BASHES at Kay-Em with his fists. OVER and 
	OVER. He
	catches a rhythm. Kay-Em is trapped below.

	INT. WALKWAY TWO

				DELONGPRE
		Well, it was a good plan.

	They look at one another -- hopless. Then --

				BRODSKI(O.S.)
		You stupid bitch!

	Everyone jumps as Sergeant Brodski leans against the walkway door frame.
	He's bound his wounds with a make-shift tourniquet wrapped around his 
	mid-section.

				BRODSKI
		Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!

				BOEMAN
		Sergeant? We thought you were...

				BRODSKI
		Yeah, yeah.
			(to Janessa)
		Well, what have you got to say for yourself?

				JANESSA
		I don't know...sorry?

				RIZZO
		Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.

				BRODSKI
		Bomb?

				BOEMAN
		Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.

	The sergeant tosses his pack to the ground.

				BRODSKI
		How much you need?

	INT. LAB ONE

	WHAM...WHAM...WHAM... A RAIN of firststaking on this droid from the 
	future.

	Finally, Jason stops. Straddling KAy-Em 14 he stares at his kill...until 
	--

				KAY-EM 14
			(condescending)
		That was very good. You should
		feel very good about yourself
		right now. Good effort.
			(tough voice)
		How could you hit a girl you sumbitch?!

	Kay-Em 14 places the chaingun over Jason's chest.

	BRAAAATTTT!!!!

	Jason is blown across the room!

				KAY-EM 14
		Okay, dip shit. Time to finish
		you off so I can go home and boink
		your momma with a corndog. The kinky
		bitch.

	Chaingun and laser cannon UNLEASH A MASSIVE DISPLAY on the fleshly body 
	of
	JASON VOORHEES.

	The top portion of Jason's mask shatters!

	hIS RIGHT LEG IS TURNED INTO A PILE OF MEAT, then blown clean off for 
	good measure!
	Jason falls on his ass!

	He raises his machete arm. A last ditch effort. Could he be that lucky?
	To throw a machete and stop this onslaught?

	CHA-CHING!

	NOPE.

				KAY-EM 14
			(singing)
		Bang, bang Maxewells silver hammer
		came down upon his head. Doo-pee-
		do-do. Bang, bang Maxewell's silver
		hammer made sure that he was dead...

	Jason climbs to his one good leg but i t only serves as a better aim
	for Kay-Em 14.

	KA-FOOM! The laser cannon blows Jason's left arm to hell.

	KA-FOOM! KA-FOOM!

	Two more blasts send Jason flying through the back wall and sliding 
	across the floor.

	KAY-EM 14'S INTERNAL SCAN POV

	This time, Jason's body doesn't move.

	SUBJECT: DEAD
	CHANCE OF FUNCTION: ZERO PERCENT
	MISSION OF OBJECTIVES: COMPLERED

				KAY-EM 14
		Oh...my...god. What have I done?
			(crying)
		Thorgan!

	Kay-Em turns and races down the hall.

				KAY-EM 14
		Thorgan I'm a murderer!

	INT.  WALKWAY TWO

	Boeman and Delongpre hustle to set the final charge.

				BRODSKI
		Blowing the walkway? You come up
		with that yourself?

				BOEMAN
		Rizzo did.

	CHA-CHUNG...CHA-CHUNG. Kay-Em steps into the walkway. She's covered in
	blood.

				THORGAN
		Kay-Em!

				BOEMAN
		What are you doing back?!!

				KAY-EM 14
			(sad)
		Sumbitch won't be giving us
		anymore trouble.

				RIZZO
		You killed him?

				KAY-EM 14
			(regret)
		Blew half his skull away, one leg,
		one arm and left his entrails
		stretched across the lab. And look
		at me! I'm covered in his filthy blood!

				THORGAN
		You did good, Kay-Em. I'm proud of you.

				KAY-EM 14
		A real mamma's boy that one.
		Dissed his mamma and he nearly
		threw a tantrum. Little good it did him.

				RIZZO
		His mother?

				BOEMAN
		What?

				RIZZO
		I don't know. Nothing.

	Suddenly the ship's hull SCREAMS. The ship BUCKS. Everyone tumbles.

				BOEMAN
		Hurry up people! We're running out
		of time.

	INT.  LAB ONE 

	Jason's body is propped up against a machine in the same position we saw 
	it before. This
	mass of torn flesh doesn't move.

	The ship BUCKS again.

	The machine HUMS to life. BUZZING and BEEPING. Suddenly a laser scans 
	Jason's
	body.

	PULL BACK TO REVEAL

	Jason is leaned up against the Nano-Tech machine.

	INT. WALKWAY TWO

	Thorgan runs wire to each device.

				THORGAN
		As long as they're connected we can 
		blow them all simultaneously from
		a safe distance.

				BOEMAN
		Two more charges to go.

	INT. LABE ONE - NANO-TECH MACHINE

	We see a schematic of Jason's battered body on the monitor. Nano-
	technology
	is already at work.

	Hoses and wires now encircle Jason's body. We follow one of the hoses 
	until it ends
	over --

	A WASTE BEND

	nside we see pile of bullets. Stuff falls from the hose. Bullets from 
	the chaingun,
	bullets from  every previous Jason movie. A broken machete blade drops 
	to the pile.
	The tip of an arrow. A couple of knives. A pair of pliers. An ink pen. 
	The skeleton
	of a fish.

	The scanning lasers move to the stump at Jason's shoulder. We see the 
	image as a new arm, fuzzy
	adn distorted, is being constructed.

	On the schematic, we see Jason's internal organs being repaired.

	By now  we've figured out ...nothing good can come of this.

	INT.  WALKWAY TWO

	Kay-Em 14 hits a button. The door begins to slide down slowly.

				THORGAN
		Done!

				BOEMAN
		Let's move out!

				BRODSKI
		Kid, you ever thought about the marine corp?

	Delongpre calls fromthe far end of the walkway, welder in his hand.

				DELONGPRE
		I need another minute. Come on!

	ON OUR HEROES

	Suddenly there is a GRINDING SOUND. Engines WHINE from behind them.

	The group stops and turns.

	The cargo door is starting to smoke. It SQUEALS as it slowly opens.

				BRODSKI
		Well fuck me.

				KAY-EM 14
		No, fuck me.

	The door opens and Jason steps into the walkway.

	But he's no Jason we've ever seen before. His leg and arm are now
	SHINY METAL. His clothes are BLACK, no longer tattered. His mask is 
	CHROME.
	We can't see them, but we know...his insides are in better shape than 
	ever.

				THORGAN
		Kay-Em? Re-engage killer instinct.

				KAY-EM 14
		Yeeee-haw!!!!

	BRAAAATTTTT!

	Kay-em firs. But, this time it doesn't seem to faze Jason. SPARKS fly as
	bullets vounce off of his metal limbs.

	Jason swings his new improved machete. It CLANGS off of Kay-Em's armor, 
	removing a hunk of metal.

	Jason grabs her and swings her into the glass walkway. Glass CRACKS.
	One of the wires, connecting two charges severs.

				BOEMAN
		Shit!

	Kay-em does a back flip, kicking Jason in the chest. He's shoved 
	backwards.

	Boeman attempts to splice the wires back together as the battle ensues.

	IT'S MASSIVE! Intellectual synthetic droid verses psychotic metallic 
	killer.
	SPARKS FLY. GUNFIRE SOUNDS. Then Kay-Em does a round house kick, but 
	Jason uses 
	his machete as a shield. Kay-Em's leg is nearly sliced off at the knee.

	She stumbles...falls to the ground.

				THORGAN
		Kay-Em!!!

	Boeman splices the wires together.

				BOEMAN
		Done!!

	Then turns to see Jason approaching.

				BOEMAN
		RUN!!

	But Jason's too close. He grabs Boeman.

	ON KAY-EM

	As her body separates from her legs mid-thigh. CHCHHHHH!
	THRUSTERS IGNITE from her lower thighs.

	As Jason raises his machete to do Boeman in --

	KA-FWAM! Kay-Em slams into him! Knocking Boeman free.

	Jason and the now hovering Kay-Em go at it again.

	CHANG! CLANG! CLUNK! Metal against metal. Kay-Em hovers up the walls, 
	over Jason's 
	head...but Jason has come into his own with these new body parts. She's 
	no match. Finally --

	JASON EMBEDS HIS MACHETE IN KAY-EM'S THROAT

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Jason rears back and shoves his fist though Kay-Em's chestplate! his 
	fist from Kay-Em's
	chest and wraps his metallic hand around he throat.

				THORGAN
		Kay-Em! Get away!

	Thorgan moves toward his robotic love but Boeman grabs him and pulls him 
	down
	the hall.

				KAY-EM 14
		That's the best you can do?

	Jason yanks his machete from the side of Kay-Em's neck. Severing her 
	head
	from her body. It flies down the hallway behind the kids.

				KAY-EM 14
		Is that it? Come back and fight like a man!

	JASON 

	Turns his glare on our heroes racing toward Delongpre at the other end.

	DELONGPRE

				DELONGPRE
		Done!

	Delongpre lifts his welder's mask to call to the others when he sees 
	JASON.

				DELONGPRE
		Shit, hurry!

	OUR HEROES

	Run toward the door. But, Thorgan stops.

				BOEMAN
		What...?

	Thorgan turns, runs back toward Jason.

				BOEMAN
		What are you doing?!!

	Thorgan is running to retrieve Kay-Em 14's head. It lies between he and 
	Jason.
	He'll never make it!  Thorgan hits the floor, slides and scoops up the 
	head.

				KAY-EM 14
		I think I'm going to throw up...

	BUT IT'S TOO LATE.

	Jason raises his machete from his belt and --

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		Hey, dickhead!

	JASON TURNS AS --

	KA-CHUNG!!!! Rizzo nails him with a metal ar.

				RIZZO
			(to Thorgan)
		Go!

	Jason stumbles backwards then whirls on Rizzo.

				RIZZO
		Oh, yeah, you remember me.

	He sure does.

	She turnsa dn runs.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As the others race into the engien room they turn to watch.

				BOEMAN
		Hurry!

				DELONGPRE
		Faster! Don't we have another gun?

	Rizzo catches up to Thorgan but they have a long way to go
	and Jason is gaining.

				JANESSA
		They're not gonna make it. Close the door
		before he gets us all.

				DELONGPRE
		They'll make it.

				JANESSA
		Close the fucking door!

				DELONGPRE
		NO!

	JANESSA leaps forward and hits the switch. The door begins sliding 
	slowly shut.

				DELONGPRE
		Damnit!

	Boeman hits the button again.

				DELONGPRE
			(glares at Janessa)
		Forget it. I had to rewire it.
		Once it's started it won't stop.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	JASON

	TWENTY PACES BEHIND

	INT.  ENGINE ROOM

				DELONGPRE
		Get ready to blow it.

	Rizzo dives, slides under the closing door.

	Thorgan follows her lead, but his slide doesn't have the same force. He 
	stops with the door
	coming down on his lower back.

	Luckily, Delongpre snatches his arms and yanks him through.

	The door closes!

				DELONGPRE
		Now!

	Boeman turns the switch.

	INT.  MIDSHIP WALK WAY

	The charges BLOW! A FIREBALL rushes toward the running JASON!

	INT.  ENGINE ROOM

	CLOSE ON DOOR

	AS KA-FWAM!!!

	JASON'S BODY IMPRINTS IN THE NOW SEALED DOOR.

	EXT. GRENDEL

	The walkway explodes, severing Grendel into two separate hulls. 
	The left damaged hull, sinks out of view as the engine side begins
	to pull away. Then --

	KA-FOOM!!

	Grendel's LEFT HULL finallay EXPLODES!! They barely amde it.

	INT.  ENGINE ROOM

	The right hull BUCKS from the force of the blast. Our heroes are 
	aireborne for a moment 
	then crash to the floor.

				BRODSKI
		Damage?

	Boeman climbs to a console.

				BOEMAN
		Minimal.

				RIZZO
		We made it?

				DELONGPRE
		I think...I think maybe we did.

	CHEERS

	Thorgan looks into Kay-Em 14's severed head.

				THORGAN
		Kay-Em we made it!

				KAY-EM 14
		Oh, goody. I'm so pleased.
		I'd clap if I could.

	Boeman CLICKS on a console keyboard.

				BOEMAN
		I've changed the course for Earth II.
		And I sent a distress signal.

				VOICE(V.O.)
		Roger, Grendel. What's the problem?

				BOEMAN
			(into mike)
		Our ship has been damaged, most of
		the crew dead. We need evac.

				VOICE
		Copy that Grendel. Rescue enroute.
		You should hit EARTH II orbit in fifteen
		minutes. Rescue ETA twenty minutes.

	CHEERS!

				BOEMAN
		We're going home people.

	More CHEERS.

	Rizzo turns to find Delonpre staring at her.

				DELONGPRE
			(big smile)
		See? We're not so bad.

				RIZZO
		Not so bad.

	There's that moment when we think the two might kiss. She takes a step
	toward him. Yes, they are going to kiss --

	BOOM!

	WARNING LIGHTS. WARNING ALARMS. The sound of SUCKING WIND. AS JASON,
	still very alive shoves his fist through the imprinted door with his
	metal hand!

	As he rips a bigger hole to gain entrance our heroes are fighting to 
	hold
	on to anything.

	The Hole is sucking everything not tied down out into space.

	Boeman is the first to reach the reactor room door.

				BOEMAN
		This way!

	He pulls Sergeant Brodski through the door as -- 

	JASON

	Fights his way through the opening in the hull.

	The engines BUCK and begin to SMOKE.

				BOEMAN
		The pressures cause the engines to overheat!
		Hurry!

	Delongpre helps Rizzo and Thorgan to safety.

	Janessa crawls across the floor digging her fingers into the steel mesh.

	SERGEANT BRODKSI

	Lying in the door's threshold reaches out and snags her hand.

				JANESSA
		Pull me in!

				BRODSKI
		I'm pulling, damnit!

	But Jason grabs Janessa's ankle and jerks. She's pulled from the 
	Sergeant's
	grasp.

	She flops around in the sucking wind as Jason watches. He lets go.

	She flies toward the hole, slams into it.

	Everything goes quiet for a moment. As he body has sealed the hole then 
	--

	SHHHHHHHHOOOOOK!

	She's sucked into space in a most grotesque manner.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

				BRODSKI
		Well, that's a shame.

	INT. REACTOR CORE

	Hug cylindrical machines run the length of this enormous room.
	They HUM quietly as our group enters.

				BRODSKI
		We need weapons.

				RIZZO
		Weapons? All this technology and
		what good has it done?!

				DELONGPRE
		It bought us some time.

				BOEMAN
		And now we're all out of it.

	Everyone stares at Boeman. He's standing at another console.

				BOEMAN
		The ship's depressurizing, the engines
		overheating. When it  reaches the core,
		we're done.

				RIZZO
		Done?

				THORGAN
		Kaboom.

				DELONGPRE
		Again?! Jesus!

				RIZZO
		Why am I not surprised?

	Thorgan still clutches Kay-Em 14's severed head.

				KAY-EM 14
		You must shut down the engines.

				DELONGPRE
		Then do it. The rescue ship can
		find us here right?

				BRODSKI
		Can't shut em' down from here.

				BOEMAN
		Somebody's gonna have to go back
		to the engine room.

				DELONGPRE
		You ain't catching my ass in there again.

	Brodski, still bleeding, pale, struggling to stand --

				BRODSKI
		I'll go.

	The kids give him the "are you crazy?" stare.

				BOEMAN
		You're too weak. I'll go.

	KA-FWAM! Everyone jumps but this time it's only Rizzo. She broke a metal 
	stand and has
	yanked one of the legs free.

				RIZZO
		You know, this future shit sucks.
		I'll fucking do it.

				DELONGPRE
		You?

				RIZZO
			(mumbling)
		Wait around on your asses all day.
			(turns to Thorgan)
		I'll need a distraction.

				THORGAN
		What kind of a distraction?

	INT. ENGINE ROOM

	JASON is pounding on the reactor room door. A difficult act with the 
	continued pressure 
	trying to suck him into space.

	THEN
				RIZZO
		HEY!

	Jason turns to find Rizzo standing in the doorway behind him. 

				RIZZO
		You want some of me?

	Jason whirls around and lurches toward her clinging to machinery as he 
	goes.


	INT.  ENGINE ROOM CORRIDOR

	Rizzo backs slowly as Jason closes in.

	As he reaches the corridor, she turns and runs.

	RIZZO

				RIZZO
		Come on, keep up.

	Jason barrels toward her.

				RIZZO
		You want some of me or not?

	She stops at a door, but doesn't attmept ot open it.

	Jason comes closer..and closeer...but Rizzo doesn't move --

	Jason moves in for the kill, raises his machete, and --

				RIZZO
		Take your best shot --

	SLASH!

	RIZZO'S CHEST IS SPLIT OPEN!

				RIZZO
			(laughs)
		I'm melting! I'm melting!

	SLASH! Her arm falls to the ground!

				RIZZO
		See now that was stupid.
		Persistent, yes, but stupid.

	Jason shoves his fist, through her chest and into the wall.

				RIZZO
		Not this time, asshole. This time
		I'm gonna watch you burn in hell.

	INT.  ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 

	The real RIZZO rips off her virtual reality helmet.

				RIZZO
		Make it fast. He's coming.

	Delongpre is punching numbers into the keypad. Both are wearing 
	headsets.

				DELONGPRE
		Almost got it.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As Jason returns to the engine room, none too pleased at being tricked.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue
		ship on radar.

				RIZZO
		Delongpre! Out of time!

				DELONPRE
		Got it!

	Rizzo jersk Delonpre and both spill into the reactor
	corridor. Rizzo slaps the panel. the door closes!
	Shutting out Jason's image.

				DELONGPRE
		Damn that was close!

	WHAM!

	THE ENGINE ROOM door RIPS in half. JASON CLIMBS through.

	RIZZO AND DELONGPRE RUN!

				RIZZO
			(into radio)
		Guys, he's right behind us!

		THORGAN(V.O.)
		It's okay.

		DELONGPRE
		Okay?!!

		THORGAN(V.O.)
		Just come on, I've got an idea.

	They race down the long corridor toward the reactor room.
	JASON IN PURSUIT.

	INT. DOCKING BAY

	Thorgan is typing like mad at small portable keyboard.
	Boeman stares out the docking bay window.

	HIS POV 

	There's damage, lots of it.

				BOEMAN
			(into radio)
		The docking bay was damaged after the
		explosion. Meet us at the airlock.

	INT. REACTOR ROOM corridor.

				DELONGPRE
		Got it.
			(to Rizzo)
		You ever space walked?

				RIZZO
		Oh sure, all the time.

	They leap through a door, closing it behind them, then keep running.

	BEHIND THEM

	KA-FWAM! Jason barrels right through the door.

				RIZZO
			(into headset)
		Damit, Thorgan, whatever you're doing...
		you'd better hurry!
			(growls)
		I hate the future!

	INT.  REACTOR CORE

	Rizzo and Delongpre enter in a  mad rush. Delongpre closes the door.
	Little good it'll do.

	INT. REACTOR ROOM CORRIDOR

	JASON kicks the door with his metallic leg!

	KA-FWAM! The door shatters and he stumlbes into --

	EXT.  CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	Forest, cabins, the lake. Everything as we and Jason remember.
	But somehow distroted. A strange hue covers everything.

	No, on second look, it's not exactly the way we remember. The trees are
	strange looking. Not the Pines and Oaks of Connecticut, but something 
	foreign.
	The cabins look a little too advanced to be stuck in the middle of a 
	camp.
	But the image will do.
					QUICK CUT TO:

	INT.  REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY

	Thorgan stands at a keyboard clicking away. Boeman is wearing a space 
	suit.
	He's helping sergeatn Brodski into his.

	At the other end of the huge room, Jason wanders ... with confusion.

				THORGAN
		Don't worry. He can't see us.

	Rizzo glances out the docking bay window.

				RIZZO
		Is that...?

	THROUGH WINDSHIELD

	We see a planet much the same color as Earth, but the continents are 
	wrong.

				DELONGPRE
		Earth II.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Suit up.

	Delongpre leads Rizzo to a suit.

				DELONGPRE
		I'll help you in.

				THORGAN
			(into headset)
		Kay-Em, you've saved our lives,
		you know that don't you?

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Kay-Em 14's head sits on the floor in the center of room.

				KAY-EM 14
		It was my pleasure, my love.
		Perhaps if all works for the best
		you can rebuild me and we can try that
		doggie style thing again.

	DOCKING BAY

	The others stare at Thorgan...he looks embarrassed to say the least.

				DELONGPRE
		I knew you were a little sick, but Geez.

	ON KAY-EM

				KAY-EM 14
			(singing happily)
		I get no kick from champaign, mere
		alcohol doesn't faze me at all,
		but I get a kick out of you.

				THORGAN
			(under his breath)
		Goodbye, my love.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Thorgan, suit up.

				THORGAN
			(to Rizzo)
		This is gonna work. If he sticks to the
		program. Will he? Stick to the program?

				RIZZO
		His mother was killed before his eyes.
		That's what drove him insane. It'll work.

				DELONGPRE
		That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of
		that future shit.

				RIZZO
		Eat me.

	She smiles as she jersk the helmet out of his hand.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Jason slowly walks beside Kay-Em 14.

					QUICK-CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	Jason is walking along the lake when he sees --

	A CAMPFIRE off in the distance. LAUGHTER, SINGING.
	CAMPERS!!!

	He takes off toward the campfire, then hears --

	SPLASHING. 

	He turns.

	HIS POV

	Within the distorted lake, someone is drowning. Could it be a little 
	boy?
	A little Jason from many years ago?

				WOMAN
		Help me!
			(gurgles)
		Jason help me!

	JASON

	Moves toward the beach. Steps partly into the water.

	HIS POV

	THE WOMAN, THE VOICE. IT'S JASON'S MOTHER!

	He turns toward the campfire, back to his mother...what to do?! Then --

	JASON TEARS INTO THE WATER, TRYING TO REACH HER.

				MRS. VOORHEES
		Help me, Jason, please! Help your mother!

	Jason moves closer.

				MRS. VOORHEES
		Don't let me die again!

	As he draws near, she reaches out her hands to him.

	JASON

	Pauses staring at the please for help.

	He stares into her pleading face. HIS MOTHER! After all these years!

	He places his hand over her face, gently, then --

	PUSHES HER UNDER!

	He holds her there.

								QUICK-CUT TO:

	INT. REACTOR ROOM

				KAY-EM 14
		Uh-oh. That's not a part of the program.
		Thorgan, we've got a problem!

	EXT.  CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE 

	Camp Cyrstal lake begins to jerk and fade.

	INT.  REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY

	Everyone is suited up. Delongpre, the last, is adjusting his helmet.

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		Oh, shit. He's going to see us.

				DELONGPRE
		Well, do something!

	Thorgan grabs the portable keyboard and starts typing away!

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	Suddenly the image solidifies then a number of the aliens from the game
	grid appear. But Jason's seen these guys before. He tears through them.

	INT. REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY

				THORGAN
		Shit!

	Boeman hits the door panel to the docking bay. It begins to slowly rise.

				BOEMAN
		Just a little more time.

	EXT.  CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	Jason stands atop a pile of dead alien like some strange Conan in space.
	The image flickers...he  catches a glimpse of our heroes at the end fo 
	the 
	room. He starts toward them.

	Then a huge white fluffy bunny with huge breasts appears before him.

				WHITE FLUFFY BUNNY
			(sings; deep african american voice)
		I'm'a big fluffy bunny...a big white fluffy bunny...

	SWISH! The bunny's head is severed. The image distortss. Again we see 
	our 
	heroes. Jason is closer.

	INT.  REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY

	The door is halway open. Our heroes start ducking under.

	Jason is almost on them.

				RIZZO
		Thorgan!!!!

	He's clicking away like a mad man.

	EXT.  CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	A ROCK BAND appears playing some futuristic metal. Then CHEERLEADERS in 
	scantily clad outfits. Then a MIDGIT in a cowboy hat riding by on a 
	tricycle. We have now entered Thorgan's twisted streams of conciousness.

	Jason tears through the aboe. His goal now clear. The distractions no
	longer fool him.

	A volley ball court appears with naked girls bouncing around.
	A fat man wearing only a spiked leather Speedo. A huge turtle.
	A couple of goats.

	Nothing is stopping Jason.

	INT.  REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY

	Boeman reaches out and jerks Thorgan into the inner air lock.

	EXT.  CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	The image finally disintergrates.

	Jason finds himself staring at our heroes. He lunges for the air lock, 
	but --

	Sergeant Brodski dives, hitting Jason in the chest and knocking him to 
	the
	floor.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Sergeant!

				BRODSKI(V.O.)
		Get out of here!

	SERGEANT BRODSKI, still in Jason's clutches, kicks at the door panel.

	The door starts to close as Jason begins hacking with his machete.

				BRODSKI(V.O.)
		That all you got?!!

	Jason hacks and hack, stabbing through the space suit, until finally, 
	the tough
	old leather neck is silent for good.

	INT.  AIR LOCK

	The door is sealed.

				RIZZO
		He saved our lives.

	Boemen hits another button, and the outer door begins to open.

				DELONGPRE
		Boeman, the ships not here.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Use the thrusters and you'll
		be fine. We'll huddle together
		out there.

	EXT.  WHAT'S LEFT OF THE GRENDEL

	AS THE OUTER DOOR OPENS, RIZZO UNCOMFORTABLY FIDGETS WITH HER SUIT.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Hey, easy now.

	He points to where her hand hovers over some buttons on her sleeve.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		You wanna release your air tanks?

				RIZZO(V.O.)
			(nervous)
		Okay, good tip.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		You'll be fine.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters.
		We'll be fine.

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around.
		So far so good.

	WHAM!

	Jason starts pounding from the other side.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Don't worry. He can't get through that door.

	Delongpre's right. This isn't some thin interior door or some
	walkway door reinforced by a high school kid. This is an air lock
	door. Built to withstand laser cannons and meteors.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Thrusters.

	CHSHSHSHSH. CHSHSH.

	Our group enters deep space.

	EXT.  WHAT'S LEFT OF GRENDEL

	Rizzo, Thorgan, Boeman and Delongpre look tiny next to the massive
	right hull. They thrust slowly into space.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Rizzo, you okay?

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		No I'm not okay! I don't
		know what the hell I'm doing!

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		You're doing fine. I won't let
		anything happen to you, remember?

					QUICK CUT TO:

	INT. DOCKING BAY

	Jason finally gives up with the massive pounding. He steps back.
	Turns, stares at the sergeants' dead body, then looks at --

	THE DOOR PANEL

	He preses the button

	the ari lock door begins to open. Air is suddenly sucked out of the 
	room!

	Sergeant Brodski's body flies out into space. Everything not tied down 
	races out 
	along with him.

	ON KAY-EM 14'S HEAD

	AS it skitters across the floor --

				KAY-EM 14
		Ahhhhh!

	-- and right out the air lock

	JASON 

	holds onto a machine until the door is open, then lets go!
	He shoots out into space.

	EXT. GRENDEL

	Jason flies out of the air lock.

	HIS POV

	He's rocketing right toward one of the space suits!

	ANOTHER ANGLE

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time?

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		I think I had some when I was eight.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Did you like it?

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		I think so, why?

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		He's trying to ask you out on a date.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Shut up, Thorgan!

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		Delongpre, you don't even know me.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		I know you.

	Suddenly Rizzo is SLAMMED from behind. She and Jason go spinning away 
	from
	the others.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Nooooooo!!

	RIZZO

	grapples with Jason, but JASON IS JUST TOO STRONG.

	Jason holds HER with his good hand and REARS his metallic hand back. 
	He's
	going to punch a hole right through her helmet, most likely throat her 
	head,
	when --

	WHAM!

	Delongpre rockets into Jason, but Jason's got one of his arms
	sticking through one of Rizzo's harnesses. THe three go tumbling.

	Delongpre clings to Jason's back.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Rizzo, pull away!

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		I'm stuck!

	Jason reaches back, grabs Delongpre and jersk him over his head until 
	he's holding Delongpre
	around the thoat. He'll pop his helmet like a cork!

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	AS Thorgan and Boeman thrust towards the tumbling mass...

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		We're too far away!

	BACK TO JASON

	AS he tightens his grip around Delongpre's neck. He can't fight back.

	RIZZO is fighting to untangle her harness. We can hear
	Delongpre CHOKING over the radio.

	The three are spinning even closer and closer towards EARTH II.

	Then, Rizzo reaches down. She grabs Delongpre's leg and CLICKS a button 
	on her sleeve.

	KA-CHSSHSH!!!

	HER AIR TANK BLOWS!

	JASON IS THROWN OFF OF THEM!

	But he's still tangled in Rizzo's hoses. And now she has no air.

	Jason turns...grabs the hoses and begins pulling himself
	toward Rizzo and Delongpre.

	He has them...when --

	WHAM!

	BRODSKI

	Still barely alive barrels into Jason, vlinging to his back.
	He turns, slashes with his knife and severs the hoses.

	Jason and Brodski tumble towards EARTH II.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Rizzo's turning blue. She's about to pass out, when --

	Delongpre pulls a hose from his suit and hooks it into her tank.

	CHSHSHSH...

	AIR BEGINS TO FLOW.

	Rizzo takes a big GASP...coughs.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		You okay?!

				RIZZO(V.O.)
			(breathing steadily)
		Oh great...yeah, having a great
		time, and you?

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		No thank you, you crazy old woman.

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		Old woman?

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Well I mean, technically you are old
		enough to be my great, great, great...

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		I get it.

	Suddenly Boeman and Thorgan grab them.  The four survivors huddle 
	together.

				KAY-EM 14
		Hello? A little assistance here?

	They turn to see Kay-Em's head floating close by. Thorgan graps at her 
	and pulls
	her head into his arms.

	THE GROUP CHEERS.

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		Kay-em you okay?

				KAY-EM 14
		I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		I missed you too.

				KAY-EM 14
		I love you.

	Those two aren't the only two.

	CLOSE ON RIZZO AND DELONGPRE

	Their glass face masks are touching. They stare into each other's 
	eyes.

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		Chinese, huh?

	They laugh and turn to stare toward EARTH II.

	EXT.  EARTH II -- ORBIT

	Suddenly Jason's body comes into view. It's racing toward Earth II.
	Brodski riding it like Slim Pickens.

				BRODSKI
		Yeee---Haaaaa!!

	Slowly they begin entering the atmosphere.

	Immediately Brodski is engulfed in flames and is gone. He was a good
	man...stay to the end to make sure the job was done right.

	Spread eagle and alone, facing the planet below, Jason continues his
	descent.

	His fingers wiggle as his chrome mask begins to heat up.

          The crumbling, teetering legal

          I only vote to break a tie. But
          I wish to address the question of
          Judge Griffin's crime package. Is
          there any objection?

          That delusion has been tried and

          stiffens at the approach of his superior. Griffin silently
          indicates for him to stand at ease.

                         CENTRAL(CONT'D)
          Nine years ago, the Lawgiver Model
          Two replaced the Lawgiver Model One.
          The difference lies in two areas:
          The computer chip and the ammunition
          coding. Like the Model one, the
          computer chip recognizes the
          thumbcode of all Judges. Judges
          may use each other's firearms; but
          a suspect dare not use a Judge's
          .weapon against "a Judge.
          ANIMATION reminds us of this in non-gory fashion.

                         CENTRAL(CONT'D)
          However, the ammunition coding in
          the Model Two is not cued to the (X)
          thumbcode recognition chip.
          Instead, it is coded to the personal
          DNA of the Judge using the weapon.

          That block war was just the
          beginning. Now I want fear racing
          through every street... terror in
          every quad... panic in every block.
          Until those miserable rezzies think
          even their Judges can't save them.
          That's when the Council will turn
          to me... and to Janus.
          Rico moves towards the door. Pauses.

                         RICO
          Fear, Terror, Panic. I think I can
          handle that. After all...
          (slight.smile)
          Look how quickly I brought fear in
          here.
          His smile fades and he exits.

          There's been over thirty years of
          genetic research since Janus failed.
          What if we could create adult
          subjects, fully grown andfu3ly
          trained at birth? We could replace
          the Judges we've lost in weeks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXTREME CLOSEUP of glowing honey-colored stones.  Their shapes ABSTRACT
as THE CAMERA EXAMINES air bubbles and crystalline patterns.

MOVING UP AND OVER this amber abstraction, the CAMERA FINDS unusual
shapes and imperfections caught in the glassy stone:  flecks of dirt,
hairs, cracks.  STILL MOVING.  STARBURSTS OF LIGHT ricochet off the
different surfaces of the stones.

CAMERA TURNS along a creamy stretch of amber.  IT TURNS IN DEEPER,
abstracting the picture further only to find A TINY BLUR that suddenly
RACKS INTO FOCUS - a bug, a mosquito lodged within an amber tomb.  It is
folded on its back.

SLOW MOTION
 as the tip of a fine-pointed drill bores into the amber
toward the trapped bug.  Orange flecks fly.  The mosquito trembles.  The
drill continues, stopping just before it touches the tiny body.

A SHINY PAIR of thin needle-nose pliers reach in the borehole and
extricate the mosquito remains.  These are dropped on a brightly lit
glass slide.  A conveyor belt starts, and the slide moves along.
arriving under a long-lensed microscope.

IN MICROSCOPIC PERSPECTIVE, a thin needle pierces the bug and delicately
removes a fragment of tissue.

PINCERS snare the fragment, dropping it into a narrow tube.  The tube
SPINS, faster and faster until it is a BLUR on the screen.

THE SCREEN FLOODS with an INFRA-RED LIGHT.  Gray, oval shapes rock in a
neutral mist.

                                                     WASH OUT TO:

HOT SUN overhead in a BIG SKY -


EXT  BADLANDS - AFTERNOON

Lodged in the cracked earth are the partially-exposed fossilized remains
of A VELOCIRAPTER, a carnivorous dinosaur.  WIDEN OUT to a SWEEPI
NG
PANORAMA of a dinosaur dig, a major excavation filled with workers
shoveling earth and stone, making measurements, taking photographs,
scribbling notes, and conferring with each other.

The center of all this activity is one man.  In a roped-off area that
circumscribes the exposed bones of the raptor, is DR. ALAN GRANT, head
paleontologist.  Good-looking, late 30's, with a think beard.

Grant lies on his belly, completely absorbed in a small piece of bone.
A GROUP OF TWELVE STUDENTS, notebooks in hand, await his next sentence.

CLOSE ON - the tiny bone.  Grant's nose touches it.

Grant brushes the bone with a toothbrush.  Then he decides on a quicker
way to clean it.  He licks it.  Excited by his discovery, he gets to his
feet and addresses his students, who listen raptly.

                            GRANT
          Right calcaneus of an adult female
          raptor.  Mild stress fractures.  What's
          this tell me?

Students look at each other.  A tentative hand.  Grant continues.

               
             GRANT
          It tells me that this bone connects to
          the navicula which we already found
          articulating to the cuboid.

OFFSCREEN, a woman SHOUTS to him.

                            ELLIE (off)
          Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!

Grant looks up.

DR. ELLIE SATTLER, late 20's, sharp-eyed, tough if she wants to be, runs
like a gazelle across the arid land.  Exuberant, she leaves a trail of
dust behind her.

She zips by A STUDENT guarding the cordoned area.  He tries to stop her.

                            STUDENT
          Dr. Sattler!  Dr. Grant is thinking!

Dr. Grant waves her over enthusiastically with his bone and continues.

                            GRANT
          So, what can we stay for sure?  Stress
          fractures in the heel ...

Uncertain students.  Ellie arrives and immediately gets into it.

                            ELLIE
          She jumps.

Grant turns around to her and smiles.  She's got it.  Other students to
- they knew is all along.

            
                GRANT
          Right as rain, Ellie.  Now, why did she
          jump?

No answer.  Ellie gives it a try.

                            ELLIE
          A defensive posture against a vicious,
          blood-thirsty T-Rex?

                            GRANT
              (nodding)
          Perhaps.  Or maybe to select the smaller,
          more tender leaves in the higher branches
          with which to suckle her young?

Ellie jumps up.

                            ELLIE
          I bet is was a mating ritual.

Students laugh.  One student eyes Grant's self-conscious smile at Ellie.

                            GRANT
          The science of paleontology can't answer
          these questions.  Novelists and artists
          who dream a vision of the Jurassic period
          can attempt these questions with their
          imaginations.  What we scientists can say
          is considering the mass and kinetic
          articulation of these bones, this animal
          had a vertical leap
 of about twelve feet.
          Not as entertaining as fiction, but
          absolutely fact without prejudice.

Ellie intrudes again.

                            ELLIE
          Excuse me, Dr. Grant.  But ... fact is,
          we're late.  There's the car.

She points.  On the horizon, a limousine speeds toward them, leaving a
dusty wake.

Grant sets the rules for his departure, giving instructions individually
as Ellie pulls him away, carrying their bags.

                            GRANT
          Jim, you keep making up the plaster
          batches.  Whatever ratio you're using,
          it's perfect.  Nora, no digging after
          five - when the temperature drops, those
          bones are just too brittle.  Bill, I
          don't want any tourists walking over my
          raptor - I don't care if the Governor of
          Montana is with them, just you guys.

Grant and Ellie continue walking.  She interrupts his continued barrage.

                            ELLIE
          You know, if ev
ery scientist stuck to his
          method like you, there would be no body
          of theory - no quasars, no big bang -

Grant stops at the sight of the stopped limo and freezes.

                            GRANT
          Jesus, a limousine.  We're re-entering
          Hammond's world, that's for sure.  (beat)
          Remind me why we're doing this, Ellie.

Ellie is gentle.  She's telling him something they've discussed before.

                            ELLIE
          We're leaving the raptor dig -

                            GRANT
          - at a critical time -

                            ELLIE
          - because Gennaro is paying us sixty
          thousand dollars to observe some resort
          of Hammond's in Costa Rica. And that's -

                            GRANT
          - enough money to keep us free of
          commercial affiliations for two summers.
          All right, all right.  Good.

Then, half-kidding with Ellie:

                            GRANT
          Financial
 independence for fraternizing
          with the enemy?  (beat)  I'll do it.

She laughs.  But he can't quite leave.  He grabs a computer printout

                            GRANT
          This is all could come up with, Skip?

Skip turns the printout right-side up in Grant's hand.  Grant smiles.

                            GRANT
          Wise guy.  Let's go, Ellie.

Grant and Ellie board the limo amidst many goodbyes from the students.
The limo pulls away.


EXT  HIGH TECH BUILDING - BIOGENETIC CORPORATION HQ - SUNSET

A purple sunset irradiates the exterior glass walls of the building.


INT  BIOGEN HQ

A peanut flies in the air.  Then falls into a big open mouth.  THOMP.

                            MOUTH
          Five hundred thousand is peanuts!

He tosses another peanut and misses his open mouth.  This is DENNIS
NEDRY, a 40 year old computer programmer.  He's fat, with greasy hair
and a permanently wrinkled suit.  His slovenly looks are wildly out of
place on the rich leather sofa where he reclin
es.

Across a gleaming granite coffee table is BILL BAKER, businessman.  A
smooth meticulous dresser, Baker is disgusted by Nedry's sloppy
appearance and voracious consumption of food and drink.

Nedry finishes a coke.  Over his shoulder is an impressive skyline view.

                            NEDRY
          I'm not reneging.  I'm re-evaluating.

Nedry holds the can of coke upside-down, drains the last drops.

                            NEDRY
          You think I'm a scumbag, I know.

Nedry chuckles, lines up three peanuts on the table.  One after the
other, he throws them in the air.  He gulps down two, misses one. It
skids across the glossy floor.

Baker's head involuntarily cocks as he looks disgustedly at Nedry.

                            NEDRY
          Look pal, you make a career in biogenetic
          industrial espionage, and you're bound to
          run across a scumbag or two.  Guaranteed!
          Part of the job description.  Look, who's
          to say, who is the real scumbag?  After
          all, I know what you guys need so bad.
          I've heard of reverse engineering.

As Nedry continues he shovels nuts into his mouth and CHOMPS and SPEAKS.

                            NEDRY
          Let the other guy put in all the work,
          all the R and D.  You take the finished
          product, work backwards, breaking it down
          to reveal its genetic code.  Presto!  In
          a few measly months you have know-how
          that took researchers ten years to
          determine.  You know how much Hammond has
          invested of his own personal wealth?
          Over five billion dollars!  And if you
          guys get the jump on his - in no time,
          the market's wide-open.

Nedry starts the LAUGH as he EATS and TALKS.

                            NEDRY
          But, boy, he's really got his product!
          Oh yes siree, massive, gargantuan, money-
          making, never-heard-of-profit-like-that
          product.  It is a sight!  Yes, indeedy!

Nedry LAUGH
S explosively.  He begins to choke, COUGHING and GASPING.

Baker is repulsed.  He stares out the window as the sun sets.

Nedry, in true distress, clutches his own throat.  He clumsily runs
toward Baker, toppling chairs as he goes.  Nedry grabs Baker's hand and
squeezes it tightly, imploring Baker for help.  Baker coolly shakes his
hand loose and shoves Nedry to the floor.  Baker looks down at the prone
and desperate Nedry.

                            BAKER
          Scumbag.  We have a deal.  That deal is
          not open to renegotiation.  Or even re-
          evaluation.

Bakers kneels down next to Nedry, who is beginning to turn blue.

                            BAKER
          The deal stands.  Take it or leave it.

Baker glances at his watch.

                            BAKER
          I'll give you a few minutes to decide.

Nedry makes a superhuman effort just to nod his head.  Baker nods back
and SLAMS his fist into Nedry's solar plexus.  It works.

Nedry sucks in a huge gulp of air.  He sits up
, rubbing his belly.  As
Baker leaves the room:

                            BAKER
          Make sure the eggs are on that supply
          ship.  Just make sure!

CAMERA LEAVES NEDRY and exits the window.    IT SWISHPANS the concrete
canyons of Wall Street and enters another office.


INT  CONSERVATIVE LAW OFFICE - DAY

DONALD GENNARO, handsome,  meticulously dressed, paces the highly
polished, glassy corner suite.  His boss, ROSS, is seated.  He's a
powerful black man who waves a prosthetic arm.

                            ROSS
          We can't trust Hammond anymore.  He's
          under too much pressure.  There's the
          EPA, he's behind schedule, and the in-
          vestors are getting nervous.  There have
          been too many rumors, too many accidents.
          We can't screw around with this.

                            GENNARO
          I've asked Hammond to arrange independent
          site inspections every week for the next
          three weeks.

                            ROS
S
          What does he say?

                            GENNARO
          Insists nothing's wrong on the island.

                            ROSS
          You know him.  Do you believe him?

                             GENNARO
          No, I don't.  I spent a lot of time with
          him five years ago when we raised the
          capital.  And it was a wild ride.  He's
          unpredictable, a dreamer.

                            ROSS
          Potentially dangerous.  We should never
          have gotten involved.  What's our position?

                            GENNARO
          The firm owns five percent.

                            ROSS
          General or limited?

                            GENNARO
          General.

                            ROSS
          We should have never done that.

                            GENNARO
          It seemed wise at the time.  We all
          wanted the park to happen.  It was in
          lieu of fees.

                            ROSS
        
  In any case, I agree an inspection is
          overdue.  Who are your site experts?

Gennaro tosses a list on Ross' desk.  He check it out.

                            ROSS
          Will they tell the truth?

                            GENNARO
          I think so.  That guy Grant's a hotshot
          in his field, always goes his own way -

                            ROSS
          - Good.  You're making all the arrangements?

                            GENNARO
          Hammond asked to place the calls himself.
          I think he wants to pretend the park is
          not in trouble.  That it's just a social
          invitation, showing off the island.

                            ROSS
          All right ... Good.  But let's be very
          clear about one thing.  I don't know how
          bad this situation actually is, Donald.
          But if there's a problem on that island -
          don't be afraid to screw Hammond and burn
          Jurassic Park to the ground.

Gennaro shakes hands 
awkwardly with Ross and leaves.  Ross paces.  Fed-
up, he whispers to himself.

                            ROSS
          Costa Rica, my ass.

He whacks his desk globe, sends its spinning.

CAMERA MOVES IN on spinning globe as we HEAR the ROTOR BLADES of a
helicopter and DISSOLVE TO:


INT/EXT  HELICOPTER IN SKY - DAWN

On the helicopter tail is a little blue logo that reads: Isla Nublar.

INSIDE, Grant, Ellie and Gennaro are in the right back row.  Ellie
dozes, her head occasionally dropping onto Grant's shoulder, to his
discomfort.  Gennaro looks at papers, trying not to look through the
clear plexi-bubble at their feet.  Next to THE PILOT, Nedry chews a
candy bar.  He offers candy to the back row.

Grant loses himself, looking out the window.

GRANT'S POV - the aquamarine blue of the ocean.  Below the waters there
are the shadows of ample marine life.  Dolphins leap in the air.
Suddenly the clear scene becomes obscured by clouds.

There is turbulence.  Ellie wakes, glances at Grant, then out the
window.  
There is mist and she absently traces her finger in it, shaping
a dinosaur figure.  Now land comes into view and for a moment, the
island below them eerily fits right into her doodling.

                            PILOT
          That's Isla Nublar.  Buckle up, the
          descent is a little hairy.

Gennaro cinches his belt tightly and half-shuts his eyes.  Nedry takes
out a sandwich and cockily loosens his belt.  Ellie looks every way.

                            ELLIE
          This is exciting!

                            GRANT
          What is, Ellie?  Where are we going?

Grant looks out his window. The helicopter rushes forward, low to the
water.  Ahead, Grant sees the island, rugged and craggy, rising sharply

                            GRANT
          Looks like Alcatraz.

The pilot coughs and rubs his goggles with the back of his hand.

                            PILOT
          There's bad wind shear on this peak.

Grant nods.  Gennaro sweats, watching the pilot tighten his own belt.

Ellie
 smiles excitedly as the helicopter starts down.  Now, A BLANKET
FOG.  Grant can't see a thing out his window.  Ellie's startled.

                            ELLIE
          How the hell is he landing this thing?

No answer.  Grant dimly discerns green branches of pine trees through
the mist.  Some are very close.  Ellie's hands grasps her seat cushion.

                            ELLIE
          This is not fun.

Grant looks through the plexi-bubble at his feet.  He sees the giant
glowing fluorescent cross below.  Lights FLASH at corners of the cross.

                            GRANT
          Relax, Ellie.  I'm sure they wouldn't
          land if it weren't safe.

The copter suddenly SHAKES violently.  Ellie grabs Grant's hand.
Gennaro sits straight up, eyes squeezed shut.

                            GRANT
          Gennaro?  This guy knows what he's doing,
          Right?  Hey, Gennaro?  I'm talking to you!

Another violent shake.  Grant squeezes Ellie's hand back.

CLOSEUP - Nedry's hand crushes a 
packet of crackers.

Gennaro is soaked.  He opens one eye and looks about, very frightened.
He speaks a mantra.

                            GENNARO
          No problem.  Relax, relax.

The pilot whispers to himself and corrects slightly.  The copter sails
sharply the other way.

                            GRANT AND ELLIE
          Whoa!!!!

CLOSE ON - the pilot jerks back the stick.

THE COPTER zooms upward.  Grant's beverage flips to the ground, pours
across the floor.

Nedry's lunch does flying.  Sandwich, candy, and cracker crumbs hang
suspended in the air.  Now it all FREE-FALLS onto Nedry's lap.

Grant and Ellie lean tightly into each other,

                            ELLIE
          I don't like this feeling ...

The pilot swings his gaze, left then right, looking at the pine forest.
Trees are close, then far, then close.  The helicopter drops rapidly.
Ellie and Grant shut their eyes.  They brace themselves for the worst.

IN AND OUT OF THE MIST, the copter descends.  Tail raised high, nose
low, fo
r a moment it looks like a strange bug-eyes prehistoric animal
bucking in its pen.  In a flash, it corrects itself.  The copter touches
down on a heli-pad.  The SOUND of the rotors fades and dies.

For a second, no one moves.  Grant lets out a great sigh of relief.
Gennaro mouths a silent prayer.  The pilot stretches his fingers.

Grant and Ellie self-consciously shake their hands free of each other.
Nedry unbuckles and laughs as he brushes off his lap.  He turns:

                            NEDRY
          Just think, Gennaro -
              (laughs harder)
          - you gotta agree it's funny!  These two,
          they dig up dinosaurs!  It's wonderful,
          isn't it?

Nedry pats Grant on his shoulder.

                            NEDRY
          Dr. Bones, you're going to love this place.

Nedry bursts out laughing again as he heads out the helicopter door.

A smile comes across Gennaro's face.  As he smiles he motions with his
hands he doesn't mean any harm.  Grant and Ellie stare at him.

      
                      PILOT
          Come on folks.  Gotta get back, there's a
          storm alert.

ROTORS TURN.  OUTSIDE, a man reaches the copter.  He wears a baseball
cap over short red hair and he's dressed in phony safari garb.  He
shakes Gennaro's hand.  This is ED REGIS, 35, head of Public Relations.
He throws open the copter door next to Grant.  Big, cheerful smile.

                            REGIS
          Hi!  Ed Regis.  Real big welcome to Isla
          Nublar, Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler.  Little
          tough landing here, I know.  But you did
          it!  Come on down, we're so happy to have
          you.  Now, watch your step.

Ellie and Grant jump into the world of Jurassic Park.


EXT  LUSH TROPICAL FOREST - MORNING

Grant takes in the beautiful tropical terrain.  This place is the
opposite of the Badlands.  There is elaborate planting everywhere:
huge, hairy ferns; exotic, spiked flowers; berries of every color;
rushing vines.  Peeking through the thick greenery are beautiful birds
a
nd flying squirrels.  The strange, prehistoric world impresses Grant
and Ellie.  Even Nedry and Gennaro take in the vegetal wonder.

Then, the SOUND of men working, grunting from exertion.  Ahead, Muldoon
directs A GROUP OF WORKMEN.  Flame-throwers roar and machetes fight back
the abundant foliage.  As they attack a new area, Regis waves Muldoon
over.  Muldoon has a pronounced limp as he walks over to join them.

                            ED REGIS
          This is Robert Muldoon, great African big
          game hunter.  And he's working for us now.
          Doing a bang-up job, too.

Muldoon rests his rifle by a tree stump and shakes with Grant and Ellie.

                            MULDOON
          Ed's a little more BS than PR.  Mr.
          Gennaro, nice to have you back.

Gennaro nods warmly as Muldoon limps back to work.

Regis leads on, taking Gennaro's arm and talking to him like and old
friend.  Nedry lumbers in the middle, alone.  At the rear, Grant and
Ellie study everything they see.  Grant
 calls to Regis but is ignored.

                            GRANT
          Mr. Regis, what is the nature of this park?

Ellie looks behind and sees cramped ferns spring out to capture the path
they just walked on.  She nudges Grant, who has seen the same.

                            ELLIE
          Aggressive growth, huh?

                            GRANT
          Hammond's trademark.

A distinct HOOTING in the distance.  Then a loud TRUMPETING.  Grant and
Ellie stop.  Nedry doesn't look up.  Regis flashes his salesman's smile.

                            REGIS
          Out animals are greeting you!

They pass a crude sign nailed to a tree:  Welcome to Jurassic Park.
Grant cringes at the sign.  Ellie nudges him to loosen up.

                            GRANT
          I hope this isn't one of those animatronic
          exhibits in a Jurassic botanical setting.

                            NEDRY
          Nope.

Gennaro wipes his brow.  They enter a green tunnel of over-arching palm
that leads to the 
VISITOR'S CENTER, a modern complex in the distance.

Ellie notices a large fence hidden in the brush.  She nudges Grant.

THEIR POV - CAMERA SLOWLY CLIMBS a fifteen foot high chain-link fence.
The needle-spiked top of this fence cuts deep into the brush.

This fence is only the prelude.

Sprawling massively above and behind it is a thirty foot high fence.
Woven throughout the fence's mesh is an intricate system of electrical
wire.  There is a prominent warning:  DANGER!  ELECTRIC FENCE: TEN
THOUSAND VOLTS - KEEP OFF!

CAMERA KEEPS CLIMBING to the top:  ominous barbed wire, curled into the
highest growth with coiled razors glistening in the sun.

Grant strains to understand.  The quickens his steps to catch the others.

They reach a clearing with an unfinished brick sidewalk and potted shade
trees waiting for planting.  A crosshatching of tiny lizards scamper off
the walk.  An empty swimming pool is being filled by A MAN with a pumper
truck.  Next to him, WORKERS water the large ferns.

                       
     REGIS
          I hope you brought your bathing suits!
          Doesn't this mist and these plants really
          create a bonafide prehistoric feeling?

Regis points to a low building with glass pyramids on the roof.

                            REGIS
          There's the Visitor's Center.

A CRANE lowers an iron grating on top of one pyramid.  An animal TRUMPETS.


INT  VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY

CLOSE ON - the iron security grating as it fits over a glass skylight.
Above, MASKED WORKERS weld it on.  Sparks fly.

Grant stares up at it, thinking.  Footsteps echo behind him as Regis,
Ellie, Gennaro, and Nedry look around the unfinished building.

The Visitor's Center is two stories high, a lot of glass with exposed
girders and supports.  It's incomplete:  vines swing in the breeze where
the back wall will go and undressed cables litter the floor.  Even so,
exhibit areas are in varying stages of completion.  Behind, SEVERAL
SPANISH WORKERS unpack masonry supplies.

                            GRANT
     
     Where's Hammond?

                            REGIS
          Mr. Hammond is dying to see you guys.

Grant strides over to an exhibit as Gennaro paces impatiently.

                            GENNARO
          Hot, hot, hot.  Ten billion bucks and the
          air conditioning sucks.

Regis smiles apologetically and pushes open a large window on one of the
finished walls.  Giant leaves and vines burst inside.

Grant studies an exhibit in progress entitled When Dinosaurs Rules the
World.  This is a large clock that presents millions of years as hours
in a single day.  Many brightly colored hours are allocated to the
dinosaurs.  Man receives the last second of the day.  Ellie joins Grant.

                            ELLIE
          The audicity of man to get here at the
          last second and think he runs the show.

Grant smiles at her inexhaustible enthusiasm.  He looks at a painted
mural of a Raptor on one of the walls in the half-completed gift shop.

Nedry is at a coke machine, feeding in change
.  It doesn't work.  He
SLAMS his hand against it, and finally, a cup drops down the chute.
Upside-down.  It pours.  Coke splashes Nedry.  He curses and exits.

THE ROTUNDA - Ellie pulls Grant over to a raised, round display with a
catwalk.  In this unfinished display, a skeletal T-Rex and a Raptor are
locked in combat.  Scaffolding is up around it, and painting supplies
are scattered all around.

Regis glances at his watch, looks up, and smiles.

At that moment, doors adjacent to the rotunda swing open automatically.
A soothing female voice comes out of the public address system.

                            VOICE (ON P.A.)
          Please come to the theater.  In a moment,
          our film will begin.

The voice goes on to give this information in a number of languages.
Regis waves everyone into the theater.   Nedry doesn't join them.  He
climbs the stairs to the second floor.


INT  SCREENING ROOM - DAY

Small and plush.  Regis sits in the front, full of enthusiasm.  Grant and
Ellie sit further behind. 
 Gennaro stands in the back and smokes.

CELESTIAL MUSIC fills the room.  Mist covers and curls on the stage
floor.  Colored spotlights illuminate the mist in an eerie fashion.
overall effect is the touristy Where's NY? high-gloss production.

years young, with a glint in his eye and very comfortable with his own
effect.  He wears a white linen suit with a red rose in the breast
pocket.  Like an elder Carl Sagan, he addresses the group.

                            HAMMOND
          Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.  Welcome
          to an ancient and mysterious world, a
          world long before humankind inhabited it
          with all out remarkable dreams and
          questions.  Enter a world that existed
          one hundred million years ago.  When our
          changing earth was the abode of
          magnificent creations.

          Today, the late twentieth century has
          witnessed a scientific gold rush of
          astonishing proportions:  the headlong
          and furious haste to un
ravel the mystery
          of genetic engineering has become more
          than just a subject for science fiction
          writers.

ON GRANT - he whispers to Ellie.

                            GRANT
          - the furious haste to commercialize
          genetic engineering.

BACK ON HAMMOND - he warms to his subject.

                            HAMMOND
          Biotechnology promises the greatest
          revolution in human history.  It will
          outdistance atomic power and computers in
          its effects on our everyday lives.  We'll
          see square trees for easy lumbering and
          white trout for super visibility to
          fisherman.  Why it will transform every
          aspect of human life: out medical care,
          our food, our health, even our very
          entertainment.

ON GRANT - confirmed in his thinking, he whispers again.

                            GRANT
          Here we go.

BACK ON HAMMOND - he concludes.

                            HAMMOND
          
Nothing will ever be the same again.
          It's literally going to change the face
          of our planet as we know it.


MUSIC SOARS.  Hammond smiles appreciatively, removes his rose.  A screen
descends behind him.

                            HAMMOND
          ... Jurassic Park.  What we do here is
          made possible through the miracle of DNA
          replication, commonly known as cloning.
          To explain what cloning means, I'm going
          to need my own clone - John Hammond.

Another Hammond appears, projected on the screen beside the real one.

                            2ND HAMMOND
          Hi, John!

                            HAMMOND
          Hi, John.

IN THE AUDIENCE - Ellie laughs aloud.  Grant, shaking his head, smiles.

BACK ON HAMMOND - The original speaks to the clone.

                            HAMMOND
          Okay John, hold out your finger.

                            2ND HAMMOND
          Why?

                            HAMMOND
          I need some of your
 genetic material.

                            2ND HAMMOND
          Now just a minute here, John.

                            HAMMOND
          Your genetic material is the same in
          every cell of your body.  You have a
          hundred billion cells.  You won't miss a
          couple.

Hammond holds his rose to the screen the pricks his clone's finger with
a thorn.

                            2ND HAMMOND
          OW!!!  That hurt!  Hey, what's -

The clone dissolves into a cascade of blood as WE SEE a magnified view
of the bloodstream.  ANIMATION begins which illuminates the parts of the
blood and its actions.  Hammond provides voiceover for the visuals.

                            HAMMOND
          John, let's look into your blood, the
          river of life.  There's your white cells,
          exquisitely evolved to clean up bodily
          wastes.  And there's a mighty nucleus,
          the heart and brain of a cell.  This
          nucleus has an amazing property.  It can
          sp
lit in half and reproduce itself.
          That's how it grows.  And then those two
          can do it again.  And again.  Making copy
          after copy of itself.

Back to the two Hammond's.  Joined by a third, then a fourth, and so on
until the screen is crammed with Hammond's, elbowing each other for room.

                            NEW HAMMOND'S
          Hi, I'm John Hammond.  Hey, I'm John
          Hammond.  No, I am.  I am.

                            HAMMOND
          Come on, that's enough of this!  And I
          thought to reproduce myself I had to do it
          the old-fashioned way.

New mist fades out this show.  The lights go up.  Regis applauds.  Grant
joins in the laughter with Ellie and Gennaro.

Hammond jumps down from the stage and greets Gennaro and Regis.

                            HAMMOND
          That's all we've got so far.  A lot of
          fun, isn't it, Mr. Gennaro?

                            REGIS
          You bet!

Hammond greets Grant and Ellie warmly.  Then 
Hammond baits Grant.

                            HAMMOND
          It's been a long time, Alan.  I know the
          preceding was not your sort of enter-
          tainment.  Popular science -

                            GRANT
          No, I don't mind popular science.  I dislike
          the commercialization of science.  It breeds
          a sloppiness, a disregard for method.

                            HAMMOND
          Well, I don't disregard method.  But think
          of mutation - which is nothing more than
          sloppy communication on the cellular
          level.  Think how triumphant mutations
          have been in natural selection.

          Oh, but I know what you're saying.  It's
          true that I have never been afraid to make
          money with science.  I've always
          considered profit to be a measure of
          success, a barometer of public reaction.

                            GRANT
          Mr. Hammond, the essential truth of a
          scientific law ha
s nothing to do with
          public reaction.  Water freezes at
          thirty-two degrees, whether you pay for
          it or not.

Hammond turns to Gennaro.  Gennaro smiles nervously at their clash.

                            HAMMOND
          Donald, in bringing my old friend, Alan
          Grant, you've brought an excellent critic
          to observe the viability of my island and
          out venture.  I look forward to winning
          you over, Dr. Grant.

                            ELLIE
          Just what is it you're trying to clone?


EXT  A SPRAWLING LAWN - DAY

Outside, Hammond leads Gennaro, Grant and Ellie.  He points out the
staff living quarters, a group of graceful teepees.  Next to their
homes, WORKERS hang laundry and cook on grills.

They pass a large Mechanical Building.  The generator housed within is
very LOUD.  The wind increases, rippling clothes.

Suddenly, the SOUND of a speeding jeep.  Grant turns.

Racing across the rolling green landscape is A RED JEEP.  Muldoon is 
at
the steering wheel.  Two kids bounce happily around in the open jeep.
They are TIMMY, 9, and LEX, 6, brother and sister.  The jeep stops.

                            LEX
          Grandpa!

Hammond looks up, delighted.  Arms open.  Gennaro pulls him close.

                            GENNARO
              (incredulous)
          Mr. Hammond, this is a serious investiga-
          tion of the island, not a weekend
          excursion or a social outing.  We're
          talking about the safety of this place!

Hammond waves to the children.

                            HAMMOND
          I'm aware of that.  But I built this
          place for children.  You can't
          investigate it without their reactions.
          They're what this place is all about.

Hammond beams to Grant and Ellie and indicates the running kids.

                            HAMMOND
          My grandchildren.  Genetics were kind.
          They're more like my ex-wife than me.

Lex jumps right into her Grandpa's arms.  Timmy s
hyly walks up and
embraces him.  Hammond shines.  Gennaro holds in his fury.


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DAY

Hammond ushers his guests into his own richly appointed baronial suite.
Ellie looks out a small window at the tee-pees and the contrasting
lifestyle below.  She then focuses on the high fence, circling the
perimeter of Hammond's quarters.  Above is a skylight, with metal bars.

Grant whispers to her, indicating the obviously modified window frame.

                            GRANT
          Who makes a windows ... smaller?

Timmy smacks him forehead, points to Grant.

                            TIMMY
          I know you.  You wrote my book.  Lost
          World of The Dinosaurs.  It's awesome.

                            LEX
          Timmy's got dinosaurs on the brain.

                            GRANT
          Don't worry - he'll grow out of it.

                            ELLIE
          Dr. Grant's embarrassed that his book was
          so widely successful.  He wrote if for
          gra
duate students.

Hammond smiles intensely.  But he's patient.  He stands be a huge table
covered with a sumptuous velvet drape.

                            HAMMOND
          Although Dr. Grant suspects otherwise,
          this is not an ill-conceived, half-baked,
          poorly funded plan that I've headed.
          This is a plan to which I committed all
          of my personal resources, literally
          billions of dollars.  And Donald Gennaro
          here has kindly helped me raise that sum
          again from wealthy Japanese.  They love
          theme parks.  I have recruited pre-
          eminent scientific minds from hallowed
          universities and we've taken the time to
          do things right.

Lex peeks under the cloth.  Hammond smiles at her and recovers the table.

                            HAMMOND
          Jurassic Park is the most advanced
          amusement park in the world.  We work
          with genetics - life's essential building
          blocks - to create new 
worlds.  I set out
          to make biological attractions.  Living
          attractions.  Attractions so astonishing
          that they'd capture the imagination of
          the entire world.

                            GRANT
          What exactly do you mean ... biological
          attractions?

                            HAMMOND
          As you well know, long ago, creatures ten
          times larger than whales roamed our
          adolescent Earth.  And then mass,
          mysterious extinction created a time
          barrier unscalable until ... now.

BEAT.

                            GRANT
          Yes?

                            HAMMOND
          Dinosaurs.
              (superbly proud)
          I've been cloning dinosaurs!

CAMERA PUSHES IN on Grant's incredulous face.

Hammond whips off the drape, revealing a complex and detailed scale
model of the entire resort.

                            HAMMOND
          Ladies and Gentlemen, Jurassic Park.  Not
          a resort, not a scien
tific conservatory,
          just a little piece of pre-history that
          every child in the whole wide world will
          insist on visiting.

Hammond grins with delight.

                            GENNARO
          At least every rich child.

Grant and Ellie come forward to examine the model.  The kids crowd in.

CAMERA SNORKELS through the model - revealing different enclosures with
miniature dinosaurs, moats, fences, roads, a river.

                            HAMMOND
          Apatosaurs in the lowland.  Gallimimus in
          the grassy plain.  Dilophosaurus above
          the river.  The mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex!
          238 fabulous creatures so far!

                            TIMMY
          Real dinosaurs, Grandpa?  Don't they want
          to just kill each other?

Hammond excitedly punches a button - colored display grids light up.

                            HAMMOND
          Timmy, there's electric fences and moats
          and video surveillance at all times.
          There
 are monitors every hundred feet
          whatever we could plant them on the
          island.  A computer to tabulate it all.

                            ELLIE
          You created dinosaurs?  Who gave you the
          right to do that?

                            HAMMOND
          I didn't create them.  I found a way to
          wake them up, to stir them out of their
          prehistoric slumber.

                            GRANT
          We don't have the science.  There's no
          source of dinosaur DNA.

Hammond's proud, excited face shifts to one that divulges modestly.

                            HAMMOND
          Yes ... there is.


INT  HALLWAY, UPPER FLOOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY

Hammond leads Grant, Ellie, Gennaro, Timmy, and Lex out of an elevator
and down an endless corridor.  A WORKMAN ON CRUTCHES passes them.

They go through a series of security doors.  To get them open, Hammond
places his palm on a screen before each door.  Each time, it lights up
with an x-ray-like image of 
his hand and each door HISSES open.

CLOSEUP - Security x-ray. of Hammond's hand.  BEEP.  A red line writes
through the screen.  Can't get in.  Complaining, under his breath:

                            HAMMOND
          Glitches.

Hammond tries again.


INT  CONTROL ROOM - DAY

The door HISSES open, revealing an elaborate technology-crammed room.
In dim light, clusters of computer consoles and video monitors glow.

Nedry sits in a corner at a keyboard with a pile of papers next to him,
typing away.  JOHN ARNOLD, 45, park supervisor, sits directing the
activities of the park and chain-smoking.  There are large windows
looking out to the park, one of which is cracked and being replaced from
the outside by a TEAM OF WORKMEN.

Hammond wears a big smile as he leads in his entourage.  He's the
ringmaster.

                            HAMMOND
          And this is the right side of my brain.
          The entire park is safely controlled from
          here.  John Arnold, that genius over
          there, is the m
aster control operator.
              (with genuine concern)
          John, don't smoke so much, you're far too
          valuable a man to me.

                            ARNOLD
          Oh, you'd survive just fine without me.

Arnold exhales smoke and waves good-naturedly.  Nedry stares darkly at
Hammond, who ignores him.

                            HAMMOND
          Everything's controlled from here.
          Remote everything. Cars, feeding
          programs, medicine dispensers, fecal
          clean up - and that can be tons in a park
          like this.  We run this place with twenty
          workers.  This computer does it all.  And
          it polices each and every single animal
          out there.

                            ELLIE
              (whispers to Grant)
          Who polices the computer?

Hammond points up.  Overlooking the control room and the park is a
raised platform with a huge chair, like a throne in a court.  A large
video screen faces this chair.

                     
       HAMMOND
          That's where I will watch the astonished
          watchers.  Okay, let's go.

They practically race as a group to keep up with Hammond.  The security
door seals shit, leaving Nedry and Arnold alone again.

                            NEDRY
          Thanks for the kind word, Mr. Hammond.

                            ARNOLD
          Come on, Dennis, he knows your technical
          contributions have made it all possible.

                            NEDRY
          Right.


BACK ON HALLWAY -

Hammond and his group turn off the corridor and reach a door marked:
CAUTION: Teratogenic Substances.  Timmy backs off, grabs Lex's arm.

                            TIMMY
          That stuff turns you into a mutant!

He contorts his face into strange shapes.  As Hammond leads them all in
Lex pulls on his pocket.

                            HAMMOND
          Don't mind the signs.  They're only legal
          precautions.

Gennaro frowns.  The door opens and Lex peeks in.

                  
          HAMMOND
          My laboratory, Lex.  It will be yours and
          Timmy's someday.


INT  AMBER ROOM, LABORATORY - CONTINUING ACTION

Grant and Ellie share a baffled look.  Grant stares.

Grant's POV - PAN ACROSS a room filled with honey-colored glowing stones
arranged on glass shelves in large pull-out trays.  Each stone is tagged
and numbered.

Grant leans down, studying the stones.  He bumps right into Gennaro.
Lex jumps excitedly.

                            LEX
          It's ... gold!

                            TIMMY
          It's amber.  Fossilized tree sap.

                            LEX
          Grandpa found gold.

Grant shushes the kids and looks to Hammond.

                            HAMMOND
          You're both right.  Amber is our gold.
          The alpha or our alchemic alphabet.  The
          precious course of our genetic material.
          You already know amber is the fossilized
          resin of prehistoric tree sap, of course.

Grant and Ellie nod impatiently. 
 Hammond sets the scene.

                            HAMMOND
          Imagine - millions of years ago, tree sap
          flowing over insects, as it does now as I
          speak, in thousands of forests and backyard
          trees everywhere.  Imagine that ancient sap
          trapping a little struggling insect and
          consuming it in a syrupy death.  Millions
          and millions of years pass and we come
          along and discover this prehistoric insect.
          If we're lucky, he's perfectly preserved in
          a fossil form inside the hardened sap which
          is now amber.  And as we examine more and
          more amber, we find many perished insects,
          including among them, biting insects -

                            GRANT
          Like mosquitos -

                            HAMMOND
          Like mosquitos, precisely, Dr. Grant.

                            GRANT
          Mosquitos that sucked the blood of
          dinosaurs.  That's your source of DNA
        
  material?  My God!  It just might work.


INT  EXTRACTION ROOM, LABORATORY

A TECHNICIAN carefully positions a piece of amber under a fine-pointed
drill.  With a nod, the technician's goggles drop from his forehead onto
his eyes and he starts up the drill.  Hammond yells over the loud WHIRR.

                            HAMMOND
          The extraction room speaks for itself.

CLOSE ON - drillbit boring into the amber.  Orange fleck fly.

                            GRANT
          It does?

The technician shuts the drill.  Placing his hands into a mounted pair
of gloves, he operates an automated pair of needle-nose pliers to
carefully lift out the remains of a mosquito.  He drops this bug on a
slide and places this slide on a tray full of such slides.

                            LEX
          That's a million year old mosquito?

A conveyor belt starts, carrying this tray on to the NEXT TECHNICIAN.
The group follows.  This technician puts the first slide under a
microscope.  Grant watches on a video monito
r as the tech inserts a long
needle into the prehistoric bug.

                            ELLIE
          Put in a piece of amber, find a mosquito,
          drill it out.  Right?

                            HAMMOND
          Right.  You are witnessing the extraction
          of tissue from the thorax of this humble
          insect.  If this mosquito has ingested any
          foreign red blood cells - say it bit a
          hadrosaur or a stegosaurus or a T-Rex -  we
          will extract those blood cells and obtain
          paleo-DNA, the how-to-build instruction
          book of an extinct creature.
          So you see, Ellie, I'm not creating dino-
          saurs. Fossils left behind the information,
          the map of how to bring them back.  I'm
          helping them escape from the confined of
          time.

                            GRANT
          But even thousands of mosquitos wouldn't
          give you enough tissue to determine a
          complete DNA strand.

                 
           HAMMOND
          Right you are, Dr. Grant!  More like
          hundreds of thousands of mosquitos are
          necessary to provide even a partial
          strand of DNA.  And without a complete
          strand, we don't have a dinosaur.


INT  GENETICS ROOM

A LOUD HUMMING SOUND.  Along the walls are rows of waist-high stainless
steel boxes.  In the room's center are two six-foot-high round towers.
At a single console, a man studies a monitor.

DR. WU, 35, looks up from his study and beams at his guests.  He jumps
up and knocks over his cup of coffee.  ASSISTANTS clean the area as Wu
comes forward and actually hugs Grant, much to Grant's embarrassment.

                            HAMMOND
          Ah, I knew you two would hit it off!  Dr.
          Grant, this is Dr. Wu, my chief geneticist.

                            WU
          Finally, you are here!  I've been working
          without the encouragement of my peers for
          too long.  Welcome, welcome!

He kisses Ellie, who takes 
it in stride.  Gennaro, We already knows.

                            WU
          Mr. Hammond never lets me publish and
          he's interested only in results, not in
          science.

                            HAMMOND
          Don't forget to thank me when you pick up
          your Nobel prize.

Hammond and Wu resume the tour.

                            HAMMOND
          You are standing in the middle of the
          most powerful genetics factory created
          since the expulsion from Eden.

                            WU
          These are Hamachi-Hood automated gene
          sequencers, those are Cray XMP's,
          supercomputers that take DNA information
          and organize it.  In this room, we take
          fragmented or incomplete DNA strands and
          compare them to other incomplete strands.

                            HAMMOND
          It's like finding the missing pieces of a
          jigsaw puzzle.

                            WU
          The computers make sever
al trillion
          calculations to provide us with a
          complete DNA strand - the genetic code of
          an extinct animal.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY

A vast room bathed in infrared light, filled with long tables.  The
first tables have rows and rows of centrifuges, each bearing dozens of
test tubes.  Wu leads the group.

                            GRANT
          Okay, you have your "complete" DNA
          strand.  How do you grow it?

                            WU
          We use unfertilized crocodile ova as our
          breeding medium.

                            HAMMOND
          Our primordial soup.

                            GRANT
          And how do you know what it is you're
          growing?

Wu shrugs.

                            WU
          Well, we have computer techniques to try
          and map out finds on an evolutionary
          basis.  But mostly, we just grow it and
          find out what it is.  If it's something
          we're interested in, and it 
survives, we
          keep it.

Grant and Ellie share a concerned look.

                            GENNARO
          And if you're not interested?

Wu indicates a cabinet of chemicals with skull-and-crossbone warnings.
Timmy regards the poison with excitement.

Lex calls from deeper in the room.

                            LEX
          Come look!

Here, plastic eggs lay on the long tables, their pale outlines obscured
by a grey mist that covers the tables.  The eggs are all gently rocking
as TECHNICIANS roam up and down the aisles.

Hammond walks ahead of the group.  As Wu speaks, Hammond listens and
enjoys it as though he's hearing it for the first time.

                            WU
          This is the incubation room.  We keep the
          temperature at ninetynine degrees and a
          relative humidity of one hundred percent.

                            GRANT AND TIMMY
          Jurassic atmosphere.

Timmy smiles at Grant.  Hammond winks at Timmy.

                            WU
          We
 also run a high oxygen concentration,
          up to thirty-three percent, so if you
          feel faint, please tell me right away.

Lex feigns a faint, Timmy cracks a small smile. They move forward,
waist-deep in the mist.  A strange green light emanates from the
incubators.  Lex is half-consumed by the mist. She mimics the witch.

                            LEX
          I'm ... melting!

Ellie laughs and pulls Lex close.

                            WU
          Reptile eggs contain large amounts of
          yolk but no water at all.  The embryos
          must extract water from the surrounding
          environment.

                            GRANT
          That's why you create the mist.

Wu nods.  Hammond just enjoys the scene as Grant and Ellie watch a
thermal sensor moving from one egg to the next, touching each with a
flexible wand, beeping.  Lex and Timmy let their hands glide over the
sides of the green glowing incubators fully awed by the strange, big
eggs they hold.

                   
         WU
          Children, please do not touch!  The eggs
          are permeable to skin oils.

Grant that very close to an egg.  He sniffs it.

                            GRANT
          What kind of eggs are these?  Are these
          shells plastic?

                            WU
          Yes, they are,  The embryos are
          mechanically inserted and then hatched in
          this room.  But we've managed to
          sufficiently mimic the actual biological
          process - these creatures rupture the
          plastic membrane that they're contained
          in when they're born.  Like real births.

They reach an endless row of incubators, lined up along the wall,
beneath a viewing area like those found in an OB-GYN ward.

                            WU
          Eggs that are determined viable spend
          their last couple days in our specially-
          designed incubators, which help
          accelerate the pre-natal developmental
          stages.  Which is interesting becaus
e
          we're having a problem with the adult
          animals -

Hammond claps a hand over Wu's mouth and laughs.

                            HAMMOND
          There's no problem Dr. Wu can't handle.
          Now who wants to see the real thing?

As they exit the CAMERA PANS the misty aisles, studying the eggs.


EXT  VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY

Blue shadows of clouds sweep across an expansive green hill in front of
the Visitor's Center.

Grant and Hammond make their way down below to the loading area for the
park tour.  A little ahead is Gennaro and Ellie.  Gennaro chatters on
while Ellie energetically explores the area, looking at the plants.

                            GENNARO
          ... so naturally, Hammond's going to
          present everything in the best light.  I
          need to know that this park is safe.

                            ELLIE
          I'll tell you something that troubles me
          from the start.  The carnivores are all
          well-fed and kept separated from their

          natural prey.  That'll keep 'em alive,
          but it won't keep 'em happy.

                            GENNARO
          How do you mean?

                            ELLIE
          The carnivores will want to hunt.  It's
          an instinct.  And that instinct will have
          to be satisfied or suppressed.

FURTHER UP THE HILL, moving slowly, Hammond eyes the pair suspiciously.

                            HAMMOND
          Gennaro is putting negative ideas into
          Ellie's head.  He's a naysayer.  I have
          no affection for that type of thinking.

                            GRANT
          Don't worry.  Ellie makes her own
          judgments.

At the base of the hill Timmy and Lex toss a baseball.


EXT  TOUR START - DAY

The group gathers.  TWO ELECTRIC CARS glide to a stop behind them.
Regis leans out of the first one.

                            REGIS
          Hey!  Great day for a tour!

                            GENNARO
          Looks like rain to me.

         
                   REGIS
          No!  I told the rain-god to hold it off
          till we got back.

The kids pile in next to Regis and explore the high-tech cars.  Timmy
finds a a pair of very think, strange-looking goggles with dials on top.

Grant, Ellie, and Gennaro climb in the second car.

                            HAMMOND
          Kids, mind Mr. Regis.  He's in charge now.

The cars begin to move and pass Hammond.  He waves.

Gennaro looks back as the cars turn into the brush.  Hammond waves.

                            HAMMOND
          Gennaro, for once in your life, let
          something really move you.

In the cruiser, Gennaro rubs his neck.  He turns to Grant.

                            GENNARO
          Ever get the feeling we're just Hammond's
          damn guinea pigs?

                            GRANT
          I like to wait and see.

Ellie motions ahead, with excitement and apprehension, to a huge gate.
Regis and the kids wave behind to Grant, Ellie and Gennaro.

The gate's doo
rs swing open and the cruisers move forward.  The kids
squeal out a YA-HOO that floats through the air to Grant.  But Grant
wears a cautious face, his skeptical eyes scan the landscape.

A FANFARE of trumpets and then a pre-recorded voice speaks from a
console in each cruiser.  Video screens display a welcome message.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          Welcome to Jurassic Park.  You are now
          entering the lost world of the
          prehistoric past, a world of mighty
          creatures long gone from the face of the
          earth, which you are privileged to see
          for the first time ...

Regis uses his walkie-talkie to contact Grant's cruiser.

                            REGIS (ON WALKIE)
          That's Richard Kiley.  We spared no
          expense.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          We'll begin our tour today with the
          herbivores ...


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, FIRST TOUR STOP - DAY

Between massive tree trunks, a spectacular view:  stor
m clouds touch
mountaintops.  Below, the lagoon ripples in pink crescents.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          ... and the grasses are a species of
          juniper, and samples can be purchased at
          the gift shop.  Now, if everyone will
          take a look to the right ...

All eyes swing that way.  Grant doesn't see a thing.  Nor do the others.

AHEAD, Timmy pulls the binoculars out of the equipment pouch and studies
the location.  Lex grabs the night goggles.  Timmy pulls them from her.

                            REGIS
          Look ...

                            LEX AND TIMMY
          I don't see anything.  Do you see
          anything?  There's nothing there.

                            REGIS
          Something's out there ...

IN THE SECOND CAR, a fly buzzes on Grant's windshield.  Grant hangs out
his window almost sniffing the air for some movement.  Nothing.

SUDDENLY the trees in front of them move!  A deep trumpeting SOUND and
TWO BRACHIOSAURS rumble away fr
om the side of the road.  The ground
SHAKES as they walk, their BELLOWING fills the air.  Led by Grant, the
passengers rise through the open top of their Land Cruisers, to look up
at the dinosaurs far above.

DROOPING FROM ABOVE, leaves and little branches shower on Grant.  Utter
amazement fills Grant's face, then his mouth breaks into a giant smile
then a laugh.  He simply can't believe his eyes. His laugh becomes
raucous and euphoric.

                            GRANT
          Ellie!  Can you imagine the excavation
          team seeing this!

Behind him, Ellie's whole person is awestruck, immobile.  Gennaro
squints, straining to make sense of this unbelievable reality.

IN THE CAR AHEAD, Lex and Timmy stare open-mouthed.  Regis looks at the
animal and then at the group's reverie.  He smiles knowingly: he's been
there, too.  He bends and whispers:

                            REGIS
          Congratulations. You're the first kids in
          the whole wide world ever to see real
          dinosaurs.

The
 kids look up at Regis with wonder in their eyes.

GRANT CAN'T stop laughing.  Still chewing, a brachiosaur cranes down to
peer at this laughing man.  The brachiosaur's huge head stops inches
away from Grant.  Grant, awestruck, stares and them -

CLOSE ON - Grant as his eyes slowly roll back and ... he faints.

The dinosaur casually moves away as Ellie comes to Grant's aid.

                            ELLIE
          Alan?  Alan?
              (sort of delighted)
          He fainted!

Gennaro waves to Regis that all is okay.  Grant slowly revives.  He
looks back at the brachiosaur, groggily, smiling away.  He looks at
Ellie and their eyes linger on each other longer than usual, sharing a
look of serene delight.

Gennaro plops back in his seat and ponders the scene before him.  A
glazed look fills his face.

                            GENNARO
          My God, we're going to make a fortune
          here!

CAMERA PUSHES IN on the majestic, gentle beauty of the Brachiosaurs.
JUNGLE SOUNDS DOMINATE, growing l
ouder and louder.


INT CONTROL ROOM - DAY

Hammond sits at his throne, happily watching the huge video screen which
displays the tour group.  He laughs raucously and calls to Arnold.

                            HAMMOND
          He fainted.  I've waited fifteen years to
          impress that young man.

                            ARNOLD
          Oh Mr. Hammond, I'm sorry to interrupt
          you, but Muldoon needs you by the pit.

                            HAMMOND
          Oh, balls.


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, SECOND TOUR STOP - DAY

The cruisers come to a stop.  In the distance, A HERD OF GALLIMIMUS
graze.  They stand on their hind legs to get at high palm trees, then
drop gracefully down on all fours to chew.  BABY GALLIMIMUS scamper
around the adults, eating leaves that drop from the larger animals.

                             PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          ... Gallimimus, known as the ostrich
          dinosaur for the shape of its shoulders,
          have a very strong nesting instinct ...

Grant do
esn't listen.  He is simply intoxicated with the pastoral beauty
of the gentle, grazing dinosaurs.  Suddenly, he looks away with a deep
concern.  Ellie looks at him questioningly.

                            GRANT
          Ellie?  What the hell are we going to do
          with the rest of our lives?

Ellie smiles at him, puzzled.

                            ELLIE
          What to you mean?

                            GRANT
          Can't you see it, Ellie?  We're the ones
          that are extinct now.


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, THIRD TOUR STOP - DAY

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          ... lots more to see in the herbivore
          section of our park.  But as we come
          alongside out Jurassic jungle river to the
          left, let's try and catch a glimpse of a
          very unusual and dangerous carnivore.
          Look across the river and above ...

A lovely mossy clearing.  And to the side, bounded just by a thicket of
bushes, a precipitous drop to a tropical river, lus
h and clear.  The
river runs fast but it is narrow.  On the other side is a sharp rise.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          And there they are!

Standing on that natural pedestal and watching our tour come to a stop
are TWO DILOPHOSAURUS, man-sized dinosaurs with gills that hang around
their necks.  Grant and Ellie chime in with the pre-recorded voice.

                            ALL THREE
          Dilophosaurus!

Timmy and Lex point enthusiastically.  Regis holds them down with a
gentle but restraining arm.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          Dilophosaurus is one of the earliest
          carnivores.  Scientists once thought
          their jaw muscles were too weak to kill,
          but now, through the miracle of their
          cloning, we know Dilophosaurs spit venom,
          a poison which causes blindness and then
          unconsciousness.

Their distinctive HOOT drifts across the afternoon air.

                            GENNARO
          Poisonous d
inosaurs, there's a liability
          issue without a lot of precedent.

CLOSEUP of the nearly motionless Dilophosaurus.  One yawns wide.

                            GRANT
              (assessing)
          It's like a Gila monster of a cobra.  It's
          a poison ...

                            ELLIE
          Spitter!

The Spitters bound off as Grant watches, transfixed.  A flock of birds
burst from a tree and cross the sky.  Trees filter the light.

                            ELLIE
          Are we dreaming all this?


EXT  RAPTOR PIT - DAY

A big hole in the ground, covered with a think wire mesh.  Suddenly, a
dark claw pushes against the wire web. A SHOWER OF SPARKS.  A SCREECH
animals GROWL and SNARL.  An animal slams its face into the mesh.  SPARKS
illuminate a set of RAZOR-SHARP TEETH.

Muldoon stands next to the pit, carefully loading an assault rifle.
Hammond comes in a hurry.  Muldoon sees Hammond and puts down the rifle.
He walks to Hammond, talking before he gets there.

               
             MULDOON
          These raptors are too damn dangerous. One
          of them tunneled out this morning.  He
          ripped a boy's arm off before I could get
          a bullet in him.

                            HAMMOND
          A bullet?  Muldoon - no!  Now what?  I
          have five left?

                            MULDOON
          John, they're mean as scorpions and smart
          as chimps.  Their little fingers make
          them natural cage-breakers.  We should
          terminate the raptor program.  They're
          just too smart.  Too damn smart.

                            HAMMOND
          Oh balls.  I will not terminate the raptors
          just because they're behaving normally.
          They're hunters.  Why can't we contain them
          properly?

Hammond starts to walk away.  Muldoon follows, he's not finished at all.

                            MULDOON
          John, remember back in '88, when we
          started to build the containment devices?
         
 We ordered cattle prods, tasers, guns
          that blow out electric nets.  They're all
          too slow for these guys. If we're going
          to keep the raptors, I want TOW missiles
          and laser-guided devices.

Hammond laughs warmly.  He pats Muldoon on the back.

                            HAMMOND
          It's just a zoo, Muldoon.  A zoo.  Figure
          out a way to contain them.  And we'll sit
          down and have a nice long discussion about
          raptors - after my guests leave, okay?

Hammond walks away.  Muldoon stares after him, jingling keys in his
hand.  Muldoon lumps over to A WORKER.

                            MULDOON
          Okay!  Get a 'dozer, start digging round
          the pit.  We're gonna bury some fence.
          And wear your rifle when you're working!


INT  CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON

Hammond enters and crosses to his throne.  Hammond swivels to Arnold who
exhales smoke.  Nedry looks over, keeps typing.

                            HAMMOND
          Wh
ere are they?  Punch 'em up.

                            ARNOLD
          They'll be by the trike's in a moment.
          Trike's sick again.

                            HAMMOND
          How can you say it so matter-of-factly?
          The trike's.  You casually accept it, but
          I never can.  You know what it means when
          you say "by the trikes"?  "By the
          trike's" means that they're out there by
          the species:  triceratops horridus.  It
          astounds me every time what I've done
          here.  What magic, what alchemy.  We
          turned a piece of a rock into a dinosaur.
          I will never be complacent about that.

Arnold smiles and punches a button.  WE HEAR the pre-recorded tour voice
and some chatter of the kids.

EAVESDROPPING on the tour IS INTERRUPTED by a radio transmission to the
control room.  Arnold slides over and shuts off the tour monitoring.
The picture on the video screen is now of a cargo boat at a dock.

                            RADIO
 
         Hello, John.  This is the Anne B at the
          dock.  I'm looking at the storm patterns
          just south of us.  Requesting permission
          to leave before unloading the last three
          food containers.

Nedry looks up quickly, listening carefully.

                            RADIO
          Don't want to be stuck here if this chop
          gets much worse.

Hammond reacts with quiet dismay.  Nedry quietly gets up.

                            NEDRY
          Coffee anyone?

He's ignored.  Arnold defers to Hammond who leans to the microphone.

                            HAMMOND
          Hello skipper, John Hammond, how are you
          tonight?  I certainly don't want to
          imperil anyone.  But can you give us one
          more container of food?  Then we'll feel
          comfortable is the storm delays your
          return.  Could you help us out here?  Of
          course, if it looks too choppy just go,
          but you'd be doing us a big favor.

                 
           RADIO
          Well ... we'll do our best, sir.  We'll
          get one more container off. How's that?

Hammond thanks him and signs off.  Arnold looks at the darkening clouds.


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, FOURTH TOUR STOP - LATE AFTERNOON

The cars twist through dense vegetation with a GRINDING of gears.  The
first car comes to a jerky stop.

There is a huge TRICERATOPS lying on its side, moving very slowly,
breathing laboriously.  HARDING, the tall, balding park vet, kneels on
the ground.  He peers into the animal's mouth with a large flashlight.

Before the second car can stop completely, Grant leaps out, races to the
trike.  Regis tries to restrain the kids but they chase Grant and Ellie.

Grant joins Harding on the ground.  The trike lets out a low MOAN.
She's too sick to move.  Ellie and Lex squat by the animal.

                            LEX
          I feel so sorry for her.  She's so sick.

                            VET
          We don't know what's wrong with Freda.
          Every six we
eks she gets like this.

                            REGIS
          Oh, she'll be up and around in no time.
          After a big night, I feel the same way.

Grant very gently opens the Trike's mouth.

                            GRANT
          Poor girl.  What's the matter?  Ellie,
          look at this.

A dark purple tongue droops limply from her mouth.  Ellie shines the
light on it, illuminating silvery blisters.  Gennaro turns away.

                            ELLIE
          Microvesicles.  Interesting.

Grant scratches one of the blisters with his ball-point pen.  It oozes.
The kids share a grossed-out look.

                            LEX
          Doesn't she have a mommy and a daddy?

                            HARDING
          We make these dinosaurs in the lab,
          sweetheart.  But they do form attachments.
          Freda has a little one that follows her
          around, thinks Freda's his mom.

Grant starts to look around.

                            ELLIE
          What does sh
e eat?  Where does she feed?

                            HARDING
          Animal this size takes in a minimum of
          six hundred pounds of plants a day.  We
          truck in hay and meadow grasses seven
          times a day.  That's all she touches.

Grant studies the nearby grass and bushes.  Timmy quietly follows Grant.

Ellie lifts a huge eyelid on the triceratops.  A runny eye just stares.

Grant comes up triumphantly with a bouquet of weeds clutched in his
hand.  These weeds have little purple berries.  Ellie looks over.

                            ELLIE
          West Indian Lilacs!

                            GRANT
          These'd give anybody a stomachache.

                            HARDING
          I'm telling you, the animals don't eat
          don't eat that stuff.

Regis keeps a babysitter's eye on the kids.  Timmy comes up with a
handful of smooth stones.  He approaches Grant shyly.

                            TIMMY
          Dr. Grant, sir?  How 'bout these?
          There'
s lots of little piles of these?

Grant fingers one distractedly, then suddenly comes to attention.

                            GRANT
          Hey, Ellie take a look at his.  Good
          work, Timmy.

Ellie gets up, brushes herself off, comes over and examines the stone.

                            ELLIE
          Extremely smooth.  Purple stains, could
          be those lilac berries.

She and Grant smile and each other and nod.  Gennaro is curious.

                            HARDING
          I don't get it.

                            GRANT
          Looks like your trike swallows stones to
          help her digest her food.  Walking
          around, she crushes berries against the
          stones.  And even just a little crushed
          berry is eventually enough,

                            ELLIE
          So, she poisons herself periodically.

                            HARDING
          Bet we tested her saliva for any trace of -

                            GRANT
          But with th
e stones, she swallows them
          and probably bypasses any mucosal
          contact.  Straight to the stomach.  I
          would test her excrement.

                            LEX
          Yo, yuk!

A light RAIN begins.  Automatically, with a soft hiss, the glass roofs
of the cruisers slide shit.  Gennaro taps Regis and indicates the cars.

                            GENNARO
          Hey Regis, where are your rain gods?
          It's gonna pour.  Let's finish our tour.

Grant agrees, heads for the cruisers.  He turns and looks for Ellie.
Ellie stands by the Trike.  She gives Grant a meaningful look.

                            ELLIE
          I'm staying.

Grant smiles at her decision.

                            GRANT
          Soil samples?

                            ELLIE
          You read my mind.
              (confidentially)
          I think she's sicker then they're saying.
          Her skin is dry and flaky.  And her gums
          are pale.  I'm going to talk to Dr. Wu.

        
                    GRANT
          Good idea.  I'll keep my eyes open.

Gennaro climbs in with Grant.  The two cruisers start off and Timmy
turns backward to stare wistfully at Grant.  Regis and Lex wave to the
Trike.  Grant looks back to Ellie who has already begun to work.

ON TRIKE - a mosquito lands on its back.  The trike's tail slaps it dead.


INT  MACHINE ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

With difficulty, Nedry shoves his large body down the crawl space behind
a large rack of electronic equipment.  He stops and uses a suction cup
device to lift a section of the tiled floor.  He gropes among cables and
pulls out a small wireless radio.  He transmits:

                            NEDRY (INTO RADIO)
          Jim, what the hell's with you  ... I know
          a storm's coming, I can't ... it's all so
          tightly planned ... that's not enough ...
          ok, twenty minutes, I'll be there.  Damn!

Nedry returns the radio to its hiding place.  He sucks in his gut to
make the crawl out of  the narrow space.


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, T-REX FEEDING AREA - DUSK

The cruisers stop on the rise of a hill.  They over look a forested area,
sloping down to the edge of the lagoon.

                            TOUR
          The mighty T-Rex arose late in dinosaur
          history.  Dinosaurs ruled the earth for a
          hundred and twenty million years, but
          there were tyrannosaurs for only the last
          fifteen million years of that period ...

Farther south, they see the graceful necks of the brachiosaurs standing
at the water's edge.  Their bodies, mirrored in the moving surface,
break apart with the continuing drops of rain.  Hear lightning rhythmic-
ally pulses the sky.  All is quiet except for the soft drone of cicadas
and the tapping of light rain.

Regis calls Grant on the walkie-talkie.

                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
          You know, Dr. Grant, Hammond likes to
          come here in the evening and just sit.

                            GRANT (OVER WALKIE)
          Where is the T-
Rex?

                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
          Good question.

ON GRANT - as he takes that in, nodding to himself. Studies the land.

                            GRANT
          Maybe she's down hunting apatosaurs.

OVER WALKIE - Regis laughs, his voice tinny over the radio.

                            REGIS (OVER WALKIE)
          Would if she could, believe me.  Some-
          times she stands by the lagoon and stares
          at those animals, and wiggles those
          little forearms of hers in frustration.
          But the T-Rex territory is completely
          enclosed with trenches and fences.
          Believe me, she can't go anywhere.

                            GRANT
          Then where is she?

They hear A SOFT BLEATING.  In the center of the field, a small cage
rises into view, lifted on hydraulics from underground.  The cage bars
slide down.  A GOAT remains tethered in the field, BLEATING plaintively.

The tour group stares out their windows, expectantly.


BACK ON CONTRO
L ROOM -

Hammond, pleased, watches the giant screen that displays the tour group.
Muldoon limps into the control room.  Arnold looks over.

                            MULDOON
          Just checking in.  Everything ok?

                            HAMMOND
          Look at them.  Leaning out the windows,
          so eager.  They can't wait to see it.
          They have come for the danger.

                            MULDOON
          That's what I'm afraid of.

Muldoon twirls the keys on his fingers and watches the land cruisers.


BACK ON CRUISERS, T-REX FEEDING AREA -

Grant watches quietly.

The BLEATING becomes louder, more insistent.  The goat tugs frantically
at its tether, racing back and forth, kicking.

                            LEX
          What's going to happen to the goat?  Is
          the T-Rex gonna come eat the goat?

Grant senses something.  He sits straight up.  Looks out intently.

                            GRANT
          He's here.

The goat is tethered in the middle of the fi
eld, thirty yards from the
nearest tree.  Grant scans the tree for the T-Rex.

The goat senses something too.  It struggles and strains, bleating
frantically.  Suddenly the mechanical SOUND of the cage coming up.  Its
bars surround the goat with safety once again.

                            REGIS
          Looks like the Rex will have its snack a
          little later today.

                            RECORDED VOICE
          The sensors don't see the Rex around.
          She usually comes within five minutes of
          hearing dinner. If she doesn't, that
          means she's sleeping - we might have
          access to her at the picnic area.

Lex and Timmy let out a sigh of relief.  The tension is gone.

                            LEX
          I didn't want to see him get eaten.  I
          liked the goat.


BACK IN THE CONTROL ROOM -

Hammond studies the large video monitor.  He watches Grant and Gennaro.
Their voices are heard in the control room.

                            GENNARO (MONITOR
ED)
          What is a carnivore got out?

                            GRANT (MONITORED)
          There'd be no stopping it.  Huge, with no
          natural enemies, and a suppressed hunting
          instinct.

Hammond glares.  Arnold, aware, shuts off the screen.

                            HAMMOND
          Damn those people.  They are so negative.

                            ARNOLD
          It's natural.  They can't fully
          appreciate that we've engineered the
          animals and the park for total safety.

                            HAMMOND
          They comb this island like a bunch of
          accountants.  They don't experience the
          wonder, the awe of it all.

                            ARNOLD
          You can't make people experience wonder.

Hammond gets up and stands before the big windows overlooking the park.
The quartz FLOODLIGHTS outside their area COME ON with a rosy glow and
the dark jungle is opened again to their inspection.

At his console, Nedry looks at Hamm
ond.  Hammond stares out the window.
The RAIN PICKS UP and bounces off the window.  Hammond speaks to Arnold
without turning.

                            HAMMOND
          It's like the Garden of Eden out there.
          This is the most beautiful time of day.

                            ARNOLD
          Better rout the tour back.  They can
          start again sun-up tomorrow morning.

                            HAMMOND
          Yup.  Call the kitchen.  Those kids'll be
          hungry when they get in.

Arnold picks up the phone.  STATIC.  He glances over at Nedry.

                            NEDRY
          Sorry 'bout that.  I've taken all the
          lines to upload some data.

Hammond's annoyed, but contains it.  Arnold looks at Nedry, who smiles.

                            NEDRY
          I'll clear a couple of lines for you at
          the end of the next transmission, sir.
          Here you go now, this will make it all
          better, Mr. Hammond.

Nedry punches in a code.

CLOSE ON 
- Nedry's fat finger punching a last key.

CLOSE ON - amber video display terminal as a countdown begins.

As the screen counts down from ten to zero, Nedry peers at Hammond with
a steely glint in his eyes.

BACK ON SCREEN - three, two, one, the countdown hits zero.

Nedry's data-filled screen blinks off.  Nedry looks up to the rack of
monitors.  Unnoticed by Hammond or Arnold two more monitors go blank.
Then a third one.


BACK  ON CRUISERS, REST AREA - NIGHT

The electric cars turn up into a scenic area high above the rest of the
park.  HUGE QUARTZ LIGHTS REVEAL a dramatic view down to the ocean.
There the supply ship, the ANNE B, unloads its last crates.

RAIN INCREASES.  On the other side of the road are picnic tables, an
unfinished snack bar and rest rooms.  To the side of this rest area is a
view of the interior of the island.  A guard-rail separates visitors

To the other side of the rest area is a concrete moat and in the back of
this is a tall, electrified fence.  Surrounding the electric fence is a

smaller protective fence.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          ... enjoy a healthy snack.  This is also
          a good time to ...

                            LEX
          Hey, is that bathroom working?

                            REGIS
          Sure.
              (he uses his walkie)
          Rest stop.

The kids take off towards the bathroom, running through the rain.  Grant
gets out of his cruiser, strides to Regis.  He indicates the fence.

                            GRANT
          Is that still the T-Rex paddock?

                            REGIS
          Yes.  But she never comes here.  I don't
          know why not.  Probably too much
          construction.

GENNARO, jacket over his head against the rain, looks down to the ocean.

GENNARO'S POV - THE ANNE B UNLOADS he last cargo crate.

GRANT LOOKS at the concrete moat.  Studies its deep curve.  He looks up
at the tell electrical fence with its 10,000 volt warning.  He sees
conventional power lines on the opposite sid
e of the road.

CAMERA EXAMINES the empty cruisers.  Inside, the pre-recorded voice is
chatting on.  It slows eerily and stops.  Video SCREENS BLINK OUT.


BACK ON CONTROL ROOM -

Nedry yawns loudly.

                            NEDRY
          Yup!  Looks like a never-ending weekend
          for me.  I'm gonna get a Diet Coke.
          Don't touch my console, ok?  Line will
          be clear in five minutes.

Nedry leaves.  Hammond swings around and growls under his breath.

                            HAMMOND
          Slob!

                            ARNOLD
          Well, at least he knows what he's doing.


INT  UPPER FLOOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - NIGHT

Nedry races through the series of security doors.  He ignores the
security x-ray device and just SHOVES each door open with his hand.


BACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA -

THE QUARTZ LIGHTS GO OUT, leaving the group in shadowy darkness and now
STEADY RAIN.  There's a ripple of surprise from the group.  Regis rounds
them all up and directs them back into the 
cruisers.

                            REGIS
          Everything's just fine.  It's a temporary
          glitch due to the rain.  No doubt,
          they're going to re-rout some circuits
          back at the mainframe.  We'll have the
          power back on in moments.  Let's get back
          in the cruisers, they may start up, and
          I'd like us all to be seated in them.

The cruisers are STILL.  IN THE REAR CRUISER, Gennaro turns to Grant.

                            GENNARO
          I knew we shouldn't have kids here.

A vivid FLASH of LIGHTNING.  IN THE FIRST CAR:  Lex covers her eyes.
Then she looks up at Regis with a frightful face.

                            LEX
          Mr. Regis, are dinosaurs ... nocturnal?

                            REGIS
          No, darling, of course not.

                            LEX
          Mr. Regis?  What's ... nocturnal?

Another LIGHTNING FLASH.  Lex cries.  Regis comforts her.

                            REGIS
          Don't you worry about d
inosaurs.  They're
          all very safe in their paddocks just like
          animals in a big, strong zoo.  They're not
          going anywhere we don't tell them to go.

Timmy looks out the window excitedly.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - NIGHT

All those eggs on tables.  No moving sensors.  Nedry pulls a portable
incubator away from the dozens lined up against the wall.  Its
electrical cord goes flying.  Furiously, Nedry fills the incubator with
eggs, one after the other.

                            NEDRY
          Okay, little ones!  Here we go!

Nedry grabs the handles of the incubator and runs with it.  The
incubator careens on one wheel as he turns the corner and exits.


BACK ON CONTROL ROOM -

Hammond looks out the large window as the LIGHTS EXTINGUISH.  He twirls.

                            HAMMOND
          What's going on, Arnold?  I want those
          lights on.  I don't want my grandchildren
          scared.

                            ARNOLD
          Jesus, the computer's gone
 down.

                            HAMMOND
          Well, I want the computer up.  This is
          the wrong weekend for glitches.

Arnold still examines his console.  He looks out with worry.

                            ARNOLD
          That's not the worst of it.

                            HAMMOND
          Oh yeah?  Please tell me what's worse
          than the lights going out?

Wu smashes through the door.

                            WU
          All the security doors are open.  Someone
          has been in my laboratory and the eggs
          have been disturbed.

The camera pushes in on Hammond's face.

                            HAMMOND
          Where the hell is Nedry?  Where is he?
          Did anybody check the damn john?

Hammond storms out.


INT  CORRIDOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - CONTINUING ACTION

Hammond enters the hall.  Muldoon, racing from the other direction, yells:

                            MULDOON
          John, the generator's shut down.  Who cut
          the power?

     
                       HAMMOND
          Arnold's on it.  You go out and bring
          back the tour right away.  I don't need
          any of this!

Muldoon is already running back the way he came.


INT  GARAGE - NIGHT

Several electric land cruisers are stored in this shadowy room.  There
is a glassed-in area where Muldoon's weapons are stored:  assault
rifles, tasers, tear gas canisters.

To the side of the garage s Muldoon's red jeep.  In the passenger side
of the front seat is a rocket launcher.

Nedry storms in, wheeling his incubator.  He stop suddenly and listens.
Approaching FOOTSTEPS.

                            NEDRY
          Oh, shit!


INT  BASEMENT STAIRS, VISITOR'S CENTER -

Muldoon runs down a long corridor, stop with a skid and yanks open the
door to the garage.  He runs out.  His boots RESOUND on the concrete.

BACK ON - NEDRY'S PANICKED FACE as he listens to the footsteps.
Wheezing, with great difficulty, Nedry bends his knees and strains.  With
everything he's got, he lifts the incub
ator waist-height.  And holds it.

BACK ON MULDOON - Muldoon's footsteps ECHO as they come closer and closer
to the garage.  Muldoon whips down the curve in the stairs.  His jacket
catches on an incomplete section of banister. Yanks him to a stop.

CLOSE ON - Muldoon's jacket as it RIPS, stays caught.

BACK ON - NEDRY as he tries to heave higher, can't.  Beads a sweat roll
down his brow.

MULDOON FREES HIS caught jacket and then keep going.

Nedry's face drips with sweat.  The incubator slips out of his sweaty
palms.  Catches it with his knee.  Nedry curses and with one forceful
boost, he lifts the incubator shoulder height.

CLOSE ON - Muldoon's feet on long stairwell. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.

NERVOUS, NEDRY BREATHES in a labored fashion.  He looks this way and
that.  He closes his eyes and with one superhuman effort, he heaves the
incubator into the back seat of the red jeep.  Nedry exhales.

At that moment, MULDOON ENTERS the vestibule between stairs and garage.

NEDRY EYES the shadowy figure in the vestibule.  
Nedry's frightened face.

MULDOON STOPS and reaches in his belt.  He pulls out his pistol.  He
takes out long, shiny cartridges.  He loads the pistol.

NEDRY LEAPS in the front of the jeep, pushing aside the rocket launcher,
and zooms into the night.

A moment later, Muldoon enters the garage.  He sniffs at the exhaust
that still hangs in the air.  He looks over and is surprised to see his
jeep gone.  He bends and inspects fresh tread marks. He looks up, his
face straining to understand.


EXT  PARK ROAD - NIGHT

Nedry's red jeep flies down the park road.

CLOSE ON - Nedry's wheel as he turns it.

His tires skid sideways, then regain traction.  The jeep bolts up a
smaller access road.  He skids to a stop at the top of the hill.

Nedry jumps out and looks up.  His high beams illuminate a huge electric
fence prominently labeled:  DANGER!  10,000 Volts!

Two safety fences separate Nedry from the electric fence.  He races to
the first one, pulls out a key chain.  He tries one key, then another,
and another.  It f
its.  Nedry unlocks the gate, swings open the door.

Nedry runs to the second gate.  He slips in the mud.  He slides to the
ground, dropping keys in a muddy pool.

CLOSE ON - Nedry's hand frantically fishing for the key chain in the
muddy water.  Got them!   Unlocks the second gate.

He races to the electric fence.  RAIN PELTS him now.  Water beads on his
face.  Lightning flashes on the 10,000 volts warning.

He grabs the gate with his bare hand and swings it open.

Nedry heads back to his jeep, his fat body strobed by its high beams.
He jumps in the jeep and drives through.  Behind him, the open gates
move recklessly in the stormy night.


BACK ON GARAGE

Ellie and Harding pull in, in their own gas-powered jeep.  Muldoon is
waiting for them.  Now there's a rifle slung over his shoulder.  Harding
jumps out of the jeep.

                            MULDOON
          Get out, get out!  I need this jeep.
          There's a problem with the tour.  Ellie,
          Hammond'll fill you in.

Ellie is concerned, the
n decisive.

                            ELLIE
          No!  I'm going with you, Muldoon.

They race out.


EXT  DOCK - NIGHT

Headlights blazing in the darkness, Nedry's jeep skids to a stop by the
dock where the ANNE B is preparing to leave.  The water is very choppy.

Nedry jumps out and pulls his incubator to the ground.  He begins to
drag it through the mud, toward the ship.  CAPTAIN FARRELL comes to meet
him, along with A COUPLE MEN, who hoist the incubator easily and carry
it toward the ship.

                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
          Good.  Glad to see you.  Were you seen?

                            NEDRY
          Nah.  I'm back in five minutes, they'll
          never know I was gone.
              (yells after the men with the incubator)
          Careful with that thing!  It's worth more
          than the ship.
              (to the Captain)
          When's the copter meeting you?

                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
          It's not.  The storm's coast-to-coast,
       
   nobody could land on the water.

                            NEDRY
              (totally panicked)
          Shit!  What's the backup?  I don't like
          this.  Maybe we should do it another time,
          I don't like it.  I just don't like -

                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
          Shhh!  I wired Baker, he'll have a man at
          the dock in Puntaremas.  We should be
          able to make that in time.

                            NEDRY
              (somewhat relieved)
          Ten hours?

                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
          Yeah, now relax.  I got a lot riding on
          this too, you know.  No one's going to
          mess up now.  Baker's not going to mess
          up.  His people won't let him.

                            NEDRY
          Ok.  Ok.  Here.

Nedry pulls an aerosol can out of the baggy crotch of his pants.

                            NEDRY
          Look, this is insulating spray.

CLOSE ON - Nedry sprays a big mound of white foam into his
 hand,

                            NEDRY
          In about eight hours, spray down all the
          eggs with this stuff.  It'll keep 'em
          warm but not too warm.  I hope Baker has
          it together with the dock.


BACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA -

Rain drums down on the cruiser.  Timmy stares out at the dark.  Lex
stares nervously out the side window.  Timmy picks up the night goggles
and snaps them on.

                            TIMMY
          Hey, these thing work great.  I can see
          in the dark and I can see far.

He swivels away from the T-Rex paddock and looks out toward the ocean.
He reaches up and adjusts the knob.

                            TIMMY
          Hey!  I wonder if that boat's still
          there?  It is. I think they're getting
          ready to go.

TIM'S POV - the fluorescent green image of men untying casting lines on
the boat.

Another LIGHTNING FLASH and Lex SCREAMS and covers her face.  She cries.

                            REGIS
          Timmy, can you
 give her the goggles?

Lex clamps her hands over her eyes.  Timmy gently nudges her.

                            TIMMY
          Want to look at the boat, Lex?

Timmy hands her the night goggles. Lex dries her eyes and takes a peek
with the goggles toward the ocean.

                            LEX
          Hey, that fat guy's down there. Is he
          gonna come get us and take us to Grandpa?

LEX'S POV - the picture streaks but clearly reveals Nedry shouting at
the Captain.  Men heave the incubator onto the ship.

                            LEX
          They have one of those things from the
          room with all the eggs - you know, where
          they help the baby eggs grow up.

                            TIMMY
          You mean an incubator?

                            GRANT (ON WALKIE)
          What's the commotion?

                            REGIS
          Let me see.  Give them to men, sweetheart.

                            TIMMY (TO WALKIE)
          Uh, Dr. Grant?

REGIS GRABS th
e walkie talkie and tries to silence Timmy.  He knows he
gets there too late and reluctantly lets Timmy have it back.

                            TIMMY
          We saw that computer guy helping 'em load
          an incubator onto the ship.

                            LEX (TO WALKIE)
          Yeah, he's stealing them, Dr. Grant!
          He's stealing my Grandpa's eggs!

                            GRANT (ON WALKIE)
          Nedry?  With an incubator?  Regis??

                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
              (finally acknowledges)
          That's what they saw.

ON GRANT - He looks sharply at Gennaro.

                            GRANT (TO WALKIE)
          We gotta tell Hammond and Arnold right
          away.  How far is it to the mainland?

ON TIMMY - He looks at Regis.

                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
          Uh, it's a hundred miles to Puntaremas.
          About a sixteen hour voyage in this
          weather.

ON GRANT - He fiddles with the radio in his cruiser.  No r
esponse still.

                            GRANT
          I wouldn't like to see dinosaurs running
          around Costa Rica.

                            GENNARO
          When's the damn power coming on?


INT/EXT MULDOON'S JEEP, OTHER BACK ROADS

Muldoon and Ellie drive into the storm.  Suddenly, he slams on his
brakes.  In front of him, a tree has fallen, completely blocking the
road.  Muldoon curses, swerves around, and skids to a stop.

As Muldoon gets out and assesses the situation, Ellie lodges herself
between the tree and the jeep.  She pushes the tree with her strong legs
and moves it a good five feet. Quickly, Muldoon and Ellie drag the tree.
As they struggle.

                            MULDOON
          Strong legs.

                            ELLIE
          Lot of track in college.


BACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA -

IN THE FIRST CAR, Regis drums his fingers on the dashboard.  Timmy wears
his goggles and stares into the rain.  Lex shifts her body around,
trying to get comfortable to rest.

 
                           LEX
          I'm hungry.  When can we get going?

                            REGIS
          When the electricity comes back on,
          honey.  These cars run on electric cables
          buried in the road.

IN THE SECOND CAR, Grant tries the radio to no avail.  Gennaro smokes.
Grant looks forward toward the first cruiser.  He can barely make out
the car in the dark and rain.  Occasionally, LIGHTNING reveals all.

TIMMY PULLS GUM out of his pocket.  Feels a tiny shake, looks around.
He puts it in his mouth, chewing quietly.  SUDDENLY, the whole car
VIBRATES.  Regis' sunglasses jump off the dashboard and fall to the
floor.  The kids look at him.

                            REGIS
          Must be turning on the electricity.

Lex sits up, looks around groggily.

                            LEX
          Feels like a vibration.


INT  T-REX PADDOCK - NIGHT

The T-Rex's huge hind feet crash down, one large foot following after
the other in long, powerful strides.


BACK ON CRUISE
RS, REST AREA - FIRST CRUISER

There is a thud, and then a THUD, and then a THUD.   Tim and Lex share a
frightened look.  Now the thud grows LOUDER.  There is a CRASHING SOUND,
the whole cruiser SHAKES.  Then silence.  Then another SHAKE.

CAMERA PUSHES IN TILL CLOSE - Timmy stares out with his night goggles.

TIM'S NIGHTSCOPE POV IN CLOSE - T-Rex paws rest on the electric fence.

Tim takes off his goggles, stares, transfixed.  Regis picks them up.

EXTREME CLOSEUP - of muscular forepaws with pebbled, grainy skin and
thick, curved nails comfortably gripping a thick wire strand.

The T-Rex moves his body forward of the brush, pushes against the fence.


IN THE SECOND CRUISER -

Grant and Gennaro stare out, unseeing in the rain and darkness.


CLOSE ON LEX -

Tears roll down her cheek.  She cries silently with an unknown fear.
Regis pulls the goggles from his eyes, starts to gag, checks it.

                            REGIS
          Jesus Christ.

                            LEX
          Bad language.

     
                       REGIS
          Jesus Christ.  The fence isn't
          electrified.

                            LEX
          Is that bad?

Regis turns, looks out the side window, away from the T-Rex.

Regis is shaking uncontrollably.  Suddenly he throws open his door and
bolts off into the rain, leaving the door open.  No move from the Rex.

Regis races by the second cruiser.  Grant stares out at him.

                            TIM
          Mr. Regis!  Mr. Regis, where are you
          going?

                            LEX
          He just left us.  He just left us all
          alone.  Timmy, Timmy how could he do
          that?  We're all alone!  We're all alone!

FLASH OF LIGHTNING.  FLASH.  The Rex butts his head.

TIM'S POV - The fence bangs down on top of his cruiser.

Timmy and Lex recoil from the scrape  of the wire mesh against the car.


IN THE SECOND CRUISER -

GRANT AND GENNARO'S POV - through the almost obscuring rain they see the
fallen fence.  An unseen weight pulls on it fur
ther, causing its
electric wire to pop like over-tuned guitar strings.


TIMMY REACHES -

out into the rain for the open door handle.

Another LIGHTNING FLASH and the creature is revealed standing between
the two cruisers, atop the crushed fence.  His head turns back and
forth, he's deciding on his prey.  Grant and Gennaro or Tim and Lex?

Timmy slams the door shut.  He looks directly at the Rex, just a few
feet away.  The Rex turns to him, stares back.

Lex SCREAMS and Timmy claps a hand over her mouth.

There is a whisper over Tim's walkie-talkie.

                            GRANT (ON WALKIE)
          Timmy, be quiet. Don't move.


BACK ON GRANT -

He snaps off the walkie-talkie.

HIS POV - The rain runs in rivulets down the pebbled skin of the
muscular hind legs.  The animal's head is out-of-view, above the
rooftops of the cars.  The Rex lifts its huge hind leg.

                            GENNARO
          Holy shit!  Any suggestions what we do
          now?

                            GRANT
        
  Can't think of a thing.

The T-Rex slowly circles Grant's cruiser.


BACK ON TIM -

He watches the beast move.


BACK ON GRANT AND GENNARO -

As they twist and turn, trying to find a circling Rex in dark and rain.
The Rex pauses right next to Gennaro's window.  He lowers his head,
looking for movement inside.

CLOSE ON - the beady, expressionless reptilian eye moving in the socket.

Grant whispers, hardly moving his lips.

                            GRANT
          Don't move.

Gennaro's leg trembles uncontrollably.


IN THE FIRST CRUISER -

Very frightened, Lex discovers a flashlight.  She flicks it on and off,
distracting herself.  The beam shows her eyes full of a quiet panic.

                            LEX
          It's too, too dark out there.

Tim waves his hands in caution.


BACK ON GRANT, GENNARO, AND THE REX -

The Rex bends down, bumps the windshield with his nose.  Just stays
there, breathing heavily.  In the distance, the flashlight goes on
again.  The Rex raises his head suddenly.  Grant g
rabs his walkie.

                            GRANT (TO THE WALKIE)
          Shut that flashlight, Tim!

As the Rex heads off, a casual swipe of his tail SMASHES the side of the
cruiser, throwing Grant and Gennaro across the inside of the car.


ON TIM -

He lunges for the flashlight.  Lex dodges him, keeps it lit.

                            LEX
          No, it's mine.  Please, I need it.

Tim looks up through the sun roof.  The massive head of the
Tyrannosaurus Rex appears.  Tim watches, transfixed.  Lex looks up.
Irrational with terror, she aims her flashlight like a gun.  Blasts him.
Her flashlight beam cuts through the dark and rain - she sees the beast
plainly for the first time and SCREAMS!

The POOL OF LIGHT bathes the Rex's face.  He smashes his head down onto
the Plexiglass bubble.  It crunches, and falls into the car, crushing
the children.  Tim uses his feet to push it to the side.

Above, the Rex displays is gaping maw, drooling toward the opening.


GRANT -

watches the Rex raise his mighty h
ead again, above the kids' cruiser.


TIMMY AND LEX -

have a half-instant of relief.  Then SLAM.  The Rex butts his head
against the cruiser.  The Rex comes back down, tries to discover his
prey inside the cruiser.  Pushes his head close to the glass, looking.

The dinosaur stands in front of the cruiser, his whole chest heaving,
his forelimbs pawing the air.

Timmy whispers to Lex.

                            TIMMY
          Are you ok?  Be quiet and don't move.

Lex barely nods and grabs Timmy's hand.

The Tyrannosaur places his head next to the car.  He begins to shove the
cruiser with his head.  The cruiser ROCKS.  The back window bursts,
shards go flying.

Inside, the kids are THROWN back and forth, SHOVED against each other,
and finally FLUNG against the top of the car as the cruiser FLIPS.

The whole world TILTS CRAZILY - trunks of palm trees slide by, the
ground above, the blazing eye of the rex, the tops of palm trees.

The cruiser SLAMS DOWN on its side, the windows splat in the mud.  Lex
falls he
lplessly against the side window and lies motionless.  Timmy
falls beside her, banging his head.  He reaches for Lex.

                            TIMMY
              (softly)
          Lex?  Lex?

SILENCE.  No movement from Lex.

THE ANIMAL toys with the cruiser.  Like a dog with its bone, the
dinosaur pushes the cruiser along with his head.  He pushes it past the
picnic tables toward the ripped fence and the embankment.  Each shove
sends the children flying again.

The cruiser is pushes closer and closer to the unprotected embankment.
The cruiser slams to a stop completely upside-down.  The T-Rex steps
right on the cruiser, crushing the roof against the ground.

INSIDE - the children crawl for their lives as the car crushes further
down from above and a tidal wave of mud oozes in from the sides.

THE REX - gnaws at the car, grabs a tire with his teeth,  It ruptures
with a pitiful pop.  The Rex grabs at the axle with his teeth, begins to
drag the car back.  THe kids, half-outside, are pulled with the car.



GRANT DANCES -

with a flare!  The Rex is distracted.

CLOSE ON - the Rex as he ROARS.  The flare gleams in his eyes.

The Rex starts toward Grant.  He tosses the flare over the half-standing
part of the fence.  The Rex lunges after the flare.

GENNARO has reached his limit.  Terrorized, he leaps out and SCREAMS:

                            GENNARO
          Extinct animals should stay extinct!

He bolts.  The Rex sees him and starts after him, THUNDERING by Grant,
who stays frozen in place.

Gennaro sprints for his life.  He's not even a distant match for the T-
Rex jogging behind him.

Gennaro dives into the LADIES ROOM.

INSIDE - he slams the door and shoves the trashcan against the door.
POUNDING FOOTSTEPS APPROACH!  Gennaro backs up into one of the stalls.
LOUDER POUNDING, THE WALLS BEGIN TO VIBRATE!  Gennaro assumes a 'tuck'
position.

ON THE INTERIOR DOOR - The Rex smashes right through the steel-clad
door.  Pieces go flying.

Gennaro hides amidst the wreckage as the Rex sniffs around.


GRANT RUNS BA
CK -

to check on the kids.  He reaches a hand underneath the flipped car,
sitting in the mud.  Lex's soft voice can be heard.

                            LEX (OFF)
          Dr. Grant!

Grant fishes under, finds Lex's hand, drags her out.  He quickly checks
her for broken bones.

                            GRANT
          Lex, are you okay?

                            LEX
          Timmy's unconscious, he won't move.

Lex SCREAMS.  Grant turns to see the Rex return.  He squeezes Lex tight.
The animal goes right past them, back to his toy - Tim's land cruiser!

The Rex BELLOWS a huge cry.  Timmy awakens and sees the Rex above him.
He SCREAMS.

Lex, squeezed in Grant's arms, sees her imperiled brother.

                            LEX
          Timmy!

The Tyrannosaur looks up, GROWLS across the upside-down cruiser, opens
its huge jaws menacingly, all the time staring at Grant and Lex.

INSIDE THE CAR - Timmy tries to unwedge himself.  A thin trickle of
blood runs down his forehead.  He's jammed between the
 crushed roof and
the bent bench seat.  He can't free himself.

The Rex begins to SHOVE the cruiser toward Grant and Lex.  They back up
but they have very few feet left - they're almost at the embankment.
But if they don't move, they'll by crushed by the oncoming car.

Grant slings Lex onto his back.  She grabs her hands around his neck and
digs her feet into his sides.  Grant begins to climb over the downed
fence and into the embankment - it's a huge drop!

Grant grabs a broken cable and lowers himself and Lex over the side of
the embankment.

Just in time as the Rex SHOVES the cruiser further.  Now, the cruiser
TEETERS right on the edge, turning again on its side.  Tim hangs halfway
out of the car, unable to get out further.

Grant, with Lex on his back, slides down the cable, rappelling down the
embankment.  ABOVE, the car looms over them, rocking on the edge.  Lex
looks up and grabs Grant so tightly, she chokes him, unknowingly.

Grant, eyes bulging, sees the danger from above.  He pushes off the wall
and
 swings them toward the next hanging cable.  He reaches out and -

- GRABS THE NEXT CABLE just as -

- the T-Rex BELLOWS and lowers her head, and gives a final shove.  Timmy
and the cruiser SAIL INTO SPACE.  Timmy SCREAMS!

Grant and Lex swing out of the way as the cruiser sails past them.  Lex
SCREAMS, squeezing Grant's neck even tighter!   They watch helplessly as
the cruiser BOUNCES off the wall and CRASH-LANDS into the top of a tree
at the base of the wall.

Grant and Lex stare down at the wreck in the tree.  Timmy can't be seen.
Grant, choking from Lex's grip, grabs her fingers.

                            GRANT
          Let ... go ... please.

The Rex ROARS above.  They look up.

THE REX paws the air, GRUNTS in frustration and STALKS off, LIGHTNING
FLASHES.


EXT  NEDRY'S JEEP, BACK ROADS -

Nedry speeds along the rain-slick road, fish-tailing as he goes.

CLOSE ON - Nedry at the wheel.

NEDRY'S POV - the dark, wet road running alongside a ten-foot chain-link
fence.  Suddenly, a beast-like visage blur
s across the road.

Nedry swerves.  The jeep skids.  Nedry tries to over-steer, can't bring
the careening jeep under control.

The jeep crashes though the fence, bounces down a cement culvert, and
dives into a raging gully.

Nedry curses.  He spins the wheel.  The tires spin and spray.  The
jeep's hopelessly stuck in the gully.  From Nedry's seat in the jeep, he
cranes his head around, examining his situation.

NEDRY'S POV - On the opposite side of the gully, there is an equipment
graveyard.  By the titled jeep headlights, steely monsters all around
can be seen - discarded earth movers, graders, and tractors.

Nedry gets out of the jeep, grabs the winch from the jeep's back end.
and wades over to an abandoned tractor.

                            NEDRY
          Shit. I'm going to have to change clothes.

He loops the winch around the tractor's base.  Suddenly, he stops and
looks around as he hears a gentle HOOTING.  He squints, looking at the
strange steel graveyard lit by the bright beams of the jeep headli
ghts.

HOOT!  HOOT!  A distinctive HOOTING.  Nedry looks up in fear.  SILENCE.

Nedry starts moving toward his jeep.  Again, the HOOT!  Nedry stops,
looks right, looks left.  A RUSTLE in the trees.  Nedry's head cocks.

Looking through trees, lit by the strong beams, Nedry sees a SPITTER in
the eerie mist.  Now it's gone.  Now it's back.  It circles Nedry
warily, hunting him.  Nedry stares.

                            NEDRY
          I hope this is one of them herbivores.

Nedry scrambles the other way, full-tilt.  Hop, hop, and the Spitter
drops in front of Nedry from the other side.  HOOT!

Nedry jumps back, lands on his butt.  The Spitter zips in from the side
- HOOT!

Nedry doubles back, racing through the abandoned equipment, ducking and
rolling under a cement mixer, spinning past a tree.  He splashes down
the embankment, trying to get to his jeep.  He uses the winch line to
steady himself again the raging current.  He finally reaches the jeep,
swings open the door - and, surging out of the water like a
 demonic
apparition, is the SPITTER!  Nedry backs away, directly into the glare
of the headlights!

CLOSE ON - the Spitter.  It's plume opens, bright orange gills swell out
like an umbrella around its neck.  Something squirts beneath its jaws.

A big glob SMACKS Nedry on the arm.  He brushes it off.

                            NEDRY
          Gross.

EXTREME CLOSEUP - the Spitter's head.  The jaws puff, the hood flares
out, the neck snaps forward.  And - it spits.

This glob misses Nedry, splashes off the steaming headlight.

VERY EXTREME CLOSEUP - The Spitter's swollen poison sacs are inflated.
They fire!

This glob hits Nedry in the eyes.  He SCREAMS.

                            NEDRY
          I'm blind, I'm blind.

He falls against the jeep, rubbing his eyes.  The Spitter calmly hops to
the embankment and watches the blinded Nedry weave drunkenly in the
water.  Nedry grabs onto the jeep and pulls himself along toward the
driver's door.  The Spitter stalks, watching him.

Nedry pulls open the jeep door, 
thrusts his head in, slams it against
the door frame.  Now Nedry heaves his whole body into the jeep.  The
Spitter's long ostrich-like legs stretch and bend in an easy gait as it
closes it on Nedry.

Nedry sits behind the wheel, unseeing as the Spitter watches patiently
turns his blind eyes that way.

A long beat.  The Spitter leaps forward, the CAMERA PULLS BACK WIDER AND
WIDER.  Nedry lets out an ear-splitting SCREAM and the car horn BLARES.


INT  TIMMY'S CRUISER

Timmy lies against a spidered side window, his head pressed against the
door handle.  He pushes himself up on one elbow, opens his eyes, and
tries to focus.  Rain has nearly stopped but a light drizzle hits him

Timmy tries to straighten up, but he's too dizzy.  He stops and hears A
CREAKING and feels the whole car gently swaying back and forth.  With a
further effort, he raises his body so that he's standing with his feet
on the window frame and looks out the broken roof.

TIM'S POV - Dense foliage, moving in the wind, hard to see through.  An
o
pen space and - THE GROUND, FORTY FEET AWAY!


INT/EXT  CRUISER - CONTINUING ACTION

Tim's cruiser is lying on its side, stuck in the higher branches of a
tree on the hillside.

                            TIMMY
          Oh shit!

Timmy pulls his body up carefully, trying to get a better view.  He
grabs the steering wheel for support and it spins free in his hand.

CRACK!  The cruiser slips a few inches down the tree.  Timmy grabs the
window frame and freezes.  The car sways in the wind.

CRACK!  The car slips a quick and rocky two feet.

                            TIMMY
          Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!

Timmy hears something.  He raises his head very carefully.  Climbing up
the tree, pulling himself on a nearby branch, is Dr. Grant.

                            GRANT
          Timmy.  Are you ok?

                            TIMMY
          Thank God you're here.  Where's Lex?

                            GRANT
          Below.  She's fine.  Let's get you down.

Timmy nods.

Grant peers throug
h the broken roof of the cruiser, analyzing Timmy's
predicament.  He cranes his head back to examine how the cruiser is
supported in the tree.  Grant turns back to Timmy.

                            GRANT
          Try the door you're leaning against.
          Nice and slow.

Timmy places his weight on the two sides of the door frame and reaches
between his legs, trying to open the door handle.  Stuck.  CRACK!  The
cruiser drops another foot.

Grant scrambles down a couple branches until he is even with the cruiser
again.  He motions for Timmy to hold still.

Grant reaches across to the other car door and tries the outer door
handle.  This one opens and very slowly, he pushes open the door.  Grant
gingerly holds it half-open in mid-air.

                            GRANT
          Crawl this way.  Slowly.

Carefully testing his weight with each step, Timmy lowers his body down.
He pushes his legs out the door.  They kick in the air and slowly come
to rest on a lower branch.  He lets himself down.  Now he si
ts on a
branch, a few feet below the cruiser.

CRACK!  The cruiser drops.  Grant still hangs onto the door but now his
footing on the branch is gone.  His legs hang in space.  The cruiser
hangs precariously above Timmy.  They're all twenty feet in the air.

                            GRANT
          We're going to have to make a jump for
          it, Timmy.  Okay?

Timmy agrees.

                            GRANT
          One, two, three, jump.

Timmy lets go and DROPS.  Grant follows.  So does the cruiser.  It's
hurtling right at them.

Timmy BANGS against the wet tree-trunk and slides down.  Branches WHIP
against his face, his hands SCRAPE against the trunk.  Grant BOUNCES
them.  They scramble down as quick as they can.

Timmy pulls his hands along the sap-sticky surface of the tree.  CRACK!
Grant is stopped for a terrible instant - doubled over a branch, he
flips himself over, dropping further.  The cruiser jolts along, just a
half-step behind them.

Timmy dives the last six feet and HITS the wet earth 
with a THUD!  Grant
CRASHES next to him.  Before they can roll out of the way, the cruiser
keeps coming.  Grant and Timmy look up at it.

GRANT'S POV - The cruiser dropping, dropping toward them.  And finally
stops, just inches away, its dented grill grinning at them, its cracked
headlight glaring.

Oil drips down on Grant.  He grabs Timmy, who grabs the night goggles.
The two roll away.  That second the cruiser SMASHES to the ground.

Grant brushes himself off painfully, extends a hand to Timmy.  Timmy
slowly reaches up and pulls himself standing.

                            TIMMY
          Thanks, Dr. Grant.

                            GRANT
          You owe me one.

Grant turns around in a slow, fluid circle, checking out the forest.

                            GRANT
          Where'd Lex go?

They hear a faint WHIMPERING.

                            TIMMY
          There's Lex.

He runs.  Grant follows.


INT  DRAINPIPE -

Lex is curled up inside the drainpipe.  Her baseball glove is in her
mouth and
 she is rocking back and forth, rhythmically banging her head
against the back of the pipe.  She WHIMPERS.

ON THE HILLSIDE -

Grant and Timmy arrive at the drainpipe and stare in at Lex.

                            GRANT
          Come on out now, Lex.

Lex continues to band her head.  Timmy tries again.

                            TIMMY
          It's your turn to wear the goggles, Lex.

She shakes her head.  He holds up her baseball but she doesn't look.

                            TIMMY
          I found your baseball.

                            LEX
          You did?

But she doesn't move.  Grant speaks encouragingly.

                            GRANT
          Cone on, Lex, it must be cold in there.
          And tight.  Why don't you come out?

                            LEX
          I'm afraid of the "animals".

                            TIMMY
          The "animals" are gone.

                            LEX
          Where did it go?

                            TIMMY
          I don't kno
w but it's not here now.

                            LEX
          Are there any grownups out there?

                            GRANT
          I'm a grownup, Lex.  Come on out.  Gimmie
          you hand, come on, here you go.

                            LEX
          I'm hungry.

                            GRANT
          Me, too.  We've got to get ourselves back
          to civilization.


EXT  ROADSIDE

Regis slowly crawls out from between a couple large boulders.  He looks
around carefully.  He peels mud off his face and rubs his neck.

He touches his cheek.

CLOSE ON Regis' swollen cheek.  He rubs it with his finger.  Suddenly,
he swats at his own mouth.  He reaches in and pulls out a leech fat with
blood.  He hurls it to the ground, spitting.  He grabs another off his
arm and rips if off, leaving a bloody streak.  He digs in his pants and
pulls out another.  He SCREAMS.

As soon as he has done so, he knows he's made a mistake.  He looks
around frantically.  Sees the Rex trot down the road toward 
him.

                            REGIS
          Noooooo!


BACK ON HILLSIDE -

Grant and the kids crest the hill.  Grant puts on the night goggles and
adjusts the dial and looks toward Regis.  The kids can't see that far.

                            TIMMY
          What's going on?

Grant's green POV - Regis and the Rex bounding after him.  Regis hugs a
tree, unmoving.

Grant whispers to the kids.

                            GRANT
          It's Regis and the Rex is after him.  But
          it's okay.  Regis knows the Rex can't see
          him.  Evidently, he can only see move-
          ment.  Regis'll be ok if he stays still.

AFTER A LONG MOMENT, the tyrannosaur walks away, disappears into the
shadows.  Regis waits another long moment and releases his tree.

GRANT'S POV - The tyrannosaur leaps out of the shadows and knocks Regis
to the ground.  Regis jumps up and backs off.  The animal knocks him
right back down.  Regis jumps up again and screams at the beast.

                            REGIS
    
      You don't want to hurt Mr. Regis.  Go
          away.  Ed's your friend.  Back off!

THE REX watches him dance around.  It goes toward him.  This time its
jaws are open.  Regis SCREAMS and in the middle, the scream cuts off.

Grant lets the goggles fall off his face.  They hit the ground with a
METALLIC CLINK.  The Rex turns toward Grant and the kids.

                            GRANT
          Let's go!

Grant grabs both the kids' hands and they begin to run.


BACK ON  TOUR REST AREA -

Drops of water splat on a big fern.  Light swims in the little puddle.
In the sky above, clouds hurry by, intermittently revealing a half-
obscured moon.

The torn fence lies in a crumpled, twisted mess.  The wheel of a Land
Cruiser spins.  A little lizard runs in place on it.

The SOUND of the jeep's engine.  It's Muldoon and Ellie.

THEIR POV - a single cruiser lies on its side in the middle of the road.

                            ELLIE
          Oh, My God!  Where's the other one?

Before the cruiser stops, she j
umps out.   Muldoon shouts a whisper.

                            MULDOON
          Ellie!

Ellie turns in the headlight beams.  Muldoon tosses her a flashlight.

                            MULDOON
          Wait up.

Muldoon skids to a stop, leaps out of the car.  He catches up to Ellie.

They share a frightened, apprehensive look.  Muldoon gets on his knees
and and touches a muddies area.

                            MULDOON
          T-Rex tracks.

Ellie looks out into the forest.

                            ELLIE
          Then they must be out there.  They must
          be out there.  I know it.

                            MULDOON
          Perhaps.

                            ELLIE
          No!  They're out there.

                            MULDOON
          I've seen a lot of animal attacks in the
          bush.  It's not as gory and horrifying to
          see as you'd think.  No pools of blood or
          exposed bones.  There is usually little or
          no evidence left behind.  And if
 victims
          are small, a predator can kill by just
          shaking the little thing to death, eating
          it, and leave not so much as a button.

A definite RUSTLING in the brush.

Ellie jumps and SCREAMS.  Muldoon puts his hand over her mouth and
pushes her down.  They both squat by the cruiser.  SILENCE.  Ellie
swallows.  Muldoon slowly gets up.  Ellie follows.

Their flashlights swing back and forth in the night.  Twigs crack under
their feet.

Ellie hears the RUSTLE at the edge of the forest.  She shines her light
into the brush.  She catches her breath.  Her hand shakes.

Ellie flashes her beam right, left, up, down.  Jumps.  Something is
coming at her, rolling at her.  She gasps, steps back.  It's too late.
It's Gennaro.  His limp body stops at her feet.  She covers her mouth.
Muldoon runs to her.

Gennaro is face-down.  Muldoon takes his pulse.

                            MULDOON
          Thank God.  (beat)  We have to carry him.
          First I have to ...

He stands and removes his 
jacket.

CLOSE ON - Muldoon tears the jacket into long strips.

He wraps Gennaro's wounds.

                            MULDOON
          He's losing a lot of blood.  Help me.

Muldoon and Ellie carry Gennaro to the jeep.  They lay him on the back
seat.  Muldoon jumps in back with him.  He keeps wrapping the wounds.
Ellie starts the engine, looks back at him.

                            ELLIE
          Looks like you've been through this
          before.

Muldoon looks up.

                            MULDOON
          I told you I've seen big game attacks in
          Africa.

She starts the engine.

                            ELLIE
          Right.

Ellie skids out of there.


INT  CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

The dark room is lit with two outdoor torches.  Light flickering on
their faces, Arnold and Wu stare at the console screen.

                            WU
          Why?

                            ARNOLD
          Because Nedry messed with the code.
          That's why I'm checking it.

              
              WU
          But that could take weeks.  What would be
          faster?  Try keychecks.

Arnold snaps his fingers, grabs Wu,

                            ARNOLD
          That's true.  Keychecks will give me a
          record of every button Nedry pushed.

With a rapid series of keys, Arnold initiates "keystrokes".  The
computer displays a short series of commands.  Arnold runs his finger
down the screen.

                            ARNOLD
          Jesus, that's all he did all afternoon?
          He was just dicking around, maybe waiting
          to get his nerve up.

Wu points to a line.  It reads:  WHTE-RBT.OBJ

                            WU
          What's that?

                            ARNOLD
          Some sort of object.  Let's see if we can
          trace it.

Arnold types FIND WHTE-RBT.OBJ.  Nothing.  He tries DEFINE WHTE-RBT.OBJ.
Still nothing.  LIST WHTE-RBT.OBJ.  The screen fills with data.  Each
line defines another security system that has been shut off:  SECURITY
PERIM
ETER FENCES OFF/   SECURITY - INTERIOR FENCES OFF/  SECURITY -
LABORATORY DOORS OFF/, etc.

                            WU
          What's it mean?

                            ARNOLD
          It wasn't a bug.  It was a trap door that
          fat bastard left for himself.  When he
          hit WHTE-RBT. OBJ, it initiates a set of
          commands that turned the whole goddamn
          park off.  Hammond was right about him.

                            WU
          If I did that I'd leave a way to turn it
          back on.  In case I had to.  I'm sure
          Nedry did.  You're find it.

Arnold nods grimly.


INT  CAFETERIA - NIGHT

Hammond sits quietly in the deserted cafeteria, calmly spooning ice
cream into his mouth.  This room is lit by dozens of candles.

Muldoon walks in, stares at Hammond in the semi-darkness.

                            MULDOON
          We found Gennaro.  He'd badly injured.
          Harding's tending to him in your
          quarters.  He'll be all right if we can
    
      radio for help.  Your grandchildren and
          Grant are somewhere in the park.  I
          believe they're alive but I don't know
          where they are.

                            HAMMOND
          I'm sure you'll find them.

                            MULDOON
          I certainly hope so.

                            HAMMOND
          I'm sure we will.  After all, I keep
          telling everyone, this park is made for
          children.

                            MULDOON
          Just so you understand that they're
          missing, sir.

                            HAMMOND
          Missing?  Of course I know they're
          missing.  You just said that.  Look, Bob,
          let's not get carried away.  We've had a
          little breakdown from the storm or
          whatever, and as a result we've had a
          regrettable, unfortunate accident.  And
          that's all that happened.  We're dealing
          with it.  Arnold will get the computers
          cleaned up, and
 the radio and phone lines
          open.  You'll find those kids and my good
          friend, Dr. Grant.  I'm sure they'll want
          some of this ice cream.  It's very good.


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

Dark.  Ellie helps Harding get Gennaro comfortable on Hammond's couch.
Blood from Gennaro's injuries stain the rich leather.  Gennaro babbles.

                            GENNARO
          That Rex didn't even give me his full
          attention.  That's what hurts.  I was
          just an afterthought.  I gave him my full
          attention.

                            HARDING
          He's had a lot of morphine.

                            GENNARO
              (sings)
          Not enough.

                            ELLIE
          I need to find Wu.  I have to run a few
          tests in his lab.

                            HARDING
          He's probably in the control room, get-
          ting in the way while Arnold tries to put
          things together.

As Ellie leaves, Genna
ro is singing a shanty in his morphine stupor.

                            GENNARO
          Yo ho, I'll close this place down ...


EXT  THE ANNE B AT SEA - NIGHT

The ship is tossed around on a stormy sea.

                                                     MATCH CUT TO:


INT  STATEROOM -

The eggs are tossed around in the womb of the incubator.  The swell
settles but the rocking of one egg doesn't stop.  The egg cracks, a
silvery line runs down its side.


EXT  PARK - NIGHT

Somewhere in the dark park, laced by low fog, Grant, Timmy and Lex walk.

                            LEX
          I'm tired.

                            TIMMY
          You're too big to be carried.

                            LEX
          But I'm tired-tired.

                            GRANT
          Okay, Lex.

Grant picks her up.

                            GRANT
          Oof!  You're heavy.

The full moon is blurred by drifting clouds.  Their blunted shadows lead
the three across an open field toward dark woods beyond
.  Grant is lost
is thought, trying to decide where to go.

                            GRANT
          I think we're still in his paddock.

Lex's heavy eyes open.  Her eyes grow big.  She taps Grant's shoulder.

                            GRANT
          What?

                            LEX
          Don't you see?  Don't you see?

                            GRANT
          What?

                            LEX
          The fence.

                            GRANT
              (squinting)
          No.

                            TIMMY
          Oh I do, right there!

Lex lets herself slide off Grant and runs into the woods.  Timmy
follows.  Grant follows, squinting.  Finally, he sees.  A big smile.

The kids look up at a twelve foot high electric fence.  Timmy gulps.

                            LEX
          Timmy's scared of heights.

Timmy spins in fury.

                            TIMMY
          Shut up.

Lex and Timmy stare at each other.  No fighting - now.  They relax.

                   
         GRANT
          Okay with the fence, Timmy?

Timmy eyes it.  Nods hesitantly.  They start to climb.  Lex climbs easily.

                            LEX
              (mumbles quietly)
          'Fraid of heights.

Timmy climbs tentatively.  A dinosaur ROARS in the distance.

CLOSE ON - Timmy's foot loses its grip.

Timmy hangs for a moment, held only by his straining hands.

All three stop.  Wait.  Timmy regains his balance.  Slowly, they proceed
up and over.

On the other side, Grant looks around.  More high trees.  Beyond a field.

                            GRANT
          A herbivore grazing area.  Excellent.

Grant starts to walk toward it.  Timmy stops.  Lets sits on a tree root.

                             TIM
          We gonna walk all night?

Grant looks at his watch.

                            GRANT
          Twelve hours before that ship reaches the
          mainland.

                            TIM
          We need sleep.

True, and Grant's thinking the same thing.  He looks aro
und, surveying
the misty forest.  He looks straight up into the beautiful, tall trees
that ring the wide-open grassy meadow.

                            GRANT
          Up there.

                            TIM
          Climb?  Again?  I can't climb again?

Grant smiles.

                            GRANT
          Sure you can.

Grant checks out and rejects tree after tree.  Near the meadow he finds
it.  A good, basic climbing tree.


EXT  UPPER BRANCHES OF THE TREE

Grant helps Lex get comfortable on his lap.  Timmy tucks himself in
between Grant's outstretched legs.  Grant looks out.  Back to kids.

Timmy and Lex are already snoring.  Lex turns and hugs Grant close to
her.  She murmurs in her sleep.  Grant starts to pat her shoulder when
Timmy, without waking, reaches to her and strokes her hair.

                            TIMMY
              (mumbles)
          It's ok, Lex.  Everything's gonna be okay.

                                                       CUT TO:

CLOSE ON - amoeba-like creatures 
swimming in a pool.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - NIGHT

Ellie lifts her head away from the powerful microscope.

The dark room is lit by flashlight.  Battery packs power the microscope.
Wu paces the room, regarding his eggs with dismay.  Sitting on their
long tables with no moving wands above them - no thermal sensors.

                            WU
          What is taking Arnold so long?  This room
          is too cold.  My eggs will be damaged.

Ellie swings the lens to Wu.  Not so interested but peers in politely.

                            ELLIE
          No sign of those berries.  Really
          interesting.  There are indications of a
          similar virus in every tissue sample.
          But it's not in the ground.  Could I look
          at some of the discarded embryos?

Wu reluctantly agrees.  He opens a cabinet and brings her samples.

                            WU
          I'm sure you'll find your virus ... or a
          similar one.  All animals carry many
          viruses 
in a dormant condition.  It's
          almost impossible to say with certainty
          which are the same strains.

Ellie begins a test on a sample.  She adds a reagent and marks up a
slide.  As she works:

                            ELLIE
          And yet from what Harding tells me, many
          of you animals have similar symptoms -
          besides the microvesicles, a lack of
          hunger, loss of reproductive urges, sores
          in the mouth and gums.

Wu waves his arms.

                            WU
          What the hell does Harding know?  He's a
          veterinarian, not a pathologist.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

Arnold pushes his chair away from his console and claps his hands as
Muldoon walks in.  Muldoon asks hopefully.

                            MULDOON
          What is it?

Arnold points to the screen.

                            ARNOLD
          That's it.

Muldoon comes closer.

                            MULDOON
          That's what?

                            ARNOL
D
          I found the command to restore the
          original code.  It resets the linked
          parameters.

                            MULDOON
          The fences and the power?

                            ARNOLD
          Right.  And it does something else. It
          erases the code lines that refer to it.  It
          destroys all evidence it was ever there.

                            MULDOON
          Nedry could steal the eggs, get back and
          reset the whole show.  No one would ever
          miss him.

                            ARNOLD
          Watch this.

Arnold types in a command.  The screen flickers and changes.  Arnold and
Muldoon look out the window as lights come on through out the park.

                            ARNOLD
          Hot damn!

                            MULDOON
          Are the fences back on?

                            ARNOLD
          You bet they are.  It will take a few
          seconds to get up to full power, because
          we've got fift
y miles of fence out there,
          and the generator has to feed the
          capacitors along the way.  But in a half
          a minute we'll be back in business.

Arnold points to the transparent map of the park.  On it, bright red
lines snake out, moving throughout the park, as electricity surges
through the fences.

                            MULDOON
          Motion sensors?

                            ARNOLD
          Got them too.   It will be a few minutes
          while the computer counts.  Then I'll
          tell you where Grant and the kids are and
          you can go and get them.  But every-
          thing's working.  Half past ten and we've
          got the whole thing back up and running.

Muldoon picks up a phone, shakes his head.

                            MULDOON
          Just hiss.


BACK ON  GRANT AND KIDS IN TREE -

Grant snores.  A mosquito buzzes around him.  He waves him away and
continues to sleep.

In the distance, a tiny BEEPING. Below the towering tree, across the
f
ield, a sensor beeps, it's green light blinks, and the beeping stops.

IN THE HIGH TREE, the branches sway.  Grant and the kids sleep on.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

The glowing, glass map.  Arnold and Muldoon stare at it.

                            MULDOON
          What is taking so damn long?  Where are they?

                            ARNOLD
          There's a lot of extraneous movement out
          there.  Branches blowing, birds, back-
          ground movement.  It may take, ah, okay,
          count's finished.

Muldoon looks at Arnold anxiously.  Arnold looks down.

                            ARNOLD
          Hmmmm.  I don't see them.  Maybe they're
          out of range of a sensor.

                            MULDOON
          Shit.  I don't know where they are.  I
          wish I could go out there   But I haven't
          got anything to use on the Rex.  My
          rocket launcher's in the jeep Nedry
          stole.  And going out with a big gun in
          the dark would be suicide
.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - NIGHT

Brightly lit again.  Ellie performs tests with a centrifuge.  She looks
at Wu, who sits across from her in a high stool, stifling a yawn.

                            ELLIE
          Why don't you get some sleep, Dr. Wu?
          I'm just going to run a couple more tests
          and then I'm going to turn in myself.

Wu doesn't need to be told twice.  He climbs off his stool.

                            WU
          No point in everyone being exhausted.

He starts to leave.  He comes back and speaks consolingly at Ellie.

                            WU
          I'm sure Muldoon will find Dr. Grant as
          soon as there is light.

Ellie appreciates his effort, nods seriously, goes back to work.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


EXT  OCEAN - JUST BEFORE DAWN

Beautiful dark ocean.  The sky is a rich blue.  A morning star fades as
the sky lightens.  The Anne B is a small dot on the massive ocean.


INT  STATEROOM, ANNE B 
-

Eggs sit in the incubator.  A hand sprays them with foam.  Leaves.
CAMERA EXAMINES the eggs as the foam disperses.  More cracks.  One egg
jumps with a bolt from within.  It settles.  Jumps again.

                                                      CUT TO:

ESTABLISHING AERIAL - the primordial beauty of Isla Nublar at dawn.


EXT  VISITOR'S CENTER - DAWN

Muldoon drives out into the park in Harding's jeep.  THREE WORKERS
travel with him.  Each carries a rifle.


EXT  GRANT'S TREE - DAWN

CAMERA LOOK DOWN on Grant, Lex and Timmy still sleeping in the tree.  A
large shadow falls on their quiet faces.  Lex opens an eye. She SCREAMS.

Grant and Timmy wake up with a start.

THEIR POV - AS THE CAMERA LOOKS THROUGH THEIR LEGS AND TILTS UP right
into the huge face of A DUCK-BILLED HADROSAUR, a gigantic dinosaur with
cow eyes.  Its head moves up through the canopy of the trees.  Then the
head swoops way down below.  And returns to Grant's level and stares at
his shoe.

The hadrosaur tastes Grant's shoe.  The kids
 press tightly into Grant.

                            LEX
          He gonna eat us?

                            GRANT
          I don't think so.  She's a ...

                            GRANT AND TIMMY
          ... herbivore.

The hadrosaur HONKS.  Lex covers her ears.  Grant smiles and motions to
Lex.  He picks a big fruit off the tree and tosses it into the
hadrosaur's mouth.  CHOMP.  He feeds it again.  Lex and Timmy toss a few.

CHOMP!  CHOMP!  HONK!  HONK!

The hadrosaur's big head swoops way down, momentarily gone.

When she returns, all three quickly gather fruits and throw them into
her mouth.  The hadrosaur pulls back with her giant mouthful of fruit.
She pulls further and further back and then her huge head turns and
moves down.

Grant, Lex and Timmy strain to see through the branches.

THEIR POV - The hadrosaur is feeding four scampering, baby hadrosaurs.
Letting the fruit tumble from her mouth into theirs.  Lex YELLS:

                            LEX
          Come here, babies!  Get your b
reakfast!

The babies run to the base of the tree.  The kids toss fruits right down
to them.  Lex and Timmy climb lower to feed them right from their hands.

Grant and the mother hadrosaur stare at each other.  She sniffs his
foot.  He moves closer, straddling a branch.  He lifts up her lip and
examines her gums.

CLOSE ON - a ripped piece of fence stuck in her teeth.

Grant yanks it out.  He lets it drop to the ground.  He take a large
leaf and rubs her teeth with it.

CLOSE ON - her mouth as Grant's hand touches the side of her tongue.  He
sees little tiny bumps.

The hadrosaur lets out a low groan.   Grant is puzzled, rubs harder.

                            GRANT
          Like the trike.  Maybe it's not the stones.

HONK!   She pulls her mouth away.  The baby hadrosaurs turn to the
honking adult.  She is leaving quickly.  They follow quickly behind her.
The small herd leaves, casually trampling trees as they go.


EXT  BACK ROADS, PARK - MORNING

Muldoon and workers drive rapidly in the jeep.  Suddenly,
 Muldoon slams
on the brakes.

MULDOON'S POV - ABOUT TWENTY PROCOMPSOGNATHIDS (COMPYS), small chicken-
sized scavenging dinosaurs, scramble across the road.

                            MULDOON
          Where the hell are they going?

Muldoon watches them cross.  He thinks it over.  Spins the wheel and
follows them off the road.

                            MULDOON
          Let's see what's up.


EXT  BELOW THE TREE, PARK - MORNING

Timmy bravely jumps from a very low branch.  He smiles and looks at
Grant, who's already on the ground.  Grant looks off in the distance.

                            GRANT
          Tim, I think there's a motion sensor
          across the field and down there.

                            TIM
          Where's Lex?

ALONE IN THE BUSHES -  Lex kneels.  She holds a big fruit and calls:

                            LEX
          C'mere boy, c'mere.

She tosses the fruit.

CLOSE ON - the fruit rolling away.

Lex gets up and follows the rolling fruit.  She picks it up.

           
                 LEX
          It's very, very good.

She tosses it again.

                            LEX
          C'mere boy, c'mere.

Lex's eyes scan the bushes, then stop.  She smiles.

LEX'S POV - hidden in the brush, a baby triceratops' eye peeks at Lex.

Lex pushes the fruit closer.  The BABY TRICERATOPS comes out of the
brush, squeaking as it goes.  It nibbles the fruit.  Lex rolls another.

BACK ON GRANT AND TIM - They look around.  Timmy stops, mouth open, YELLS:

                            TIM
          Dr. Grant, Dr. Grant, look.

Grant turns, looks OFFSCREEN.  He's astonished by when he sees.

HIS POV - a row of shrubs, which Lex seems to soar above.  As a break in
the shrubs, it's clear that she's riding the baby triceratops.  Loving it.

                            LEX
          Whoa!

With a whoop, Grant and Timmy chase after Lex on her triceratops.

Lex rides through low brush, ducking down as she goes.  Then beneath the
tall trees as she enters the forest.  She crosses a stream on a log
b
ridge.  Light showers down through the branches.  The water shimmers.
Lex in is paradise.

Behind her, Grant and Timmy shout for her to stop.  She waves, kicks the
triceratops like it's a horse and YELLS:

                            LEX
          Giddyup!

The trike takes off, in a rush.  It trips over a fallen tree, downed by
the storm.  The trike takes a spill and Lex goes flying.

                            LEX
          Whoa!!  Take is easy!

She passes over the trike's head, in the air, and SCREAMS as she flies:

                            LEX
          I can't swim!

She SPLASHES into the stream.

Timmy, first to arrive on the scene, dives in heroically.  He comes up
sheepish and muddy - and sees Lex standing in a foot of water.

The baby dinosaur rolls to a stop, mowing down a patch of saplings as
she goes.  It stands up, dizzy and out of breath.

Timmy wipes mud off himself.  Grant helps the kids out of the water.
The baby triceratops follows them.  Grant yells to the baby trike.

                 
           GRANT
          Go home now.  Home to Freda!

                            LEX
          Oh, let him stay.  He likes me to ride
          him.  He could carry me instead of you,
          Dr. Grant.  Please, let him stay,

Grant shakes his head,

                            GRANT
          Go!  Go away.  Go!  Get out of here!

The trike whimpers and watches the three of them walk on.  Lex is
heartbroken.

                            LEX
          Will I ever play with him again?

Grant looks across the field, abundantly beautiful in the early morning.
He has to keep them going.   He points across the field.

                            GRANT
          We gotta get to that motion detector.
          It's still a ways.

Lex looks behind her.  In the distance, more hadrosaurs join the herd
eating from the tall trees.  Some cool off in a shallow lagoon.  They
drink, lowering their flat heads, meeting their own reflections in the
still water.  When they look up again, their heads swivel.  At the
water's 
edge, a baby hadrosaur ventures out, squeaks, and scrambles back
while the adults watch indulgently.


EXT  OFF ROAD, PARK - MORNING

Muldoon and his workers now follow the compys on foot.  The compys trail
off in different directions.  Muldoon and his workers break apart to
track the different groups.

A BEARDED WORKER follows his party of compys.  He looks ahead and sees a
small group stopped ahead.  Their heads are bent to the ground.

A BALD WORKER has reached another cluster of compys.  Kicking, he
scatters them.

Muldoon's tracking leads him to the equipment graveyard where Nedry was
lost.  He sees his stolen red jeep.  He rushes to it.  On the passenger
side still sits the rocket launcher.  He opens the door to retrieve it.
When he leans in, his eye catches the tilted side-view mirror.  The
image is of many compys bent over the ground.  He comes around, YELLING.

                            MULDOON
          I found Nedry!

In the distance, the call is ECHOED.

                            BEARDED WORKE
R (OFF)
          I found him!

                            BALD WORKER (OFF)
          Found him!


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DAY

Hammond peeks in the door and sees Gennaro, heavily bandaged, dozing on
the couch.  Gennaro's eyes flutter and Hammond enters and smiles.

                            HAMMOND
          He, Donald.  Glad you're awake.  I hope
          you're not going to take this little
          mishap you had and hold it against my
          park.  It would be terrible if the
          finishing funds were in any way held up.

Gennaro just grins and shakes his head.  He's very high on morphine.  He
wants to speak but Hammond keeps talking.  After each sentence, Gennaro
enthusiastically agrees with a nod.

                            HAMMOND
          You really shouldn't have gotten out of
          the vehicle.  The park is actually quite
          safe.  A disenchanted worker sabotaged
          some equipment.  Arnold, Muldoon, and Wu,
          all loyal employees, are righting damage
    
      as we speak.

                            GENNARO
          Oh good, 'cause I love the park!  It's
          more than we ever dreamed!  Those
          brachiosaurs are so big!  And those
          Spitters -
              (he spits)
          - incredible!  I only have one problem.
          Aren't we going to have pterodactyls?
              (he frowns, smacks his forehead)
          Oh, they'd fly away!

Gennaro looks off, watching the imaginary pterodactyls fly away.
Hammond takes out a bag.

                            HAMMOND
          Take a look at these, Donald.  Have you
          seen these?  These are great.

Hammond dumps things out of the bag.  They are souvenirs of the park.

                            HAMMOND
          Wind-up toys.  Spitter umbrellas.

Gennaro is thrilled.

                            HAMMOND
          I got some great t-shirts.  Dinosaur
          bingo, hey ...

Hammond leans closer.

                            HAMMOND
          Wu says he can make a foot high
    
      triceratops.  We'll sell pets as living
          souvenirs.  Bio-engineered to eat only
          food we sell, of course.

Gennaro can't take it.  Great idea!  He high-fives Hammond repeatedly.

Harding enters and gently taps Hammond on the shoulder.

                            HARDING
          You'll have to bear with him, Mr. Hammond.
          He's doped to infinity and back.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - DAY

Sunlight pours through the windows.  Ellie sits with her head in hands.
She looks around and wanders the lab.  Notices a drawer, slides it open.

X-rays.  She shuffles through, finds some marked: FREDA.

Ellie snaps on a viewing light at her lab station.  She studies the X-
ray.  She looks up in surprise.   Studies it again.

The viewing light is snapped off.  Ellie looks again.  Wu stands there.

                            WU
          Who gave you permission -

Ellie attacks back.

                            ELLIE
          I'm here to investigate this park. And
          there's
 plenty you haven't told me.

                            WU
          That's absurd.

                            ELLIE
          These bones aren't fully formed.

                            WU
          You're qualified to interpret x-rays of
          living dinosaurs?  I doubt it.  It took
          me many months to learn.

                            Y
          I'll tell you something else, Freda isn't
          an adult, just a huge juvenile.

                            WU
          You're making a lot of assumptions here.

                            ELLIE
          Right.  What the hell is going on, Wu?

They stare at each other in the bright sunlight.

                            HAMMOND (OFF)
          Growth hormones.

The two swing around.  Hammond stands in the sharp shadows of the room.

                            WU
          She didn't have a right to explore my lab.

                            HAMMOND
          Let's not argue, Wu, we have a serious
          problem.
              (to 
Ellie)
          These animals don't last.  There is a
          regularity, a predictability about when
          they die.  It's always ... very young.
          We don't know why.  Given time, I'm sure
          Wu will figure it out.  It's just ...

                            WU
          Just some adjustment in the code is
          required.

                            HAMMOND
          But there are deadlines.  The park opens
          next summer. And it requires full-grown
          specimens.  So Wu uses growth hormones to
          achieve the desired size in a short
          amount of time.  But they all keep dying
          and we don't know how to stop it.

Ellie and Wu stare at Hammond.  He steps forward.  The light is so hot
behind him that his appearance is like an apparition.

                            HAMMOND
          I was going to tell you all this myself,
          Dr. Sattler, after Gennaro stopped
          breathing down my neck.  That's why I
          wanted you and Dr. Grant 
here on my
          island - you have to help me keep the
          dinosaurs alive.  Won't you please help
          me?

                                                      CUT TO:

IN THE SKY, the sun momentarily burns through the clouds -


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DAY


Ellie enters.  On the couch, Gennaro snores lightly.  In a chair nearby
Harding sleeps, a roll of gauze grasped in his hands.

Ellie walks over to the large model of the park that Hammond revealed.
She looks at the miniature dinosaurs that sit in different sectors of
the park.  She picks up the plastic Rex, examines it, drops it back in.

She brushes by Harding and studies Gennaro's pasty, sleeping face.  Air
blows in and out of his dry lips.  She examines the gauze wrapped around
his wounded leg.  It seeps with blood.


INT CONTROL - DAY

Arnold works at his console.  Hammond and Wu lean over his shoulder.
Ellie bursts in, very agitated.  Hammond looks up.

                            ELLIE
          Gennaro's losing a lot of blood. 
 He
          needs transfusions.  We gotta get a
          rescue helicopter.  Arnold, what's with
          the phones?

                            ARNOLD
          Ah hell. I just can't find it.

He sips his coffee and stares bleary-eyed at the screen.

                            ELLIE
          Find what?

                            ARNOLD
          Nedry jammed all the communication lines.
          He inserted some command, a lockout into
          the program code.  I can't find it,
          because I gave that restore command and
          it erased part of the program listings.

                            WU
          So?  Just reset - shut the system down
          and you'll clear the memory.  Everything
          will be in the normal wakeup mode.

                            ARNOLD
          Shut the system down?

                            WU
          And reset.

                            ARNOLD
          I've never done that before.  And I'm
          reluctant to do it.  Maybe it's tr
ue, all
          systems will come on, but maybe they won't.

                            ELLIE
          Look, there is a sick man here who needs
          medical attention or he'll die.  Four
          people are out there, missing in your
          park.  We need search teams.  We have to
          have a phone or radio.

Arnold still hesitates.

                            ELLIE
          Well?

                            ARNOLD
          Well, it's just that the safety systems
          don't function with the computer shut
          down and -

Ellie boils over.

                            ELLIE
          - turn the goddamn safety systems off!
          Can't you get it through your head that
          we have no choice?

Arnold looks at Hammond, who now stares out into the park.  Without
turning, Hammond nods his consent.

                            ARNOLD
          Okay.

Arnold gets up and goes to the main panel.  He opens the doors and
uncovers the metal swing-latches over the safety switches. 
 He pops them
off, one after another.

                            ARNOLD
          You asked for it.  And you got it.

He throws the master switch.

The control room goes black.  All monitors go black.  Arnold, Wu and
Ellie stand in the dark.

                            ELLIE
          How long do we have to wait?

                            ARNOLD
          Thirty seconds.


EXT  FIELD IN THE PARK -

Grant and kids walk through a clearing.  Lex stops.

                            GRANT
          What is it?

                            LEX
          I hear something.

                            GRANT
          Come on.

Timmy looks around. The morning is still and peaceful. Branches are
motionless.  Only a little bird jumps from one branch to another.

                            LEX
          Hear it now?

                            TIMMY
          You're hearing things.  Come on, we gotta
          get back and warn them about the boat.

Lex hesitates but doesn't want to be left behind.  She runs betw
een
Grant and Timmy.  Then they all hear it.

HONKING.  It comes from the herd of duck bills behind them.  First the
honking of a single animal, then another animal joins in, then another
and another, until the whole herd has taken up the honking cry.

                            TIMMY
          What's going on?

                            GRANT
          They're agitated.

The duckbills twist and turn.  They hurry out of the water, circling the
young ones to protect them.

With a ROAR, the T-Rex bursts from the trees, just a hundred yards away
straight toward the hadrosaurs.

                            LEX
          I told you I heard something!

The earth SHAKES.  A low rumble is heard and felt as the hadrosaurs begin
to run  in a parallel direction to the course of Grant and the kids.

                            GRANT
          Outta the way, kids! Run!

Grant grabs Lex, lifting her bodily off the ground, and carries her like
a football.  Timmy runs beside them.

Hadrosaurs run alongside of them.  Grant
 hears the crashing of trees.
He takes a glance over his shoulder.

GRANT'S POV - a flurry of flamingos takes flight and spooks the herd
into changing direction.  The hadrosaurs swerve and charge right into
the path of Grant, Lex and Timmy.  They all SCREAM.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

The quiet black room.  Hammond stands by the big window.  His pensive
presence affects all in the room.

Arnold looks at his illuminated watch.

                            ARNOLD
          Memory should be cleared by now.

He pushes the main switch back on.  Nothing on.

                            ARNOLD
          Damn.

Arnold pushes the switch off and then on again.  Still nothing.  He
glances at Hammond's back.  Sweat forms on his brow.

                            ELLIE
          What's wrong?

                            ARNOLD
          Oh hell!  I have to turn the safety switches
          back on before I restart the power.

Arnold flips on three safeties, and covers them again with latch covers.
Holding his breath, he
 turns on the main power switch.

First, there is the computer beep.  Ellie jumps.  Then relaxes.  The
lights come on.  The screens hum.  Hammond's shoulder twitches slightly.

                            ARNOLD
          Thank God!

The room is jubilant.  Hugs and cheers.  Ellie picks up a phone.

                            ELLIE
          Arnold!  They're still not working.

                            ARNOLD
          No, it sounds dead but after a reset, all
          system modules have to be brought on line
          manually.

Arnold quickly goes back to work at his console.  Hammond turns.

                            WU
              (to Hammond)
          Arnold's about to get the phones up.

Arnold pushes the chair back.

                            ARNOLD
          Okay, we're up again!

Ellie grabs the phone back up.

                            ELLIE
          No we're not.  Phones still dead.

Arnold swings her way.

                            ARNOLD
          Can't be -

                    
        HAMMOND
          My God, look at this, Arnold.

Hammond points to the transparent map.  A tight cluster of dots by the
lagoon move in a coordinated way.  Moving fast, in a kind of swirl.

                            ELLIE
          What's happening?

                            ARNOLD
              (tonelessly)
          The duckbills.

                            WU
          My good God.

                            ELLIE
          What?

                            ARNOLD
          It's the Rex ...

                            HAMMOND
          They've stampeded ...


BACK ON  THE HADROSAURS - LOW ANGLE ON THE STAMPEDE -

Grant and kids run for their lives.  Behind them the duckbills charge
with surprising speed.  Their enormous bodies charge in a tight group,
kicking up dirt, rocks, whole trees as they thunder along.

CLOSE ON - a charging duckbill as he HONKS, eyes wild with fear.

A horrible ROAR of the T-Rex sends a duckbill infant squealing and
struggling to stay out from underfoot.

CLOSE ON
 - A huge adult foot almost tramples the infant.

Frightened and confused the infant scampers even deeper into the
maelstrom.  The frenzied herd raises a great cloud of yellow dust.

GRANT AND LEX AND TIMMY run wildly.  The stampede is very close behind
Grant and the kid's faces are covered with sweat and dust.

Another deafening ROAR of the T-Rex.

Grant leads them toward a rocky outcrop with a stand of big conifers.
The animals continue to close.

CLOSE ON - the running feet of the stampeding animals.  The ground
VIBRATES every time it is struck by the huge feet.

GRANT AND THE KIDS scramble onto the rocks.  They frantically tuck in
between big boulders as the the herd reaches them.  Lex shields her
dusty face with her hands as she wedges deeper between the rocks.  Grant
pushes her down deeper and looks up from between the rocks.

GRANT'S POV - the immense legs of the first hadrosaur to pass.  Another
slams its big tail against the rocks, leaving a splash of hot blood.

Stampeding legs send clods of dirt fl
ying in the air.  Above, even the
birds are running.  Disoriented, they fly frantically along.

GRANT AND THE KIDS are enveloped in dust.  Just shadows of huge bodies
with giant limbs.  BELLOWS of pain as animals wheel and circle.

A boulder is dislodged and it rolls toward Timmy.  He dives out of his
rocky hiding place.  The boulder continues on toward Grant and Lex.
They dive after Timmy.  The group buries itself anew in a group of thick
roots tangled amidst smaller rocks.  The boulder continues on, SMASHING
the rocky enclave they have just left.

Grant and the kids huddle and watch the last under-bellies oscillate
above them.  The stampede goes past.  They lie there, unable to move.
They watch the herd trample on.


CLOSE ON - The Rex's foot as it crushes a motion sensor.

Lex SCREAMS.  Grant and Timmy cover her mouth.

The T-Rex hunts down the herd.  He targets his prey.  A young hadrosaur.

As the hadrosaur gallops into the shadowy treeline, the Rex lunges
fiercely.  The Rex and its victim are enveloped 
in dust.

Grant holds Lex close.  She watches the terrible cloud with a quiet
horror.  Timmy makes the first move to leave.

                            TIMMY
          Let's go.  Now!

The herd's remainder gallops off into the safety of the deep jungle.

Grant, Lex and Timmy run in the opposite direction.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

Hammond, Arnold, Wu, and Ellie watch the monitor as the dust slowly
clears.  Hadrosaurs scatter.

Now the Rex is calm and quiet.  BACK TO CAMERA, he gnaws on something.

                            HAMMOND
          No!  Oh no!  He make a kill.  He killed
          one of my animals!  Where's Muldoon?

                            ARNOLD
          I'm sorry, Mr. Hammond.

                            HAMMOND
          My animals!  My animals!

Muldoon enters, limping in.  Hammond is very upset.

                            HAMMOND
          Where have you been?  My Rex killed a
          hadrosaur.  You should be out there,
          doing something.

                            MUL
DOON
          I just came to tell you - you're minus
          one computer expert.


EXT  BY THE RIVER, PARK - DAY

The water rushes a few hundred yards away.  Grant and the kids have
finally rested enough.  Grant nods to Timmy.

                            GRANT
          We'll walk by the river.  That leads back
          to the Visitor's center.

                            LEX
          Not me.  I'm not walking anymore.

                            TIMMY
          Come on Lex, I'll carry you.

                            LEX
          Nope.  Too scared.

Timmy looks up at Grant.  Grant kneels down by Lex.  Lex embraces Grant.

                            GRANT
          You ready?

She wipes her tears.

                            LEX
          Can we go on the raft?  Then we don't
          have to walk so close to the animals!

                            GRANT
          What raft?

Lex points to a low concrete maintenance building with bars.  It is
twenty yards away.

                            LEX

          Where I found Freda's baby.

Grant start to stand.  He's thinking.

                            GRANT
          It's still mid-morning.  I bet we have at
          least ten miles to go.  If we take the
          raft along the river, we can make much
          faster progress.

                            TIMMY
          Let's do it.


INT  MAINTENANCE BUILDING -

Grant stumbles deep in the gloomy recesses of the building.  He pushes
past drums of herbicide, tree-pruning equipment, spare tires, coils of
cyclone fencing, huge fertilizer bags, stacks of ceramic insulators,
empty motor-oil cans, work-lights and cables.

                            GRANT
          Lex, I don't see any raft.

Timmy looks at Lex.  Where is it?  Lex doesn't know.

                            TIMMY
          Keep going.

Grant keeps pushing through bags of cement, lengths of copper pipe,
piles of green mesh.  Two plastic oars hang on the concrete wall.

                            GRANT
          Bullseye!

Timmy is reliev
ed.  Lex smiles.

                            LEX
          Told you!

Grant grabs them.  Looks around, still -

                            GRANT
          No raft. Where did you see it, Lex?

                            LEX
          Actually, I never really saw one. Just
          assumed.

                            GRANT
          Assumed?

She nods.  Grant and Timmy resume looking.

IN THE REAR OF THE BUILDING - Lex walks below a barred window.  Slats of
light fall on her back.  She sees a dark closet door ajar.  She brushes
the handle.  It swings opens and two bright orange life preservers fall
on her, knocking her to the ground.

LEX SCREAMS, frantically pushing the life preservers off.

Grant's head pops up.  Timmy runs to her side.  She is wrestling
irrationally with the life preservers.  Timmy drops to the ground.

                            TIMMY
          Lex!  Lex!  You're okay, you're okay!

Lex is overcome with fear.  Timmy grabs a preservers and puts it on.

                            TIMM
Y
          Look, Lex!  Look!

She looks at him, realizes, and bursts out laughing.  Timmy laughs with
her.  Grant joins them.  He sits on a box and laughs.

                            GRANT
          I'm afraid there's no raft.

Grant gets up.  He reaches for the hands of the kids.  Timmy sees it -
the box Grant sat on is labeled: RAFT STORAGE.  Timmy smiles..


AT THE RIVER'S EDGE -

Grant pulls a cord.

With a LOUD HISS, the rubber begins to expand uncontrollably, jerking
and jumping like a wild marionette.  Then, with a whopping HISS-WHAP! it
pops fully open on the deck: a large bright yellow rubber raft.

Timmy and Lex climb in, wearing the life preservers.  Grant gets in and
pushes off with his oars.

The small disturbance causes the cicadas to ROAR.  The raft drifts out
into the lagoon.  Grant fixes his oars into the oarlocks.

Grant surveys the river.

                            GRANT
          Looks pretty calm.

THUMP.  The raft stops moving.  They are aground.  Lex looks overboard.
She reaches in
 about elbow deep.

Grant stands and puts the oars in the water.  He pushes with all his
might.  There is a long scraping sound of the raft against the mud
floor.  But it moves.  And the raft goes into deep enough water.

A general sigh of relief as they gently float downstream.


A WIDE AREA OF THE RIVER -

Grant energetically works the oars.

CLOSE ON - Lex lets her hand trail in the water.

                            LEX
          I'll row, Dr. Grant.

                            GRANT
          No.

But he's sweating and takes a moment to rest.  Lex looks down at her
hand in the water.  It still trails.

                            LEX
          Hey, we're still moving.

Grant looks into the water.  She's right.

                            GRANT
          There's a current.

Grant lays back against the rubber gunwales, closes his eyes.  The two
kids look at him.

                            LEX
          You can't sleep.

                            GRANT
              (eyes closed)
          I'm not sl
eeping... yet.

                            LEX
          I'll do it!

Lex picks up the oars and begins.

                            TIMMY
          We gotta warn them about the boat.

Grant opens one eye and looks up at the sun in the sky.  He sighs and
takes up the oars again.  He rows powerfully with the current.


A BEND IN THE RIVER -

Current picks up speed.  The water begins to rush and ROAR.

                            TIMMY
          Cool!

White foam crashes on the raft and sprays the kids.  They burst out
laughing.  Grant smiles at them, but there is concern in his eyes.


ANOTHER BEND -

Now the raft is really racing.  The kids hold on tightly as the raft is
rocked.  White water crashed over, drenching the kids.  When Grant takes
a moment to look, he is soaked by a huge wave.

The raft tosses right and left.  Timmy holds the rubber grips.  He's
yanked to one side.  He's knocked to the raft floor.  Quickly gets his
grip again.  SHOUTS to Grant.

                            TIMMY
          Thought
 is looked calm?

                            GRANT
          Guess I was wrong.

Grant looks ahead.  The river widens.  The raft really starts to fly.

Lex, gripping very tightly, looks out.  Water sprays her again and
again.  Her face is serious.

                            LEX
          I can't swim!

Grant grabs the raft's tie line and pulls it out of its rubber rings.
He lashes it around Lex and Timmy.  Then he ties it around one of the
rubber grips.

                            GRANT
          Hold on real tight.

They go flying down the river.  The ROAR deafens.

The raft lifts out of the water.  And crashes down, rocking every way.

Jagged rocks appear.  Grant uses his paddle as a club to push off the
rocks and the rushing shoreline.  The kids duck from sudden overhanging
trees.

Grant looks ahead.  He blanches.

HIS POV - the surging edge of a tumultuous waterfall.

They're almost there.  At the huge waterfall, water rushes violently,
heaving over the magnificent precipice.

Timmy tries to tighten L
ex's vest but is thrown back down .  He YELLS:

                            TIMMY
          Hold my hand.  Hold my hand when we go.

The raft spins in the rushing water.  Everyone is thrown around.

The rope holding the kids to the raft tautens. The oars are wrestled out
of Grant's hands and go flying through the air, spilling over the edge.

At the last moment, Grant spots a tree branch arching over the cascade.
With all his might, he stands and holds his balance long enough. to let
his hands smash into the overhanging branch.

They stop right at the waterfall's edge.

Grant struggles mightily to hold onto the branch.  But the water keeps
rushing.  His strength ebbs.

                            TIMMY
          Don't let go!

Grant's veins pop out in his arms.  His hands start to slip off the wet
tree bark.  Lex watches his hands slowly lose their grip.

The rubber raft jumps and leaps below him.  Water pours into the raft.
Lex tries fruitlessly to let it out.  Timmy holds down Grant's feet.

               
             TIMMY
          You can do it!

                            GRANT
          I'm trying.  I'm trying ... Ooooo!!! ....

His hands slipping, slipping ...

                            GRANT
          No!!!!!

                                                      CUT TO:

CLOSE ON - The T-Rex, face down in the mud.


INT  CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON

Arnold, Wu, Muldoon, and Ellie stare raptly at the monitor.

                            MULDOON
          Son-of-a-bitch.  He's taking a nap.
          Hasn't been this well fed ... ever.

Hammond is above, in his throne.  He calls down:

                            HAMMOND
          Could he drown in that position?  That's
          a very valuable animal.

                            MULDOON
          I know it's a valuable animal.

Muldoon takes a step up toward Hammond's throne and the two argue
quietly back and forth.  In the foreground, Wu calls Arnold over.

                            WU
          What's that, John?

Wu points to the screen behind 
Arnold's head.  In the upper right-hand
corner, it blinks a yellow warning:  AUX PWR LOW!  Ellie regards it.

                            ELLIE
          You running on auxiliary power?

                            ARNOLD
          I'm not.

                            WU
          Looks like you are.

                            ARNOLD
          Can't be.

                            WU
          Print the system status log.

Arnold nods and rapidly strikes keys.  In the corner, a printer whirs to
life.  Moments later, it spins out a single page.  Arnold tears it off.

Ellie continues to stare at the screen.  It now flashes red:  AUX PWR
FAIL!  An alarm klaxon BLARES.

Hammond holds his ears against the noise.  He stands up.

The room lights begin to FLASH.  They're reflected in Hammond's eyes.
Hammond ROARS above the chaos.

                            HAMMOND
          What the hell is going on?

Onscreen, numbers begin to count backward from ten.  Hammond lurches.
At zero, the lights go off, the monitors,
 even the computer.  Just the
alarms keep screaming.

                            HAMMOND
          You're ruining my ordered, precise park!

Arnold ignores him, keeps pressing buttons.  Hammond rushes toward
Arnold.  Arnold looks over his shoulder in surprise.  Hammond SCREAMS.

                            HAMMOND
          Fix my park, Arnold!  Fix it!

Arnold crosses his hands in front of his face, blocking Hammond's
attack.  Hammond grabs Arnold's wrists and the two twirl to the ground.
Breathing heavily, Hammond clutches his hand to his own chest.

Arnold stands up, brushes off.  He puts himself together, looks at
Hammond.  He SHOUTS over the siren:

                            ARNOLD
          I know it's hard, I know it's hard, but
          I'm going to put it all back together for
          you - I promise.  I will


BACK ON RAFT AT WATERFALL -

Grant still clings to the overhanging branch, holding the raft from
toppling over the crashing waterfall.  Lex and Timmy hold onto his legs.

The ROAR of the
 water diminishes.  And the flow subsides from a raging
current to a rolling river.  And then to a gentle stream.  A trickle.
Nothing.

Grant slowly relaxes, lets go.  So do the children.  Around the raft,
the water level begins to drain.  Gradually, Grant and the kids are left
in the raft sitting in just a few puddles of water.  Around them,
various pumps and other equipment is exposed where it was once covered
by rushing white water.

                            LEX
          The waterfall stopped.

                            TIMMY
          Waterfalls aren't supposed to stop.

                            GRANT
          I think they cut the power.  Hey -

He points and the three of them look over the edge where the waterfall
once poured.  There's a shimmering rainbow and beyond that, in the mist
is the visitor's center.

                            GRANT
          Well, there's our pot of gold.  Let's go,
          kids.

They grab his hands and clamber out of the raft, running toward shore.


BACK ON CON
TROL ROOM -

Muldoon pulls open the blinds and the hot sun filters in, so the room is
alternate patches of bright and dark.

In a hot corner, Ellie squats over a prostate Hammond, mopping his brow
with a cool cloth.  He murmurs, only barely intelligible.

                            HAMMOND
          Told him, fix my park, fix my park.

Wu brings the printout to Arnold.  The printout is a chronological
rendering of control room events since the restart.  It is clear they
have been running on auxiliary power.  Wu yells above the alarm:

                            WU
          You shut down as six thirty-four this
          morning, and when you started back up, it
          was with auxiliary power.

                            ARNOLD
          Jesus.  The auxiliary generator fires up
          first and then that's used to start the
          main generator because it needs a heavy
          charge.  The main generator has to be
          manually reset.

                            WU
          Outside?  In
 the generator building?

Arnold nods.  Muldoon points to a line in the printout:

06:35:22   WARNING: FENCE STATUS (NB)  OPERATIVE - AUX POWER

                            MULDOON
          This doesn't mean the fences have been
          off since six-thirty, does it?

Arnold grabs the paper, looks at it, slams it down.

                            ARNOLD
          Backup power doesn't generate enough
          amperage to power the electrified fences,
          so they were automatically kept off.
          That's also why we had no phones or
          radio.

                            MULDOON
          All of the fences?

                            ARNOLD
          Yes.

                            MULDOON
          Including the velociraptor mesh?

                            ARNOLD
              (disgusted, exhausted)
          Yes, yes, yes.

In the corner, Hammond lifts his head and Ellie gently helps him to a
sitting position.

                            HAMMOND
          Do you mean those raptor
s could be loose?

                            ARNOLD
          I'm afraid so.

                            MULDOON
          No, no way.  Last time, it took 'em two
          days to chew through that mesh.  But give
          'em enough time, they'll get out.  We
          better get that power on now.

                            HAMMOND
          Regardless, check the pit.  Make sure
          there' five of them there.


EXT  VISITOR'S CENTER - AFTERNOON

Muldoon and Arnold run across the lawn.  Muldoon carries his rocket
launcher at a ready position.  In the distance, the alarm still SOUNDS,
lights FLASH a continued warning.

They reach the maintenance building where the generator is housed.  Its
familiar him has been replaced by its own alarms.  The closer they
approach, the louder and brighter these alarms are.  Grey steam pours
out of the vents of the building, obscuring everything.

                            ARNOLD
          What's that steam coming out of my
          generator room?

           
                 MULDOON
          Relax, it's just refrigerated air.
          There's a leaky cooling pipe.  I fixed it
          a couple times before but the original
          installation was at too sharp an angle.

Arnold accepts this.  He is about to enter when Muldoon instructs him.

                            MULDOON
          Just go and turn on your generator, then
          get right back to the control room.

Arnold lights a cigarette and disappears into the steam-shrouded door.


EXT  RAPTOR PIT - AFTERNOON

Muldoon inspects an extremely discouraging sight.  The thick mesh that
covered the pit has been chewed through and ripped open.  With heavy gun
in one hand, Muldoon shines his flashlight into the pit.  It's empty.

Muldoon looks up.

MULDOON'S POV - the dense forest surrounding the Visitor's Center.

Muldoon examines the ground.  He locates the raptor prints leading away

Muldoon breaks into a run.


INT/EXT  GENERATOR ROOM - AFTERNOON

Muldoon comes back to the generator room still runnin
g full-tilt.  He
kicks open the door.  Steam pours out.  Standing in the thick steam,
Muldoon yells for Arnold.  No answer.  He steps in the doorway and
shines his flashlight around.

MULDOON'S POV - Only the dark abstract shapes of rakes and coiled ropes
and small machinery can be seen in the steam.

Muldoon yells again.  No answer at all.  Muldoon curses and leaves.

As soon as Muldoon is gone, there is movement.  Even above the sirens,
an animalistic breathing, grunting can be heard.  Obscured by steam and
flashing lights, a reptilian claw clutches a shadow.  A pack of
cigarettes falls to the ground, spilling out on the floor.


INT  CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON

Muldoon enters and confronts Hammond, Ellie, and Wu,

                            MULDOON
          Raptors chewed their way out.  All five
          are out there.

                            ELLIE
          Arnold's not with you?

Muldoon looks around grimly.  He shakes his head.

                            MULDOON
          I was hoping he was ba
ck here already.

Hammond takes charge.

                            HAMMOND
          This is why my quarters were specially
          fortified.  To assist in an emergency just
          like this one.  Let's go.  Muldoon, round
          up the workers.  They'll go with us too.

Muldoon stares at Hammond, then drops it.  They prepare to go.

                            ELLIE
          Wait.  What about Arnold?


EXT  HILLSIDE, PARK -

Grant and the kids come over the hill.  Timmy sees the big fence and the
Visitor's Center close behind.

                            TIMMY
          We're home!

Lex and Grant happily run down the hill.


EXT  ELECTRIFIED FENCE IN PARK - AFTERNOON

Grant and the kids stand in the long shadows of the electric fence.
This huge fence is much higher than what Timmy has had to climb.  Grant
turns to him apologetically.

                            GRANT
          Sorry, Tim.  We gotta climb up.

                            TIM
          That's all right, Dr. Grant.  You owe me
   
       one.


EXT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - AFTERNOON

Wu stands at the open sliding gate of the perimeter fence surrounding
Hammond's quarters..  Next to him is Ellie.  Behind both of them,
launcher at the ready, is Muldoon.  Watching from the window above,
Hammond waves.  Ellie and Wu wear radio headsets.

                            MULDOON
          Okay Wu, I'll have you covered at every
          moment.  But this shell carries quite a
          punch, so if you're too close, it'll take
          a piece of you.  Ellie's on the headset
          with you.  If another ones come at you,
          let her know.  Then Ellie - you start
          jumping and yelling.  The buggers are
          easily distracted.  They'll come running
          and let Wu get that power on.  Then both
          of you, get behind this fence as quick as
          possible.

Wu and Ellie nod seriously and test radio contact.  We starts his way
across the lawn, Muldoon limps behind with his launcher.  Ellie stands
ready at the open 
gate.

Wu takes slow steps.  Muldoon follows.  Wu is just five feet away from
the door to the generator building.

CLOSE ON - Wu's tense face.

THE ATTACK is sudden and fierce.  It comes from the brush.  The raptor
leaps onto Wu in an instant.  Wu and the raptor roll on the ground.  Wu
struggles for his life.  Muldoon can't get a safe shot.  He SCREAM:

                            MULDOON
          Wu, get away.  Give me room to shoot.

Ellie comes running away from the safety of the gate.  She jumps up and
down, waving her hands, and SCREAMS:

                            ELLIE
          Hey you cretaceous dromaeosaur, you can't
          catch me.  Hey, come and get me, you
          flat-snouted Mongolian beast.  Hey!

The Raptor is distracted by this.  He lets Wu go for a moment, shaking
him loose from his bloody jaws.  Instantly, Wu rolls away.  Muldoon
fires the rocket launcher.  With a SIZZLE, the missile fires.  BOOM!
Direct hit!  The raptor is blown to tiny pieces.

Muldoon grabs Wu and pulls the inju
red man to safety.

                            MULDOON
          You ok?

In reply Wu gets to his feet, looks where the Raptor was.

                            WU
          Now, there's four.

Muldoon helps Wu back inside the fence.  He waves for Ellie to come in
and join them.

Ellie takes off toward the generator building.  She YELLS:

                            ELLIE
          I'm going in.  Muldoon, cover the door
          after I go in.  Wu, guide me!

Muldoon yells for her to wait but stops when he realizes that this may
be their best plan.

Ellie races like a gazelle across the open lawn.  She's very fast and
graceful.  She ducks into the generator building.

Above it all, Hammond watches at the small viewing window.


BACK ON - GRANT AND KIDS AT FENCE

The three are at the top of the fence now.  Grant carefully lifts Lex
above the barbed wire and she grabs onto the other side of the fence to
begin the climb down.  Grant grabs Tim and lifts him next.  Tim's tense
face is a river of sweat.


INT  GE
NERATOR BUILDING -

Ellie finishes the stairs and feels her way along the basement wall.
Her face is lit by a flashing yellow light.  She bangs her head on a
pipe.  She rubs her head.

                            ELLIE
          Damn, I banged my head.

                            WU (OVER RADIO)
          Oh that's good, that must be the water
          pipe.  You're really close now, there's a
          cabinet just above your head.  Reach up
          and open it.  The handle turns to the
          left.

Ellie turns the handle.  The cabinet opens.

                            WU (OVER RADIO)
          It's a large throw-switch.  Pull it down,
          count to three, and push it back up.
          That's all there is to it.

Ellie throws it down.  She counts:

                            ELLIE
          One -


BACK ON GRANT AND KIDS -

Just a few feet from the bottom of the fence.


BACK ON ELLIE -

                            ELLIE
          Two -


BACK ON GRANT AND KIDS -

Grant and Timmy jump down. 
 Lex is just behind.  Her sneaker catches in
the fence pattern.  She pulls on it.


BACK ON ELLIE -

                            ELLIE
          Three!

She throws the large switch back.


BACK ON LEX -

She jumps off the fence.  Her sneaker comes off, falls to the ground.

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON LEX - it celebrates her narrow escape.

Grant casually leans against the fence to help Lex with her shoe.
NOTHING!  STILL NO ELECTRIC FENCES!

The Visitor's Center is in sight.  They all turn to each other.  Elated.

                            LEX
          We did it!

                            TIM
          We made it!

Lex jumps up and down.  Grant smiles, high-fives Timmy.


BACK ON ELLIE -

The siren and the flashing lights stop.  The room lights go on.  Ellie
turns to go back upstairs.  Her foot slips, she falls to the ground.
She has slipped on a pool of blood.  She jumps up, recoils.

It's Arnold.  She squelches a SCREAM, covering her own mouth.

SMASH!  Ellie SCREAMS as a raptor lunges at her.   He jumps down
 from
above the water pipe Ellie banged her head on.

Ellie turns and races toward a ventilation shaft.  She dives into it.
The raptor gets there a second late and smashes against the shaft wall.

Ellie pushes herself against the shaft wall and, using her legs to push
against the wall, begins to climb up.

The raptor smashes against the shaft again and gets inside.  Ellie
scrambles up.  The raptor snarls and spits but it is momentarily pinned.

Ellie continues her scramble up the shaft.  At ground level, she slams
her feet hard against a vent, popping it open.  Scraping the wall and
banging against pipes, she races toward the door.


EXT  GENERATOR BUILDING - CONTINUING ACTION

Ellie runs full-tilt toward the fence surrounding Hammond's quarters.
Wu, injured, lies within the safety of the fenced area.  Muldoon stands
with his rocket launcher just outside the fence waiting for Ellie.
Ellie screams to him as she speeds across the lawn.

                            ELLIE
          Raptor!

The raptor EXPLODES th
rough the door of the generator building after
Ellie.

Muldoon fires at the raptor. Misses.  No time to reload.

The raptor gains on Ellie.  Muldoon ducks inside the fence's heavy gate.
He slides the gate half-shut, waving Ellie on.

Ellie dives inside the safety of the fence, losing her headset as she
goes.  The gate is almost closed.  The raptor lunges.

Muldoon slides shut the heavy gate, bashing the raptor's head with all
his might.  The raptor shudders, caught in the gate.  Stunned, for a
second, it doesn't move.

Ellie and Muldoon run to the building.  They push open the steel-clad
security door and dive inside.  Wu limping, chases after them.  With a
curse, Muldoon pushes the door back open, waves for Wu.

ELLIE AND MULDOON'S POV - Wu runs frantically.  The raptor jerks out of
the gate, inside of the fence.  He races after Wu.

                            WU
          Keep it open!  I'm coming!

Wu runs faster.  The raptor gains on him.  Wu screams, runs spastically.
Wu and the raptor are neck-and-neck
, equally close to the open door.

                            ELLIE
          Come on, Wu!  Come on!  Run!

The raptor is inches from Wu.  Both are closer and closer to the door.

                            ELLIE
          They're coming inside!

                            WU
          Help!

Wu and the raptor are at the door.

                            MULDOON
          No they're not, Ellie.

Muldoon slams the door shut on Wu and the raptor.  Wu's screams are
horrific.


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - CONTINUING ACTION

Ellie drops to her knees, her chest heaving, pulls her headset off with
a bleeding hand.  Muldoon, affected, turns to her.

                            MULDOON
          I couldn't compromise everyone's safety.

Ellie nods, catches her breath.

                            ELLIE
          Why didn't the power go on?

                            MULDOON
          You just reset the power.  Now the
          computer has to be booted.

Muldoon looks out the tiny barred window of the security do
or.

MULDOON'S POV - There is already almost no sign of Wu.  The gate to the
perimeter fence slides shut.  The raptor looks up.  He is trapped within
the perimeter fence of Hammond's quarters.

CAMERA SLOWLY TILTS to the viewing window above.  Hammond stares down.


INT  VISITOR'S CENTER -

Grant and kids walk through the open security doors.  All is empty and
quiet.  They call out but there are no answers.

                            LEX
          Where did everybody go?

Grant thinks.

                            GRANT
          Probably your grandfather's quarters.
          Let's go.

A DISTANT BELLOW.  Grant reconsiders.

                            GRANT
          Actually, stay here.

He corrals the kids into the half completed enclosure of the Gift Shop.

                            LEX
          No, I want to stay with you.

Grant looks around tensely.

                            GRANT
          No, keep an eye on things round here for
          me.  I'll be back with the others.

                 
           TIMMY
          What about -

Grant looks at Timmy.

                            GRANT
          I'll radio the ship as soon as I find
          somebody.  (beat)  You're in charge now.
          Don't move from here ... unless you have
          to, ok?

Timmy nods.  Lex is happy, sinks to the floor.

                            LEX
          Goody!  I'm gonna rest.

She finds a box of wind-up dinosaur toys. She winds one. Sends it
walking to Timmy.

                            TIMMY
          Tired!  He carried you the whole way.

Grant slips off into the concealing shadows of the skeletal display of
the T-rex and raptor in combat.  He looks back above his own shoulder
into the menacing jaws of the skeletal raptor.  He shouts back.

                            GRANT
          Be right back.


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -

It's a madhouse in the crowded baronial quarters of Hammond.  Gennaro is
singing at the top of his-lungs while Harding tries to restrain him.
Scared Workers huddle together, many a
re injured.  Hammond sits on the
floor, in a meditative trance.

Ellie and Muldoon stare out the window.

THEIR POV - The raptor is jumping in the air.  With every jump he comes
closer to leaping onto the roof of their small building.

Muldoon regards his rocket launcher ruefully.

                            ELLIE
          Why don't you just nail that bastard?

                            MULDOON
          No more ammo.  I requisitioned six
          charges but the bean-counter -
              (he thrusts a finger at Hammond)
          - cut it down to two.

Ellie looks up to the ceiling.  There is a large glass skylight with
crisscrossing iron bars casting an ominous shadow in the sun.


EXT  THE ANNE B AT SEA - DAY

The ship continues along smooth sunlit sea.  Land is in distant sight.


INT  STATEROOM -

The cracked egg is nudged open.  The cute scaly head of a six-inch baby
raptor nuzzles its way out of the shell.  It shakes off a few pieces of
clinging shell and immediately begins to devour one of the
 remaining eggs.

                                                      CUT TO:

CLOSE ON - The wind-up dinosaur skitters across the polished floor.  It
bands against the  the wall again and again.

Timmy looks down at it and smiles at Lex.

                            LEX
          Any candy behind the counter?

                            TIMMY
          Hungry?

                            LEX
          Starved.

Timmy looks behind the counter.  He sees boxes of goods.  He moves a
stack of umbrellas out of his way.  Lex gets up and pulls one out.

                            TIMMY
          Nothing.

                            LEX
          Let's go to the kitchen.

She smiles and pops to her feet.  Timmy's not sure.

                            TIMMY
          Dr. Grant said -

                            LEX
          - let's go.  We'll come right back.

CLOSE ON - Timmy's torn face.  He's hungry, too.

He makes the right decision.

                            TIMMY
          Nope.  We're waiting here t
ill Dr. Grant
          gets back.  He'll help us get some -

Interrupted by A SOUND.  A rhythmic, horrible BREATHING.   Now some
light and rapid STEPS.  And a SNIFFING.  It's definitely an animal.

Lex backs off in a hurry. She knocks the umbrella over.  It skirts
across the floor.  It spins and opens by itself.  Printed on it is the
ferocious face of the Spitter, the sides of its bright poisonous gills
spinning to a stop.

The breathing gets closer and closer.  The children huddle together in a
corner of the gift shop.  They SCREAM.

It's A RAPTOR, lean and ferocious.  More like a cyborg than a hunter, it
studies the kids from just outside the gift shop entrance.  His eyes
flick back and forth between the two pieces of meat.

Timmy grabs the box of toy dinosaurs.  He winds one up and sends it off
across the hall.  The raptor glances over at the moving toy.  Timmy
grabs another, whispers as he winds it.

                            TIMMY
          Start winding now!

Lex and Timmy wind toy after toy, send th
em across the hall.  The raptor
leaps, crushing one in its jaws.  Others waddle by.  The raptor dodges
and darts, grabbing this one, smashing that one.

The kids go running out into the hall.  They race down the Visitor
Center corridor.  Timmy pulls Lex behind him toward the restaurant.

                            LEX
          Where are we going?

                            TIM
          The kitchen!


INT/EXT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -

With a huge leap, the raptor finally makes it to the roof of Hammond's
quarters.  He jumps lightly onto the skylight.  Glass shatters over the
assembled guests and workers below.  Total commotion and SCREAMS.

The raptor immediately begins to gnaw at the iron bars that block the
skylight.  Below, they shake off shards of glass and huddle in the
corners.  Ellie turns to Muldoon.

                            ELLIE
          How long?

                            MULDOON
          Well, they seem to be getting faster all
          the time. I would say - fifteen minutes.

Ellie no
tices something out the window.  It's Grant approaching the
gate.  She hammers on the glass.

Grant's hand reaches for the knob.

The raptor stops gnawing, its ears perked up.

Ellie screams and screams.

Grant notices some of Wu's remains inside the gate.  He stops and looks
up.  At the window, Ellie waves her arms, warning him not to enter.
Grant stops.  He sees Wu's headset on the grass, reaches through the
fence, grabs it, puts it on.

Ellie jumps up and gets her headset.  She barks into it.

                            ELLIE
          There's a raptor on the roof of this
          building.  Open that gate and you're a
          dead man.

Grant stares up at Ellie in the window.  He waves.  She presses her hand
to the glass.

                            GRANT
          Ellie, I'm go glad -

                            ELLIE
          Shut up and listen.  We have about
          fifteen minutes here.  The computer has
          to be rebooted.  That'll turn on the
          electric fences.  Besides the r
aptor
          stuck in here with us, there are four
          more ...

Grant races back to the Visitor's Center as she continues to fill him in.


INT  KITCHEN, VISITOR'S CENTER - CONTINUING ACTION

The kids hurtle through this huge, industrial kitchen.  The kitchen is a
maze of turns, from the hot lamp pickup area to the rows of stainless
steel burners to the chopping blocks to the potwashing area.  The kids
dart and duck from one area to the next, taking shortcuts under tables,
crawling behind counters, scattering pots and pans behind.

Relentlessly, with a casual speed, the raptor stalks them.  It avoids
their obstacles with a casual grace and when it cannot fit through their
shortcuts, it just continues around.

Timmy pulls open the large silvered door of the freezer.  Lex starts to
hurry inside.  Timmy grabs her.

                            TIMMY
          We'll freeze to death in there.

                            LEX
          He's going to eat us!

Timmy reaches into the freezer and grabs a pile 
of steaks.  He tosses one
toward the raptor.  The raptor gobbles it in one bite.  Timmy shoves Lex
out of the way and begins to toss the steaks on the floor.  One after the
other, he tosses them, in a row, closer and closer to the open freezer.

The raptor mechanically gobbles the steaks, following their path.  He
continues right into the freezer to grab the last of Tim's bait.

Tim leaps and slams the heavy freezer door shut.  Lex comes running and
throws her small weight alongside of Timmy's.

                            TIMMY
          PUSH!

The heave and the lock catches on the door.  From inside, there is a
strangled CRY and the door is slammed repeatedly.  The metal panels of
the door buckle but they do not break.  The door hinges bend and curve
but they do not give.

The kids collapse in relief on the kitchen floor.  In just a moment,
Timmy is back on his feet.

                            LEX
          What is it, Timmy?

                            TIMMY
          I just remembered something.  Rapto
rs are
          born in large litters.  There's probably
          more coming.  We gotta hide.

He grabs her hand and they run out of the back entrance of the kitchen.
There's a stairway and they race up.


INT  GIFT SHOP -

Grant, wearing his headset, calls for the kids and looks around the gift
shop with concern.  He sniffs the air and examines the crushed windup
toys.  He sees some animal scales on the floor.  He hears a NOISE above
and begins to run.


INT  UPPER FLOOR HALLWAY, VISITOR'S CENTER -

The kids hear this NOISE too and it's closer to them.  They bust into -


INT  AMBER ROOM, LABORATORY -

The kids knock over trays of stones as they rush through this room.


INT  EXTRACTION ROOM, LABORATORY -

Automated drills whir as Tim and Lex crash through, knocking equipment
to the ground.  The drills still whir on the ground.


INT  GENETICS ROOM -

The Hamachi-Hood sequencers explode in a heap of punch cards and
magnetic tape as the kids race by.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY -

The kids slide int
o this room.  They race to its far corner, past
incubators and display cases of chemicals.  They look back and see -

KID'S POV - A raptor happily gorging itself on a table of eggs.  He's
been in this room, their place of refuge, the whole time.

CLOSE ON - The raptor's glistening eyes register the children.

He begins to stalk.  The kids SCREAM.  This time there is nowhere to go.

The raptor closes in on the kids.  Timmy feebly stands in front of his
younger sister.

CLOSE ON - The raptor licks its lips, lizard-like.

At the other end of the room, GRANT ENTERS quickly.  He surveys the
situation.  Quickly, he grabs an egg off a table.  He reaches into one
of the chemical cabinets with POISON WARNINGS prominently displayed.  He
comes out with a syringe and a vial.

The raptor is almost on the kids.  Grant coughs conspicuously.  The
raptor whirls, studies Grant.  He looks back at the children.

Grant speaks into the headset.

                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
          Talk, Ellie, just keep talking.

He tosses the headset on the ground.  Ellie's voice crackles out.  The
raptor studies it, transfixed.

Grant injects the egg, then gently rolls it on the ground.  The raptor
forgets the headset.  He comes forward and sniffs the egg, then sucks it
up, swallowing it whole.

The raptor turns back to the kids.  He takes two steps toward them,
tenses to pounce - and keels over.  DEAD.

The kids race around the dead raptor to Grant.  Grant grabs his headset
as the three run out of the room.  Grant addresses Timmy as they run.

                            GRANT
          Timmy, you know anything about computers?

                            TIMMY
          Well, I just got an XT at home.  I told
          my Dad I wanted a 386.

                            GRANT
          Ok good, you're elected.


INT  CONTROL ROOM -

Grant and Tim and Lex study the quiet room.  Grant speaks calmly into
his headset.

                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
          Okay, we've reached the computer room.
          Who can te
ll Timmy how to reboot?

                            ELLIE (OVER RADIO)
          Ah, Alan, nobody here knows how to boot
          the computer.  Please hurry, we've only
          got a couple minutes left.

                            GRANT
          Tim, you got to book the system.  They
          reset the power and there are no phones.
          We gotta turn on the fences and we gotta
          stop that ship.

                            LEX
          Are they going to be ok?

                            GRANT
          If we can get help very soon.

                            TIMMY
          Sshh, you guys, I'm thinking.

He studies a grid on a large console.  He reaches out and touches a part
of the screen.  There is a beep and a warning sign - INVALID ARGUMENT.
PLEASE TRY AGAIN.


BACK ON  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -

The raptor has chewed almost all the way through the bars.  Panic below.
In the middle of it all, Ellie is focused, listening on her headset.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

Timmy tries somethin
g else.  BEEP.  Lex raises a hand.  Grant stops her.

                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
          Ellie, we're working as fast as we can
          here.

Timmy tries a screen section.  BEEP.  Again. BEEP.  Again.  BEEP.  BEEP.

Timmy shakes his head.  In desperation he stabs at the keyboard below
the touch screen.  He punches the ESCAPE button.

The screen lights up a new message - SYSTEM RESET COMPLETED.  ALL
SYSTEMS NORMAL.


BACK ON  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -

The raptor has just chewed through.  He squeezes his body into the space
as the bars ELECTRIFY.  Spastically, the raptor jerks back and forth as
the current flows through him.  He can't get out.

Finally, with a WHIMPER, he stops struggling and slides through the
space he created.  With a THUMP, he drops to the floor below.

Ellie, Muldoon, Hammond and the workers look on in shock.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

Grant cheers and hugs Timmy.  Lex whoops.

                            ELLIE (ON RADIO)
          Ok, we're all right here for now.
      
    Thanks.

                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
          Don't mention it.  It was Timmy.

                            ELLIE (ON RADIO)
          But there's still one more raptor.  So be
          careful.

Timmy is pushing menus and submenus on the touchscreen now.
COMMUNICATIONS - RADIO - VEHICULAR ...  He gets the one he wants.

He indicates the radio-mike to Grant.

                            TIM
          I think this is the boat.  They called it
          the Queen Anne or something.

Grant grabs the mike.

                            GRANT
          Queen Anne, do you read me?  Queen Anne?

The radio crackles to life.

                            RADIO
          This is the Queen Anne B?  I copy.
          What's up?

                            GRANT
          Report your position!

                            RADIO
          Ah, we're just about to dock here in
          Puntaremas.  Who wants to know?  Please
          identify yourself.

Tim punches the screen which displays FARRELL, F
REDERICK D. (CAPT.)
Grant reads it and nods.  His voice is tough as nails.

                            GRANT
          Try this for identification, Captain
          Farrell.  You are in possession of stolen
          biological materials.  If you don't turn
          that boat around and return to Isla
          Nublar immediately with your contraband
          cargo, you will be found in violation of
          Section 509 of the Uniform Maritime Act,
          you will be subject to revocation of
          license, penalties in excess of fifty
          thousand dollars, and five years in jail.
          Do you copy?

SILENCE.

                            GRANT
          Do you copy, Captain Farrell?

                            RADIO
          I copy.  All ahead stern.

A blinking light on a map indicates that the ship is pulling away from
the harbor.  Grant nods to Timmy who terminates the radio contact.

                            TIMMY
          What's the Uniform Maritime Code?

                     
       GRANT
          Who the hell knows?

Grant and Timmy start to celebrate again when Lex interrupts.

                            LEX
          What good does that do?  To have the ship
          turn around?

Grant turns to her seriously.

                            GRANT
          Well it gives us ten more hours.
              (to Timmy)
          Let's see if we can raise the Costa Rican
          Coast Guard on that thing.

The last raptor smashes into the control room through Hammond's viewing
window.  Glass goes flying.  Grant and kids go running into the hallway.


INT ROTUNDA -

With the raptor in hot pursuit, the kids and Grant come flying.  Tim and
Lex jump over the railing, leaping onto the skeletal display.  Grant
goes for the stairs, jumping down them three at a time.

The raptor goes after the kids, scrambling over the balcony onto the
display.  The kids scamper down the display, knocking paint cans and
tools off the scaffolding as they go.  The raptor is just one beat
behind, and his snar
ling face is splashed with red paint as he chases.

The kids burrow into the rib cage of the Rex.  They break off floating
rubs and hurl them back at the raptor.  The raptor is undeterred,
closing the gap on the kids.

The kids are stuck at the end of the rib cage - it's closed off by the
skeleton and they can't break through.  They're imprisoned.  The raptor
is pushing through the rib cage, bones crackling as it goes.

Grant leaps up the scaffolding, grabs a beam, swings his weight onto it,
and slams it into the T-Rex's neck.  The neck shatters and the massive
head of the T-Rex drops free.

It falls directly onto the last raptor, squashing him flat.  Dead.

                            GRANT
              (grimly)
          And then there were none.


EXT  HELICOPTER PAD - DUSK

Muldoon leads his workers onto an army helicopter.  Two workers carry
Gennaro on a stretcher.  Ellie boards with the kids on each side of her,
holding her hands.

Grant and Hammond walk together, toward the helicopter.

              
              HAMMOND
          Dr. Grant, don't abandon this beautiful
          place.  I need a man just like you to
          help me get my park back on its feet
          again.  And it will be on its feet again.

                            GRANT
          We have to leave now.

Hammond stops.

                            HAMMOND
          Oh you don't know.  There are wonderful
          plans in the works, sites already
          purchased for Euro-Jurassic and Jurassic
          Japan.

Grant is unimpressed.  He holds a hand out to Hammond.  Hammond tries a
new approach.

                            HAMMOND
          Don't you see I've exalted human
          potential here?  You must see it.  You
          must feel it.  I called back a life form.
          Listen, Dr. Grant, don't go.  Be a part
          of this.  I'm inviting you to do just
          that - let the others go, if they want.

                            GRANT
          You interrupted natural law.  There are
          regulations,
 rules that nature follows
          that make her knowable.

                            HAMMOND
          You mean there are rules that nature
          follows that create barriers to our
          knowledge.

                            GRANT
          Barriers?  Like the seasons?  The earth
          spinning, orbiting the sun?  The entire
          solar system in interlocking motion.  Our
          own beings in biological step with it
          all.  Mr. Hammond, you've disrupted the
          pattern and look what it's done!

                            HAMMOND
          I know what it's done.  I've made
          triceratops and gallimimus and a T-Rex.
          I've got a batch of iguanadons being born
          on Tuesday.  What do you say to that?

                            GRANT
          Don't count on it.  Now get in.

Grant jumps in the copter, holds out a hand to Hammond.

                            GRANT
          You created mutant forms that you further
          mutated to create amus
ement attractions.
          You made biological puppets with
          heartbeats and an early death sentence.

                            HAMMOND
          I created genetic miracles!

                            GRANT
          You created a park to generate a profit-
          making merchandising operation.

                            HAMMOND
          The merchandise is just a by-product.
          Souvenirs for people to reflect on the
          wonder.  You fainted when you saw the
          brachiosaur.  Alan, look, let's not
          argue.  The problem is that my employees
          were not up to par with my dream.  They
          failed me.  The park, I promise you, is
          safe.  It really is.

Grant grabs Hammond's arm, starts to tug.

                            GRANT
          You park is doomed.  Now come with me.
          
                            HAMMOND
          It is not!  It's blooming!  In the throes
          of labor!  You are one more more negative
          voice in a 
universe of negativity.
          You'll amount to nothing.  You'll be a
          bone-brusher all your life.  I pity you.

Hammond pulls his arm away and strides away from the helicopter just as
the ROTORS START UP.  Hammond's suit whips in the wind.  Grant calls to
him, reaching out his arm.

                            GRANT
          Come back, Mr. Hammond!  It's over!

Hammond keeps walking.  He disappears over a grassy knoll.

Grant's outstretched hand drops to his side when THE ATTACK comes.

With a huge bellow, the T-Rex comes charging at the helicopter.  THE
PILOT screams for all to board as he starts to lift off.

The Rex bites onto the copter skid as the copter tries to escape.  The
copter angles dangerously as the Rex holds on.

Ellie fires a fire-extinguisher into the furious face of the Rex and its
jaws relax.  The copter escapes and starts to climb high into the sky.
The Rex paws after it, then drops down to four legs and gives the copter
a final swipe with its tail.

The tail SWISHES through 
the air and CRACKS against the plexiglass
windshield which fissures and pops.  The pilot struggles to maintain
altitude and manages to keep the craft in the air.

With a ROAR of its own, the copter breaks into the blue sky and soars.
away, leaving an angry T-Rex alone.  Unnoticed by the frustrated Rex,
Hammond slips away and walks into the jungle.


IN THE COPTER -

SLOWLY PAN the exhausted faces of Muldoon and his workers, Lex and Timmy
holding onto each other, and Grant huddles next to Ellie.  He reaches
out and puts an arm around her shoulder.  She reaches up and pulls his
arm close.

                            ELLIE
          They're so beautiful.  They're condemned,
          aren't they?  Even those embryo fragments
          had the same viral contamination.

                            GRANT
          I have a theory.

Ellie looks up in surprise.  She give him a big smile.

                            ELLIE
          You have a theory?

Grant smiles back at her.

                            GRANT
   
       I think that they could never completely          
          isolate the dinosaur DNA.  There was
          always some microscopic mosquito
          contamination.  But at the molecular
          level, that was enough.  Every dinosaur
          received the same genetic massage, the
          encoding that every mosquito gets to
          terminate life after a season.

                            ELLIE
          So the very process itself was flawed.

She's sad.  Grant hugs her.  Over her shoulder he gives a parting glance
to the island.  A green jewel in a blue sea.  Suddenly it is obliterated
by clouds.

CAMERA PANS AWAY AND SWOOPS DOWN from the copter.  IT CROSSES the sky.
THE CAMERA DESCENDS to Isla Nublar, slowly reveling in its natural
beauty and finally coming to earth in the midst of the verdant jungle.


IN THE JUNGLE - MAGIC HOUR

Hammond slowly climbs a steep hill covered with creeping growth.  He
almost reaches the top when he slips.  He falls to the soft ground and
rolls. He tumbles he
lplessly, rolling and spinning down the sharp drop,
finally coming to a complete stop in a shallow pool of water.  Face
down, his head splashes into the puddle.  No movement. Just the sound of
labored breath.

The army copter circles lower and lower as it finds the Queen Anne B,
slowly drifting across the moonlit water.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXTREME CLOSEUP of glowing honey-colored stones.  Their shapes ABSTRACT
as THE CAMERA EXAMINES air bubbles and crystalline patterns.

MOVING UP AND OVER this amber abstraction, the CAMERA FINDS unusual
shapes and imperfections caught in the glassy stone:  flecks of dirt,
hairs, cracks.  STILL MOVING.  STARBURSTS OF LIGHT ricochet off the
different surfaces of the stones.

CAMERA TURNS along a creamy stretch of amber.  IT TURNS IN DEEPER,
abstracting the picture further only to find A TINY BLUR that suddenly
RACKS INTO FOCUS - a bug, a mosquito lodged within an amber tomb.  It is
folded on its back.

SLOW MOTION
 as the tip of a fine-pointed drill bores into the amber
toward the trapped bug.  Orange flecks fly.  The mosquito trembles.  The
drill continues, stopping just before it touches the tiny body.

A SHINY PAIR of thin needle-nose pliers reach in the borehole and
extricate the mosquito remains.  These are dropped on a brightly lit
glass slide.  A conveyor belt starts, and the slide moves along.
arriving under a long-lensed microscope.

IN MICROSCOPIC PERSPECTIVE, a thin needle pierces the bug and delicately
removes a fragment of tissue.

PINCERS snare the fragment, dropping it into a narrow tube.  The tube
SPINS, faster and faster until it is a BLUR on the screen.

THE SCREEN FLOODS with an INFRA-RED LIGHT.  Gray, oval shapes rock in a
neutral mist.

                                                     WASH OUT TO:

HOT SUN overhead in a BIG SKY -


EXT  BADLANDS - AFTERNOON

Lodged in the cracked earth are the partially-exposed fossilized remains
of A VELOCIRAPTER, a carnivorous dinosaur.  WIDEN OUT to a SWEEPI
NG
PANORAMA of a dinosaur dig, a major excavation filled with workers
shoveling earth and stone, making measurements, taking photographs,
scribbling notes, and conferring with each other.

The center of all this activity is one man.  In a roped-off area that
circumscribes the exposed bones of the raptor, is DR. ALAN GRANT, head
paleontologist.  Good-looking, late 30's, with a think beard.

Grant lies on his belly, completely absorbed in a small piece of bone.
A GROUP OF TWELVE STUDENTS, notebooks in hand, await his next sentence.

CLOSE ON - the tiny bone.  Grant's nose touches it.

Grant brushes the bone with a toothbrush.  Then he decides on a quicker
way to clean it.  He licks it.  Excited by his discovery, he gets to his
feet and addresses his students, who listen raptly.

                            GRANT
          Right calcaneus of an adult female
          raptor.  Mild stress fractures.  What's
          this tell me?

Students look at each other.  A tentative hand.  Grant continues.

               
             GRANT
          It tells me that this bone connects to
          the navicula which we already found
          articulating to the cuboid.

OFFSCREEN, a woman SHOUTS to him.

                            ELLIE (off)
          Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!

Grant looks up.

DR. ELLIE SATTLER, late 20's, sharp-eyed, tough if she wants to be, runs
like a gazelle across the arid land.  Exuberant, she leaves a trail of
dust behind her.

She zips by A STUDENT guarding the cordoned area.  He tries to stop her.

                            STUDENT
          Dr. Sattler!  Dr. Grant is thinking!

Dr. Grant waves her over enthusiastically with his bone and continues.

                            GRANT
          So, what can we stay for sure?  Stress
          fractures in the heel ...

Uncertain students.  Ellie arrives and immediately gets into it.

                            ELLIE
          She jumps.

Grant turns around to her and smiles.  She's got it.  Other students to
- they knew is all along.

            
                GRANT
          Right as rain, Ellie.  Now, why did she
          jump?

No answer.  Ellie gives it a try.

                            ELLIE
          A defensive posture against a vicious,
          blood-thirsty T-Rex?

                            GRANT
              (nodding)
          Perhaps.  Or maybe to select the smaller,
          more tender leaves in the higher branches
          with which to suckle her young?

Ellie jumps up.

                            ELLIE
          I bet is was a mating ritual.

Students laugh.  One student eyes Grant's self-conscious smile at Ellie.

                            GRANT
          The science of paleontology can't answer
          these questions.  Novelists and artists
          who dream a vision of the Jurassic period
          can attempt these questions with their
          imaginations.  What we scientists can say
          is considering the mass and kinetic
          articulation of these bones, this animal
          had a vertical leap
 of about twelve feet.
          Not as entertaining as fiction, but
          absolutely fact without prejudice.

Ellie intrudes again.

                            ELLIE
          Excuse me, Dr. Grant.  But ... fact is,
          we're late.  There's the car.

She points.  On the horizon, a limousine speeds toward them, leaving a
dusty wake.

Grant sets the rules for his departure, giving instructions individually
as Ellie pulls him away, carrying their bags.

                            GRANT
          Jim, you keep making up the plaster
          batches.  Whatever ratio you're using,
          it's perfect.  Nora, no digging after
          five - when the temperature drops, those
          bones are just too brittle.  Bill, I
          don't want any tourists walking over my
          raptor - I don't care if the Governor of
          Montana is with them, just you guys.

Grant and Ellie continue walking.  She interrupts his continued barrage.

                            ELLIE
          You know, if ev
ery scientist stuck to his
          method like you, there would be no body
          of theory - no quasars, no big bang -

Grant stops at the sight of the stopped limo and freezes.

                            GRANT
          Jesus, a limousine.  We're re-entering
          Hammond's world, that's for sure.  (beat)
          Remind me why we're doing this, Ellie.

Ellie is gentle.  She's telling him something they've discussed before.

                            ELLIE
          We're leaving the raptor dig -

                            GRANT
          - at a critical time -

                            ELLIE
          - because Gennaro is paying us sixty
          thousand dollars to observe some resort
          of Hammond's in Costa Rica. And that's -

                            GRANT
          - enough money to keep us free of
          commercial affiliations for two summers.
          All right, all right.  Good.

Then, half-kidding with Ellie:

                            GRANT
          Financial
 independence for fraternizing
          with the enemy?  (beat)  I'll do it.

She laughs.  But he can't quite leave.  He grabs a computer printout

                            GRANT
          This is all could come up with, Skip?

Skip turns the printout right-side up in Grant's hand.  Grant smiles.

                            GRANT
          Wise guy.  Let's go, Ellie.

Grant and Ellie board the limo amidst many goodbyes from the students.
The limo pulls away.


EXT  HIGH TECH BUILDING - BIOGENETIC CORPORATION HQ - SUNSET

A purple sunset irradiates the exterior glass walls of the building.


INT  BIOGEN HQ

A peanut flies in the air.  Then falls into a big open mouth.  THOMP.

                            MOUTH
          Five hundred thousand is peanuts!

He tosses another peanut and misses his open mouth.  This is DENNIS
NEDRY, a 40 year old computer programmer.  He's fat, with greasy hair
and a permanently wrinkled suit.  His slovenly looks are wildly out of
place on the rich leather sofa where he reclin
es.

Across a gleaming granite coffee table is BILL BAKER, businessman.  A
smooth meticulous dresser, Baker is disgusted by Nedry's sloppy
appearance and voracious consumption of food and drink.

Nedry finishes a coke.  Over his shoulder is an impressive skyline view.

                            NEDRY
          I'm not reneging.  I'm re-evaluating.

Nedry holds the can of coke upside-down, drains the last drops.

                            NEDRY
          You think I'm a scumbag, I know.

Nedry chuckles, lines up three peanuts on the table.  One after the
other, he throws them in the air.  He gulps down two, misses one. It
skids across the glossy floor.

Baker's head involuntarily cocks as he looks disgustedly at Nedry.

                            NEDRY
          Look pal, you make a career in biogenetic
          industrial espionage, and you're bound to
          run across a scumbag or two.  Guaranteed!
          Part of the job description.  Look, who's
          to say, who is the real scumbag?  After
          all, I know what you guys need so bad.
          I've heard of reverse engineering.

As Nedry continues he shovels nuts into his mouth and CHOMPS and SPEAKS.

                            NEDRY
          Let the other guy put in all the work,
          all the R and D.  You take the finished
          product, work backwards, breaking it down
          to reveal its genetic code.  Presto!  In
          a few measly months you have know-how
          that took researchers ten years to
          determine.  You know how much Hammond has
          invested of his own personal wealth?
          Over five billion dollars!  And if you
          guys get the jump on his - in no time,
          the market's wide-open.

Nedry starts the LAUGH as he EATS and TALKS.

                            NEDRY
          But, boy, he's really got his product!
          Oh yes siree, massive, gargantuan, money-
          making, never-heard-of-profit-like-that
          product.  It is a sight!  Yes, indeedy!

Nedry LAUGH
S explosively.  He begins to choke, COUGHING and GASPING.

Baker is repulsed.  He stares out the window as the sun sets.

Nedry, in true distress, clutches his own throat.  He clumsily runs
toward Baker, toppling chairs as he goes.  Nedry grabs Baker's hand and
squeezes it tightly, imploring Baker for help.  Baker coolly shakes his
hand loose and shoves Nedry to the floor.  Baker looks down at the prone
and desperate Nedry.

                            BAKER
          Scumbag.  We have a deal.  That deal is
          not open to renegotiation.  Or even re-
          evaluation.

Bakers kneels down next to Nedry, who is beginning to turn blue.

                            BAKER
          The deal stands.  Take it or leave it.

Baker glances at his watch.

                            BAKER
          I'll give you a few minutes to decide.

Nedry makes a superhuman effort just to nod his head.  Baker nods back
and SLAMS his fist into Nedry's solar plexus.  It works.

Nedry sucks in a huge gulp of air.  He sits up
, rubbing his belly.  As
Baker leaves the room:

                            BAKER
          Make sure the eggs are on that supply
          ship.  Just make sure!

CAMERA LEAVES NEDRY and exits the window.    IT SWISHPANS the concrete
canyons of Wall Street and enters another office.


INT  CONSERVATIVE LAW OFFICE - DAY

DONALD GENNARO, handsome,  meticulously dressed, paces the highly
polished, glassy corner suite.  His boss, ROSS, is seated.  He's a
powerful black man who waves a prosthetic arm.

                            ROSS
          We can't trust Hammond anymore.  He's
          under too much pressure.  There's the
          EPA, he's behind schedule, and the in-
          vestors are getting nervous.  There have
          been too many rumors, too many accidents.
          We can't screw around with this.

                            GENNARO
          I've asked Hammond to arrange independent
          site inspections every week for the next
          three weeks.

                            ROS
S
          What does he say?

                            GENNARO
          Insists nothing's wrong on the island.

                            ROSS
          You know him.  Do you believe him?

                             GENNARO
          No, I don't.  I spent a lot of time with
          him five years ago when we raised the
          capital.  And it was a wild ride.  He's
          unpredictable, a dreamer.

                            ROSS
          Potentially dangerous.  We should never
          have gotten involved.  What's our position?

                            GENNARO
          The firm owns five percent.

                            ROSS
          General or limited?

                            GENNARO
          General.

                            ROSS
          We should have never done that.

                            GENNARO
          It seemed wise at the time.  We all
          wanted the park to happen.  It was in
          lieu of fees.

                            ROSS
        
  In any case, I agree an inspection is
          overdue.  Who are your site experts?

Gennaro tosses a list on Ross' desk.  He check it out.

                            ROSS
          Will they tell the truth?

                            GENNARO
          I think so.  That guy Grant's a hotshot
          in his field, always goes his own way -

                            ROSS
          - Good.  You're making all the arrangements?

                            GENNARO
          Hammond asked to place the calls himself.
          I think he wants to pretend the park is
          not in trouble.  That it's just a social
          invitation, showing off the island.

                            ROSS
          All right ... Good.  But let's be very
          clear about one thing.  I don't know how
          bad this situation actually is, Donald.
          But if there's a problem on that island -
          don't be afraid to screw Hammond and burn
          Jurassic Park to the ground.

Gennaro shakes hands 
awkwardly with Ross and leaves.  Ross paces.  Fed-
up, he whispers to himself.

                            ROSS
          Costa Rica, my ass.

He whacks his desk globe, sends its spinning.

CAMERA MOVES IN on spinning globe as we HEAR the ROTOR BLADES of a
helicopter and DISSOLVE TO:


INT/EXT  HELICOPTER IN SKY - DAWN

On the helicopter tail is a little blue logo that reads: Isla Nublar.

INSIDE, Grant, Ellie and Gennaro are in the right back row.  Ellie
dozes, her head occasionally dropping onto Grant's shoulder, to his
discomfort.  Gennaro looks at papers, trying not to look through the
clear plexi-bubble at their feet.  Next to THE PILOT, Nedry chews a
candy bar.  He offers candy to the back row.

Grant loses himself, looking out the window.

GRANT'S POV - the aquamarine blue of the ocean.  Below the waters there
are the shadows of ample marine life.  Dolphins leap in the air.
Suddenly the clear scene becomes obscured by clouds.

There is turbulence.  Ellie wakes, glances at Grant, then out the
window.  
There is mist and she absently traces her finger in it, shaping
a dinosaur figure.  Now land comes into view and for a moment, the
island below them eerily fits right into her doodling.

                            PILOT
          That's Isla Nublar.  Buckle up, the
          descent is a little hairy.

Gennaro cinches his belt tightly and half-shuts his eyes.  Nedry takes
out a sandwich and cockily loosens his belt.  Ellie looks every way.

                            ELLIE
          This is exciting!

                            GRANT
          What is, Ellie?  Where are we going?

Grant looks out his window. The helicopter rushes forward, low to the
water.  Ahead, Grant sees the island, rugged and craggy, rising sharply

                            GRANT
          Looks like Alcatraz.

The pilot coughs and rubs his goggles with the back of his hand.

                            PILOT
          There's bad wind shear on this peak.

Grant nods.  Gennaro sweats, watching the pilot tighten his own belt.

Ellie
 smiles excitedly as the helicopter starts down.  Now, A BLANKET
FOG.  Grant can't see a thing out his window.  Ellie's startled.

                            ELLIE
          How the hell is he landing this thing?

No answer.  Grant dimly discerns green branches of pine trees through
the mist.  Some are very close.  Ellie's hands grasps her seat cushion.

                            ELLIE
          This is not fun.

Grant looks through the plexi-bubble at his feet.  He sees the giant
glowing fluorescent cross below.  Lights FLASH at corners of the cross.

                            GRANT
          Relax, Ellie.  I'm sure they wouldn't
          land if it weren't safe.

The copter suddenly SHAKES violently.  Ellie grabs Grant's hand.
Gennaro sits straight up, eyes squeezed shut.

                            GRANT
          Gennaro?  This guy knows what he's doing,
          Right?  Hey, Gennaro?  I'm talking to you!

Another violent shake.  Grant squeezes Ellie's hand back.

CLOSEUP - Nedry's hand crushes a 
packet of crackers.

Gennaro is soaked.  He opens one eye and looks about, very frightened.
He speaks a mantra.

                            GENNARO
          No problem.  Relax, relax.

The pilot whispers to himself and corrects slightly.  The copter sails
sharply the other way.

                            GRANT AND ELLIE
          Whoa!!!!

CLOSE ON - the pilot jerks back the stick.

THE COPTER zooms upward.  Grant's beverage flips to the ground, pours
across the floor.

Nedry's lunch does flying.  Sandwich, candy, and cracker crumbs hang
suspended in the air.  Now it all FREE-FALLS onto Nedry's lap.

Grant and Ellie lean tightly into each other,

                            ELLIE
          I don't like this feeling ...

The pilot swings his gaze, left then right, looking at the pine forest.
Trees are close, then far, then close.  The helicopter drops rapidly.
Ellie and Grant shut their eyes.  They brace themselves for the worst.

IN AND OUT OF THE MIST, the copter descends.  Tail raised high, nose
low, fo
r a moment it looks like a strange bug-eyes prehistoric animal
bucking in its pen.  In a flash, it corrects itself.  The copter touches
down on a heli-pad.  The SOUND of the rotors fades and dies.

For a second, no one moves.  Grant lets out a great sigh of relief.
Gennaro mouths a silent prayer.  The pilot stretches his fingers.

Grant and Ellie self-consciously shake their hands free of each other.
Nedry unbuckles and laughs as he brushes off his lap.  He turns:

                            NEDRY
          Just think, Gennaro -
              (laughs harder)
          - you gotta agree it's funny!  These two,
          they dig up dinosaurs!  It's wonderful,
          isn't it?

Nedry pats Grant on his shoulder.

                            NEDRY
          Dr. Bones, you're going to love this place.

Nedry bursts out laughing again as he heads out the helicopter door.

A smile comes across Gennaro's face.  As he smiles he motions with his
hands he doesn't mean any harm.  Grant and Ellie stare at him.

      
                      PILOT
          Come on folks.  Gotta get back, there's a
          storm alert.

ROTORS TURN.  OUTSIDE, a man reaches the copter.  He wears a baseball
cap over short red hair and he's dressed in phony safari garb.  He
shakes Gennaro's hand.  This is ED REGIS, 35, head of Public Relations.
He throws open the copter door next to Grant.  Big, cheerful smile.

                            REGIS
          Hi!  Ed Regis.  Real big welcome to Isla
          Nublar, Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler.  Little
          tough landing here, I know.  But you did
          it!  Come on down, we're so happy to have
          you.  Now, watch your step.

Ellie and Grant jump into the world of Jurassic Park.


EXT  LUSH TROPICAL FOREST - MORNING

Grant takes in the beautiful tropical terrain.  This place is the
opposite of the Badlands.  There is elaborate planting everywhere:
huge, hairy ferns; exotic, spiked flowers; berries of every color;
rushing vines.  Peeking through the thick greenery are beautiful birds
a
nd flying squirrels.  The strange, prehistoric world impresses Grant
and Ellie.  Even Nedry and Gennaro take in the vegetal wonder.

Then, the SOUND of men working, grunting from exertion.  Ahead, Muldoon
directs A GROUP OF WORKMEN.  Flame-throwers roar and machetes fight back
the abundant foliage.  As they attack a new area, Regis waves Muldoon
over.  Muldoon has a pronounced limp as he walks over to join them.

                            ED REGIS
          This is Robert Muldoon, great African big
          game hunter.  And he's working for us now.
          Doing a bang-up job, too.

Muldoon rests his rifle by a tree stump and shakes with Grant and Ellie.

                            MULDOON
          Ed's a little more BS than PR.  Mr.
          Gennaro, nice to have you back.

Gennaro nods warmly as Muldoon limps back to work.

Regis leads on, taking Gennaro's arm and talking to him like and old
friend.  Nedry lumbers in the middle, alone.  At the rear, Grant and
Ellie study everything they see.  Grant
 calls to Regis but is ignored.

                            GRANT
          Mr. Regis, what is the nature of this park?

Ellie looks behind and sees cramped ferns spring out to capture the path
they just walked on.  She nudges Grant, who has seen the same.

                            ELLIE
          Aggressive growth, huh?

                            GRANT
          Hammond's trademark.

A distinct HOOTING in the distance.  Then a loud TRUMPETING.  Grant and
Ellie stop.  Nedry doesn't look up.  Regis flashes his salesman's smile.

                            REGIS
          Out animals are greeting you!

They pass a crude sign nailed to a tree:  Welcome to Jurassic Park.
Grant cringes at the sign.  Ellie nudges him to loosen up.

                            GRANT
          I hope this isn't one of those animatronic
          exhibits in a Jurassic botanical setting.

                            NEDRY
          Nope.

Gennaro wipes his brow.  They enter a green tunnel of over-arching palm
that leads to the 
VISITOR'S CENTER, a modern complex in the distance.

Ellie notices a large fence hidden in the brush.  She nudges Grant.

THEIR POV - CAMERA SLOWLY CLIMBS a fifteen foot high chain-link fence.
The needle-spiked top of this fence cuts deep into the brush.

This fence is only the prelude.

Sprawling massively above and behind it is a thirty foot high fence.
Woven throughout the fence's mesh is an intricate system of electrical
wire.  There is a prominent warning:  DANGER!  ELECTRIC FENCE: TEN
THOUSAND VOLTS - KEEP OFF!

CAMERA KEEPS CLIMBING to the top:  ominous barbed wire, curled into the
highest growth with coiled razors glistening in the sun.

Grant strains to understand.  The quickens his steps to catch the others.

They reach a clearing with an unfinished brick sidewalk and potted shade
trees waiting for planting.  A crosshatching of tiny lizards scamper off
the walk.  An empty swimming pool is being filled by A MAN with a pumper
truck.  Next to him, WORKERS water the large ferns.

                       
     REGIS
          I hope you brought your bathing suits!
          Doesn't this mist and these plants really
          create a bonafide prehistoric feeling?

Regis points to a low building with glass pyramids on the roof.

                            REGIS
          There's the Visitor's Center.

A CRANE lowers an iron grating on top of one pyramid.  An animal TRUMPETS.


INT  VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY

CLOSE ON - the iron security grating as it fits over a glass skylight.
Above, MASKED WORKERS weld it on.  Sparks fly.

Grant stares up at it, thinking.  Footsteps echo behind him as Regis,
Ellie, Gennaro, and Nedry look around the unfinished building.

The Visitor's Center is two stories high, a lot of glass with exposed
girders and supports.  It's incomplete:  vines swing in the breeze where
the back wall will go and undressed cables litter the floor.  Even so,
exhibit areas are in varying stages of completion.  Behind, SEVERAL
SPANISH WORKERS unpack masonry supplies.

                            GRANT
     
     Where's Hammond?

                            REGIS
          Mr. Hammond is dying to see you guys.

Grant strides over to an exhibit as Gennaro paces impatiently.

                            GENNARO
          Hot, hot, hot.  Ten billion bucks and the
          air conditioning sucks.

Regis smiles apologetically and pushes open a large window on one of the
finished walls.  Giant leaves and vines burst inside.

Grant studies an exhibit in progress entitled When Dinosaurs Rules the
World.  This is a large clock that presents millions of years as hours
in a single day.  Many brightly colored hours are allocated to the
dinosaurs.  Man receives the last second of the day.  Ellie joins Grant.

                            ELLIE
          The audicity of man to get here at the
          last second and think he runs the show.

Grant smiles at her inexhaustible enthusiasm.  He looks at a painted
mural of a Raptor on one of the walls in the half-completed gift shop.

Nedry is at a coke machine, feeding in change
.  It doesn't work.  He
SLAMS his hand against it, and finally, a cup drops down the chute.
Upside-down.  It pours.  Coke splashes Nedry.  He curses and exits.

THE ROTUNDA - Ellie pulls Grant over to a raised, round display with a
catwalk.  In this unfinished display, a skeletal T-Rex and a Raptor are
locked in combat.  Scaffolding is up around it, and painting supplies
are scattered all around.

Regis glances at his watch, looks up, and smiles.

At that moment, doors adjacent to the rotunda swing open automatically.
A soothing female voice comes out of the public address system.

                            VOICE (ON P.A.)
          Please come to the theater.  In a moment,
          our film will begin.

The voice goes on to give this information in a number of languages.
Regis waves everyone into the theater.   Nedry doesn't join them.  He
climbs the stairs to the second floor.


INT  SCREENING ROOM - DAY

Small and plush.  Regis sits in the front, full of enthusiasm.  Grant and
Ellie sit further behind. 
 Gennaro stands in the back and smokes.

CELESTIAL MUSIC fills the room.  Mist covers and curls on the stage
floor.  Colored spotlights illuminate the mist in an eerie fashion.
overall effect is the touristy Where's NY? high-gloss production.

years young, with a glint in his eye and very comfortable with his own
effect.  He wears a white linen suit with a red rose in the breast
pocket.  Like an elder Carl Sagan, he addresses the group.

                            HAMMOND
          Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.  Welcome
          to an ancient and mysterious world, a
          world long before humankind inhabited it
          with all out remarkable dreams and
          questions.  Enter a world that existed
          one hundred million years ago.  When our
          changing earth was the abode of
          magnificent creations.

          Today, the late twentieth century has
          witnessed a scientific gold rush of
          astonishing proportions:  the headlong
          and furious haste to un
ravel the mystery
          of genetic engineering has become more
          than just a subject for science fiction
          writers.

ON GRANT - he whispers to Ellie.

                            GRANT
          - the furious haste to commercialize
          genetic engineering.

BACK ON HAMMOND - he warms to his subject.

                            HAMMOND
          Biotechnology promises the greatest
          revolution in human history.  It will
          outdistance atomic power and computers in
          its effects on our everyday lives.  We'll
          see square trees for easy lumbering and
          white trout for super visibility to
          fisherman.  Why it will transform every
          aspect of human life: out medical care,
          our food, our health, even our very
          entertainment.

ON GRANT - confirmed in his thinking, he whispers again.

                            GRANT
          Here we go.

BACK ON HAMMOND - he concludes.

                            HAMMOND
          
Nothing will ever be the same again.
          It's literally going to change the face
          of our planet as we know it.


MUSIC SOARS.  Hammond smiles appreciatively, removes his rose.  A screen
descends behind him.

                            HAMMOND
          ... Jurassic Park.  What we do here is
          made possible through the miracle of DNA
          replication, commonly known as cloning.
          To explain what cloning means, I'm going
          to need my own clone - John Hammond.

Another Hammond appears, projected on the screen beside the real one.

                            2ND HAMMOND
          Hi, John!

                            HAMMOND
          Hi, John.

IN THE AUDIENCE - Ellie laughs aloud.  Grant, shaking his head, smiles.

BACK ON HAMMOND - The original speaks to the clone.

                            HAMMOND
          Okay John, hold out your finger.

                            2ND HAMMOND
          Why?

                            HAMMOND
          I need some of your
 genetic material.

                            2ND HAMMOND
          Now just a minute here, John.

                            HAMMOND
          Your genetic material is the same in
          every cell of your body.  You have a
          hundred billion cells.  You won't miss a
          couple.

Hammond holds his rose to the screen the pricks his clone's finger with
a thorn.

                            2ND HAMMOND
          OW!!!  That hurt!  Hey, what's -

The clone dissolves into a cascade of blood as WE SEE a magnified view
of the bloodstream.  ANIMATION begins which illuminates the parts of the
blood and its actions.  Hammond provides voiceover for the visuals.

                            HAMMOND
          John, let's look into your blood, the
          river of life.  There's your white cells,
          exquisitely evolved to clean up bodily
          wastes.  And there's a mighty nucleus,
          the heart and brain of a cell.  This
          nucleus has an amazing property.  It can
          sp
lit in half and reproduce itself.
          That's how it grows.  And then those two
          can do it again.  And again.  Making copy
          after copy of itself.

Back to the two Hammond's.  Joined by a third, then a fourth, and so on
until the screen is crammed with Hammond's, elbowing each other for room.

                            NEW HAMMOND'S
          Hi, I'm John Hammond.  Hey, I'm John
          Hammond.  No, I am.  I am.

                            HAMMOND
          Come on, that's enough of this!  And I
          thought to reproduce myself I had to do it
          the old-fashioned way.

New mist fades out this show.  The lights go up.  Regis applauds.  Grant
joins in the laughter with Ellie and Gennaro.

Hammond jumps down from the stage and greets Gennaro and Regis.

                            HAMMOND
          That's all we've got so far.  A lot of
          fun, isn't it, Mr. Gennaro?

                            REGIS
          You bet!

Hammond greets Grant and Ellie warmly.  Then 
Hammond baits Grant.

                            HAMMOND
          It's been a long time, Alan.  I know the
          preceding was not your sort of enter-
          tainment.  Popular science -

                            GRANT
          No, I don't mind popular science.  I dislike
          the commercialization of science.  It breeds
          a sloppiness, a disregard for method.

                            HAMMOND
          Well, I don't disregard method.  But think
          of mutation - which is nothing more than
          sloppy communication on the cellular
          level.  Think how triumphant mutations
          have been in natural selection.

          Oh, but I know what you're saying.  It's
          true that I have never been afraid to make
          money with science.  I've always
          considered profit to be a measure of
          success, a barometer of public reaction.

                            GRANT
          Mr. Hammond, the essential truth of a
          scientific law ha
s nothing to do with
          public reaction.  Water freezes at
          thirty-two degrees, whether you pay for
          it or not.

Hammond turns to Gennaro.  Gennaro smiles nervously at their clash.

                            HAMMOND
          Donald, in bringing my old friend, Alan
          Grant, you've brought an excellent critic
          to observe the viability of my island and
          out venture.  I look forward to winning
          you over, Dr. Grant.

                            ELLIE
          Just what is it you're trying to clone?


EXT  A SPRAWLING LAWN - DAY

Outside, Hammond leads Gennaro, Grant and Ellie.  He points out the
staff living quarters, a group of graceful teepees.  Next to their
homes, WORKERS hang laundry and cook on grills.

They pass a large Mechanical Building.  The generator housed within is
very LOUD.  The wind increases, rippling clothes.

Suddenly, the SOUND of a speeding jeep.  Grant turns.

Racing across the rolling green landscape is A RED JEEP.  Muldoon is 
at
the steering wheel.  Two kids bounce happily around in the open jeep.
They are TIMMY, 9, and LEX, 6, brother and sister.  The jeep stops.

                            LEX
          Grandpa!

Hammond looks up, delighted.  Arms open.  Gennaro pulls him close.

                            GENNARO
              (incredulous)
          Mr. Hammond, this is a serious investiga-
          tion of the island, not a weekend
          excursion or a social outing.  We're
          talking about the safety of this place!

Hammond waves to the children.

                            HAMMOND
          I'm aware of that.  But I built this
          place for children.  You can't
          investigate it without their reactions.
          They're what this place is all about.

Hammond beams to Grant and Ellie and indicates the running kids.

                            HAMMOND
          My grandchildren.  Genetics were kind.
          They're more like my ex-wife than me.

Lex jumps right into her Grandpa's arms.  Timmy s
hyly walks up and
embraces him.  Hammond shines.  Gennaro holds in his fury.


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DAY

Hammond ushers his guests into his own richly appointed baronial suite.
Ellie looks out a small window at the tee-pees and the contrasting
lifestyle below.  She then focuses on the high fence, circling the
perimeter of Hammond's quarters.  Above is a skylight, with metal bars.

Grant whispers to her, indicating the obviously modified window frame.

                            GRANT
          Who makes a windows ... smaller?

Timmy smacks him forehead, points to Grant.

                            TIMMY
          I know you.  You wrote my book.  Lost
          World of The Dinosaurs.  It's awesome.

                            LEX
          Timmy's got dinosaurs on the brain.

                            GRANT
          Don't worry - he'll grow out of it.

                            ELLIE
          Dr. Grant's embarrassed that his book was
          so widely successful.  He wrote if for
          gra
duate students.

Hammond smiles intensely.  But he's patient.  He stands be a huge table
covered with a sumptuous velvet drape.

                            HAMMOND
          Although Dr. Grant suspects otherwise,
          this is not an ill-conceived, half-baked,
          poorly funded plan that I've headed.
          This is a plan to which I committed all
          of my personal resources, literally
          billions of dollars.  And Donald Gennaro
          here has kindly helped me raise that sum
          again from wealthy Japanese.  They love
          theme parks.  I have recruited pre-
          eminent scientific minds from hallowed
          universities and we've taken the time to
          do things right.

Lex peeks under the cloth.  Hammond smiles at her and recovers the table.

                            HAMMOND
          Jurassic Park is the most advanced
          amusement park in the world.  We work
          with genetics - life's essential building
          blocks - to create new 
worlds.  I set out
          to make biological attractions.  Living
          attractions.  Attractions so astonishing
          that they'd capture the imagination of
          the entire world.

                            GRANT
          What exactly do you mean ... biological
          attractions?

                            HAMMOND
          As you well know, long ago, creatures ten
          times larger than whales roamed our
          adolescent Earth.  And then mass,
          mysterious extinction created a time
          barrier unscalable until ... now.

BEAT.

                            GRANT
          Yes?

                            HAMMOND
          Dinosaurs.
              (superbly proud)
          I've been cloning dinosaurs!

CAMERA PUSHES IN on Grant's incredulous face.

Hammond whips off the drape, revealing a complex and detailed scale
model of the entire resort.

                            HAMMOND
          Ladies and Gentlemen, Jurassic Park.  Not
          a resort, not a scien
tific conservatory,
          just a little piece of pre-history that
          every child in the whole wide world will
          insist on visiting.

Hammond grins with delight.

                            GENNARO
          At least every rich child.

Grant and Ellie come forward to examine the model.  The kids crowd in.

CAMERA SNORKELS through the model - revealing different enclosures with
miniature dinosaurs, moats, fences, roads, a river.

                            HAMMOND
          Apatosaurs in the lowland.  Gallimimus in
          the grassy plain.  Dilophosaurus above
          the river.  The mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex!
          238 fabulous creatures so far!

                            TIMMY
          Real dinosaurs, Grandpa?  Don't they want
          to just kill each other?

Hammond excitedly punches a button - colored display grids light up.

                            HAMMOND
          Timmy, there's electric fences and moats
          and video surveillance at all times.
          There
 are monitors every hundred feet
          whatever we could plant them on the
          island.  A computer to tabulate it all.

                            ELLIE
          You created dinosaurs?  Who gave you the
          right to do that?

                            HAMMOND
          I didn't create them.  I found a way to
          wake them up, to stir them out of their
          prehistoric slumber.

                            GRANT
          We don't have the science.  There's no
          source of dinosaur DNA.

Hammond's proud, excited face shifts to one that divulges modestly.

                            HAMMOND
          Yes ... there is.


INT  HALLWAY, UPPER FLOOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY

Hammond leads Grant, Ellie, Gennaro, Timmy, and Lex out of an elevator
and down an endless corridor.  A WORKMAN ON CRUTCHES passes them.

They go through a series of security doors.  To get them open, Hammond
places his palm on a screen before each door.  Each time, it lights up
with an x-ray-like image of 
his hand and each door HISSES open.

CLOSEUP - Security x-ray. of Hammond's hand.  BEEP.  A red line writes
through the screen.  Can't get in.  Complaining, under his breath:

                            HAMMOND
          Glitches.

Hammond tries again.


INT  CONTROL ROOM - DAY

The door HISSES open, revealing an elaborate technology-crammed room.
In dim light, clusters of computer consoles and video monitors glow.

Nedry sits in a corner at a keyboard with a pile of papers next to him,
typing away.  JOHN ARNOLD, 45, park supervisor, sits directing the
activities of the park and chain-smoking.  There are large windows
looking out to the park, one of which is cracked and being replaced from
the outside by a TEAM OF WORKMEN.

Hammond wears a big smile as he leads in his entourage.  He's the
ringmaster.

                            HAMMOND
          And this is the right side of my brain.
          The entire park is safely controlled from
          here.  John Arnold, that genius over
          there, is the m
aster control operator.
              (with genuine concern)
          John, don't smoke so much, you're far too
          valuable a man to me.

                            ARNOLD
          Oh, you'd survive just fine without me.

Arnold exhales smoke and waves good-naturedly.  Nedry stares darkly at
Hammond, who ignores him.

                            HAMMOND
          Everything's controlled from here.
          Remote everything. Cars, feeding
          programs, medicine dispensers, fecal
          clean up - and that can be tons in a park
          like this.  We run this place with twenty
          workers.  This computer does it all.  And
          it polices each and every single animal
          out there.

                            ELLIE
              (whispers to Grant)
          Who polices the computer?

Hammond points up.  Overlooking the control room and the park is a
raised platform with a huge chair, like a throne in a court.  A large
video screen faces this chair.

                     
       HAMMOND
          That's where I will watch the astonished
          watchers.  Okay, let's go.

They practically race as a group to keep up with Hammond.  The security
door seals shit, leaving Nedry and Arnold alone again.

                            NEDRY
          Thanks for the kind word, Mr. Hammond.

                            ARNOLD
          Come on, Dennis, he knows your technical
          contributions have made it all possible.

                            NEDRY
          Right.


BACK ON HALLWAY -

Hammond and his group turn off the corridor and reach a door marked:
CAUTION: Teratogenic Substances.  Timmy backs off, grabs Lex's arm.

                            TIMMY
          That stuff turns you into a mutant!

He contorts his face into strange shapes.  As Hammond leads them all in
Lex pulls on his pocket.

                            HAMMOND
          Don't mind the signs.  They're only legal
          precautions.

Gennaro frowns.  The door opens and Lex peeks in.

                  
          HAMMOND
          My laboratory, Lex.  It will be yours and
          Timmy's someday.


INT  AMBER ROOM, LABORATORY - CONTINUING ACTION

Grant and Ellie share a baffled look.  Grant stares.

Grant's POV - PAN ACROSS a room filled with honey-colored glowing stones
arranged on glass shelves in large pull-out trays.  Each stone is tagged
and numbered.

Grant leans down, studying the stones.  He bumps right into Gennaro.
Lex jumps excitedly.

                            LEX
          It's ... gold!

                            TIMMY
          It's amber.  Fossilized tree sap.

                            LEX
          Grandpa found gold.

Grant shushes the kids and looks to Hammond.

                            HAMMOND
          You're both right.  Amber is our gold.
          The alpha or our alchemic alphabet.  The
          precious course of our genetic material.
          You already know amber is the fossilized
          resin of prehistoric tree sap, of course.

Grant and Ellie nod impatiently. 
 Hammond sets the scene.

                            HAMMOND
          Imagine - millions of years ago, tree sap
          flowing over insects, as it does now as I
          speak, in thousands of forests and backyard
          trees everywhere.  Imagine that ancient sap
          trapping a little struggling insect and
          consuming it in a syrupy death.  Millions
          and millions of years pass and we come
          along and discover this prehistoric insect.
          If we're lucky, he's perfectly preserved in
          a fossil form inside the hardened sap which
          is now amber.  And as we examine more and
          more amber, we find many perished insects,
          including among them, biting insects -

                            GRANT
          Like mosquitos -

                            HAMMOND
          Like mosquitos, precisely, Dr. Grant.

                            GRANT
          Mosquitos that sucked the blood of
          dinosaurs.  That's your source of DNA
        
  material?  My God!  It just might work.


INT  EXTRACTION ROOM, LABORATORY

A TECHNICIAN carefully positions a piece of amber under a fine-pointed
drill.  With a nod, the technician's goggles drop from his forehead onto
his eyes and he starts up the drill.  Hammond yells over the loud WHIRR.

                            HAMMOND
          The extraction room speaks for itself.

CLOSE ON - drillbit boring into the amber.  Orange fleck fly.

                            GRANT
          It does?

The technician shuts the drill.  Placing his hands into a mounted pair
of gloves, he operates an automated pair of needle-nose pliers to
carefully lift out the remains of a mosquito.  He drops this bug on a
slide and places this slide on a tray full of such slides.

                            LEX
          That's a million year old mosquito?

A conveyor belt starts, carrying this tray on to the NEXT TECHNICIAN.
The group follows.  This technician puts the first slide under a
microscope.  Grant watches on a video monito
r as the tech inserts a long
needle into the prehistoric bug.

                            ELLIE
          Put in a piece of amber, find a mosquito,
          drill it out.  Right?

                            HAMMOND
          Right.  You are witnessing the extraction
          of tissue from the thorax of this humble
          insect.  If this mosquito has ingested any
          foreign red blood cells - say it bit a
          hadrosaur or a stegosaurus or a T-Rex -  we
          will extract those blood cells and obtain
          paleo-DNA, the how-to-build instruction
          book of an extinct creature.
          So you see, Ellie, I'm not creating dino-
          saurs. Fossils left behind the information,
          the map of how to bring them back.  I'm
          helping them escape from the confined of
          time.

                            GRANT
          But even thousands of mosquitos wouldn't
          give you enough tissue to determine a
          complete DNA strand.

                 
           HAMMOND
          Right you are, Dr. Grant!  More like
          hundreds of thousands of mosquitos are
          necessary to provide even a partial
          strand of DNA.  And without a complete
          strand, we don't have a dinosaur.


INT  GENETICS ROOM

A LOUD HUMMING SOUND.  Along the walls are rows of waist-high stainless
steel boxes.  In the room's center are two six-foot-high round towers.
At a single console, a man studies a monitor.

DR. WU, 35, looks up from his study and beams at his guests.  He jumps
up and knocks over his cup of coffee.  ASSISTANTS clean the area as Wu
comes forward and actually hugs Grant, much to Grant's embarrassment.

                            HAMMOND
          Ah, I knew you two would hit it off!  Dr.
          Grant, this is Dr. Wu, my chief geneticist.

                            WU
          Finally, you are here!  I've been working
          without the encouragement of my peers for
          too long.  Welcome, welcome!

He kisses Ellie, who takes 
it in stride.  Gennaro, We already knows.

                            WU
          Mr. Hammond never lets me publish and
          he's interested only in results, not in
          science.

                            HAMMOND
          Don't forget to thank me when you pick up
          your Nobel prize.

Hammond and Wu resume the tour.

                            HAMMOND
          You are standing in the middle of the
          most powerful genetics factory created
          since the expulsion from Eden.

                            WU
          These are Hamachi-Hood automated gene
          sequencers, those are Cray XMP's,
          supercomputers that take DNA information
          and organize it.  In this room, we take
          fragmented or incomplete DNA strands and
          compare them to other incomplete strands.

                            HAMMOND
          It's like finding the missing pieces of a
          jigsaw puzzle.

                            WU
          The computers make sever
al trillion
          calculations to provide us with a
          complete DNA strand - the genetic code of
          an extinct animal.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY

A vast room bathed in infrared light, filled with long tables.  The
first tables have rows and rows of centrifuges, each bearing dozens of
test tubes.  Wu leads the group.

                            GRANT
          Okay, you have your "complete" DNA
          strand.  How do you grow it?

                            WU
          We use unfertilized crocodile ova as our
          breeding medium.

                            HAMMOND
          Our primordial soup.

                            GRANT
          And how do you know what it is you're
          growing?

Wu shrugs.

                            WU
          Well, we have computer techniques to try
          and map out finds on an evolutionary
          basis.  But mostly, we just grow it and
          find out what it is.  If it's something
          we're interested in, and it 
survives, we
          keep it.

Grant and Ellie share a concerned look.

                            GENNARO
          And if you're not interested?

Wu indicates a cabinet of chemicals with skull-and-crossbone warnings.
Timmy regards the poison with excitement.

Lex calls from deeper in the room.

                            LEX
          Come look!

Here, plastic eggs lay on the long tables, their pale outlines obscured
by a grey mist that covers the tables.  The eggs are all gently rocking
as TECHNICIANS roam up and down the aisles.

Hammond walks ahead of the group.  As Wu speaks, Hammond listens and
enjoys it as though he's hearing it for the first time.

                            WU
          This is the incubation room.  We keep the
          temperature at ninetynine degrees and a
          relative humidity of one hundred percent.

                            GRANT AND TIMMY
          Jurassic atmosphere.

Timmy smiles at Grant.  Hammond winks at Timmy.

                            WU
          We
 also run a high oxygen concentration,
          up to thirty-three percent, so if you
          feel faint, please tell me right away.

Lex feigns a faint, Timmy cracks a small smile. They move forward,
waist-deep in the mist.  A strange green light emanates from the
incubators.  Lex is half-consumed by the mist. She mimics the witch.

                            LEX
          I'm ... melting!

Ellie laughs and pulls Lex close.

                            WU
          Reptile eggs contain large amounts of
          yolk but no water at all.  The embryos
          must extract water from the surrounding
          environment.

                            GRANT
          That's why you create the mist.

Wu nods.  Hammond just enjoys the scene as Grant and Ellie watch a
thermal sensor moving from one egg to the next, touching each with a
flexible wand, beeping.  Lex and Timmy let their hands glide over the
sides of the green glowing incubators fully awed by the strange, big
eggs they hold.

                   
         WU
          Children, please do not touch!  The eggs
          are permeable to skin oils.

Grant that very close to an egg.  He sniffs it.

                            GRANT
          What kind of eggs are these?  Are these
          shells plastic?

                            WU
          Yes, they are,  The embryos are
          mechanically inserted and then hatched in
          this room.  But we've managed to
          sufficiently mimic the actual biological
          process - these creatures rupture the
          plastic membrane that they're contained
          in when they're born.  Like real births.

They reach an endless row of incubators, lined up along the wall,
beneath a viewing area like those found in an OB-GYN ward.

                            WU
          Eggs that are determined viable spend
          their last couple days in our specially-
          designed incubators, which help
          accelerate the pre-natal developmental
          stages.  Which is interesting becaus
e
          we're having a problem with the adult
          animals -

Hammond claps a hand over Wu's mouth and laughs.

                            HAMMOND
          There's no problem Dr. Wu can't handle.
          Now who wants to see the real thing?

As they exit the CAMERA PANS the misty aisles, studying the eggs.


EXT  VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY

Blue shadows of clouds sweep across an expansive green hill in front of
the Visitor's Center.

Grant and Hammond make their way down below to the loading area for the
park tour.  A little ahead is Gennaro and Ellie.  Gennaro chatters on
while Ellie energetically explores the area, looking at the plants.

                            GENNARO
          ... so naturally, Hammond's going to
          present everything in the best light.  I
          need to know that this park is safe.

                            ELLIE
          I'll tell you something that troubles me
          from the start.  The carnivores are all
          well-fed and kept separated from their

          natural prey.  That'll keep 'em alive,
          but it won't keep 'em happy.

                            GENNARO
          How do you mean?

                            ELLIE
          The carnivores will want to hunt.  It's
          an instinct.  And that instinct will have
          to be satisfied or suppressed.

FURTHER UP THE HILL, moving slowly, Hammond eyes the pair suspiciously.

                            HAMMOND
          Gennaro is putting negative ideas into
          Ellie's head.  He's a naysayer.  I have
          no affection for that type of thinking.

                            GRANT
          Don't worry.  Ellie makes her own
          judgments.

At the base of the hill Timmy and Lex toss a baseball.


EXT  TOUR START - DAY

The group gathers.  TWO ELECTRIC CARS glide to a stop behind them.
Regis leans out of the first one.

                            REGIS
          Hey!  Great day for a tour!

                            GENNARO
          Looks like rain to me.

         
                   REGIS
          No!  I told the rain-god to hold it off
          till we got back.

The kids pile in next to Regis and explore the high-tech cars.  Timmy
finds a a pair of very think, strange-looking goggles with dials on top.

Grant, Ellie, and Gennaro climb in the second car.

                            HAMMOND
          Kids, mind Mr. Regis.  He's in charge now.

The cars begin to move and pass Hammond.  He waves.

Gennaro looks back as the cars turn into the brush.  Hammond waves.

                            HAMMOND
          Gennaro, for once in your life, let
          something really move you.

In the cruiser, Gennaro rubs his neck.  He turns to Grant.

                            GENNARO
          Ever get the feeling we're just Hammond's
          damn guinea pigs?

                            GRANT
          I like to wait and see.

Ellie motions ahead, with excitement and apprehension, to a huge gate.
Regis and the kids wave behind to Grant, Ellie and Gennaro.

The gate's doo
rs swing open and the cruisers move forward.  The kids
squeal out a YA-HOO that floats through the air to Grant.  But Grant
wears a cautious face, his skeptical eyes scan the landscape.

A FANFARE of trumpets and then a pre-recorded voice speaks from a
console in each cruiser.  Video screens display a welcome message.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          Welcome to Jurassic Park.  You are now
          entering the lost world of the
          prehistoric past, a world of mighty
          creatures long gone from the face of the
          earth, which you are privileged to see
          for the first time ...

Regis uses his walkie-talkie to contact Grant's cruiser.

                            REGIS (ON WALKIE)
          That's Richard Kiley.  We spared no
          expense.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          We'll begin our tour today with the
          herbivores ...


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, FIRST TOUR STOP - DAY

Between massive tree trunks, a spectacular view:  stor
m clouds touch
mountaintops.  Below, the lagoon ripples in pink crescents.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          ... and the grasses are a species of
          juniper, and samples can be purchased at
          the gift shop.  Now, if everyone will
          take a look to the right ...

All eyes swing that way.  Grant doesn't see a thing.  Nor do the others.

AHEAD, Timmy pulls the binoculars out of the equipment pouch and studies
the location.  Lex grabs the night goggles.  Timmy pulls them from her.

                            REGIS
          Look ...

                            LEX AND TIMMY
          I don't see anything.  Do you see
          anything?  There's nothing there.

                            REGIS
          Something's out there ...

IN THE SECOND CAR, a fly buzzes on Grant's windshield.  Grant hangs out
his window almost sniffing the air for some movement.  Nothing.

SUDDENLY the trees in front of them move!  A deep trumpeting SOUND and
TWO BRACHIOSAURS rumble away fr
om the side of the road.  The ground
SHAKES as they walk, their BELLOWING fills the air.  Led by Grant, the
passengers rise through the open top of their Land Cruisers, to look up
at the dinosaurs far above.

DROOPING FROM ABOVE, leaves and little branches shower on Grant.  Utter
amazement fills Grant's face, then his mouth breaks into a giant smile
then a laugh.  He simply can't believe his eyes. His laugh becomes
raucous and euphoric.

                            GRANT
          Ellie!  Can you imagine the excavation
          team seeing this!

Behind him, Ellie's whole person is awestruck, immobile.  Gennaro
squints, straining to make sense of this unbelievable reality.

IN THE CAR AHEAD, Lex and Timmy stare open-mouthed.  Regis looks at the
animal and then at the group's reverie.  He smiles knowingly: he's been
there, too.  He bends and whispers:

                            REGIS
          Congratulations. You're the first kids in
          the whole wide world ever to see real
          dinosaurs.

The
 kids look up at Regis with wonder in their eyes.

GRANT CAN'T stop laughing.  Still chewing, a brachiosaur cranes down to
peer at this laughing man.  The brachiosaur's huge head stops inches
away from Grant.  Grant, awestruck, stares and them -

CLOSE ON - Grant as his eyes slowly roll back and ... he faints.

The dinosaur casually moves away as Ellie comes to Grant's aid.

                            ELLIE
          Alan?  Alan?
              (sort of delighted)
          He fainted!

Gennaro waves to Regis that all is okay.  Grant slowly revives.  He
looks back at the brachiosaur, groggily, smiling away.  He looks at
Ellie and their eyes linger on each other longer than usual, sharing a
look of serene delight.

Gennaro plops back in his seat and ponders the scene before him.  A
glazed look fills his face.

                            GENNARO
          My God, we're going to make a fortune
          here!

CAMERA PUSHES IN on the majestic, gentle beauty of the Brachiosaurs.
JUNGLE SOUNDS DOMINATE, growing l
ouder and louder.


INT CONTROL ROOM - DAY

Hammond sits at his throne, happily watching the huge video screen which
displays the tour group.  He laughs raucously and calls to Arnold.

                            HAMMOND
          He fainted.  I've waited fifteen years to
          impress that young man.

                            ARNOLD
          Oh Mr. Hammond, I'm sorry to interrupt
          you, but Muldoon needs you by the pit.

                            HAMMOND
          Oh, balls.


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, SECOND TOUR STOP - DAY

The cruisers come to a stop.  In the distance, A HERD OF GALLIMIMUS
graze.  They stand on their hind legs to get at high palm trees, then
drop gracefully down on all fours to chew.  BABY GALLIMIMUS scamper
around the adults, eating leaves that drop from the larger animals.

                             PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          ... Gallimimus, known as the ostrich
          dinosaur for the shape of its shoulders,
          have a very strong nesting instinct ...

Grant do
esn't listen.  He is simply intoxicated with the pastoral beauty
of the gentle, grazing dinosaurs.  Suddenly, he looks away with a deep
concern.  Ellie looks at him questioningly.

                            GRANT
          Ellie?  What the hell are we going to do
          with the rest of our lives?

Ellie smiles at him, puzzled.

                            ELLIE
          What to you mean?

                            GRANT
          Can't you see it, Ellie?  We're the ones
          that are extinct now.


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, THIRD TOUR STOP - DAY

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          ... lots more to see in the herbivore
          section of our park.  But as we come
          alongside out Jurassic jungle river to the
          left, let's try and catch a glimpse of a
          very unusual and dangerous carnivore.
          Look across the river and above ...

A lovely mossy clearing.  And to the side, bounded just by a thicket of
bushes, a precipitous drop to a tropical river, lus
h and clear.  The
river runs fast but it is narrow.  On the other side is a sharp rise.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          And there they are!

Standing on that natural pedestal and watching our tour come to a stop
are TWO DILOPHOSAURUS, man-sized dinosaurs with gills that hang around
their necks.  Grant and Ellie chime in with the pre-recorded voice.

                            ALL THREE
          Dilophosaurus!

Timmy and Lex point enthusiastically.  Regis holds them down with a
gentle but restraining arm.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          Dilophosaurus is one of the earliest
          carnivores.  Scientists once thought
          their jaw muscles were too weak to kill,
          but now, through the miracle of their
          cloning, we know Dilophosaurs spit venom,
          a poison which causes blindness and then
          unconsciousness.

Their distinctive HOOT drifts across the afternoon air.

                            GENNARO
          Poisonous d
inosaurs, there's a liability
          issue without a lot of precedent.

CLOSEUP of the nearly motionless Dilophosaurus.  One yawns wide.

                            GRANT
              (assessing)
          It's like a Gila monster of a cobra.  It's
          a poison ...

                            ELLIE
          Spitter!

The Spitters bound off as Grant watches, transfixed.  A flock of birds
burst from a tree and cross the sky.  Trees filter the light.

                            ELLIE
          Are we dreaming all this?


EXT  RAPTOR PIT - DAY

A big hole in the ground, covered with a think wire mesh.  Suddenly, a
dark claw pushes against the wire web. A SHOWER OF SPARKS.  A SCREECH
animals GROWL and SNARL.  An animal slams its face into the mesh.  SPARKS
illuminate a set of RAZOR-SHARP TEETH.

Muldoon stands next to the pit, carefully loading an assault rifle.
Hammond comes in a hurry.  Muldoon sees Hammond and puts down the rifle.
He walks to Hammond, talking before he gets there.

               
             MULDOON
          These raptors are too damn dangerous. One
          of them tunneled out this morning.  He
          ripped a boy's arm off before I could get
          a bullet in him.

                            HAMMOND
          A bullet?  Muldoon - no!  Now what?  I
          have five left?

                            MULDOON
          John, they're mean as scorpions and smart
          as chimps.  Their little fingers make
          them natural cage-breakers.  We should
          terminate the raptor program.  They're
          just too smart.  Too damn smart.

                            HAMMOND
          Oh balls.  I will not terminate the raptors
          just because they're behaving normally.
          They're hunters.  Why can't we contain them
          properly?

Hammond starts to walk away.  Muldoon follows, he's not finished at all.

                            MULDOON
          John, remember back in '88, when we
          started to build the containment devices?
         
 We ordered cattle prods, tasers, guns
          that blow out electric nets.  They're all
          too slow for these guys. If we're going
          to keep the raptors, I want TOW missiles
          and laser-guided devices.

Hammond laughs warmly.  He pats Muldoon on the back.

                            HAMMOND
          It's just a zoo, Muldoon.  A zoo.  Figure
          out a way to contain them.  And we'll sit
          down and have a nice long discussion about
          raptors - after my guests leave, okay?

Hammond walks away.  Muldoon stares after him, jingling keys in his
hand.  Muldoon lumps over to A WORKER.

                            MULDOON
          Okay!  Get a 'dozer, start digging round
          the pit.  We're gonna bury some fence.
          And wear your rifle when you're working!


INT  CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON

Hammond enters and crosses to his throne.  Hammond swivels to Arnold who
exhales smoke.  Nedry looks over, keeps typing.

                            HAMMOND
          Wh
ere are they?  Punch 'em up.

                            ARNOLD
          They'll be by the trike's in a moment.
          Trike's sick again.

                            HAMMOND
          How can you say it so matter-of-factly?
          The trike's.  You casually accept it, but
          I never can.  You know what it means when
          you say "by the trikes"?  "By the
          trike's" means that they're out there by
          the species:  triceratops horridus.  It
          astounds me every time what I've done
          here.  What magic, what alchemy.  We
          turned a piece of a rock into a dinosaur.
          I will never be complacent about that.

Arnold smiles and punches a button.  WE HEAR the pre-recorded tour voice
and some chatter of the kids.

EAVESDROPPING on the tour IS INTERRUPTED by a radio transmission to the
control room.  Arnold slides over and shuts off the tour monitoring.
The picture on the video screen is now of a cargo boat at a dock.

                            RADIO
 
         Hello, John.  This is the Anne B at the
          dock.  I'm looking at the storm patterns
          just south of us.  Requesting permission
          to leave before unloading the last three
          food containers.

Nedry looks up quickly, listening carefully.

                            RADIO
          Don't want to be stuck here if this chop
          gets much worse.

Hammond reacts with quiet dismay.  Nedry quietly gets up.

                            NEDRY
          Coffee anyone?

He's ignored.  Arnold defers to Hammond who leans to the microphone.

                            HAMMOND
          Hello skipper, John Hammond, how are you
          tonight?  I certainly don't want to
          imperil anyone.  But can you give us one
          more container of food?  Then we'll feel
          comfortable is the storm delays your
          return.  Could you help us out here?  Of
          course, if it looks too choppy just go,
          but you'd be doing us a big favor.

                 
           RADIO
          Well ... we'll do our best, sir.  We'll
          get one more container off. How's that?

Hammond thanks him and signs off.  Arnold looks at the darkening clouds.


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, FOURTH TOUR STOP - LATE AFTERNOON

The cars twist through dense vegetation with a GRINDING of gears.  The
first car comes to a jerky stop.

There is a huge TRICERATOPS lying on its side, moving very slowly,
breathing laboriously.  HARDING, the tall, balding park vet, kneels on
the ground.  He peers into the animal's mouth with a large flashlight.

Before the second car can stop completely, Grant leaps out, races to the
trike.  Regis tries to restrain the kids but they chase Grant and Ellie.

Grant joins Harding on the ground.  The trike lets out a low MOAN.
She's too sick to move.  Ellie and Lex squat by the animal.

                            LEX
          I feel so sorry for her.  She's so sick.

                            VET
          We don't know what's wrong with Freda.
          Every six we
eks she gets like this.

                            REGIS
          Oh, she'll be up and around in no time.
          After a big night, I feel the same way.

Grant very gently opens the Trike's mouth.

                            GRANT
          Poor girl.  What's the matter?  Ellie,
          look at this.

A dark purple tongue droops limply from her mouth.  Ellie shines the
light on it, illuminating silvery blisters.  Gennaro turns away.

                            ELLIE
          Microvesicles.  Interesting.

Grant scratches one of the blisters with his ball-point pen.  It oozes.
The kids share a grossed-out look.

                            LEX
          Doesn't she have a mommy and a daddy?

                            HARDING
          We make these dinosaurs in the lab,
          sweetheart.  But they do form attachments.
          Freda has a little one that follows her
          around, thinks Freda's his mom.

Grant starts to look around.

                            ELLIE
          What does sh
e eat?  Where does she feed?

                            HARDING
          Animal this size takes in a minimum of
          six hundred pounds of plants a day.  We
          truck in hay and meadow grasses seven
          times a day.  That's all she touches.

Grant studies the nearby grass and bushes.  Timmy quietly follows Grant.

Ellie lifts a huge eyelid on the triceratops.  A runny eye just stares.

Grant comes up triumphantly with a bouquet of weeds clutched in his
hand.  These weeds have little purple berries.  Ellie looks over.

                            ELLIE
          West Indian Lilacs!

                            GRANT
          These'd give anybody a stomachache.

                            HARDING
          I'm telling you, the animals don't eat
          don't eat that stuff.

Regis keeps a babysitter's eye on the kids.  Timmy comes up with a
handful of smooth stones.  He approaches Grant shyly.

                            TIMMY
          Dr. Grant, sir?  How 'bout these?
          There'
s lots of little piles of these?

Grant fingers one distractedly, then suddenly comes to attention.

                            GRANT
          Hey, Ellie take a look at his.  Good
          work, Timmy.

Ellie gets up, brushes herself off, comes over and examines the stone.

                            ELLIE
          Extremely smooth.  Purple stains, could
          be those lilac berries.

She and Grant smile and each other and nod.  Gennaro is curious.

                            HARDING
          I don't get it.

                            GRANT
          Looks like your trike swallows stones to
          help her digest her food.  Walking
          around, she crushes berries against the
          stones.  And even just a little crushed
          berry is eventually enough,

                            ELLIE
          So, she poisons herself periodically.

                            HARDING
          Bet we tested her saliva for any trace of -

                            GRANT
          But with th
e stones, she swallows them
          and probably bypasses any mucosal
          contact.  Straight to the stomach.  I
          would test her excrement.

                            LEX
          Yo, yuk!

A light RAIN begins.  Automatically, with a soft hiss, the glass roofs
of the cruisers slide shit.  Gennaro taps Regis and indicates the cars.

                            GENNARO
          Hey Regis, where are your rain gods?
          It's gonna pour.  Let's finish our tour.

Grant agrees, heads for the cruisers.  He turns and looks for Ellie.
Ellie stands by the Trike.  She gives Grant a meaningful look.

                            ELLIE
          I'm staying.

Grant smiles at her decision.

                            GRANT
          Soil samples?

                            ELLIE
          You read my mind.
              (confidentially)
          I think she's sicker then they're saying.
          Her skin is dry and flaky.  And her gums
          are pale.  I'm going to talk to Dr. Wu.

        
                    GRANT
          Good idea.  I'll keep my eyes open.

Gennaro climbs in with Grant.  The two cruisers start off and Timmy
turns backward to stare wistfully at Grant.  Regis and Lex wave to the
Trike.  Grant looks back to Ellie who has already begun to work.

ON TRIKE - a mosquito lands on its back.  The trike's tail slaps it dead.


INT  MACHINE ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

With difficulty, Nedry shoves his large body down the crawl space behind
a large rack of electronic equipment.  He stops and uses a suction cup
device to lift a section of the tiled floor.  He gropes among cables and
pulls out a small wireless radio.  He transmits:

                            NEDRY (INTO RADIO)
          Jim, what the hell's with you  ... I know
          a storm's coming, I can't ... it's all so
          tightly planned ... that's not enough ...
          ok, twenty minutes, I'll be there.  Damn!

Nedry returns the radio to its hiding place.  He sucks in his gut to
make the crawl out of  the narrow space.


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, T-REX FEEDING AREA - DUSK

The cruisers stop on the rise of a hill.  They over look a forested area,
sloping down to the edge of the lagoon.

                            TOUR
          The mighty T-Rex arose late in dinosaur
          history.  Dinosaurs ruled the earth for a
          hundred and twenty million years, but
          there were tyrannosaurs for only the last
          fifteen million years of that period ...

Farther south, they see the graceful necks of the brachiosaurs standing
at the water's edge.  Their bodies, mirrored in the moving surface,
break apart with the continuing drops of rain.  Hear lightning rhythmic-
ally pulses the sky.  All is quiet except for the soft drone of cicadas
and the tapping of light rain.

Regis calls Grant on the walkie-talkie.

                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
          You know, Dr. Grant, Hammond likes to
          come here in the evening and just sit.

                            GRANT (OVER WALKIE)
          Where is the T-
Rex?

                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
          Good question.

ON GRANT - as he takes that in, nodding to himself. Studies the land.

                            GRANT
          Maybe she's down hunting apatosaurs.

OVER WALKIE - Regis laughs, his voice tinny over the radio.

                            REGIS (OVER WALKIE)
          Would if she could, believe me.  Some-
          times she stands by the lagoon and stares
          at those animals, and wiggles those
          little forearms of hers in frustration.
          But the T-Rex territory is completely
          enclosed with trenches and fences.
          Believe me, she can't go anywhere.

                            GRANT
          Then where is she?

They hear A SOFT BLEATING.  In the center of the field, a small cage
rises into view, lifted on hydraulics from underground.  The cage bars
slide down.  A GOAT remains tethered in the field, BLEATING plaintively.

The tour group stares out their windows, expectantly.


BACK ON CONTRO
L ROOM -

Hammond, pleased, watches the giant screen that displays the tour group.
Muldoon limps into the control room.  Arnold looks over.

                            MULDOON
          Just checking in.  Everything ok?

                            HAMMOND
          Look at them.  Leaning out the windows,
          so eager.  They can't wait to see it.
          They have come for the danger.

                            MULDOON
          That's what I'm afraid of.

Muldoon twirls the keys on his fingers and watches the land cruisers.


BACK ON CRUISERS, T-REX FEEDING AREA -

Grant watches quietly.

The BLEATING becomes louder, more insistent.  The goat tugs frantically
at its tether, racing back and forth, kicking.

                            LEX
          What's going to happen to the goat?  Is
          the T-Rex gonna come eat the goat?

Grant senses something.  He sits straight up.  Looks out intently.

                            GRANT
          He's here.

The goat is tethered in the middle of the fi
eld, thirty yards from the
nearest tree.  Grant scans the tree for the T-Rex.

The goat senses something too.  It struggles and strains, bleating
frantically.  Suddenly the mechanical SOUND of the cage coming up.  Its
bars surround the goat with safety once again.

                            REGIS
          Looks like the Rex will have its snack a
          little later today.

                            RECORDED VOICE
          The sensors don't see the Rex around.
          She usually comes within five minutes of
          hearing dinner. If she doesn't, that
          means she's sleeping - we might have
          access to her at the picnic area.

Lex and Timmy let out a sigh of relief.  The tension is gone.

                            LEX
          I didn't want to see him get eaten.  I
          liked the goat.


BACK IN THE CONTROL ROOM -

Hammond studies the large video monitor.  He watches Grant and Gennaro.
Their voices are heard in the control room.

                            GENNARO (MONITOR
ED)
          What is a carnivore got out?

                            GRANT (MONITORED)
          There'd be no stopping it.  Huge, with no
          natural enemies, and a suppressed hunting
          instinct.

Hammond glares.  Arnold, aware, shuts off the screen.

                            HAMMOND
          Damn those people.  They are so negative.

                            ARNOLD
          It's natural.  They can't fully
          appreciate that we've engineered the
          animals and the park for total safety.

                            HAMMOND
          They comb this island like a bunch of
          accountants.  They don't experience the
          wonder, the awe of it all.

                            ARNOLD
          You can't make people experience wonder.

Hammond gets up and stands before the big windows overlooking the park.
The quartz FLOODLIGHTS outside their area COME ON with a rosy glow and
the dark jungle is opened again to their inspection.

At his console, Nedry looks at Hamm
ond.  Hammond stares out the window.
The RAIN PICKS UP and bounces off the window.  Hammond speaks to Arnold
without turning.

                            HAMMOND
          It's like the Garden of Eden out there.
          This is the most beautiful time of day.

                            ARNOLD
          Better rout the tour back.  They can
          start again sun-up tomorrow morning.

                            HAMMOND
          Yup.  Call the kitchen.  Those kids'll be
          hungry when they get in.

Arnold picks up the phone.  STATIC.  He glances over at Nedry.

                            NEDRY
          Sorry 'bout that.  I've taken all the
          lines to upload some data.

Hammond's annoyed, but contains it.  Arnold looks at Nedry, who smiles.

                            NEDRY
          I'll clear a couple of lines for you at
          the end of the next transmission, sir.
          Here you go now, this will make it all
          better, Mr. Hammond.

Nedry punches in a code.

CLOSE ON 
- Nedry's fat finger punching a last key.

CLOSE ON - amber video display terminal as a countdown begins.

As the screen counts down from ten to zero, Nedry peers at Hammond with
a steely glint in his eyes.

BACK ON SCREEN - three, two, one, the countdown hits zero.

Nedry's data-filled screen blinks off.  Nedry looks up to the rack of
monitors.  Unnoticed by Hammond or Arnold two more monitors go blank.
Then a third one.


BACK  ON CRUISERS, REST AREA - NIGHT

The electric cars turn up into a scenic area high above the rest of the
park.  HUGE QUARTZ LIGHTS REVEAL a dramatic view down to the ocean.
There the supply ship, the ANNE B, unloads its last crates.

RAIN INCREASES.  On the other side of the road are picnic tables, an
unfinished snack bar and rest rooms.  To the side of this rest area is a
view of the interior of the island.  A guard-rail separates visitors

To the other side of the rest area is a concrete moat and in the back of
this is a tall, electrified fence.  Surrounding the electric fence is a

smaller protective fence.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          ... enjoy a healthy snack.  This is also
          a good time to ...

                            LEX
          Hey, is that bathroom working?

                            REGIS
          Sure.
              (he uses his walkie)
          Rest stop.

The kids take off towards the bathroom, running through the rain.  Grant
gets out of his cruiser, strides to Regis.  He indicates the fence.

                            GRANT
          Is that still the T-Rex paddock?

                            REGIS
          Yes.  But she never comes here.  I don't
          know why not.  Probably too much
          construction.

GENNARO, jacket over his head against the rain, looks down to the ocean.

GENNARO'S POV - THE ANNE B UNLOADS he last cargo crate.

GRANT LOOKS at the concrete moat.  Studies its deep curve.  He looks up
at the tell electrical fence with its 10,000 volt warning.  He sees
conventional power lines on the opposite sid
e of the road.

CAMERA EXAMINES the empty cruisers.  Inside, the pre-recorded voice is
chatting on.  It slows eerily and stops.  Video SCREENS BLINK OUT.


BACK ON CONTROL ROOM -

Nedry yawns loudly.

                            NEDRY
          Yup!  Looks like a never-ending weekend
          for me.  I'm gonna get a Diet Coke.
          Don't touch my console, ok?  Line will
          be clear in five minutes.

Nedry leaves.  Hammond swings around and growls under his breath.

                            HAMMOND
          Slob!

                            ARNOLD
          Well, at least he knows what he's doing.


INT  UPPER FLOOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - NIGHT

Nedry races through the series of security doors.  He ignores the
security x-ray device and just SHOVES each door open with his hand.


BACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA -

THE QUARTZ LIGHTS GO OUT, leaving the group in shadowy darkness and now
STEADY RAIN.  There's a ripple of surprise from the group.  Regis rounds
them all up and directs them back into the 
cruisers.

                            REGIS
          Everything's just fine.  It's a temporary
          glitch due to the rain.  No doubt,
          they're going to re-rout some circuits
          back at the mainframe.  We'll have the
          power back on in moments.  Let's get back
          in the cruisers, they may start up, and
          I'd like us all to be seated in them.

The cruisers are STILL.  IN THE REAR CRUISER, Gennaro turns to Grant.

                            GENNARO
          I knew we shouldn't have kids here.

A vivid FLASH of LIGHTNING.  IN THE FIRST CAR:  Lex covers her eyes.
Then she looks up at Regis with a frightful face.

                            LEX
          Mr. Regis, are dinosaurs ... nocturnal?

                            REGIS
          No, darling, of course not.

                            LEX
          Mr. Regis?  What's ... nocturnal?

Another LIGHTNING FLASH.  Lex cries.  Regis comforts her.

                            REGIS
          Don't you worry about d
inosaurs.  They're
          all very safe in their paddocks just like
          animals in a big, strong zoo.  They're not
          going anywhere we don't tell them to go.

Timmy looks out the window excitedly.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - NIGHT

All those eggs on tables.  No moving sensors.  Nedry pulls a portable
incubator away from the dozens lined up against the wall.  Its
electrical cord goes flying.  Furiously, Nedry fills the incubator with
eggs, one after the other.

                            NEDRY
          Okay, little ones!  Here we go!

Nedry grabs the handles of the incubator and runs with it.  The
incubator careens on one wheel as he turns the corner and exits.


BACK ON CONTROL ROOM -

Hammond looks out the large window as the LIGHTS EXTINGUISH.  He twirls.

                            HAMMOND
          What's going on, Arnold?  I want those
          lights on.  I don't want my grandchildren
          scared.

                            ARNOLD
          Jesus, the computer's gone
 down.

                            HAMMOND
          Well, I want the computer up.  This is
          the wrong weekend for glitches.

Arnold still examines his console.  He looks out with worry.

                            ARNOLD
          That's not the worst of it.

                            HAMMOND
          Oh yeah?  Please tell me what's worse
          than the lights going out?

Wu smashes through the door.

                            WU
          All the security doors are open.  Someone
          has been in my laboratory and the eggs
          have been disturbed.

The camera pushes in on Hammond's face.

                            HAMMOND
          Where the hell is Nedry?  Where is he?
          Did anybody check the damn john?

Hammond storms out.


INT  CORRIDOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - CONTINUING ACTION

Hammond enters the hall.  Muldoon, racing from the other direction, yells:

                            MULDOON
          John, the generator's shut down.  Who cut
          the power?

     
                       HAMMOND
          Arnold's on it.  You go out and bring
          back the tour right away.  I don't need
          any of this!

Muldoon is already running back the way he came.


INT  GARAGE - NIGHT

Several electric land cruisers are stored in this shadowy room.  There
is a glassed-in area where Muldoon's weapons are stored:  assault
rifles, tasers, tear gas canisters.

To the side of the garage s Muldoon's red jeep.  In the passenger side
of the front seat is a rocket launcher.

Nedry storms in, wheeling his incubator.  He stop suddenly and listens.
Approaching FOOTSTEPS.

                            NEDRY
          Oh, shit!


INT  BASEMENT STAIRS, VISITOR'S CENTER -

Muldoon runs down a long corridor, stop with a skid and yanks open the
door to the garage.  He runs out.  His boots RESOUND on the concrete.

BACK ON - NEDRY'S PANICKED FACE as he listens to the footsteps.
Wheezing, with great difficulty, Nedry bends his knees and strains.  With
everything he's got, he lifts the incub
ator waist-height.  And holds it.

BACK ON MULDOON - Muldoon's footsteps ECHO as they come closer and closer
to the garage.  Muldoon whips down the curve in the stairs.  His jacket
catches on an incomplete section of banister. Yanks him to a stop.

CLOSE ON - Muldoon's jacket as it RIPS, stays caught.

BACK ON - NEDRY as he tries to heave higher, can't.  Beads a sweat roll
down his brow.

MULDOON FREES HIS caught jacket and then keep going.

Nedry's face drips with sweat.  The incubator slips out of his sweaty
palms.  Catches it with his knee.  Nedry curses and with one forceful
boost, he lifts the incubator shoulder height.

CLOSE ON - Muldoon's feet on long stairwell. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.

NERVOUS, NEDRY BREATHES in a labored fashion.  He looks this way and
that.  He closes his eyes and with one superhuman effort, he heaves the
incubator into the back seat of the red jeep.  Nedry exhales.

At that moment, MULDOON ENTERS the vestibule between stairs and garage.

NEDRY EYES the shadowy figure in the vestibule.  
Nedry's frightened face.

MULDOON STOPS and reaches in his belt.  He pulls out his pistol.  He
takes out long, shiny cartridges.  He loads the pistol.

NEDRY LEAPS in the front of the jeep, pushing aside the rocket launcher,
and zooms into the night.

A moment later, Muldoon enters the garage.  He sniffs at the exhaust
that still hangs in the air.  He looks over and is surprised to see his
jeep gone.  He bends and inspects fresh tread marks. He looks up, his
face straining to understand.


EXT  PARK ROAD - NIGHT

Nedry's red jeep flies down the park road.

CLOSE ON - Nedry's wheel as he turns it.

His tires skid sideways, then regain traction.  The jeep bolts up a
smaller access road.  He skids to a stop at the top of the hill.

Nedry jumps out and looks up.  His high beams illuminate a huge electric
fence prominently labeled:  DANGER!  10,000 Volts!

Two safety fences separate Nedry from the electric fence.  He races to
the first one, pulls out a key chain.  He tries one key, then another,
and another.  It f
its.  Nedry unlocks the gate, swings open the door.

Nedry runs to the second gate.  He slips in the mud.  He slides to the
ground, dropping keys in a muddy pool.

CLOSE ON - Nedry's hand frantically fishing for the key chain in the
muddy water.  Got them!   Unlocks the second gate.

He races to the electric fence.  RAIN PELTS him now.  Water beads on his
face.  Lightning flashes on the 10,000 volts warning.

He grabs the gate with his bare hand and swings it open.

Nedry heads back to his jeep, his fat body strobed by its high beams.
He jumps in the jeep and drives through.  Behind him, the open gates
move recklessly in the stormy night.


BACK ON GARAGE

Ellie and Harding pull in, in their own gas-powered jeep.  Muldoon is
waiting for them.  Now there's a rifle slung over his shoulder.  Harding
jumps out of the jeep.

                            MULDOON
          Get out, get out!  I need this jeep.
          There's a problem with the tour.  Ellie,
          Hammond'll fill you in.

Ellie is concerned, the
n decisive.

                            ELLIE
          No!  I'm going with you, Muldoon.

They race out.


EXT  DOCK - NIGHT

Headlights blazing in the darkness, Nedry's jeep skids to a stop by the
dock where the ANNE B is preparing to leave.  The water is very choppy.

Nedry jumps out and pulls his incubator to the ground.  He begins to
drag it through the mud, toward the ship.  CAPTAIN FARRELL comes to meet
him, along with A COUPLE MEN, who hoist the incubator easily and carry
it toward the ship.

                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
          Good.  Glad to see you.  Were you seen?

                            NEDRY
          Nah.  I'm back in five minutes, they'll
          never know I was gone.
              (yells after the men with the incubator)
          Careful with that thing!  It's worth more
          than the ship.
              (to the Captain)
          When's the copter meeting you?

                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
          It's not.  The storm's coast-to-coast,
       
   nobody could land on the water.

                            NEDRY
              (totally panicked)
          Shit!  What's the backup?  I don't like
          this.  Maybe we should do it another time,
          I don't like it.  I just don't like -

                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
          Shhh!  I wired Baker, he'll have a man at
          the dock in Puntaremas.  We should be
          able to make that in time.

                            NEDRY
              (somewhat relieved)
          Ten hours?

                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
          Yeah, now relax.  I got a lot riding on
          this too, you know.  No one's going to
          mess up now.  Baker's not going to mess
          up.  His people won't let him.

                            NEDRY
          Ok.  Ok.  Here.

Nedry pulls an aerosol can out of the baggy crotch of his pants.

                            NEDRY
          Look, this is insulating spray.

CLOSE ON - Nedry sprays a big mound of white foam into his
 hand,

                            NEDRY
          In about eight hours, spray down all the
          eggs with this stuff.  It'll keep 'em
          warm but not too warm.  I hope Baker has
          it together with the dock.


BACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA -

Rain drums down on the cruiser.  Timmy stares out at the dark.  Lex
stares nervously out the side window.  Timmy picks up the night goggles
and snaps them on.

                            TIMMY
          Hey, these thing work great.  I can see
          in the dark and I can see far.

He swivels away from the T-Rex paddock and looks out toward the ocean.
He reaches up and adjusts the knob.

                            TIMMY
          Hey!  I wonder if that boat's still
          there?  It is. I think they're getting
          ready to go.

TIM'S POV - the fluorescent green image of men untying casting lines on
the boat.

Another LIGHTNING FLASH and Lex SCREAMS and covers her face.  She cries.

                            REGIS
          Timmy, can you
 give her the goggles?

Lex clamps her hands over her eyes.  Timmy gently nudges her.

                            TIMMY
          Want to look at the boat, Lex?

Timmy hands her the night goggles. Lex dries her eyes and takes a peek
with the goggles toward the ocean.

                            LEX
          Hey, that fat guy's down there. Is he
          gonna come get us and take us to Grandpa?

LEX'S POV - the picture streaks but clearly reveals Nedry shouting at
the Captain.  Men heave the incubator onto the ship.

                            LEX
          They have one of those things from the
          room with all the eggs - you know, where
          they help the baby eggs grow up.

                            TIMMY
          You mean an incubator?

                            GRANT (ON WALKIE)
          What's the commotion?

                            REGIS
          Let me see.  Give them to men, sweetheart.

                            TIMMY (TO WALKIE)
          Uh, Dr. Grant?

REGIS GRABS th
e walkie talkie and tries to silence Timmy.  He knows he
gets there too late and reluctantly lets Timmy have it back.

                            TIMMY
          We saw that computer guy helping 'em load
          an incubator onto the ship.

                            LEX (TO WALKIE)
          Yeah, he's stealing them, Dr. Grant!
          He's stealing my Grandpa's eggs!

                            GRANT (ON WALKIE)
          Nedry?  With an incubator?  Regis??

                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
              (finally acknowledges)
          That's what they saw.

ON GRANT - He looks sharply at Gennaro.

                            GRANT (TO WALKIE)
          We gotta tell Hammond and Arnold right
          away.  How far is it to the mainland?

ON TIMMY - He looks at Regis.

                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
          Uh, it's a hundred miles to Puntaremas.
          About a sixteen hour voyage in this
          weather.

ON GRANT - He fiddles with the radio in his cruiser.  No r
esponse still.

                            GRANT
          I wouldn't like to see dinosaurs running
          around Costa Rica.

                            GENNARO
          When's the damn power coming on?


INT/EXT MULDOON'S JEEP, OTHER BACK ROADS

Muldoon and Ellie drive into the storm.  Suddenly, he slams on his
brakes.  In front of him, a tree has fallen, completely blocking the
road.  Muldoon curses, swerves around, and skids to a stop.

As Muldoon gets out and assesses the situation, Ellie lodges herself
between the tree and the jeep.  She pushes the tree with her strong legs
and moves it a good five feet. Quickly, Muldoon and Ellie drag the tree.
As they struggle.

                            MULDOON
          Strong legs.

                            ELLIE
          Lot of track in college.


BACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA -

IN THE FIRST CAR, Regis drums his fingers on the dashboard.  Timmy wears
his goggles and stares into the rain.  Lex shifts her body around,
trying to get comfortable to rest.

 
                           LEX
          I'm hungry.  When can we get going?

                            REGIS
          When the electricity comes back on,
          honey.  These cars run on electric cables
          buried in the road.

IN THE SECOND CAR, Grant tries the radio to no avail.  Gennaro smokes.
Grant looks forward toward the first cruiser.  He can barely make out
the car in the dark and rain.  Occasionally, LIGHTNING reveals all.

TIMMY PULLS GUM out of his pocket.  Feels a tiny shake, looks around.
He puts it in his mouth, chewing quietly.  SUDDENLY, the whole car
VIBRATES.  Regis' sunglasses jump off the dashboard and fall to the
floor.  The kids look at him.

                            REGIS
          Must be turning on the electricity.

Lex sits up, looks around groggily.

                            LEX
          Feels like a vibration.


INT  T-REX PADDOCK - NIGHT

The T-Rex's huge hind feet crash down, one large foot following after
the other in long, powerful strides.


BACK ON CRUISE
RS, REST AREA - FIRST CRUISER

There is a thud, and then a THUD, and then a THUD.   Tim and Lex share a
frightened look.  Now the thud grows LOUDER.  There is a CRASHING SOUND,
the whole cruiser SHAKES.  Then silence.  Then another SHAKE.

CAMERA PUSHES IN TILL CLOSE - Timmy stares out with his night goggles.

TIM'S NIGHTSCOPE POV IN CLOSE - T-Rex paws rest on the electric fence.

Tim takes off his goggles, stares, transfixed.  Regis picks them up.

EXTREME CLOSEUP - of muscular forepaws with pebbled, grainy skin and
thick, curved nails comfortably gripping a thick wire strand.

The T-Rex moves his body forward of the brush, pushes against the fence.


IN THE SECOND CRUISER -

Grant and Gennaro stare out, unseeing in the rain and darkness.


CLOSE ON LEX -

Tears roll down her cheek.  She cries silently with an unknown fear.
Regis pulls the goggles from his eyes, starts to gag, checks it.

                            REGIS
          Jesus Christ.

                            LEX
          Bad language.

     
                       REGIS
          Jesus Christ.  The fence isn't
          electrified.

                            LEX
          Is that bad?

Regis turns, looks out the side window, away from the T-Rex.

Regis is shaking uncontrollably.  Suddenly he throws open his door and
bolts off into the rain, leaving the door open.  No move from the Rex.

Regis races by the second cruiser.  Grant stares out at him.

                            TIM
          Mr. Regis!  Mr. Regis, where are you
          going?

                            LEX
          He just left us.  He just left us all
          alone.  Timmy, Timmy how could he do
          that?  We're all alone!  We're all alone!

FLASH OF LIGHTNING.  FLASH.  The Rex butts his head.

TIM'S POV - The fence bangs down on top of his cruiser.

Timmy and Lex recoil from the scrape  of the wire mesh against the car.


IN THE SECOND CRUISER -

GRANT AND GENNARO'S POV - through the almost obscuring rain they see the
fallen fence.  An unseen weight pulls on it fur
ther, causing its
electric wire to pop like over-tuned guitar strings.


TIMMY REACHES -

out into the rain for the open door handle.

Another LIGHTNING FLASH and the creature is revealed standing between
the two cruisers, atop the crushed fence.  His head turns back and
forth, he's deciding on his prey.  Grant and Gennaro or Tim and Lex?

Timmy slams the door shut.  He looks directly at the Rex, just a few
feet away.  The Rex turns to him, stares back.

Lex SCREAMS and Timmy claps a hand over her mouth.

There is a whisper over Tim's walkie-talkie.

                            GRANT (ON WALKIE)
          Timmy, be quiet. Don't move.


BACK ON GRANT -

He snaps off the walkie-talkie.

HIS POV - The rain runs in rivulets down the pebbled skin of the
muscular hind legs.  The animal's head is out-of-view, above the
rooftops of the cars.  The Rex lifts its huge hind leg.

                            GENNARO
          Holy shit!  Any suggestions what we do
          now?

                            GRANT
        
  Can't think of a thing.

The T-Rex slowly circles Grant's cruiser.


BACK ON TIM -

He watches the beast move.


BACK ON GRANT AND GENNARO -

As they twist and turn, trying to find a circling Rex in dark and rain.
The Rex pauses right next to Gennaro's window.  He lowers his head,
looking for movement inside.

CLOSE ON - the beady, expressionless reptilian eye moving in the socket.

Grant whispers, hardly moving his lips.

                            GRANT
          Don't move.

Gennaro's leg trembles uncontrollably.


IN THE FIRST CRUISER -

Very frightened, Lex discovers a flashlight.  She flicks it on and off,
distracting herself.  The beam shows her eyes full of a quiet panic.

                            LEX
          It's too, too dark out there.

Tim waves his hands in caution.


BACK ON GRANT, GENNARO, AND THE REX -

The Rex bends down, bumps the windshield with his nose.  Just stays
there, breathing heavily.  In the distance, the flashlight goes on
again.  The Rex raises his head suddenly.  Grant g
rabs his walkie.

                            GRANT (TO THE WALKIE)
          Shut that flashlight, Tim!

As the Rex heads off, a casual swipe of his tail SMASHES the side of the
cruiser, throwing Grant and Gennaro across the inside of the car.


ON TIM -

He lunges for the flashlight.  Lex dodges him, keeps it lit.

                            LEX
          No, it's mine.  Please, I need it.

Tim looks up through the sun roof.  The massive head of the
Tyrannosaurus Rex appears.  Tim watches, transfixed.  Lex looks up.
Irrational with terror, she aims her flashlight like a gun.  Blasts him.
Her flashlight beam cuts through the dark and rain - she sees the beast
plainly for the first time and SCREAMS!

The POOL OF LIGHT bathes the Rex's face.  He smashes his head down onto
the Plexiglass bubble.  It crunches, and falls into the car, crushing
the children.  Tim uses his feet to push it to the side.

Above, the Rex displays is gaping maw, drooling toward the opening.


GRANT -

watches the Rex raise his mighty h
ead again, above the kids' cruiser.


TIMMY AND LEX -

have a half-instant of relief.  Then SLAM.  The Rex butts his head
against the cruiser.  The Rex comes back down, tries to discover his
prey inside the cruiser.  Pushes his head close to the glass, looking.

The dinosaur stands in front of the cruiser, his whole chest heaving,
his forelimbs pawing the air.

Timmy whispers to Lex.

                            TIMMY
          Are you ok?  Be quiet and don't move.

Lex barely nods and grabs Timmy's hand.

The Tyrannosaur places his head next to the car.  He begins to shove the
cruiser with his head.  The cruiser ROCKS.  The back window bursts,
shards go flying.

Inside, the kids are THROWN back and forth, SHOVED against each other,
and finally FLUNG against the top of the car as the cruiser FLIPS.

The whole world TILTS CRAZILY - trunks of palm trees slide by, the
ground above, the blazing eye of the rex, the tops of palm trees.

The cruiser SLAMS DOWN on its side, the windows splat in the mud.  Lex
falls he
lplessly against the side window and lies motionless.  Timmy
falls beside her, banging his head.  He reaches for Lex.

                            TIMMY
              (softly)
          Lex?  Lex?

SILENCE.  No movement from Lex.

THE ANIMAL toys with the cruiser.  Like a dog with its bone, the
dinosaur pushes the cruiser along with his head.  He pushes it past the
picnic tables toward the ripped fence and the embankment.  Each shove
sends the children flying again.

The cruiser is pushes closer and closer to the unprotected embankment.
The cruiser slams to a stop completely upside-down.  The T-Rex steps
right on the cruiser, crushing the roof against the ground.

INSIDE - the children crawl for their lives as the car crushes further
down from above and a tidal wave of mud oozes in from the sides.

THE REX - gnaws at the car, grabs a tire with his teeth,  It ruptures
with a pitiful pop.  The Rex grabs at the axle with his teeth, begins to
drag the car back.  THe kids, half-outside, are pulled with the car.



GRANT DANCES -

with a flare!  The Rex is distracted.

CLOSE ON - the Rex as he ROARS.  The flare gleams in his eyes.

The Rex starts toward Grant.  He tosses the flare over the half-standing
part of the fence.  The Rex lunges after the flare.

GENNARO has reached his limit.  Terrorized, he leaps out and SCREAMS:

                            GENNARO
          Extinct animals should stay extinct!

He bolts.  The Rex sees him and starts after him, THUNDERING by Grant,
who stays frozen in place.

Gennaro sprints for his life.  He's not even a distant match for the T-
Rex jogging behind him.

Gennaro dives into the LADIES ROOM.

INSIDE - he slams the door and shoves the trashcan against the door.
POUNDING FOOTSTEPS APPROACH!  Gennaro backs up into one of the stalls.
LOUDER POUNDING, THE WALLS BEGIN TO VIBRATE!  Gennaro assumes a 'tuck'
position.

ON THE INTERIOR DOOR - The Rex smashes right through the steel-clad
door.  Pieces go flying.

Gennaro hides amidst the wreckage as the Rex sniffs around.


GRANT RUNS BA
CK -

to check on the kids.  He reaches a hand underneath the flipped car,
sitting in the mud.  Lex's soft voice can be heard.

                            LEX (OFF)
          Dr. Grant!

Grant fishes under, finds Lex's hand, drags her out.  He quickly checks
her for broken bones.

                            GRANT
          Lex, are you okay?

                            LEX
          Timmy's unconscious, he won't move.

Lex SCREAMS.  Grant turns to see the Rex return.  He squeezes Lex tight.
The animal goes right past them, back to his toy - Tim's land cruiser!

The Rex BELLOWS a huge cry.  Timmy awakens and sees the Rex above him.
He SCREAMS.

Lex, squeezed in Grant's arms, sees her imperiled brother.

                            LEX
          Timmy!

The Tyrannosaur looks up, GROWLS across the upside-down cruiser, opens
its huge jaws menacingly, all the time staring at Grant and Lex.

INSIDE THE CAR - Timmy tries to unwedge himself.  A thin trickle of
blood runs down his forehead.  He's jammed between the
 crushed roof and
the bent bench seat.  He can't free himself.

The Rex begins to SHOVE the cruiser toward Grant and Lex.  They back up
but they have very few feet left - they're almost at the embankment.
But if they don't move, they'll by crushed by the oncoming car.

Grant slings Lex onto his back.  She grabs her hands around his neck and
digs her feet into his sides.  Grant begins to climb over the downed
fence and into the embankment - it's a huge drop!

Grant grabs a broken cable and lowers himself and Lex over the side of
the embankment.

Just in time as the Rex SHOVES the cruiser further.  Now, the cruiser
TEETERS right on the edge, turning again on its side.  Tim hangs halfway
out of the car, unable to get out further.

Grant, with Lex on his back, slides down the cable, rappelling down the
embankment.  ABOVE, the car looms over them, rocking on the edge.  Lex
looks up and grabs Grant so tightly, she chokes him, unknowingly.

Grant, eyes bulging, sees the danger from above.  He pushes off the wall
and
 swings them toward the next hanging cable.  He reaches out and -

- GRABS THE NEXT CABLE just as -

- the T-Rex BELLOWS and lowers her head, and gives a final shove.  Timmy
and the cruiser SAIL INTO SPACE.  Timmy SCREAMS!

Grant and Lex swing out of the way as the cruiser sails past them.  Lex
SCREAMS, squeezing Grant's neck even tighter!   They watch helplessly as
the cruiser BOUNCES off the wall and CRASH-LANDS into the top of a tree
at the base of the wall.

Grant and Lex stare down at the wreck in the tree.  Timmy can't be seen.
Grant, choking from Lex's grip, grabs her fingers.

                            GRANT
          Let ... go ... please.

The Rex ROARS above.  They look up.

THE REX paws the air, GRUNTS in frustration and STALKS off, LIGHTNING
FLASHES.


EXT  NEDRY'S JEEP, BACK ROADS -

Nedry speeds along the rain-slick road, fish-tailing as he goes.

CLOSE ON - Nedry at the wheel.

NEDRY'S POV - the dark, wet road running alongside a ten-foot chain-link
fence.  Suddenly, a beast-like visage blur
s across the road.

Nedry swerves.  The jeep skids.  Nedry tries to over-steer, can't bring
the careening jeep under control.

The jeep crashes though the fence, bounces down a cement culvert, and
dives into a raging gully.

Nedry curses.  He spins the wheel.  The tires spin and spray.  The
jeep's hopelessly stuck in the gully.  From Nedry's seat in the jeep, he
cranes his head around, examining his situation.

NEDRY'S POV - On the opposite side of the gully, there is an equipment
graveyard.  By the titled jeep headlights, steely monsters all around
can be seen - discarded earth movers, graders, and tractors.

Nedry gets out of the jeep, grabs the winch from the jeep's back end.
and wades over to an abandoned tractor.

                            NEDRY
          Shit. I'm going to have to change clothes.

He loops the winch around the tractor's base.  Suddenly, he stops and
looks around as he hears a gentle HOOTING.  He squints, looking at the
strange steel graveyard lit by the bright beams of the jeep headli
ghts.

HOOT!  HOOT!  A distinctive HOOTING.  Nedry looks up in fear.  SILENCE.

Nedry starts moving toward his jeep.  Again, the HOOT!  Nedry stops,
looks right, looks left.  A RUSTLE in the trees.  Nedry's head cocks.

Looking through trees, lit by the strong beams, Nedry sees a SPITTER in
the eerie mist.  Now it's gone.  Now it's back.  It circles Nedry
warily, hunting him.  Nedry stares.

                            NEDRY
          I hope this is one of them herbivores.

Nedry scrambles the other way, full-tilt.  Hop, hop, and the Spitter
drops in front of Nedry from the other side.  HOOT!

Nedry jumps back, lands on his butt.  The Spitter zips in from the side
- HOOT!

Nedry doubles back, racing through the abandoned equipment, ducking and
rolling under a cement mixer, spinning past a tree.  He splashes down
the embankment, trying to get to his jeep.  He uses the winch line to
steady himself again the raging current.  He finally reaches the jeep,
swings open the door - and, surging out of the water like a
 demonic
apparition, is the SPITTER!  Nedry backs away, directly into the glare
of the headlights!

CLOSE ON - the Spitter.  It's plume opens, bright orange gills swell out
like an umbrella around its neck.  Something squirts beneath its jaws.

A big glob SMACKS Nedry on the arm.  He brushes it off.

                            NEDRY
          Gross.

EXTREME CLOSEUP - the Spitter's head.  The jaws puff, the hood flares
out, the neck snaps forward.  And - it spits.

This glob misses Nedry, splashes off the steaming headlight.

VERY EXTREME CLOSEUP - The Spitter's swollen poison sacs are inflated.
They fire!

This glob hits Nedry in the eyes.  He SCREAMS.

                            NEDRY
          I'm blind, I'm blind.

He falls against the jeep, rubbing his eyes.  The Spitter calmly hops to
the embankment and watches the blinded Nedry weave drunkenly in the
water.  Nedry grabs onto the jeep and pulls himself along toward the
driver's door.  The Spitter stalks, watching him.

Nedry pulls open the jeep door, 
thrusts his head in, slams it against
the door frame.  Now Nedry heaves his whole body into the jeep.  The
Spitter's long ostrich-like legs stretch and bend in an easy gait as it
closes it on Nedry.

Nedry sits behind the wheel, unseeing as the Spitter watches patiently
turns his blind eyes that way.

A long beat.  The Spitter leaps forward, the CAMERA PULLS BACK WIDER AND
WIDER.  Nedry lets out an ear-splitting SCREAM and the car horn BLARES.


INT  TIMMY'S CRUISER

Timmy lies against a spidered side window, his head pressed against the
door handle.  He pushes himself up on one elbow, opens his eyes, and
tries to focus.  Rain has nearly stopped but a light drizzle hits him

Timmy tries to straighten up, but he's too dizzy.  He stops and hears A
CREAKING and feels the whole car gently swaying back and forth.  With a
further effort, he raises his body so that he's standing with his feet
on the window frame and looks out the broken roof.

TIM'S POV - Dense foliage, moving in the wind, hard to see through.  An
o
pen space and - THE GROUND, FORTY FEET AWAY!


INT/EXT  CRUISER - CONTINUING ACTION

Tim's cruiser is lying on its side, stuck in the higher branches of a
tree on the hillside.

                            TIMMY
          Oh shit!

Timmy pulls his body up carefully, trying to get a better view.  He
grabs the steering wheel for support and it spins free in his hand.

CRACK!  The cruiser slips a few inches down the tree.  Timmy grabs the
window frame and freezes.  The car sways in the wind.

CRACK!  The car slips a quick and rocky two feet.

                            TIMMY
          Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!

Timmy hears something.  He raises his head very carefully.  Climbing up
the tree, pulling himself on a nearby branch, is Dr. Grant.

                            GRANT
          Timmy.  Are you ok?

                            TIMMY
          Thank God you're here.  Where's Lex?

                            GRANT
          Below.  She's fine.  Let's get you down.

Timmy nods.

Grant peers throug
h the broken roof of the cruiser, analyzing Timmy's
predicament.  He cranes his head back to examine how the cruiser is
supported in the tree.  Grant turns back to Timmy.

                            GRANT
          Try the door you're leaning against.
          Nice and slow.

Timmy places his weight on the two sides of the door frame and reaches
between his legs, trying to open the door handle.  Stuck.  CRACK!  The
cruiser drops another foot.

Grant scrambles down a couple branches until he is even with the cruiser
again.  He motions for Timmy to hold still.

Grant reaches across to the other car door and tries the outer door
handle.  This one opens and very slowly, he pushes open the door.  Grant
gingerly holds it half-open in mid-air.

                            GRANT
          Crawl this way.  Slowly.

Carefully testing his weight with each step, Timmy lowers his body down.
He pushes his legs out the door.  They kick in the air and slowly come
to rest on a lower branch.  He lets himself down.  Now he si
ts on a
branch, a few feet below the cruiser.

CRACK!  The cruiser drops.  Grant still hangs onto the door but now his
footing on the branch is gone.  His legs hang in space.  The cruiser
hangs precariously above Timmy.  They're all twenty feet in the air.

                            GRANT
          We're going to have to make a jump for
          it, Timmy.  Okay?

Timmy agrees.

                            GRANT
          One, two, three, jump.

Timmy lets go and DROPS.  Grant follows.  So does the cruiser.  It's
hurtling right at them.

Timmy BANGS against the wet tree-trunk and slides down.  Branches WHIP
against his face, his hands SCRAPE against the trunk.  Grant BOUNCES
them.  They scramble down as quick as they can.

Timmy pulls his hands along the sap-sticky surface of the tree.  CRACK!
Grant is stopped for a terrible instant - doubled over a branch, he
flips himself over, dropping further.  The cruiser jolts along, just a
half-step behind them.

Timmy dives the last six feet and HITS the wet earth 
with a THUD!  Grant
CRASHES next to him.  Before they can roll out of the way, the cruiser
keeps coming.  Grant and Timmy look up at it.

GRANT'S POV - The cruiser dropping, dropping toward them.  And finally
stops, just inches away, its dented grill grinning at them, its cracked
headlight glaring.

Oil drips down on Grant.  He grabs Timmy, who grabs the night goggles.
The two roll away.  That second the cruiser SMASHES to the ground.

Grant brushes himself off painfully, extends a hand to Timmy.  Timmy
slowly reaches up and pulls himself standing.

                            TIMMY
          Thanks, Dr. Grant.

                            GRANT
          You owe me one.

Grant turns around in a slow, fluid circle, checking out the forest.

                            GRANT
          Where'd Lex go?

They hear a faint WHIMPERING.

                            TIMMY
          There's Lex.

He runs.  Grant follows.


INT  DRAINPIPE -

Lex is curled up inside the drainpipe.  Her baseball glove is in her
mouth and
 she is rocking back and forth, rhythmically banging her head
against the back of the pipe.  She WHIMPERS.

ON THE HILLSIDE -

Grant and Timmy arrive at the drainpipe and stare in at Lex.

                            GRANT
          Come on out now, Lex.

Lex continues to band her head.  Timmy tries again.

                            TIMMY
          It's your turn to wear the goggles, Lex.

She shakes her head.  He holds up her baseball but she doesn't look.

                            TIMMY
          I found your baseball.

                            LEX
          You did?

But she doesn't move.  Grant speaks encouragingly.

                            GRANT
          Cone on, Lex, it must be cold in there.
          And tight.  Why don't you come out?

                            LEX
          I'm afraid of the "animals".

                            TIMMY
          The "animals" are gone.

                            LEX
          Where did it go?

                            TIMMY
          I don't kno
w but it's not here now.

                            LEX
          Are there any grownups out there?

                            GRANT
          I'm a grownup, Lex.  Come on out.  Gimmie
          you hand, come on, here you go.

                            LEX
          I'm hungry.

                            GRANT
          Me, too.  We've got to get ourselves back
          to civilization.


EXT  ROADSIDE

Regis slowly crawls out from between a couple large boulders.  He looks
around carefully.  He peels mud off his face and rubs his neck.

He touches his cheek.

CLOSE ON Regis' swollen cheek.  He rubs it with his finger.  Suddenly,
he swats at his own mouth.  He reaches in and pulls out a leech fat with
blood.  He hurls it to the ground, spitting.  He grabs another off his
arm and rips if off, leaving a bloody streak.  He digs in his pants and
pulls out another.  He SCREAMS.

As soon as he has done so, he knows he's made a mistake.  He looks
around frantically.  Sees the Rex trot down the road toward 
him.

                            REGIS
          Noooooo!


BACK ON HILLSIDE -

Grant and the kids crest the hill.  Grant puts on the night goggles and
adjusts the dial and looks toward Regis.  The kids can't see that far.

                            TIMMY
          What's going on?

Grant's green POV - Regis and the Rex bounding after him.  Regis hugs a
tree, unmoving.

Grant whispers to the kids.

                            GRANT
          It's Regis and the Rex is after him.  But
          it's okay.  Regis knows the Rex can't see
          him.  Evidently, he can only see move-
          ment.  Regis'll be ok if he stays still.

AFTER A LONG MOMENT, the tyrannosaur walks away, disappears into the
shadows.  Regis waits another long moment and releases his tree.

GRANT'S POV - The tyrannosaur leaps out of the shadows and knocks Regis
to the ground.  Regis jumps up and backs off.  The animal knocks him
right back down.  Regis jumps up again and screams at the beast.

                            REGIS
    
      You don't want to hurt Mr. Regis.  Go
          away.  Ed's your friend.  Back off!

THE REX watches him dance around.  It goes toward him.  This time its
jaws are open.  Regis SCREAMS and in the middle, the scream cuts off.

Grant lets the goggles fall off his face.  They hit the ground with a
METALLIC CLINK.  The Rex turns toward Grant and the kids.

                            GRANT
          Let's go!

Grant grabs both the kids' hands and they begin to run.


BACK ON  TOUR REST AREA -

Drops of water splat on a big fern.  Light swims in the little puddle.
In the sky above, clouds hurry by, intermittently revealing a half-
obscured moon.

The torn fence lies in a crumpled, twisted mess.  The wheel of a Land
Cruiser spins.  A little lizard runs in place on it.

The SOUND of the jeep's engine.  It's Muldoon and Ellie.

THEIR POV - a single cruiser lies on its side in the middle of the road.

                            ELLIE
          Oh, My God!  Where's the other one?

Before the cruiser stops, she j
umps out.   Muldoon shouts a whisper.

                            MULDOON
          Ellie!

Ellie turns in the headlight beams.  Muldoon tosses her a flashlight.

                            MULDOON
          Wait up.

Muldoon skids to a stop, leaps out of the car.  He catches up to Ellie.

They share a frightened, apprehensive look.  Muldoon gets on his knees
and and touches a muddies area.

                            MULDOON
          T-Rex tracks.

Ellie looks out into the forest.

                            ELLIE
          Then they must be out there.  They must
          be out there.  I know it.

                            MULDOON
          Perhaps.

                            ELLIE
          No!  They're out there.

                            MULDOON
          I've seen a lot of animal attacks in the
          bush.  It's not as gory and horrifying to
          see as you'd think.  No pools of blood or
          exposed bones.  There is usually little or
          no evidence left behind.  And if
 victims
          are small, a predator can kill by just
          shaking the little thing to death, eating
          it, and leave not so much as a button.

A definite RUSTLING in the brush.

Ellie jumps and SCREAMS.  Muldoon puts his hand over her mouth and
pushes her down.  They both squat by the cruiser.  SILENCE.  Ellie
swallows.  Muldoon slowly gets up.  Ellie follows.

Their flashlights swing back and forth in the night.  Twigs crack under
their feet.

Ellie hears the RUSTLE at the edge of the forest.  She shines her light
into the brush.  She catches her breath.  Her hand shakes.

Ellie flashes her beam right, left, up, down.  Jumps.  Something is
coming at her, rolling at her.  She gasps, steps back.  It's too late.
It's Gennaro.  His limp body stops at her feet.  She covers her mouth.
Muldoon runs to her.

Gennaro is face-down.  Muldoon takes his pulse.

                            MULDOON
          Thank God.  (beat)  We have to carry him.
          First I have to ...

He stands and removes his 
jacket.

CLOSE ON - Muldoon tears the jacket into long strips.

He wraps Gennaro's wounds.

                            MULDOON
          He's losing a lot of blood.  Help me.

Muldoon and Ellie carry Gennaro to the jeep.  They lay him on the back
seat.  Muldoon jumps in back with him.  He keeps wrapping the wounds.
Ellie starts the engine, looks back at him.

                            ELLIE
          Looks like you've been through this
          before.

Muldoon looks up.

                            MULDOON
          I told you I've seen big game attacks in
          Africa.

She starts the engine.

                            ELLIE
          Right.

Ellie skids out of there.


INT  CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

The dark room is lit with two outdoor torches.  Light flickering on
their faces, Arnold and Wu stare at the console screen.

                            WU
          Why?

                            ARNOLD
          Because Nedry messed with the code.
          That's why I'm checking it.

              
              WU
          But that could take weeks.  What would be
          faster?  Try keychecks.

Arnold snaps his fingers, grabs Wu,

                            ARNOLD
          That's true.  Keychecks will give me a
          record of every button Nedry pushed.

With a rapid series of keys, Arnold initiates "keystrokes".  The
computer displays a short series of commands.  Arnold runs his finger
down the screen.

                            ARNOLD
          Jesus, that's all he did all afternoon?
          He was just dicking around, maybe waiting
          to get his nerve up.

Wu points to a line.  It reads:  WHTE-RBT.OBJ

                            WU
          What's that?

                            ARNOLD
          Some sort of object.  Let's see if we can
          trace it.

Arnold types FIND WHTE-RBT.OBJ.  Nothing.  He tries DEFINE WHTE-RBT.OBJ.
Still nothing.  LIST WHTE-RBT.OBJ.  The screen fills with data.  Each
line defines another security system that has been shut off:  SECURITY
PERIM
ETER FENCES OFF/   SECURITY - INTERIOR FENCES OFF/  SECURITY -
LABORATORY DOORS OFF/, etc.

                            WU
          What's it mean?

                            ARNOLD
          It wasn't a bug.  It was a trap door that
          fat bastard left for himself.  When he
          hit WHTE-RBT. OBJ, it initiates a set of
          commands that turned the whole goddamn
          park off.  Hammond was right about him.

                            WU
          If I did that I'd leave a way to turn it
          back on.  In case I had to.  I'm sure
          Nedry did.  You're find it.

Arnold nods grimly.


INT  CAFETERIA - NIGHT

Hammond sits quietly in the deserted cafeteria, calmly spooning ice
cream into his mouth.  This room is lit by dozens of candles.

Muldoon walks in, stares at Hammond in the semi-darkness.

                            MULDOON
          We found Gennaro.  He'd badly injured.
          Harding's tending to him in your
          quarters.  He'll be all right if we can
    
      radio for help.  Your grandchildren and
          Grant are somewhere in the park.  I
          believe they're alive but I don't know
          where they are.

                            HAMMOND
          I'm sure you'll find them.

                            MULDOON
          I certainly hope so.

                            HAMMOND
          I'm sure we will.  After all, I keep
          telling everyone, this park is made for
          children.

                            MULDOON
          Just so you understand that they're
          missing, sir.

                            HAMMOND
          Missing?  Of course I know they're
          missing.  You just said that.  Look, Bob,
          let's not get carried away.  We've had a
          little breakdown from the storm or
          whatever, and as a result we've had a
          regrettable, unfortunate accident.  And
          that's all that happened.  We're dealing
          with it.  Arnold will get the computers
          cleaned up, and
 the radio and phone lines
          open.  You'll find those kids and my good
          friend, Dr. Grant.  I'm sure they'll want
          some of this ice cream.  It's very good.


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

Dark.  Ellie helps Harding get Gennaro comfortable on Hammond's couch.
Blood from Gennaro's injuries stain the rich leather.  Gennaro babbles.

                            GENNARO
          That Rex didn't even give me his full
          attention.  That's what hurts.  I was
          just an afterthought.  I gave him my full
          attention.

                            HARDING
          He's had a lot of morphine.

                            GENNARO
              (sings)
          Not enough.

                            ELLIE
          I need to find Wu.  I have to run a few
          tests in his lab.

                            HARDING
          He's probably in the control room, get-
          ting in the way while Arnold tries to put
          things together.

As Ellie leaves, Genna
ro is singing a shanty in his morphine stupor.

                            GENNARO
          Yo ho, I'll close this place down ...


EXT  THE ANNE B AT SEA - NIGHT

The ship is tossed around on a stormy sea.

                                                     MATCH CUT TO:


INT  STATEROOM -

The eggs are tossed around in the womb of the incubator.  The swell
settles but the rocking of one egg doesn't stop.  The egg cracks, a
silvery line runs down its side.


EXT  PARK - NIGHT

Somewhere in the dark park, laced by low fog, Grant, Timmy and Lex walk.

                            LEX
          I'm tired.

                            TIMMY
          You're too big to be carried.

                            LEX
          But I'm tired-tired.

                            GRANT
          Okay, Lex.

Grant picks her up.

                            GRANT
          Oof!  You're heavy.

The full moon is blurred by drifting clouds.  Their blunted shadows lead
the three across an open field toward dark woods beyond
.  Grant is lost
is thought, trying to decide where to go.

                            GRANT
          I think we're still in his paddock.

Lex's heavy eyes open.  Her eyes grow big.  She taps Grant's shoulder.

                            GRANT
          What?

                            LEX
          Don't you see?  Don't you see?

                            GRANT
          What?

                            LEX
          The fence.

                            GRANT
              (squinting)
          No.

                            TIMMY
          Oh I do, right there!

Lex lets herself slide off Grant and runs into the woods.  Timmy
follows.  Grant follows, squinting.  Finally, he sees.  A big smile.

The kids look up at a twelve foot high electric fence.  Timmy gulps.

                            LEX
          Timmy's scared of heights.

Timmy spins in fury.

                            TIMMY
          Shut up.

Lex and Timmy stare at each other.  No fighting - now.  They relax.

                   
         GRANT
          Okay with the fence, Timmy?

Timmy eyes it.  Nods hesitantly.  They start to climb.  Lex climbs easily.

                            LEX
              (mumbles quietly)
          'Fraid of heights.

Timmy climbs tentatively.  A dinosaur ROARS in the distance.

CLOSE ON - Timmy's foot loses its grip.

Timmy hangs for a moment, held only by his straining hands.

All three stop.  Wait.  Timmy regains his balance.  Slowly, they proceed
up and over.

On the other side, Grant looks around.  More high trees.  Beyond a field.

                            GRANT
          A herbivore grazing area.  Excellent.

Grant starts to walk toward it.  Timmy stops.  Lets sits on a tree root.

                             TIM
          We gonna walk all night?

Grant looks at his watch.

                            GRANT
          Twelve hours before that ship reaches the
          mainland.

                            TIM
          We need sleep.

True, and Grant's thinking the same thing.  He looks aro
und, surveying
the misty forest.  He looks straight up into the beautiful, tall trees
that ring the wide-open grassy meadow.

                            GRANT
          Up there.

                            TIM
          Climb?  Again?  I can't climb again?

Grant smiles.

                            GRANT
          Sure you can.

Grant checks out and rejects tree after tree.  Near the meadow he finds
it.  A good, basic climbing tree.


EXT  UPPER BRANCHES OF THE TREE

Grant helps Lex get comfortable on his lap.  Timmy tucks himself in
between Grant's outstretched legs.  Grant looks out.  Back to kids.

Timmy and Lex are already snoring.  Lex turns and hugs Grant close to
her.  She murmurs in her sleep.  Grant starts to pat her shoulder when
Timmy, without waking, reaches to her and strokes her hair.

                            TIMMY
              (mumbles)
          It's ok, Lex.  Everything's gonna be okay.

                                                       CUT TO:

CLOSE ON - amoeba-like creatures 
swimming in a pool.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - NIGHT

Ellie lifts her head away from the powerful microscope.

The dark room is lit by flashlight.  Battery packs power the microscope.
Wu paces the room, regarding his eggs with dismay.  Sitting on their
long tables with no moving wands above them - no thermal sensors.

                            WU
          What is taking Arnold so long?  This room
          is too cold.  My eggs will be damaged.

Ellie swings the lens to Wu.  Not so interested but peers in politely.

                            ELLIE
          No sign of those berries.  Really
          interesting.  There are indications of a
          similar virus in every tissue sample.
          But it's not in the ground.  Could I look
          at some of the discarded embryos?

Wu reluctantly agrees.  He opens a cabinet and brings her samples.

                            WU
          I'm sure you'll find your virus ... or a
          similar one.  All animals carry many
          viruses 
in a dormant condition.  It's
          almost impossible to say with certainty
          which are the same strains.

Ellie begins a test on a sample.  She adds a reagent and marks up a
slide.  As she works:

                            ELLIE
          And yet from what Harding tells me, many
          of you animals have similar symptoms -
          besides the microvesicles, a lack of
          hunger, loss of reproductive urges, sores
          in the mouth and gums.

Wu waves his arms.

                            WU
          What the hell does Harding know?  He's a
          veterinarian, not a pathologist.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

Arnold pushes his chair away from his console and claps his hands as
Muldoon walks in.  Muldoon asks hopefully.

                            MULDOON
          What is it?

Arnold points to the screen.

                            ARNOLD
          That's it.

Muldoon comes closer.

                            MULDOON
          That's what?

                            ARNOL
D
          I found the command to restore the
          original code.  It resets the linked
          parameters.

                            MULDOON
          The fences and the power?

                            ARNOLD
          Right.  And it does something else. It
          erases the code lines that refer to it.  It
          destroys all evidence it was ever there.

                            MULDOON
          Nedry could steal the eggs, get back and
          reset the whole show.  No one would ever
          miss him.

                            ARNOLD
          Watch this.

Arnold types in a command.  The screen flickers and changes.  Arnold and
Muldoon look out the window as lights come on through out the park.

                            ARNOLD
          Hot damn!

                            MULDOON
          Are the fences back on?

                            ARNOLD
          You bet they are.  It will take a few
          seconds to get up to full power, because
          we've got fift
y miles of fence out there,
          and the generator has to feed the
          capacitors along the way.  But in a half
          a minute we'll be back in business.

Arnold points to the transparent map of the park.  On it, bright red
lines snake out, moving throughout the park, as electricity surges
through the fences.

                            MULDOON
          Motion sensors?

                            ARNOLD
          Got them too.   It will be a few minutes
          while the computer counts.  Then I'll
          tell you where Grant and the kids are and
          you can go and get them.  But every-
          thing's working.  Half past ten and we've
          got the whole thing back up and running.

Muldoon picks up a phone, shakes his head.

                            MULDOON
          Just hiss.


BACK ON  GRANT AND KIDS IN TREE -

Grant snores.  A mosquito buzzes around him.  He waves him away and
continues to sleep.

In the distance, a tiny BEEPING. Below the towering tree, across the
f
ield, a sensor beeps, it's green light blinks, and the beeping stops.

IN THE HIGH TREE, the branches sway.  Grant and the kids sleep on.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

The glowing, glass map.  Arnold and Muldoon stare at it.

                            MULDOON
          What is taking so damn long?  Where are they?

                            ARNOLD
          There's a lot of extraneous movement out
          there.  Branches blowing, birds, back-
          ground movement.  It may take, ah, okay,
          count's finished.

Muldoon looks at Arnold anxiously.  Arnold looks down.

                            ARNOLD
          Hmmmm.  I don't see them.  Maybe they're
          out of range of a sensor.

                            MULDOON
          Shit.  I don't know where they are.  I
          wish I could go out there   But I haven't
          got anything to use on the Rex.  My
          rocket launcher's in the jeep Nedry
          stole.  And going out with a big gun in
          the dark would be suicide
.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - NIGHT

Brightly lit again.  Ellie performs tests with a centrifuge.  She looks
at Wu, who sits across from her in a high stool, stifling a yawn.

                            ELLIE
          Why don't you get some sleep, Dr. Wu?
          I'm just going to run a couple more tests
          and then I'm going to turn in myself.

Wu doesn't need to be told twice.  He climbs off his stool.

                            WU
          No point in everyone being exhausted.

He starts to leave.  He comes back and speaks consolingly at Ellie.

                            WU
          I'm sure Muldoon will find Dr. Grant as
          soon as there is light.

Ellie appreciates his effort, nods seriously, goes back to work.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


EXT  OCEAN - JUST BEFORE DAWN

Beautiful dark ocean.  The sky is a rich blue.  A morning star fades as
the sky lightens.  The Anne B is a small dot on the massive ocean.


INT  STATEROOM, ANNE B 
-

Eggs sit in the incubator.  A hand sprays them with foam.  Leaves.
CAMERA EXAMINES the eggs as the foam disperses.  More cracks.  One egg
jumps with a bolt from within.  It settles.  Jumps again.

                                                      CUT TO:

ESTABLISHING AERIAL - the primordial beauty of Isla Nublar at dawn.


EXT  VISITOR'S CENTER - DAWN

Muldoon drives out into the park in Harding's jeep.  THREE WORKERS
travel with him.  Each carries a rifle.


EXT  GRANT'S TREE - DAWN

CAMERA LOOK DOWN on Grant, Lex and Timmy still sleeping in the tree.  A
large shadow falls on their quiet faces.  Lex opens an eye. She SCREAMS.

Grant and Timmy wake up with a start.

THEIR POV - AS THE CAMERA LOOKS THROUGH THEIR LEGS AND TILTS UP right
into the huge face of A DUCK-BILLED HADROSAUR, a gigantic dinosaur with
cow eyes.  Its head moves up through the canopy of the trees.  Then the
head swoops way down below.  And returns to Grant's level and stares at
his shoe.

The hadrosaur tastes Grant's shoe.  The kids
 press tightly into Grant.

                            LEX
          He gonna eat us?

                            GRANT
          I don't think so.  She's a ...

                            GRANT AND TIMMY
          ... herbivore.

The hadrosaur HONKS.  Lex covers her ears.  Grant smiles and motions to
Lex.  He picks a big fruit off the tree and tosses it into the
hadrosaur's mouth.  CHOMP.  He feeds it again.  Lex and Timmy toss a few.

CHOMP!  CHOMP!  HONK!  HONK!

The hadrosaur's big head swoops way down, momentarily gone.

When she returns, all three quickly gather fruits and throw them into
her mouth.  The hadrosaur pulls back with her giant mouthful of fruit.
She pulls further and further back and then her huge head turns and
moves down.

Grant, Lex and Timmy strain to see through the branches.

THEIR POV - The hadrosaur is feeding four scampering, baby hadrosaurs.
Letting the fruit tumble from her mouth into theirs.  Lex YELLS:

                            LEX
          Come here, babies!  Get your b
reakfast!

The babies run to the base of the tree.  The kids toss fruits right down
to them.  Lex and Timmy climb lower to feed them right from their hands.

Grant and the mother hadrosaur stare at each other.  She sniffs his
foot.  He moves closer, straddling a branch.  He lifts up her lip and
examines her gums.

CLOSE ON - a ripped piece of fence stuck in her teeth.

Grant yanks it out.  He lets it drop to the ground.  He take a large
leaf and rubs her teeth with it.

CLOSE ON - her mouth as Grant's hand touches the side of her tongue.  He
sees little tiny bumps.

The hadrosaur lets out a low groan.   Grant is puzzled, rubs harder.

                            GRANT
          Like the trike.  Maybe it's not the stones.

HONK!   She pulls her mouth away.  The baby hadrosaurs turn to the
honking adult.  She is leaving quickly.  They follow quickly behind her.
The small herd leaves, casually trampling trees as they go.


EXT  BACK ROADS, PARK - MORNING

Muldoon and workers drive rapidly in the jeep.  Suddenly,
 Muldoon slams
on the brakes.

MULDOON'S POV - ABOUT TWENTY PROCOMPSOGNATHIDS (COMPYS), small chicken-
sized scavenging dinosaurs, scramble across the road.

                            MULDOON
          Where the hell are they going?

Muldoon watches them cross.  He thinks it over.  Spins the wheel and
follows them off the road.

                            MULDOON
          Let's see what's up.


EXT  BELOW THE TREE, PARK - MORNING

Timmy bravely jumps from a very low branch.  He smiles and looks at
Grant, who's already on the ground.  Grant looks off in the distance.

                            GRANT
          Tim, I think there's a motion sensor
          across the field and down there.

                            TIM
          Where's Lex?

ALONE IN THE BUSHES -  Lex kneels.  She holds a big fruit and calls:

                            LEX
          C'mere boy, c'mere.

She tosses the fruit.

CLOSE ON - the fruit rolling away.

Lex gets up and follows the rolling fruit.  She picks it up.

           
                 LEX
          It's very, very good.

She tosses it again.

                            LEX
          C'mere boy, c'mere.

Lex's eyes scan the bushes, then stop.  She smiles.

LEX'S POV - hidden in the brush, a baby triceratops' eye peeks at Lex.

Lex pushes the fruit closer.  The BABY TRICERATOPS comes out of the
brush, squeaking as it goes.  It nibbles the fruit.  Lex rolls another.

BACK ON GRANT AND TIM - They look around.  Timmy stops, mouth open, YELLS:

                            TIM
          Dr. Grant, Dr. Grant, look.

Grant turns, looks OFFSCREEN.  He's astonished by when he sees.

HIS POV - a row of shrubs, which Lex seems to soar above.  As a break in
the shrubs, it's clear that she's riding the baby triceratops.  Loving it.

                            LEX
          Whoa!

With a whoop, Grant and Timmy chase after Lex on her triceratops.

Lex rides through low brush, ducking down as she goes.  Then beneath the
tall trees as she enters the forest.  She crosses a stream on a log
b
ridge.  Light showers down through the branches.  The water shimmers.
Lex in is paradise.

Behind her, Grant and Timmy shout for her to stop.  She waves, kicks the
triceratops like it's a horse and YELLS:

                            LEX
          Giddyup!

The trike takes off, in a rush.  It trips over a fallen tree, downed by
the storm.  The trike takes a spill and Lex goes flying.

                            LEX
          Whoa!!  Take is easy!

She passes over the trike's head, in the air, and SCREAMS as she flies:

                            LEX
          I can't swim!

She SPLASHES into the stream.

Timmy, first to arrive on the scene, dives in heroically.  He comes up
sheepish and muddy - and sees Lex standing in a foot of water.

The baby dinosaur rolls to a stop, mowing down a patch of saplings as
she goes.  It stands up, dizzy and out of breath.

Timmy wipes mud off himself.  Grant helps the kids out of the water.
The baby triceratops follows them.  Grant yells to the baby trike.

                 
           GRANT
          Go home now.  Home to Freda!

                            LEX
          Oh, let him stay.  He likes me to ride
          him.  He could carry me instead of you,
          Dr. Grant.  Please, let him stay,

Grant shakes his head,

                            GRANT
          Go!  Go away.  Go!  Get out of here!

The trike whimpers and watches the three of them walk on.  Lex is
heartbroken.

                            LEX
          Will I ever play with him again?

Grant looks across the field, abundantly beautiful in the early morning.
He has to keep them going.   He points across the field.

                            GRANT
          We gotta get to that motion detector.
          It's still a ways.

Lex looks behind her.  In the distance, more hadrosaurs join the herd
eating from the tall trees.  Some cool off in a shallow lagoon.  They
drink, lowering their flat heads, meeting their own reflections in the
still water.  When they look up again, their heads swivel.  At the
water's 
edge, a baby hadrosaur ventures out, squeaks, and scrambles back
while the adults watch indulgently.


EXT  OFF ROAD, PARK - MORNING

Muldoon and his workers now follow the compys on foot.  The compys trail
off in different directions.  Muldoon and his workers break apart to
track the different groups.

A BEARDED WORKER follows his party of compys.  He looks ahead and sees a
small group stopped ahead.  Their heads are bent to the ground.

A BALD WORKER has reached another cluster of compys.  Kicking, he
scatters them.

Muldoon's tracking leads him to the equipment graveyard where Nedry was
lost.  He sees his stolen red jeep.  He rushes to it.  On the passenger
side still sits the rocket launcher.  He opens the door to retrieve it.
When he leans in, his eye catches the tilted side-view mirror.  The
image is of many compys bent over the ground.  He comes around, YELLING.

                            MULDOON
          I found Nedry!

In the distance, the call is ECHOED.

                            BEARDED WORKE
R (OFF)
          I found him!

                            BALD WORKER (OFF)
          Found him!


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DAY

Hammond peeks in the door and sees Gennaro, heavily bandaged, dozing on
the couch.  Gennaro's eyes flutter and Hammond enters and smiles.

                            HAMMOND
          He, Donald.  Glad you're awake.  I hope
          you're not going to take this little
          mishap you had and hold it against my
          park.  It would be terrible if the
          finishing funds were in any way held up.

Gennaro just grins and shakes his head.  He's very high on morphine.  He
wants to speak but Hammond keeps talking.  After each sentence, Gennaro
enthusiastically agrees with a nod.

                            HAMMOND
          You really shouldn't have gotten out of
          the vehicle.  The park is actually quite
          safe.  A disenchanted worker sabotaged
          some equipment.  Arnold, Muldoon, and Wu,
          all loyal employees, are righting damage
    
      as we speak.

                            GENNARO
          Oh good, 'cause I love the park!  It's
          more than we ever dreamed!  Those
          brachiosaurs are so big!  And those
          Spitters -
              (he spits)
          - incredible!  I only have one problem.
          Aren't we going to have pterodactyls?
              (he frowns, smacks his forehead)
          Oh, they'd fly away!

Gennaro looks off, watching the imaginary pterodactyls fly away.
Hammond takes out a bag.

                            HAMMOND
          Take a look at these, Donald.  Have you
          seen these?  These are great.

Hammond dumps things out of the bag.  They are souvenirs of the park.

                            HAMMOND
          Wind-up toys.  Spitter umbrellas.

Gennaro is thrilled.

                            HAMMOND
          I got some great t-shirts.  Dinosaur
          bingo, hey ...

Hammond leans closer.

                            HAMMOND
          Wu says he can make a foot high
    
      triceratops.  We'll sell pets as living
          souvenirs.  Bio-engineered to eat only
          food we sell, of course.

Gennaro can't take it.  Great idea!  He high-fives Hammond repeatedly.

Harding enters and gently taps Hammond on the shoulder.

                            HARDING
          You'll have to bear with him, Mr. Hammond.
          He's doped to infinity and back.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - DAY

Sunlight pours through the windows.  Ellie sits with her head in hands.
She looks around and wanders the lab.  Notices a drawer, slides it open.

X-rays.  She shuffles through, finds some marked: FREDA.

Ellie snaps on a viewing light at her lab station.  She studies the X-
ray.  She looks up in surprise.   Studies it again.

The viewing light is snapped off.  Ellie looks again.  Wu stands there.

                            WU
          Who gave you permission -

Ellie attacks back.

                            ELLIE
          I'm here to investigate this park. And
          there's
 plenty you haven't told me.

                            WU
          That's absurd.

                            ELLIE
          These bones aren't fully formed.

                            WU
          You're qualified to interpret x-rays of
          living dinosaurs?  I doubt it.  It took
          me many months to learn.

                            Y
          I'll tell you something else, Freda isn't
          an adult, just a huge juvenile.

                            WU
          You're making a lot of assumptions here.

                            ELLIE
          Right.  What the hell is going on, Wu?

They stare at each other in the bright sunlight.

                            HAMMOND (OFF)
          Growth hormones.

The two swing around.  Hammond stands in the sharp shadows of the room.

                            WU
          She didn't have a right to explore my lab.

                            HAMMOND
          Let's not argue, Wu, we have a serious
          problem.
              (to 
Ellie)
          These animals don't last.  There is a
          regularity, a predictability about when
          they die.  It's always ... very young.
          We don't know why.  Given time, I'm sure
          Wu will figure it out.  It's just ...

                            WU
          Just some adjustment in the code is
          required.

                            HAMMOND
          But there are deadlines.  The park opens
          next summer. And it requires full-grown
          specimens.  So Wu uses growth hormones to
          achieve the desired size in a short
          amount of time.  But they all keep dying
          and we don't know how to stop it.

Ellie and Wu stare at Hammond.  He steps forward.  The light is so hot
behind him that his appearance is like an apparition.

                            HAMMOND
          I was going to tell you all this myself,
          Dr. Sattler, after Gennaro stopped
          breathing down my neck.  That's why I
          wanted you and Dr. Grant 
here on my
          island - you have to help me keep the
          dinosaurs alive.  Won't you please help
          me?

                                                      CUT TO:

IN THE SKY, the sun momentarily burns through the clouds -


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DAY


Ellie enters.  On the couch, Gennaro snores lightly.  In a chair nearby
Harding sleeps, a roll of gauze grasped in his hands.

Ellie walks over to the large model of the park that Hammond revealed.
She looks at the miniature dinosaurs that sit in different sectors of
the park.  She picks up the plastic Rex, examines it, drops it back in.

She brushes by Harding and studies Gennaro's pasty, sleeping face.  Air
blows in and out of his dry lips.  She examines the gauze wrapped around
his wounded leg.  It seeps with blood.


INT CONTROL - DAY

Arnold works at his console.  Hammond and Wu lean over his shoulder.
Ellie bursts in, very agitated.  Hammond looks up.

                            ELLIE
          Gennaro's losing a lot of blood. 
 He
          needs transfusions.  We gotta get a
          rescue helicopter.  Arnold, what's with
          the phones?

                            ARNOLD
          Ah hell. I just can't find it.

He sips his coffee and stares bleary-eyed at the screen.

                            ELLIE
          Find what?

                            ARNOLD
          Nedry jammed all the communication lines.
          He inserted some command, a lockout into
          the program code.  I can't find it,
          because I gave that restore command and
          it erased part of the program listings.

                            WU
          So?  Just reset - shut the system down
          and you'll clear the memory.  Everything
          will be in the normal wakeup mode.

                            ARNOLD
          Shut the system down?

                            WU
          And reset.

                            ARNOLD
          I've never done that before.  And I'm
          reluctant to do it.  Maybe it's tr
ue, all
          systems will come on, but maybe they won't.

                            ELLIE
          Look, there is a sick man here who needs
          medical attention or he'll die.  Four
          people are out there, missing in your
          park.  We need search teams.  We have to
          have a phone or radio.

Arnold still hesitates.

                            ELLIE
          Well?

                            ARNOLD
          Well, it's just that the safety systems
          don't function with the computer shut
          down and -

Ellie boils over.

                            ELLIE
          - turn the goddamn safety systems off!
          Can't you get it through your head that
          we have no choice?

Arnold looks at Hammond, who now stares out into the park.  Without
turning, Hammond nods his consent.

                            ARNOLD
          Okay.

Arnold gets up and goes to the main panel.  He opens the doors and
uncovers the metal swing-latches over the safety switches. 
 He pops them
off, one after another.

                            ARNOLD
          You asked for it.  And you got it.

He throws the master switch.

The control room goes black.  All monitors go black.  Arnold, Wu and
Ellie stand in the dark.

                            ELLIE
          How long do we have to wait?

                            ARNOLD
          Thirty seconds.


EXT  FIELD IN THE PARK -

Grant and kids walk through a clearing.  Lex stops.

                            GRANT
          What is it?

                            LEX
          I hear something.

                            GRANT
          Come on.

Timmy looks around. The morning is still and peaceful. Branches are
motionless.  Only a little bird jumps from one branch to another.

                            LEX
          Hear it now?

                            TIMMY
          You're hearing things.  Come on, we gotta
          get back and warn them about the boat.

Lex hesitates but doesn't want to be left behind.  She runs betw
een
Grant and Timmy.  Then they all hear it.

HONKING.  It comes from the herd of duck bills behind them.  First the
honking of a single animal, then another animal joins in, then another
and another, until the whole herd has taken up the honking cry.

                            TIMMY
          What's going on?

                            GRANT
          They're agitated.

The duckbills twist and turn.  They hurry out of the water, circling the
young ones to protect them.

With a ROAR, the T-Rex bursts from the trees, just a hundred yards away
straight toward the hadrosaurs.

                            LEX
          I told you I heard something!

The earth SHAKES.  A low rumble is heard and felt as the hadrosaurs begin
to run  in a parallel direction to the course of Grant and the kids.

                            GRANT
          Outta the way, kids! Run!

Grant grabs Lex, lifting her bodily off the ground, and carries her like
a football.  Timmy runs beside them.

Hadrosaurs run alongside of them.  Grant
 hears the crashing of trees.
He takes a glance over his shoulder.

GRANT'S POV - a flurry of flamingos takes flight and spooks the herd
into changing direction.  The hadrosaurs swerve and charge right into
the path of Grant, Lex and Timmy.  They all SCREAM.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

The quiet black room.  Hammond stands by the big window.  His pensive
presence affects all in the room.

Arnold looks at his illuminated watch.

                            ARNOLD
          Memory should be cleared by now.

He pushes the main switch back on.  Nothing on.

                            ARNOLD
          Damn.

Arnold pushes the switch off and then on again.  Still nothing.  He
glances at Hammond's back.  Sweat forms on his brow.

                            ELLIE
          What's wrong?

                            ARNOLD
          Oh hell!  I have to turn the safety switches
          back on before I restart the power.

Arnold flips on three safeties, and covers them again with latch covers.
Holding his breath, he
 turns on the main power switch.

First, there is the computer beep.  Ellie jumps.  Then relaxes.  The
lights come on.  The screens hum.  Hammond's shoulder twitches slightly.

                            ARNOLD
          Thank God!

The room is jubilant.  Hugs and cheers.  Ellie picks up a phone.

                            ELLIE
          Arnold!  They're still not working.

                            ARNOLD
          No, it sounds dead but after a reset, all
          system modules have to be brought on line
          manually.

Arnold quickly goes back to work at his console.  Hammond turns.

                            WU
              (to Hammond)
          Arnold's about to get the phones up.

Arnold pushes the chair back.

                            ARNOLD
          Okay, we're up again!

Ellie grabs the phone back up.

                            ELLIE
          No we're not.  Phones still dead.

Arnold swings her way.

                            ARNOLD
          Can't be -

                    
        HAMMOND
          My God, look at this, Arnold.

Hammond points to the transparent map.  A tight cluster of dots by the
lagoon move in a coordinated way.  Moving fast, in a kind of swirl.

                            ELLIE
          What's happening?

                            ARNOLD
              (tonelessly)
          The duckbills.

                            WU
          My good God.

                            ELLIE
          What?

                            ARNOLD
          It's the Rex ...

                            HAMMOND
          They've stampeded ...


BACK ON  THE HADROSAURS - LOW ANGLE ON THE STAMPEDE -

Grant and kids run for their lives.  Behind them the duckbills charge
with surprising speed.  Their enormous bodies charge in a tight group,
kicking up dirt, rocks, whole trees as they thunder along.

CLOSE ON - a charging duckbill as he HONKS, eyes wild with fear.

A horrible ROAR of the T-Rex sends a duckbill infant squealing and
struggling to stay out from underfoot.

CLOSE ON
 - A huge adult foot almost tramples the infant.

Frightened and confused the infant scampers even deeper into the
maelstrom.  The frenzied herd raises a great cloud of yellow dust.

GRANT AND LEX AND TIMMY run wildly.  The stampede is very close behind
Grant and the kid's faces are covered with sweat and dust.

Another deafening ROAR of the T-Rex.

Grant leads them toward a rocky outcrop with a stand of big conifers.
The animals continue to close.

CLOSE ON - the running feet of the stampeding animals.  The ground
VIBRATES every time it is struck by the huge feet.

GRANT AND THE KIDS scramble onto the rocks.  They frantically tuck in
between big boulders as the the herd reaches them.  Lex shields her
dusty face with her hands as she wedges deeper between the rocks.  Grant
pushes her down deeper and looks up from between the rocks.

GRANT'S POV - the immense legs of the first hadrosaur to pass.  Another
slams its big tail against the rocks, leaving a splash of hot blood.

Stampeding legs send clods of dirt fl
ying in the air.  Above, even the
birds are running.  Disoriented, they fly frantically along.

GRANT AND THE KIDS are enveloped in dust.  Just shadows of huge bodies
with giant limbs.  BELLOWS of pain as animals wheel and circle.

A boulder is dislodged and it rolls toward Timmy.  He dives out of his
rocky hiding place.  The boulder continues on toward Grant and Lex.
They dive after Timmy.  The group buries itself anew in a group of thick
roots tangled amidst smaller rocks.  The boulder continues on, SMASHING
the rocky enclave they have just left.

Grant and the kids huddle and watch the last under-bellies oscillate
above them.  The stampede goes past.  They lie there, unable to move.
They watch the herd trample on.


CLOSE ON - The Rex's foot as it crushes a motion sensor.

Lex SCREAMS.  Grant and Timmy cover her mouth.

The T-Rex hunts down the herd.  He targets his prey.  A young hadrosaur.

As the hadrosaur gallops into the shadowy treeline, the Rex lunges
fiercely.  The Rex and its victim are enveloped 
in dust.

Grant holds Lex close.  She watches the terrible cloud with a quiet
horror.  Timmy makes the first move to leave.

                            TIMMY
          Let's go.  Now!

The herd's remainder gallops off into the safety of the deep jungle.

Grant, Lex and Timmy run in the opposite direction.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

Hammond, Arnold, Wu, and Ellie watch the monitor as the dust slowly
clears.  Hadrosaurs scatter.

Now the Rex is calm and quiet.  BACK TO CAMERA, he gnaws on something.

                            HAMMOND
          No!  Oh no!  He make a kill.  He killed
          one of my animals!  Where's Muldoon?

                            ARNOLD
          I'm sorry, Mr. Hammond.

                            HAMMOND
          My animals!  My animals!

Muldoon enters, limping in.  Hammond is very upset.

                            HAMMOND
          Where have you been?  My Rex killed a
          hadrosaur.  You should be out there,
          doing something.

                            MUL
DOON
          I just came to tell you - you're minus
          one computer expert.


EXT  BY THE RIVER, PARK - DAY

The water rushes a few hundred yards away.  Grant and the kids have
finally rested enough.  Grant nods to Timmy.

                            GRANT
          We'll walk by the river.  That leads back
          to the Visitor's center.

                            LEX
          Not me.  I'm not walking anymore.

                            TIMMY
          Come on Lex, I'll carry you.

                            LEX
          Nope.  Too scared.

Timmy looks up at Grant.  Grant kneels down by Lex.  Lex embraces Grant.

                            GRANT
          You ready?

She wipes her tears.

                            LEX
          Can we go on the raft?  Then we don't
          have to walk so close to the animals!

                            GRANT
          What raft?

Lex points to a low concrete maintenance building with bars.  It is
twenty yards away.

                            LEX

          Where I found Freda's baby.

Grant start to stand.  He's thinking.

                            GRANT
          It's still mid-morning.  I bet we have at
          least ten miles to go.  If we take the
          raft along the river, we can make much
          faster progress.

                            TIMMY
          Let's do it.


INT  MAINTENANCE BUILDING -

Grant stumbles deep in the gloomy recesses of the building.  He pushes
past drums of herbicide, tree-pruning equipment, spare tires, coils of
cyclone fencing, huge fertilizer bags, stacks of ceramic insulators,
empty motor-oil cans, work-lights and cables.

                            GRANT
          Lex, I don't see any raft.

Timmy looks at Lex.  Where is it?  Lex doesn't know.

                            TIMMY
          Keep going.

Grant keeps pushing through bags of cement, lengths of copper pipe,
piles of green mesh.  Two plastic oars hang on the concrete wall.

                            GRANT
          Bullseye!

Timmy is reliev
ed.  Lex smiles.

                            LEX
          Told you!

Grant grabs them.  Looks around, still -

                            GRANT
          No raft. Where did you see it, Lex?

                            LEX
          Actually, I never really saw one. Just
          assumed.

                            GRANT
          Assumed?

She nods.  Grant and Timmy resume looking.

IN THE REAR OF THE BUILDING - Lex walks below a barred window.  Slats of
light fall on her back.  She sees a dark closet door ajar.  She brushes
the handle.  It swings opens and two bright orange life preservers fall
on her, knocking her to the ground.

LEX SCREAMS, frantically pushing the life preservers off.

Grant's head pops up.  Timmy runs to her side.  She is wrestling
irrationally with the life preservers.  Timmy drops to the ground.

                            TIMMY
          Lex!  Lex!  You're okay, you're okay!

Lex is overcome with fear.  Timmy grabs a preservers and puts it on.

                            TIMM
Y
          Look, Lex!  Look!

She looks at him, realizes, and bursts out laughing.  Timmy laughs with
her.  Grant joins them.  He sits on a box and laughs.

                            GRANT
          I'm afraid there's no raft.

Grant gets up.  He reaches for the hands of the kids.  Timmy sees it -
the box Grant sat on is labeled: RAFT STORAGE.  Timmy smiles..


AT THE RIVER'S EDGE -

Grant pulls a cord.

With a LOUD HISS, the rubber begins to expand uncontrollably, jerking
and jumping like a wild marionette.  Then, with a whopping HISS-WHAP! it
pops fully open on the deck: a large bright yellow rubber raft.

Timmy and Lex climb in, wearing the life preservers.  Grant gets in and
pushes off with his oars.

The small disturbance causes the cicadas to ROAR.  The raft drifts out
into the lagoon.  Grant fixes his oars into the oarlocks.

Grant surveys the river.

                            GRANT
          Looks pretty calm.

THUMP.  The raft stops moving.  They are aground.  Lex looks overboard.
She reaches in
 about elbow deep.

Grant stands and puts the oars in the water.  He pushes with all his
might.  There is a long scraping sound of the raft against the mud
floor.  But it moves.  And the raft goes into deep enough water.

A general sigh of relief as they gently float downstream.


A WIDE AREA OF THE RIVER -

Grant energetically works the oars.

CLOSE ON - Lex lets her hand trail in the water.

                            LEX
          I'll row, Dr. Grant.

                            GRANT
          No.

But he's sweating and takes a moment to rest.  Lex looks down at her
hand in the water.  It still trails.

                            LEX
          Hey, we're still moving.

Grant looks into the water.  She's right.

                            GRANT
          There's a current.

Grant lays back against the rubber gunwales, closes his eyes.  The two
kids look at him.

                            LEX
          You can't sleep.

                            GRANT
              (eyes closed)
          I'm not sl
eeping... yet.

                            LEX
          I'll do it!

Lex picks up the oars and begins.

                            TIMMY
          We gotta warn them about the boat.

Grant opens one eye and looks up at the sun in the sky.  He sighs and
takes up the oars again.  He rows powerfully with the current.


A BEND IN THE RIVER -

Current picks up speed.  The water begins to rush and ROAR.

                            TIMMY
          Cool!

White foam crashes on the raft and sprays the kids.  They burst out
laughing.  Grant smiles at them, but there is concern in his eyes.


ANOTHER BEND -

Now the raft is really racing.  The kids hold on tightly as the raft is
rocked.  White water crashed over, drenching the kids.  When Grant takes
a moment to look, he is soaked by a huge wave.

The raft tosses right and left.  Timmy holds the rubber grips.  He's
yanked to one side.  He's knocked to the raft floor.  Quickly gets his
grip again.  SHOUTS to Grant.

                            TIMMY
          Thought
 is looked calm?

                            GRANT
          Guess I was wrong.

Grant looks ahead.  The river widens.  The raft really starts to fly.

Lex, gripping very tightly, looks out.  Water sprays her again and
again.  Her face is serious.

                            LEX
          I can't swim!

Grant grabs the raft's tie line and pulls it out of its rubber rings.
He lashes it around Lex and Timmy.  Then he ties it around one of the
rubber grips.

                            GRANT
          Hold on real tight.

They go flying down the river.  The ROAR deafens.

The raft lifts out of the water.  And crashes down, rocking every way.

Jagged rocks appear.  Grant uses his paddle as a club to push off the
rocks and the rushing shoreline.  The kids duck from sudden overhanging
trees.

Grant looks ahead.  He blanches.

HIS POV - the surging edge of a tumultuous waterfall.

They're almost there.  At the huge waterfall, water rushes violently,
heaving over the magnificent precipice.

Timmy tries to tighten L
ex's vest but is thrown back down .  He YELLS:

                            TIMMY
          Hold my hand.  Hold my hand when we go.

The raft spins in the rushing water.  Everyone is thrown around.

The rope holding the kids to the raft tautens. The oars are wrestled out
of Grant's hands and go flying through the air, spilling over the edge.

At the last moment, Grant spots a tree branch arching over the cascade.
With all his might, he stands and holds his balance long enough. to let
his hands smash into the overhanging branch.

They stop right at the waterfall's edge.

Grant struggles mightily to hold onto the branch.  But the water keeps
rushing.  His strength ebbs.

                            TIMMY
          Don't let go!

Grant's veins pop out in his arms.  His hands start to slip off the wet
tree bark.  Lex watches his hands slowly lose their grip.

The rubber raft jumps and leaps below him.  Water pours into the raft.
Lex tries fruitlessly to let it out.  Timmy holds down Grant's feet.

               
             TIMMY
          You can do it!

                            GRANT
          I'm trying.  I'm trying ... Ooooo!!! ....

His hands slipping, slipping ...

                            GRANT
          No!!!!!

                                                      CUT TO:

CLOSE ON - The T-Rex, face down in the mud.


INT  CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON

Arnold, Wu, Muldoon, and Ellie stare raptly at the monitor.

                            MULDOON
          Son-of-a-bitch.  He's taking a nap.
          Hasn't been this well fed ... ever.

Hammond is above, in his throne.  He calls down:

                            HAMMOND
          Could he drown in that position?  That's
          a very valuable animal.

                            MULDOON
          I know it's a valuable animal.

Muldoon takes a step up toward Hammond's throne and the two argue
quietly back and forth.  In the foreground, Wu calls Arnold over.

                            WU
          What's that, John?

Wu points to the screen behind 
Arnold's head.  In the upper right-hand
corner, it blinks a yellow warning:  AUX PWR LOW!  Ellie regards it.

                            ELLIE
          You running on auxiliary power?

                            ARNOLD
          I'm not.

                            WU
          Looks like you are.

                            ARNOLD
          Can't be.

                            WU
          Print the system status log.

Arnold nods and rapidly strikes keys.  In the corner, a printer whirs to
life.  Moments later, it spins out a single page.  Arnold tears it off.

Ellie continues to stare at the screen.  It now flashes red:  AUX PWR
FAIL!  An alarm klaxon BLARES.

Hammond holds his ears against the noise.  He stands up.

The room lights begin to FLASH.  They're reflected in Hammond's eyes.
Hammond ROARS above the chaos.

                            HAMMOND
          What the hell is going on?

Onscreen, numbers begin to count backward from ten.  Hammond lurches.
At zero, the lights go off, the monitors,
 even the computer.  Just the
alarms keep screaming.

                            HAMMOND
          You're ruining my ordered, precise park!

Arnold ignores him, keeps pressing buttons.  Hammond rushes toward
Arnold.  Arnold looks over his shoulder in surprise.  Hammond SCREAMS.

                            HAMMOND
          Fix my park, Arnold!  Fix it!

Arnold crosses his hands in front of his face, blocking Hammond's
attack.  Hammond grabs Arnold's wrists and the two twirl to the ground.
Breathing heavily, Hammond clutches his hand to his own chest.

Arnold stands up, brushes off.  He puts himself together, looks at
Hammond.  He SHOUTS over the siren:

                            ARNOLD
          I know it's hard, I know it's hard, but
          I'm going to put it all back together for
          you - I promise.  I will


BACK ON RAFT AT WATERFALL -

Grant still clings to the overhanging branch, holding the raft from
toppling over the crashing waterfall.  Lex and Timmy hold onto his legs.

The ROAR of the
 water diminishes.  And the flow subsides from a raging
current to a rolling river.  And then to a gentle stream.  A trickle.
Nothing.

Grant slowly relaxes, lets go.  So do the children.  Around the raft,
the water level begins to drain.  Gradually, Grant and the kids are left
in the raft sitting in just a few puddles of water.  Around them,
various pumps and other equipment is exposed where it was once covered
by rushing white water.

                            LEX
          The waterfall stopped.

                            TIMMY
          Waterfalls aren't supposed to stop.

                            GRANT
          I think they cut the power.  Hey -

He points and the three of them look over the edge where the waterfall
once poured.  There's a shimmering rainbow and beyond that, in the mist
is the visitor's center.

                            GRANT
          Well, there's our pot of gold.  Let's go,
          kids.

They grab his hands and clamber out of the raft, running toward shore.


BACK ON CON
TROL ROOM -

Muldoon pulls open the blinds and the hot sun filters in, so the room is
alternate patches of bright and dark.

In a hot corner, Ellie squats over a prostate Hammond, mopping his brow
with a cool cloth.  He murmurs, only barely intelligible.

                            HAMMOND
          Told him, fix my park, fix my park.

Wu brings the printout to Arnold.  The printout is a chronological
rendering of control room events since the restart.  It is clear they
have been running on auxiliary power.  Wu yells above the alarm:

                            WU
          You shut down as six thirty-four this
          morning, and when you started back up, it
          was with auxiliary power.

                            ARNOLD
          Jesus.  The auxiliary generator fires up
          first and then that's used to start the
          main generator because it needs a heavy
          charge.  The main generator has to be
          manually reset.

                            WU
          Outside?  In
 the generator building?

Arnold nods.  Muldoon points to a line in the printout:

06:35:22   WARNING: FENCE STATUS (NB)  OPERATIVE - AUX POWER

                            MULDOON
          This doesn't mean the fences have been
          off since six-thirty, does it?

Arnold grabs the paper, looks at it, slams it down.

                            ARNOLD
          Backup power doesn't generate enough
          amperage to power the electrified fences,
          so they were automatically kept off.
          That's also why we had no phones or
          radio.

                            MULDOON
          All of the fences?

                            ARNOLD
          Yes.

                            MULDOON
          Including the velociraptor mesh?

                            ARNOLD
              (disgusted, exhausted)
          Yes, yes, yes.

In the corner, Hammond lifts his head and Ellie gently helps him to a
sitting position.

                            HAMMOND
          Do you mean those raptor
s could be loose?

                            ARNOLD
          I'm afraid so.

                            MULDOON
          No, no way.  Last time, it took 'em two
          days to chew through that mesh.  But give
          'em enough time, they'll get out.  We
          better get that power on now.

                            HAMMOND
          Regardless, check the pit.  Make sure
          there' five of them there.


EXT  VISITOR'S CENTER - AFTERNOON

Muldoon and Arnold run across the lawn.  Muldoon carries his rocket
launcher at a ready position.  In the distance, the alarm still SOUNDS,
lights FLASH a continued warning.

They reach the maintenance building where the generator is housed.  Its
familiar him has been replaced by its own alarms.  The closer they
approach, the louder and brighter these alarms are.  Grey steam pours
out of the vents of the building, obscuring everything.

                            ARNOLD
          What's that steam coming out of my
          generator room?

           
                 MULDOON
          Relax, it's just refrigerated air.
          There's a leaky cooling pipe.  I fixed it
          a couple times before but the original
          installation was at too sharp an angle.

Arnold accepts this.  He is about to enter when Muldoon instructs him.

                            MULDOON
          Just go and turn on your generator, then
          get right back to the control room.

Arnold lights a cigarette and disappears into the steam-shrouded door.


EXT  RAPTOR PIT - AFTERNOON

Muldoon inspects an extremely discouraging sight.  The thick mesh that
covered the pit has been chewed through and ripped open.  With heavy gun
in one hand, Muldoon shines his flashlight into the pit.  It's empty.

Muldoon looks up.

MULDOON'S POV - the dense forest surrounding the Visitor's Center.

Muldoon examines the ground.  He locates the raptor prints leading away

Muldoon breaks into a run.


INT/EXT  GENERATOR ROOM - AFTERNOON

Muldoon comes back to the generator room still runnin
g full-tilt.  He
kicks open the door.  Steam pours out.  Standing in the thick steam,
Muldoon yells for Arnold.  No answer.  He steps in the doorway and
shines his flashlight around.

MULDOON'S POV - Only the dark abstract shapes of rakes and coiled ropes
and small machinery can be seen in the steam.

Muldoon yells again.  No answer at all.  Muldoon curses and leaves.

As soon as Muldoon is gone, there is movement.  Even above the sirens,
an animalistic breathing, grunting can be heard.  Obscured by steam and
flashing lights, a reptilian claw clutches a shadow.  A pack of
cigarettes falls to the ground, spilling out on the floor.


INT  CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON

Muldoon enters and confronts Hammond, Ellie, and Wu,

                            MULDOON
          Raptors chewed their way out.  All five
          are out there.

                            ELLIE
          Arnold's not with you?

Muldoon looks around grimly.  He shakes his head.

                            MULDOON
          I was hoping he was ba
ck here already.

Hammond takes charge.

                            HAMMOND
          This is why my quarters were specially
          fortified.  To assist in an emergency just
          like this one.  Let's go.  Muldoon, round
          up the workers.  They'll go with us too.

Muldoon stares at Hammond, then drops it.  They prepare to go.

                            ELLIE
          Wait.  What about Arnold?


EXT  HILLSIDE, PARK -

Grant and the kids come over the hill.  Timmy sees the big fence and the
Visitor's Center close behind.

                            TIMMY
          We're home!

Lex and Grant happily run down the hill.


EXT  ELECTRIFIED FENCE IN PARK - AFTERNOON

Grant and the kids stand in the long shadows of the electric fence.
This huge fence is much higher than what Timmy has had to climb.  Grant
turns to him apologetically.

                            GRANT
          Sorry, Tim.  We gotta climb up.

                            TIM
          That's all right, Dr. Grant.  You owe me
   
       one.


EXT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - AFTERNOON

Wu stands at the open sliding gate of the perimeter fence surrounding
Hammond's quarters..  Next to him is Ellie.  Behind both of them,
launcher at the ready, is Muldoon.  Watching from the window above,
Hammond waves.  Ellie and Wu wear radio headsets.

                            MULDOON
          Okay Wu, I'll have you covered at every
          moment.  But this shell carries quite a
          punch, so if you're too close, it'll take
          a piece of you.  Ellie's on the headset
          with you.  If another ones come at you,
          let her know.  Then Ellie - you start
          jumping and yelling.  The buggers are
          easily distracted.  They'll come running
          and let Wu get that power on.  Then both
          of you, get behind this fence as quick as
          possible.

Wu and Ellie nod seriously and test radio contact.  We starts his way
across the lawn, Muldoon limps behind with his launcher.  Ellie stands
ready at the open 
gate.

Wu takes slow steps.  Muldoon follows.  Wu is just five feet away from
the door to the generator building.

CLOSE ON - Wu's tense face.

THE ATTACK is sudden and fierce.  It comes from the brush.  The raptor
leaps onto Wu in an instant.  Wu and the raptor roll on the ground.  Wu
struggles for his life.  Muldoon can't get a safe shot.  He SCREAM:

                            MULDOON
          Wu, get away.  Give me room to shoot.

Ellie comes running away from the safety of the gate.  She jumps up and
down, waving her hands, and SCREAMS:

                            ELLIE
          Hey you cretaceous dromaeosaur, you can't
          catch me.  Hey, come and get me, you
          flat-snouted Mongolian beast.  Hey!

The Raptor is distracted by this.  He lets Wu go for a moment, shaking
him loose from his bloody jaws.  Instantly, Wu rolls away.  Muldoon
fires the rocket launcher.  With a SIZZLE, the missile fires.  BOOM!
Direct hit!  The raptor is blown to tiny pieces.

Muldoon grabs Wu and pulls the inju
red man to safety.

                            MULDOON
          You ok?

In reply Wu gets to his feet, looks where the Raptor was.

                            WU
          Now, there's four.

Muldoon helps Wu back inside the fence.  He waves for Ellie to come in
and join them.

Ellie takes off toward the generator building.  She YELLS:

                            ELLIE
          I'm going in.  Muldoon, cover the door
          after I go in.  Wu, guide me!

Muldoon yells for her to wait but stops when he realizes that this may
be their best plan.

Ellie races like a gazelle across the open lawn.  She's very fast and
graceful.  She ducks into the generator building.

Above it all, Hammond watches at the small viewing window.


BACK ON - GRANT AND KIDS AT FENCE

The three are at the top of the fence now.  Grant carefully lifts Lex
above the barbed wire and she grabs onto the other side of the fence to
begin the climb down.  Grant grabs Tim and lifts him next.  Tim's tense
face is a river of sweat.


INT  GE
NERATOR BUILDING -

Ellie finishes the stairs and feels her way along the basement wall.
Her face is lit by a flashing yellow light.  She bangs her head on a
pipe.  She rubs her head.

                            ELLIE
          Damn, I banged my head.

                            WU (OVER RADIO)
          Oh that's good, that must be the water
          pipe.  You're really close now, there's a
          cabinet just above your head.  Reach up
          and open it.  The handle turns to the
          left.

Ellie turns the handle.  The cabinet opens.

                            WU (OVER RADIO)
          It's a large throw-switch.  Pull it down,
          count to three, and push it back up.
          That's all there is to it.

Ellie throws it down.  She counts:

                            ELLIE
          One -


BACK ON GRANT AND KIDS -

Just a few feet from the bottom of the fence.


BACK ON ELLIE -

                            ELLIE
          Two -


BACK ON GRANT AND KIDS -

Grant and Timmy jump down. 
 Lex is just behind.  Her sneaker catches in
the fence pattern.  She pulls on it.


BACK ON ELLIE -

                            ELLIE
          Three!

She throws the large switch back.


BACK ON LEX -

She jumps off the fence.  Her sneaker comes off, falls to the ground.

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON LEX - it celebrates her narrow escape.

Grant casually leans against the fence to help Lex with her shoe.
NOTHING!  STILL NO ELECTRIC FENCES!

The Visitor's Center is in sight.  They all turn to each other.  Elated.

                            LEX
          We did it!

                            TIM
          We made it!

Lex jumps up and down.  Grant smiles, high-fives Timmy.


BACK ON ELLIE -

The siren and the flashing lights stop.  The room lights go on.  Ellie
turns to go back upstairs.  Her foot slips, she falls to the ground.
She has slipped on a pool of blood.  She jumps up, recoils.

It's Arnold.  She squelches a SCREAM, covering her own mouth.

SMASH!  Ellie SCREAMS as a raptor lunges at her.   He jumps down
 from
above the water pipe Ellie banged her head on.

Ellie turns and races toward a ventilation shaft.  She dives into it.
The raptor gets there a second late and smashes against the shaft wall.

Ellie pushes herself against the shaft wall and, using her legs to push
against the wall, begins to climb up.

The raptor smashes against the shaft again and gets inside.  Ellie
scrambles up.  The raptor snarls and spits but it is momentarily pinned.

Ellie continues her scramble up the shaft.  At ground level, she slams
her feet hard against a vent, popping it open.  Scraping the wall and
banging against pipes, she races toward the door.


EXT  GENERATOR BUILDING - CONTINUING ACTION

Ellie runs full-tilt toward the fence surrounding Hammond's quarters.
Wu, injured, lies within the safety of the fenced area.  Muldoon stands
with his rocket launcher just outside the fence waiting for Ellie.
Ellie screams to him as she speeds across the lawn.

                            ELLIE
          Raptor!

The raptor EXPLODES th
rough the door of the generator building after
Ellie.

Muldoon fires at the raptor. Misses.  No time to reload.

The raptor gains on Ellie.  Muldoon ducks inside the fence's heavy gate.
He slides the gate half-shut, waving Ellie on.

Ellie dives inside the safety of the fence, losing her headset as she
goes.  The gate is almost closed.  The raptor lunges.

Muldoon slides shut the heavy gate, bashing the raptor's head with all
his might.  The raptor shudders, caught in the gate.  Stunned, for a
second, it doesn't move.

Ellie and Muldoon run to the building.  They push open the steel-clad
security door and dive inside.  Wu limping, chases after them.  With a
curse, Muldoon pushes the door back open, waves for Wu.

ELLIE AND MULDOON'S POV - Wu runs frantically.  The raptor jerks out of
the gate, inside of the fence.  He races after Wu.

                            WU
          Keep it open!  I'm coming!

Wu runs faster.  The raptor gains on him.  Wu screams, runs spastically.
Wu and the raptor are neck-and-neck
, equally close to the open door.

                            ELLIE
          Come on, Wu!  Come on!  Run!

The raptor is inches from Wu.  Both are closer and closer to the door.

                            ELLIE
          They're coming inside!

                            WU
          Help!

Wu and the raptor are at the door.

                            MULDOON
          No they're not, Ellie.

Muldoon slams the door shut on Wu and the raptor.  Wu's screams are
horrific.


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - CONTINUING ACTION

Ellie drops to her knees, her chest heaving, pulls her headset off with
a bleeding hand.  Muldoon, affected, turns to her.

                            MULDOON
          I couldn't compromise everyone's safety.

Ellie nods, catches her breath.

                            ELLIE
          Why didn't the power go on?

                            MULDOON
          You just reset the power.  Now the
          computer has to be booted.

Muldoon looks out the tiny barred window of the security do
or.

MULDOON'S POV - There is already almost no sign of Wu.  The gate to the
perimeter fence slides shut.  The raptor looks up.  He is trapped within
the perimeter fence of Hammond's quarters.

CAMERA SLOWLY TILTS to the viewing window above.  Hammond stares down.


INT  VISITOR'S CENTER -

Grant and kids walk through the open security doors.  All is empty and
quiet.  They call out but there are no answers.

                            LEX
          Where did everybody go?

Grant thinks.

                            GRANT
          Probably your grandfather's quarters.
          Let's go.

A DISTANT BELLOW.  Grant reconsiders.

                            GRANT
          Actually, stay here.

He corrals the kids into the half completed enclosure of the Gift Shop.

                            LEX
          No, I want to stay with you.

Grant looks around tensely.

                            GRANT
          No, keep an eye on things round here for
          me.  I'll be back with the others.

                 
           TIMMY
          What about -

Grant looks at Timmy.

                            GRANT
          I'll radio the ship as soon as I find
          somebody.  (beat)  You're in charge now.
          Don't move from here ... unless you have
          to, ok?

Timmy nods.  Lex is happy, sinks to the floor.

                            LEX
          Goody!  I'm gonna rest.

She finds a box of wind-up dinosaur toys. She winds one. Sends it
walking to Timmy.

                            TIMMY
          Tired!  He carried you the whole way.

Grant slips off into the concealing shadows of the skeletal display of
the T-rex and raptor in combat.  He looks back above his own shoulder
into the menacing jaws of the skeletal raptor.  He shouts back.

                            GRANT
          Be right back.


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -

It's a madhouse in the crowded baronial quarters of Hammond.  Gennaro is
singing at the top of his-lungs while Harding tries to restrain him.
Scared Workers huddle together, many a
re injured.  Hammond sits on the
floor, in a meditative trance.

Ellie and Muldoon stare out the window.

THEIR POV - The raptor is jumping in the air.  With every jump he comes
closer to leaping onto the roof of their small building.

Muldoon regards his rocket launcher ruefully.

                            ELLIE
          Why don't you just nail that bastard?

                            MULDOON
          No more ammo.  I requisitioned six
          charges but the bean-counter -
              (he thrusts a finger at Hammond)
          - cut it down to two.

Ellie looks up to the ceiling.  There is a large glass skylight with
crisscrossing iron bars casting an ominous shadow in the sun.


EXT  THE ANNE B AT SEA - DAY

The ship continues along smooth sunlit sea.  Land is in distant sight.


INT  STATEROOM -

The cracked egg is nudged open.  The cute scaly head of a six-inch baby
raptor nuzzles its way out of the shell.  It shakes off a few pieces of
clinging shell and immediately begins to devour one of the
 remaining eggs.

                                                      CUT TO:

CLOSE ON - The wind-up dinosaur skitters across the polished floor.  It
bands against the  the wall again and again.

Timmy looks down at it and smiles at Lex.

                            LEX
          Any candy behind the counter?

                            TIMMY
          Hungry?

                            LEX
          Starved.

Timmy looks behind the counter.  He sees boxes of goods.  He moves a
stack of umbrellas out of his way.  Lex gets up and pulls one out.

                            TIMMY
          Nothing.

                            LEX
          Let's go to the kitchen.

She smiles and pops to her feet.  Timmy's not sure.

                            TIMMY
          Dr. Grant said -

                            LEX
          - let's go.  We'll come right back.

CLOSE ON - Timmy's torn face.  He's hungry, too.

He makes the right decision.

                            TIMMY
          Nope.  We're waiting here t
ill Dr. Grant
          gets back.  He'll help us get some -

Interrupted by A SOUND.  A rhythmic, horrible BREATHING.   Now some
light and rapid STEPS.  And a SNIFFING.  It's definitely an animal.

Lex backs off in a hurry. She knocks the umbrella over.  It skirts
across the floor.  It spins and opens by itself.  Printed on it is the
ferocious face of the Spitter, the sides of its bright poisonous gills
spinning to a stop.

The breathing gets closer and closer.  The children huddle together in a
corner of the gift shop.  They SCREAM.

It's A RAPTOR, lean and ferocious.  More like a cyborg than a hunter, it
studies the kids from just outside the gift shop entrance.  His eyes
flick back and forth between the two pieces of meat.

Timmy grabs the box of toy dinosaurs.  He winds one up and sends it off
across the hall.  The raptor glances over at the moving toy.  Timmy
grabs another, whispers as he winds it.

                            TIMMY
          Start winding now!

Lex and Timmy wind toy after toy, send th
em across the hall.  The raptor
leaps, crushing one in its jaws.  Others waddle by.  The raptor dodges
and darts, grabbing this one, smashing that one.

The kids go running out into the hall.  They race down the Visitor
Center corridor.  Timmy pulls Lex behind him toward the restaurant.

                            LEX
          Where are we going?

                            TIM
          The kitchen!


INT/EXT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -

With a huge leap, the raptor finally makes it to the roof of Hammond's
quarters.  He jumps lightly onto the skylight.  Glass shatters over the
assembled guests and workers below.  Total commotion and SCREAMS.

The raptor immediately begins to gnaw at the iron bars that block the
skylight.  Below, they shake off shards of glass and huddle in the
corners.  Ellie turns to Muldoon.

                            ELLIE
          How long?

                            MULDOON
          Well, they seem to be getting faster all
          the time. I would say - fifteen minutes.

Ellie no
tices something out the window.  It's Grant approaching the
gate.  She hammers on the glass.

Grant's hand reaches for the knob.

The raptor stops gnawing, its ears perked up.

Ellie screams and screams.

Grant notices some of Wu's remains inside the gate.  He stops and looks
up.  At the window, Ellie waves her arms, warning him not to enter.
Grant stops.  He sees Wu's headset on the grass, reaches through the
fence, grabs it, puts it on.

Ellie jumps up and gets her headset.  She barks into it.

                            ELLIE
          There's a raptor on the roof of this
          building.  Open that gate and you're a
          dead man.

Grant stares up at Ellie in the window.  He waves.  She presses her hand
to the glass.

                            GRANT
          Ellie, I'm go glad -

                            ELLIE
          Shut up and listen.  We have about
          fifteen minutes here.  The computer has
          to be rebooted.  That'll turn on the
          electric fences.  Besides the r
aptor
          stuck in here with us, there are four
          more ...

Grant races back to the Visitor's Center as she continues to fill him in.


INT  KITCHEN, VISITOR'S CENTER - CONTINUING ACTION

The kids hurtle through this huge, industrial kitchen.  The kitchen is a
maze of turns, from the hot lamp pickup area to the rows of stainless
steel burners to the chopping blocks to the potwashing area.  The kids
dart and duck from one area to the next, taking shortcuts under tables,
crawling behind counters, scattering pots and pans behind.

Relentlessly, with a casual speed, the raptor stalks them.  It avoids
their obstacles with a casual grace and when it cannot fit through their
shortcuts, it just continues around.

Timmy pulls open the large silvered door of the freezer.  Lex starts to
hurry inside.  Timmy grabs her.

                            TIMMY
          We'll freeze to death in there.

                            LEX
          He's going to eat us!

Timmy reaches into the freezer and grabs a pile 
of steaks.  He tosses one
toward the raptor.  The raptor gobbles it in one bite.  Timmy shoves Lex
out of the way and begins to toss the steaks on the floor.  One after the
other, he tosses them, in a row, closer and closer to the open freezer.

The raptor mechanically gobbles the steaks, following their path.  He
continues right into the freezer to grab the last of Tim's bait.

Tim leaps and slams the heavy freezer door shut.  Lex comes running and
throws her small weight alongside of Timmy's.

                            TIMMY
          PUSH!

The heave and the lock catches on the door.  From inside, there is a
strangled CRY and the door is slammed repeatedly.  The metal panels of
the door buckle but they do not break.  The door hinges bend and curve
but they do not give.

The kids collapse in relief on the kitchen floor.  In just a moment,
Timmy is back on his feet.

                            LEX
          What is it, Timmy?

                            TIMMY
          I just remembered something.  Rapto
rs are
          born in large litters.  There's probably
          more coming.  We gotta hide.

He grabs her hand and they run out of the back entrance of the kitchen.
There's a stairway and they race up.


INT  GIFT SHOP -

Grant, wearing his headset, calls for the kids and looks around the gift
shop with concern.  He sniffs the air and examines the crushed windup
toys.  He sees some animal scales on the floor.  He hears a NOISE above
and begins to run.


INT  UPPER FLOOR HALLWAY, VISITOR'S CENTER -

The kids hear this NOISE too and it's closer to them.  They bust into -


INT  AMBER ROOM, LABORATORY -

The kids knock over trays of stones as they rush through this room.


INT  EXTRACTION ROOM, LABORATORY -

Automated drills whir as Tim and Lex crash through, knocking equipment
to the ground.  The drills still whir on the ground.


INT  GENETICS ROOM -

The Hamachi-Hood sequencers explode in a heap of punch cards and
magnetic tape as the kids race by.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY -

The kids slide int
o this room.  They race to its far corner, past
incubators and display cases of chemicals.  They look back and see -

KID'S POV - A raptor happily gorging itself on a table of eggs.  He's
been in this room, their place of refuge, the whole time.

CLOSE ON - The raptor's glistening eyes register the children.

He begins to stalk.  The kids SCREAM.  This time there is nowhere to go.

The raptor closes in on the kids.  Timmy feebly stands in front of his
younger sister.

CLOSE ON - The raptor licks its lips, lizard-like.

At the other end of the room, GRANT ENTERS quickly.  He surveys the
situation.  Quickly, he grabs an egg off a table.  He reaches into one
of the chemical cabinets with POISON WARNINGS prominently displayed.  He
comes out with a syringe and a vial.

The raptor is almost on the kids.  Grant coughs conspicuously.  The
raptor whirls, studies Grant.  He looks back at the children.

Grant speaks into the headset.

                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
          Talk, Ellie, just keep talking.

He tosses the headset on the ground.  Ellie's voice crackles out.  The
raptor studies it, transfixed.

Grant injects the egg, then gently rolls it on the ground.  The raptor
forgets the headset.  He comes forward and sniffs the egg, then sucks it
up, swallowing it whole.

The raptor turns back to the kids.  He takes two steps toward them,
tenses to pounce - and keels over.  DEAD.

The kids race around the dead raptor to Grant.  Grant grabs his headset
as the three run out of the room.  Grant addresses Timmy as they run.

                            GRANT
          Timmy, you know anything about computers?

                            TIMMY
          Well, I just got an XT at home.  I told
          my Dad I wanted a 386.

                            GRANT
          Ok good, you're elected.


INT  CONTROL ROOM -

Grant and Tim and Lex study the quiet room.  Grant speaks calmly into
his headset.

                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
          Okay, we've reached the computer room.
          Who can te
ll Timmy how to reboot?

                            ELLIE (OVER RADIO)
          Ah, Alan, nobody here knows how to boot
          the computer.  Please hurry, we've only
          got a couple minutes left.

                            GRANT
          Tim, you got to book the system.  They
          reset the power and there are no phones.
          We gotta turn on the fences and we gotta
          stop that ship.

                            LEX
          Are they going to be ok?

                            GRANT
          If we can get help very soon.

                            TIMMY
          Sshh, you guys, I'm thinking.

He studies a grid on a large console.  He reaches out and touches a part
of the screen.  There is a beep and a warning sign - INVALID ARGUMENT.
PLEASE TRY AGAIN.


BACK ON  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -

The raptor has chewed almost all the way through the bars.  Panic below.
In the middle of it all, Ellie is focused, listening on her headset.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

Timmy tries somethin
g else.  BEEP.  Lex raises a hand.  Grant stops her.

                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
          Ellie, we're working as fast as we can
          here.

Timmy tries a screen section.  BEEP.  Again. BEEP.  Again.  BEEP.  BEEP.

Timmy shakes his head.  In desperation he stabs at the keyboard below
the touch screen.  He punches the ESCAPE button.

The screen lights up a new message - SYSTEM RESET COMPLETED.  ALL
SYSTEMS NORMAL.


BACK ON  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -

The raptor has just chewed through.  He squeezes his body into the space
as the bars ELECTRIFY.  Spastically, the raptor jerks back and forth as
the current flows through him.  He can't get out.

Finally, with a WHIMPER, he stops struggling and slides through the
space he created.  With a THUMP, he drops to the floor below.

Ellie, Muldoon, Hammond and the workers look on in shock.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

Grant cheers and hugs Timmy.  Lex whoops.

                            ELLIE (ON RADIO)
          Ok, we're all right here for now.
      
    Thanks.

                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
          Don't mention it.  It was Timmy.

                            ELLIE (ON RADIO)
          But there's still one more raptor.  So be
          careful.

Timmy is pushing menus and submenus on the touchscreen now.
COMMUNICATIONS - RADIO - VEHICULAR ...  He gets the one he wants.

He indicates the radio-mike to Grant.

                            TIM
          I think this is the boat.  They called it
          the Queen Anne or something.

Grant grabs the mike.

                            GRANT
          Queen Anne, do you read me?  Queen Anne?

The radio crackles to life.

                            RADIO
          This is the Queen Anne B?  I copy.
          What's up?

                            GRANT
          Report your position!

                            RADIO
          Ah, we're just about to dock here in
          Puntaremas.  Who wants to know?  Please
          identify yourself.

Tim punches the screen which displays FARRELL, F
REDERICK D. (CAPT.)
Grant reads it and nods.  His voice is tough as nails.

                            GRANT
          Try this for identification, Captain
          Farrell.  You are in possession of stolen
          biological materials.  If you don't turn
          that boat around and return to Isla
          Nublar immediately with your contraband
          cargo, you will be found in violation of
          Section 509 of the Uniform Maritime Act,
          you will be subject to revocation of
          license, penalties in excess of fifty
          thousand dollars, and five years in jail.
          Do you copy?

SILENCE.

                            GRANT
          Do you copy, Captain Farrell?

                            RADIO
          I copy.  All ahead stern.

A blinking light on a map indicates that the ship is pulling away from
the harbor.  Grant nods to Timmy who terminates the radio contact.

                            TIMMY
          What's the Uniform Maritime Code?

                     
       GRANT
          Who the hell knows?

Grant and Timmy start to celebrate again when Lex interrupts.

                            LEX
          What good does that do?  To have the ship
          turn around?

Grant turns to her seriously.

                            GRANT
          Well it gives us ten more hours.
              (to Timmy)
          Let's see if we can raise the Costa Rican
          Coast Guard on that thing.

The last raptor smashes into the control room through Hammond's viewing
window.  Glass goes flying.  Grant and kids go running into the hallway.


INT ROTUNDA -

With the raptor in hot pursuit, the kids and Grant come flying.  Tim and
Lex jump over the railing, leaping onto the skeletal display.  Grant
goes for the stairs, jumping down them three at a time.

The raptor goes after the kids, scrambling over the balcony onto the
display.  The kids scamper down the display, knocking paint cans and
tools off the scaffolding as they go.  The raptor is just one beat
behind, and his snar
ling face is splashed with red paint as he chases.

The kids burrow into the rib cage of the Rex.  They break off floating
rubs and hurl them back at the raptor.  The raptor is undeterred,
closing the gap on the kids.

The kids are stuck at the end of the rib cage - it's closed off by the
skeleton and they can't break through.  They're imprisoned.  The raptor
is pushing through the rib cage, bones crackling as it goes.

Grant leaps up the scaffolding, grabs a beam, swings his weight onto it,
and slams it into the T-Rex's neck.  The neck shatters and the massive
head of the T-Rex drops free.

It falls directly onto the last raptor, squashing him flat.  Dead.

                            GRANT
              (grimly)
          And then there were none.


EXT  HELICOPTER PAD - DUSK

Muldoon leads his workers onto an army helicopter.  Two workers carry
Gennaro on a stretcher.  Ellie boards with the kids on each side of her,
holding her hands.

Grant and Hammond walk together, toward the helicopter.

              
              HAMMOND
          Dr. Grant, don't abandon this beautiful
          place.  I need a man just like you to
          help me get my park back on its feet
          again.  And it will be on its feet again.

                            GRANT
          We have to leave now.

Hammond stops.

                            HAMMOND
          Oh you don't know.  There are wonderful
          plans in the works, sites already
          purchased for Euro-Jurassic and Jurassic
          Japan.

Grant is unimpressed.  He holds a hand out to Hammond.  Hammond tries a
new approach.

                            HAMMOND
          Don't you see I've exalted human
          potential here?  You must see it.  You
          must feel it.  I called back a life form.
          Listen, Dr. Grant, don't go.  Be a part
          of this.  I'm inviting you to do just
          that - let the others go, if they want.

                            GRANT
          You interrupted natural law.  There are
          regulations,
 rules that nature follows
          that make her knowable.

                            HAMMOND
          You mean there are rules that nature
          follows that create barriers to our
          knowledge.

                            GRANT
          Barriers?  Like the seasons?  The earth
          spinning, orbiting the sun?  The entire
          solar system in interlocking motion.  Our
          own beings in biological step with it
          all.  Mr. Hammond, you've disrupted the
          pattern and look what it's done!

                            HAMMOND
          I know what it's done.  I've made
          triceratops and gallimimus and a T-Rex.
          I've got a batch of iguanadons being born
          on Tuesday.  What do you say to that?

                            GRANT
          Don't count on it.  Now get in.

Grant jumps in the copter, holds out a hand to Hammond.

                            GRANT
          You created mutant forms that you further
          mutated to create amus
ement attractions.
          You made biological puppets with
          heartbeats and an early death sentence.

                            HAMMOND
          I created genetic miracles!

                            GRANT
          You created a park to generate a profit-
          making merchandising operation.

                            HAMMOND
          The merchandise is just a by-product.
          Souvenirs for people to reflect on the
          wonder.  You fainted when you saw the
          brachiosaur.  Alan, look, let's not
          argue.  The problem is that my employees
          were not up to par with my dream.  They
          failed me.  The park, I promise you, is
          safe.  It really is.

Grant grabs Hammond's arm, starts to tug.

                            GRANT
          You park is doomed.  Now come with me.
          
                            HAMMOND
          It is not!  It's blooming!  In the throes
          of labor!  You are one more more negative
          voice in a 
universe of negativity.
          You'll amount to nothing.  You'll be a
          bone-brusher all your life.  I pity you.

Hammond pulls his arm away and strides away from the helicopter just as
the ROTORS START UP.  Hammond's suit whips in the wind.  Grant calls to
him, reaching out his arm.

                            GRANT
          Come back, Mr. Hammond!  It's over!

Hammond keeps walking.  He disappears over a grassy knoll.

Grant's outstretched hand drops to his side when THE ATTACK comes.

With a huge bellow, the T-Rex comes charging at the helicopter.  THE
PILOT screams for all to board as he starts to lift off.

The Rex bites onto the copter skid as the copter tries to escape.  The
copter angles dangerously as the Rex holds on.

Ellie fires a fire-extinguisher into the furious face of the Rex and its
jaws relax.  The copter escapes and starts to climb high into the sky.
The Rex paws after it, then drops down to four legs and gives the copter
a final swipe with its tail.

The tail SWISHES through 
the air and CRACKS against the plexiglass
windshield which fissures and pops.  The pilot struggles to maintain
altitude and manages to keep the craft in the air.

With a ROAR of its own, the copter breaks into the blue sky and soars.
away, leaving an angry T-Rex alone.  Unnoticed by the frustrated Rex,
Hammond slips away and walks into the jungle.


IN THE COPTER -

SLOWLY PAN the exhausted faces of Muldoon and his workers, Lex and Timmy
holding onto each other, and Grant huddles next to Ellie.  He reaches
out and puts an arm around her shoulder.  She reaches up and pulls his
arm close.

                            ELLIE
          They're so beautiful.  They're condemned,
          aren't they?  Even those embryo fragments
          had the same viral contamination.

                            GRANT
          I have a theory.

Ellie looks up in surprise.  She give him a big smile.

                            ELLIE
          You have a theory?

Grant smiles back at her.

                            GRANT
   
       I think that they could never completely          
          isolate the dinosaur DNA.  There was
          always some microscopic mosquito
          contamination.  But at the molecular
          level, that was enough.  Every dinosaur
          received the same genetic massage, the
          encoding that every mosquito gets to
          terminate life after a season.

                            ELLIE
          So the very process itself was flawed.

She's sad.  Grant hugs her.  Over her shoulder he gives a parting glance
to the island.  A green jewel in a blue sea.  Suddenly it is obliterated
by clouds.

CAMERA PANS AWAY AND SWOOPS DOWN from the copter.  IT CROSSES the sky.
THE CAMERA DESCENDS to Isla Nublar, slowly reveling in its natural
beauty and finally coming to earth in the midst of the verdant jungle.


IN THE JUNGLE - MAGIC HOUR

Hammond slowly climbs a steep hill covered with creeping growth.  He
almost reaches the top when he slips.  He falls to the soft ground and
rolls. He tumbles he
lplessly, rolling and spinning down the sharp drop,
finally coming to a complete stop in a shallow pool of water.  Face
down, his head splashes into the puddle.  No movement. Just the sound of
labored breath.

CAMERA PANS to Hammond's hand, half-submerged in water.  CAMERA MOVES
INTO EXTREME CLOSEUP as a mosquito lands on his hand.

                                         RACK OUT AND DISSOLVE TO:


EXT  OCEAN - NIGHT

The army copter circles lower and lower as it finds the Queen Anne B,
slowly drifting across the moonlit water.

1 	EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN  DAY	1

	A speedboat cuts swiftly through the ocean swells beneath the
	looming cliffs of ISLA SORNA.


2 	EXT. BOAT - DAY 							2

	Illegal Costa Rican parasail operator ENRIQUE CARDOSO helps
	Americans BEN HILDEBRAND and twelve-year-old ERIC KIRVY --
	already wearing life-vests -- strap themselves into a two-
	person PARASAIL HARNESS.


3 	EXT. BOAT - DAY 							3

	Ben and Eric clamber onto a makeshift PLATFORM that hangs over
	the back of the board. Dangling from Ben's neck is a CAMCORDER.

				BEN
		You make sure to get us as close as you can,
		okay? If it's a good trip, I'll give you a 
		little extra. 

				ENRIQUE
		Don't worry. I take you close. But not too 
		close.
			(rubbing Eric's head)
		You don't want them to eat you.

	Enrique heads toward the driver's seat and a large SECOND-HAND
	WINCH bolted to the deck.

				ENRIQUE (CONT'D)
		Ready, amigos?

	Ben and Eric nod excitedly and give the thumbs up. Ben lifts the
	camcorder to the record the action.

	Enrique jams the down the throttle down, and with a loud RAOR, the
	speedboat shoots forward. Soon the boat is whipping across the 
	rolling ocean.

	Strapped together, Ben and Eric lean back over the passing
	water, intently watching for Enrique's signal.

	As the boat picks up speed, Enrique eyes the speedometer.

	Ben grabs the end of the RIPCORD attached to the harness. He and
	Eric braces themselves.

	Enrique finally signals with a pulling motion. He pulls
	the winch, Ben yanks the cord and - 

	WOOOSH! A brightly colored PARASAIL blossoms behind the boat,
	hoisting Ben and Eric aloft. In a big BLOCK LETTERS on the
	parasail is stitched "DINO-SOAR."

	THE TOWNLINE unsold rapidly from its enormous reel.

	BEN AND ERIC climb higher and higher.

	ENRIQUE keeps an eye on the clients. When they reach a certain 
	height, he LOCKS OFF the reel.

	High overhead, Ben and Eric are floating in wonderful, quiet
	splendor. The motor of the boat now sounds strangely distant.

	Down below, the boat enters a think blanket of FOG.

	Eric points excitedly at the islands as Ben films him with the
	camera.

	Then, a sudden TUG on the thing line cause Ben to drop the camera,
	which now dangles from his neck.

				ERIC
		What was that?

	A second tug...and now the faintest of screams.

	Ben and Eric look down to find that the boat has disappeared
	into the low bank of FOG.

	By the time the boat emerges on the far side of the mist...THEIR
	IS NO SIGN OF ENRIQUE. The deck is splattered with blood.

	As Ben considers the driverless boat...

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Ben!

	Ben glances over at Eric, staring in horror at something 
	below. Following his gaze, Ben finds that their boat is only
	moments away from crashing into A LARGE REEF.

	Sticking out of the water, the imposing reef is being battered
	by waves.

	AS THE BOAT SMASHES INTO THE REEF, it splinters into a
	number of pieces.

	A panicked Ben turns to Eric.

				BEN
		Unclip your line!

	Eric and Ben frantically unclip their lines. Catching an
	updraft, the parasailers float upward.

	A strong wind sends them wafting over the daunting cliffs
	of ISLA SORNA...


4 	EXT. SUBURBAN BACKYARD - DAY 					4

	TWO PLASTIC DINOSAURS enter the frame and do battle accompanied
	by a child's ferocious sounds.

				CHILD (O.S.)

		RRRRROW! GRRRRRR!

	WINDER TO REVEAL -

	CHARLIE, a three-year old boy, plays in a sandbox with his
	favorite toy dinosaurs. ALAN GRANT squats next to him and
	watches with great delight.

	ELLIE SATLER stands over them, an INFANT in her arms -- a
	picture of the perfect family.

				GRANT
		Oh, actually, Charlie, those two are
		herbivores. They wouldn't be interested in
		fighting each other. But these...
			(picking up two other dinosaurs)
		See, these are carnivores. And this one here
		-- see its claws -- this one here uses its
		claws to gouge at the throat of its opponent

	As Grant demonstrates with some GRUNT and GROANS of his
	own, he only succeeds in frightening the boy.

				ELLIE
			(interrupting)
		Uh, Alan?


				GRANT
		Hmm?

				ELLIE
		He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a
		little older?


				GRANT
		Oh, right.
			(back to Charlie)
		Happy dinosaurs.

	He bounces them along the sandbox edge.

	Then, the sound of a CAR ENGINE turning off and a door
	SLAMMING is heard.

				ELLIE
		That must be Mark.
			(calling out)
		Mark, were back here!

	Ellie and Grant turn to see --

MARK DEGLER coming through the gate carrying a briefcase. He's their age, handsome but not annoyingly so, with a friendly,
	balance demeanor.

	He and Ellie kiss tenderly on the lips.

				ELLIE (CONT'D)
		Good day?

				MARK
		Keeping the world safe.
			(re: baby)
		Here, let me take her.

	Ellie hands off the baby.

				ELLIE
		Mark, this is Alan Grant.

				MARK
		Nice to meet you, Alan. I've heard a lot about
		you.

	The two men shake hands, and we now realize it is Grant
	who is the stranger in this household. Little Charlie runs to
	his father, showing his dinosaur.

				CHARLIE
		Daddy, this is a herbabore.

	Grant smiles uncomfortably, a third wheel.


5 	INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT 					5

	WINDEN to a PARROT in a large cage. Grant is teasing 
the bird with a cookie, holding a it just out of reach.

				GRANT
		What's my name? Come on, Jack, say it. Is my
		name Alan? Say my name.

		The bird doesn't respond.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		He used to know me.

				ELLIE
		Sorry, Alan it's been six years.

	Grant shrugs, gives Jack the cookie, and heads towards the table.
	The three adults are finishing their dessert and coffee. The
	The children have been out to bed.

	An awkward moment of silence. Uncomfortable smiles. Then --

				MARK
		More coffee?

				ELLIE
			(relived)
		Yes. Great.

	Mark stands and collects their cups.

				ELLIE (CONT'D)
		So, Mark's working at the State Department
		now.

				GRANT
		Really? 
(To Mark)
What do you do there?

				MARK
			(with mock bravado)
		I could tell you about it, but than I'd have to
		kill you.

				GRANT
		Indeed.

	Mark smiles, nodding. Then he goes into the kitchen. Another
	uncomfortable silence.

				ELLIE
	So what are you working on now?

				GRANT

	We have a new site in Montana. At least until
	the money runs out.

				ELLIE
		Anything good?

				GRANT
		Raptors, mostly.

				ELLIE
		My favorite.

	Grant leans forward, realizing Ellie's one of the few people he
	can talk to about this.

				GRANT
		You remember the sounds they made?

				ELLIE
		I try not to.

				GRANT
		We've done cranial scans, and raptors
		actually had a quite sophisticated
		resonating chamber. I have a theory that
		their ability to vocalize is the key to their
		social intelligence. The way they can work
		together as a team.

				ELLIE
		You think they could talk to each other?

				GRANT
		To a degree we never imagined.

	And from the cage in the corner of the room...

				JACK
		Bullshit!

	Both look back at the parrot. ELLIE smiles.

				ELLIE
		You taught him that.


6 	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT 					6

	Ellie and Grant head toward the rental car parked in the
	driveway.

				ELLIE
		Good luck with the fund raising.

				GRANT
		It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park,
		you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils
		are out. Everyone wants to see a real live
		dinosaur.

				ELLIE
		Times change Alan. But you're the still the
		best. I mean that.

				GRANT
		The last of my breed.

	A long moment passes between them as both consider where
	they've ended up.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		I'd better get going.

				ELLIE
		Let me know if I can help, Alan. Youre bad
		about asking for help, but please ask me.
		Anything, anytime.

				GRANT
			(deep down knowing he never
			 will)
		Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.

				ELLIE
		Goodbye, Alan.

	Not sure what the right thing to do is, they finally end up with
	a friendly hug. They keep it short.

	Grant gets in his car. Starts the ENGINE.

	He's about to pull off when Ellie knocks on the window. He rolls
	it down.

				ELLIE (CONT'D)
		When I met you, I thought that one day
		millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs
		became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me
		otherwise. When conditions changed,
		dinosaurs changed. They became other things.
		They evolved.

				GRANT
		A well-accepted theory.

				ELLIE
			(simply)
		Alan don't be afraid to evolve.

	Grant hears her, but Ellie knows it didn't really get through.
	A forced half-smile, than Grant waves goodbye.

	Ellie watches as he drives off.


7 	INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY 						7

	The last stop on Grant's fund-raising tour, it's a public
	lecture hosted by some foundation. There are SCIENTISTS and
	STUDENTS here, but also a lot of DINO-FANS, some even with
	costumes.

	Grant finishes his speech to what was a full house -- some
	ATTENDEES are grabbing their coats and sneaking out. This
	wasn't the exciting guest speaker they were all expecting.

	A new slide comes up. Just black and white, and indecipherable.

				GRANT
		It's through the painstaking study of the
		Interior chamber in multiple specimens that
		we can determine this exciting correlation
		between the larynx and the upper plate. That
		lets us theorize -- theorize, mind you -- that
		the raptor might have been capable of bird-
		like vocalizations. Which as you can
		imagine, would be a tremendous breakthrough.

	He's finished, but no one seems to notice at first. Then the
	SYMPOSTUM LEADER stands up, leading a smattering round of
	APPLAUSE.

				SYMPOSTIUM LEADER
		Thank you very much Dr. Grant. Now does
		anyone have a question?

	Nearly every hand goes up. Grant doesn't seem surprised.

				GRANT
		Does anyone have a question that doesn't 
		relate to Jurassic Park?

	Quite a few hands go down.

				GRANT (cont'd)
		Or the incident in San Diego, which I'll
		remind you, I did not witness.

	Now most of the hands are down. Picking one of the few
	remaining...

				MALE STUDENT
		Your theory on raptors is good and all, but
		isn't all this conjecture kind of moot?

	The STUDENT'S BUDDY nods in agreement.

				MALE STUDENT (CONT'D)
		I mean, once the U.N. and Costa Rica and
		everyone decides how to handle the second
		island, scientist will just go in and look
		for themselves.

				TOO-CLEVER SCIENCE REPORTER
		Isn't paleontology itself in danger of
		extinction?

	Recognizing those as fighting words, the symposium leader is
	about to step in. But Grant will take this himself.

				GRANT
		No, and let me be perfectly clear on this
		point. Dinosaurs lived 65 million years ago.
		What's left of them is fossilized in stone
		the actual scientists spend years to
		undercover.
								   (MORE)

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		what John Hammond and InGen created are
		theme park monsters. Nothing more, nothing
		less.

		The class clearly disagrees with his assessment.

				ANOTHER STUDENT
		You're saying you wouldn't want to study
		them if you had the chance?

				GRANT
		No force on this earth or in heaven could get me on
		that island.


8 	INT. DERELICT COCKPIT - DAY 					8

	Looking through the cracked windshield of a junkyard plane, we
	see someone spray painting red circles on the outside of the
	glass.


9 	EXT. AIRCRAFT GRAVEYARD - DAY 					9

	NASH, a wry, intelligent mercenary pilot and soldier, is
	painting huge eyes the windows of a wrecked plane. Finished, he
	tosses the paint can through the open windows and walks quickly
	away from the plane.

	We now see that RED TEETH are painted on the craft's nose. It
	looks absurdly like some angry beast.

	We are one the edge of a dry lake bed, part of an aircraft
	graveyard. Wrecked planes lie all around.

	We hear a phone RINGING...


10 	INT. CARGO PLANE - DAY 					       10

	A RINGING satellite phone rests on a stack of gun cases.

	UDESKY, the leader of this crew, answers it. 

				UDESKY
		Udesky.
			(beat)
		Yes sir. we're good to go. I'll lock it down as
		soon as you drop me the payment.

	With the phone still to his ear, Udesky wanders out of the
	craft...


11 	EXT. CARGO PLANE - DAY 					       11

	Udesky looks over at Nash and COOPER, another mercenary.

	Cooper's the quiet muscle of the bunch, a weapons specialist. He
	finishes loading a massive gun, essentially a hand-cannon. It's
	aimed at Nash's grimacing aircraft.

				UDESKY
		That's right, two of the very best I could
		find. No, I haven't worked with them
		personally, but they come with the highest
		recommendations.

	Then --

	Cooper FIRES at the grimacing aircraft. A projectile rockets
	into the plane and EXPLODES with a fireball.

	Nash and Cooper exchange a satisfied smile.

				UDESKY (CONT'D)
		You've got nothing to worry about, sir. This
		is going to be a piece of cake.

	Pieces of the demolished craft come raining down.


12 	EXT. EXCAVATION BASE CAMP, PT. PECK LAKE, MT - DAY 	12

	CLOSE ON a man's hand, carefully scraping the stone away from a
	dinosaur fossil. We follow his hand back as he wipes off his
	sweaty brow, revealing him to be BILLY BRENNAN, 25, an
	associate professor and site manager. He's a charmer.

	Looking past him, we see CHERYL, 21, a junior at junior of State. She's one
	of a dozen COLLEGE STUDENTS working at the site, and the one
	most smitten with her supervisor.

				CHERYL
		Billy? I don't think I'm doing this right.

	He scoots over, lying down beside her. Checks her work.

				BILLY
		You need to go slowly. See, just take it little
		at a time.

	She's not listening, just watching his eyelashes.

				CHERYL
		I can never tell what's bone and what's rock.

				BILLY
		Technically, it's all rock. The calcium in the
		bones is replaced during fossilization. But
		you can feel the difference. See? Rough,
		smooth. Rough, smooth.

	He runs her bare fingers over the two different patches, showing
	her. After a pause, she runs her finger along his
	stubbly chin...

				CHERYL
		Rough.

	...and along his lips.

				CHERYL (cont'd)
		Smooth.

	Billy may not have started this flirtation, but he's not ending
	it either. It's then that a

	SHADOW

	falls across them. Billy looks up to see...

				BILLY
		Dr. Grant!

	Grant has just returned, a bag over his shoulder.

				GRANT
		Mr. Brennan.

										CUT TO:


12A	EXT. WALKING TO THE MAIN TENTS - DAY 			12A

	Billy takes one of Grant's bags, talking as they go.

				BILLY
		How was your trip? Profitable?

				GRANT
		We'll be broke in four weeks.

				BILLY
		Three weeks. I had to rent some equipment.

	The cross into one of the tents, which only has two "walls". On
	a dust-taped table, a dusty Macintosh is feeing data into a
	strange machine the size of a dorm refrigerator. A mechanical arm sweeps
	back and forth across a tray of fine sand.

				GRANT
		You rented an automated litter box.

				BILLY
		It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan
		data from the raptor skull, than the computer
		breaks it into thousands of slices which this
		thing prints, one layer on top of the other.
		It's the future of paleontology.

				GRANT
		Not if it can't dig.

	The arm stops and suddenly the tray of sand shakes, dropping
	through holes in the bottom to reveal an object the size of 
	a person's fist.

				BILLY
		I give you a raptor's resonating chamber.

	Grant hates technology, but he can't help but be amazed by the
	result. He lifts the strange object up, shaking out the
	remaining sand.

	Billy puts it to his lips and blows through it like a conch shell.
	The resulting SOUND is unique and piercing, the cry of an 
	non-existent animal. Grant is speechless with excitement. And so he
	uses it again and again, producing different SOUNDS and
	variations.

	In the distance, flocks of birds rise to the sky and fly off.

	Billy looks up to see a MAN and a WOMAN getting out of 	
	a Cadillac. Cheryl is pointing them in the direction of the 		
	tent. 									

				BILLY (cont'd) 				
			(falsely casual) 					
		Oh, I forgot to tell you. Some visitors 			
		wanted to come by and talk	to you. I 
told them you'd be happy to see them. 
		maybe even have dinner with them. 						

				GRANT 					
		Absolutely not. 						

				BILLY 						
		They're here. 							

				GRANT 					
		What? 								

	Only now does Grant realize these two people
Who were walking up to them.
Putting on a friendly smile, Billy goes up to them.				

				MAN 						
		Dr. Grant? 							

				GRANT 					
		Yes? 								

				MAN 						
			(extending his hand)					
		Paul Kirby. Kirby Enterprises				 	
			(reaching into his pocket) 	
		My card. 							

	PAUL KIRBY is a talkative optimist with				
	no "off" switch. His wife AMANDA KIRBY, just
as friendly, is harder to read. There seems to be			
	exhaustion behind her eyes. 					

				GRANT 					
		What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby? 				

				PAUL 						
		Well sir, I am a great admirer
of yours, and I have an extremely interesting 
proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife 
and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.					

				GRANT 					
		You know, I've been traveling and I'm very 		
		tired. Maybe some other time. 				

				PAUL
		I guarantee it'll be worth your while.

	Behind Kirby, Bill furtively rubs his thumb and fingers
	together, indicating the guy is loaded.

	Grant musters a weak smile.

				GRANT
		It's be my pleasure.


13 	INT. HELL CREEK BAR AND GRILL, JORDAN, MT - NIGHT 	13

	Theyre only halfway through the entree, but Grant is ready to
	bolt. It's only Billy who's keeping him from being rude. They walk
	over to Paul and Amandas table and sit down.

				PAUL
		First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts,
		Amanda and I have admired your work for
		years.

				AMANDA
		It is truly, whats the word? Inspiring.

				GRANT
		Thank you.

	It's everything Grant can do just to be polite. He desperately
	wants to leave and get back to his dig.

				PAUL
		Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors.
		Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure
		tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2,
		the Nile...

				AMANDA
		We even have two seats reserved aboard the
		first commercial moon flight.

	Billy nudges Grant.

				GRANT
		Hmmm.

				PAUL
		Now, for our wedding anniversary this year
		we wanted to do something really special,
		something...

	He places his hand on his wife's.

				AMANDA
		...once-in-a-lifetime.

				PAUL
		We've arranged for a private airplane to
		take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want
		you to be our guide.

	The Kirby's look to Grant as if they've offered him an amazing
	gift. But Grant just sighs and smooths the tablecloth.

				GRANT
		That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm
		afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can
		refer you to a number of highly qualified...

				PAUL
		No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've
		seen these animals in the flesh. No one else
		has come close to you.

				GRANT
		I'm flattered, but I've taken this little
		adventure tour. And with the air
		restrictions they've imposed after the
		incident in San Diego, you cant fly low
		enough to see anything of interest.

	Paul is momentarily stymied, but Amanda rallies.

				AMANDA
		You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I
		have special permission to fly low.

				BILLY
		How low?

				PAUL
		Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do
		know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone
		else.

				AMANDA
		From what I understand, it's pretty much
		whatever we want.

				GRANT
		That's hard to believe.

				PAUL
		Let's just say that through my business --
		imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've
		made some friends in high places. In this
		case, the Costa Rican government.

				AMANDA
		Dr. Grant, you don't know how important it is
		for us to have you come along. It would make
		all the difference.

	Grant is trying to find another way to say no, when Paul pulls
	out his checkbook.

				PUAL
		And of course, we're prepared to make a
		sizeable contribution to your research here.

	Billy looks at Grant. Don't say no.

				PAUL (cont'd)
		I can write all kinds of numbers on this
		check. Just tell me what exactly it would
		take.

	We HOLD ON a conflicted Dr. Alan Grant.

		  		  CUT TO:

14 	EXT. SKY - DAY 							14

	NNNNNRRRRRRNNNNNRRRRR...

	A SMALL AIRPLANE - a Beechcraft Kingair 200 Turboprop, to be
	exact - cruises through clear blue skies.


15 	INT. PLANE - DAY 							15

	Grant re-settles, trying to get comfortable. Billy is across
	from him, finishing cleaning his camera lenses before putting
	them back in the ragged case.

				GRANT
		Even with what I pay you, you could get a
		better bag.

				BILLY
		No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago
		some buddies and I went hang gliding off
		these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me
		right into the side. BOOM!

				GRANT
		That does sound lucky.

				BILLY
		It was this strap alone that saved my life.
		Got caught on a rock as I was falling.

				GRANT
		Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most
		idiotic.

	Because he hasn't really said it...

				BILLY
		Listen Alan, I really appreciate you
		bringing me along.

				GRANT
		The bones will be there when we get back.
		That's the nice thing about them. They never
		run away.
			(beat)
		And besides, you got me into this. I don't
		intend to be alone with these people.

	ON PAUL AND AMANDA

	sitting near the front of the plane. Paul draws a long, nervous
	breath and looks at Amanda. She seems just as tense.

	Finally finding a comfortable position, Grant puts his hat over
	his eyes, ready to take a nap.

	Done with his camera, Billy turns to someone just off screen.

				BILLY
		So how do you know the Kirby's?

	and we reveal...

	Mercenary Cooper, the weapons specialist we met earlier. He's
	wearing sunglasses so dark you can't tell whether he's staring
	at you or fast asleep.

	He doesn't answer. Did he even hear? And then --

				COOPER
		Through our church.

				BILLY
		What Religion?

				COOPER
		Uhthe one that worships God and believes in being
		Good. 



16 	EXT. SKY - DAY 							16

	The plane continues onward.


17 	INT. PLANE - DAY / HOURS LATER 					17

	Grant slowly wakes in his chair, groggy. All the other
	passengers are fast asleep. Then Grant turns to his right.

	A RAPTOR

	sits besides him. The dinosaur eyes him curiously, then opens
	his mouth...

				RAPTOR
		Alan.

	And than it STRIKES.


18 	INT. PLANE - DAY 					       		18

	Grant wakes up with a start, disoriented. Billy is leaning over
	him.

				BILLY
	Alan. We're almost there.

	The adrenaline still surging through him, Grant turns and looks

	THROUGH THE WINDOW.

	Clouds obscure the view, than parts reveal

	ISLA SORNA

	rising majestically out of the water.


19 	EXT. SKY - COUNTINUOUS DAY 					19

	We watch the plane descend sharply to the island.


20 	INT. PLANE - COUNTINUOUS DAY 					20

	In various combinations, Grant and Billy, Paul and Amanda look
	out the windows at the amazingly green island.

	Cooper looks out through a window of his own.


21 	INT. COCKPIT - COUNTINUOUS DAY 				21

	Here we find the rest of the crew from the junkyard. Nash is
	piloting.

	A VOICE comes over their radio headsets.

				RADIO VOICE
			(Spanish accent)
		Unidentified aircraft approaching Isla
		Sorna, this is San Juan approach. You are
		flying in restricted airspace. Immediately
		turn to the coordinates two-zero-zero. I repeat
		redirect to...

	A look from Nash then Udesky switches off the radio.


22 	EXT. PLANE - COUNTINUOUS DAY 				       22

	The plane now descends to a mere hundred feet above the
	treetops.


23 	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS DAY 				       23

	Paul puts his hand atop Amanda's as they stare intently out the
	window.

	Billy looks to Grant.

				BILLY

		Admit it. You're excited.

	Grant will admit nothing.

	Calling back from the cockpit...

				UDESKY
		Cooper! Yell up if you see anything!

				COOPER
			(yelling back)
		No, I thought I'd keep it to myself.

	Suddenly Grant spots...

				GRANT
		There. There! An Apatosaur. Look at the
		coloration.

EXT. ISLA SORNA  GRASSY FIELD  CONTINUOUS DAY

	An Apatosaur is grazing on the grass.

INT.  PLANE  CONTINUOUS DAY

				BILLY
			(amazed)
		I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see
		skin.

				GRANT
		Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right
		you can see...

	But Paul just waves him away with a hand, staring intently out
	his window. We HOLD ON Grant a moment, thinking that odd.


24 	INT. COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS DAY 				       24

	Udesky puts down his binoculars.

				UDESKY
		South shore is clear. The rest is rock.

				NASH
		Are we on?

				UDESKY
		We're on.


25 	INT. MAIN CABIN - CONTINUOUS DAY  			       25

	Looking out the window, Grant notices they're flying awfully
	low. Just then, he hears a MECHANICAL HUM and a LOW RUSH from
	outside. Now wanting to believe --

				GRANT
		That's not the landing gear?

	Paul, Amanda and Cooper don't respond.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		What you're...
			(realizing)
		You can't land.

	Paul turns back to him.

				PAUL
		Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll
		explain this all in a jiffy.

				GRANT
		This plane can not land!

				AMANDA
		It's going to be all right. Just...

	Grant is out of his seat, heading for the cockpit. He'll wrestle
	the controls if he has to.

	Cooper grabs him, pulling him back. Grant starts to struggle,
	but he's certainly no match. A well-practiced fist hits him
	dead on.

	CUT TO BLACK.


26 	OVER THE DARKNESS 						26

	we hear Amanda's voice, strangely distant but amplified.

				AMANDA
		Eric! Eric! Are you there honey? Ben!
		Erriccc!

	Her calls continue as we FADE UP to...


27 	INT. PLANE - DAY 							27

	GRANT'S P.O.V. -- blurry and disorientated. He finds himself lying
	on the floor of the plane.

	Seeing him come to, Billy helps him slowly get up. Grant's head
	is pounding.

				GRANT
		Tell me we didn't land.

	By his expression, we see Billy would have to lie.

				BILLY
		I think they're looking for someone.


28 	EXT. LANDING STRIP, ISLA SORNA - DAY 			       28

	The jungle has almost reclaimed this patchy vine-covered
	runway. The airplane is parked at one end.

	Nash, Udesky, and Cooper are checking their weapons.

	Amanda is at the edge of the tarmac calling into the jungle on a
	BULLHORN.

	Billy and a groggy Grant emerge from the airplane. Paul trots
	over.

				PAUL
		Dr. Grant, are you alright? I'm sorry we
		had to be so...

	The three mercenaries are now walking into the jungle with
	their guns.

				GRANT
		What the hell is going on? What are they
		doing?

				PAUL
		Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe.
		These guys are really good. One of them was a
		Green...

				GRANT
		Mr. Kirby, trust me, on this island, there is
		no such thing as safe. We have to get back in
		this plane...

	Grant looks to Amanda, who shouts through a bull horn.

				AMANDA
			(on-bullhorn)
		ERRR-IIIC!

				GRANT
		And tell your wife to stop making so
		much noise! We're food to these damn 
animals.

				PAUL
			(yelling)
		Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad
		idea!

				AMANDA
			(on the bullhorn)
		What?

				PAUL
			(pointing broadly at Alan)
		He says it's a bad idea!

				AMANDA
			(on the bullhorn)
		What's a bad idea?

	As in on cue, there is a DEAFENING ROAR from the jungle.

	Everyone turns toward the sound and freezes.

				PAUL
			(to Alan)
		What was that?

	Grant doesn't answer, still listening to the reverberations. 
Then a couple shots are heard.

				BILLY
			(low)
		Is it a rex?

				GRANT
		I don't think so.

	Billy and Paul breathe a small sign of relief.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Sounds bigger.

	Nash and Udesky come RUNNING out of the jungle, headed for
	the plane.

				UDESKY
		We gotta go, now!

				PAUL
		What's the problem? Can't you guys...?

	As Udesky and Nash sprint past Paul in interrupted by a
	second, closer, DEAFENING ROAR. He pales.


29 	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 				       29

	Udesky waits by the door, hustling everyone inside. Nash
	hurries into the cockpit. Everyone scrambles to a seat. Amanda
	climbs next to Paul.

				AMANDA
		We can't just...

				PAUL
		Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and
		come back.

	Udesky closes the door.

				BILLY
		What about the other guy?

				UDESKY
		Coop's a professional. He can handle himself.

	A blood-curdling SCREAM echoes through the jungle followed by
	MACHINE GUN FIRE.

				NASH
			(yelling back)
		We're going!

	Udesky climbs into the copilot's seat, and Nash revs the engine.


30	EXT. RUNAWAY - DAY						30

	The plane starts down the runway.


31	INT. PLANE - DAY							31

	The passengers bounce in their seats as the plane picks up
	speed down the overgrown strip.


32	EXT. RUNWAY - DAY							32

	Suddenly, two hundred yards ahead of the plane,

	COOPER

	emerges from the jungle. He stands in the middle of the runway.
	waving one arm wildly. His second, badly injured arm hangs
	limp by his side.

				COOPER
		Come on, Nash. Slow down, buddy.


33	INT. THE COCKPIT - DAY					       33

	Nash spots Cooper, shoots a glance at the airspeed indicator.

				NASH
		Coop, you know I can't do it pal.

	He slams down full throttle in an attempt to reach flying speed.

	Seeing that Nash has no intention of stopping, Paul shouts from
	the cabin.

				PAUL
		What are you doing? That's Mr. Cooper!


34	EXT. RUNWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY				34

	We are looking down on Cooper from behind. As the plane
	approaches,

	A SHADOW

	falls over the injured mercenary. Then with brutal speed, an
	ENORMOUS BEAST seizes him in its massive jaws and lifts him
	into the air.

	From this angle we get only a glimpse of a long crocodilian
	snout, powerful clawed forearms and spiny sail rising from the
	creature's back.


35	INT. THE COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS - DAY			       35

	All eyes are on the creature as it devours Cooper. Amanda turns
	away in horror.

				AMANDA
		Oh, my God! Paul, my God!


36	INT. THE COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS - DAY			       36

	Looking through the windshield, we see the creature is directly
	in the path of the plane.

	Nash pulls back on the stick. The plane rises.

	The left propeller clips the flank of the enormous
	dinosaur, SNAPPING the blade.

	Blood sprays the windshield and side windows.


37	EXT. RUNWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY 				37

	The turboprop banks into the jungle, out of control.


38	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 					38

	The passengers are thrown about as the craft CRASHES through
	trees, tearing off a wing and pieces of the tail.

	Finally coming to rest in the jungle canopy, the plane settles
	in the trees.

	SILENCE.

	The passengers slowly recover and have a look around. Foliage
	blocks most windows, making it impossible to see out.

				BILLY
		Is anyone hurt?

	Checking themselves, everyone seems pretty much intact.

	Still thinking of himself as in charge...

				UDESKY
		Quiet! We're okay. Let's everybody just stay
		put.

	He attempts to turn on the cockpit radio, but it's dead.

				NASH
		Who's got the sat-phone?

				PAUL
		Right here!

	Paul hands the bulky phone up to Nash, who dials out.

	Grant unstraps himself, climbs to the back to the side door and shoves.
	The door opens a few inches before hitting a branch.

	He looks out the and lets out a quiet gasp as the ground reels

	THIRTY FEET BELOW.

	He quickly shuts and latches the door.

	CLOSE ON the sat-phone. pressed against Nash's ear.

				RECORDED VOICE
		We're sorry. All circuits are busy. Please
		try your call again later...

				NASH
		Shit!

				PAUL
		What is it? What's the matter?

	Amanda SCREAMS.

	A huge reptilian face appears in the cockpit window. Everyone
	else SCREAMS now.
	
	The plane LURCHES - and we hear a deep GROWL.
	
	The passengers hold tight, paralyzed. Nash buckles himself into
	his seat.

	Suddenly, the plane is YANKED from the side to side. Battered this
	way and that, the terrified passengers tightly grip their 
	seats.
	
	Finally, the horrible sounds of WRENCHING METAL as the nose of
	the plane is RIPPED RIGHT OFF.

	Nash and Udesky are suddenly sitting in open air. The nose of
	the plane is tilting downwards, the jungle floor far below.

	The passengers hang almost vertically in their seats,

	Debris tumbles out the open end of the plane, some of it
	striking Nash in the head.

	Udesky unbuckles his seat belt and climbs back up into the
	cabin. Nash follows.

	Suddenly, a long snout with dagger-like teeth pushes past the
	cockpit seats, opens wide, and

	CLAMPS DOWN

	on Nash's legs.

	The pilot CRIES OUT in agony. The others passengers grab onto
	his arms, trying to pull him back. But it's no use. The dinosaur
	rips Nash out of their grasp and down the aisle.

	Nash desperately grabs on to the seat cushion, then watches in
	horror as the fabric RIPS AWAY. He's pulled out of the plane and 
	dropped to the ground. A giant foot steps in the way as the snout
	of the creature reaches down and quickly devourers the screaming
pilot.

	It's horrifying sight, but no one can turn away.

	Pleased with the appetizer, the creature comes back for the
	main course.

	Grant tries to force open the jammed rear door. Billy tries to
	help, but the door won't budge.

	The dinosaur JAMS its snout into the fuselage and lunges for
	Amanda in the first row. She yanks her legs back as the jaws
	SNAP SHUT.

	Behind Amanda, Billy reaches forward, UNSNAPS her seat belt
	and pulls her into the next row back.

	The others unstrap their belts and crowd into the rear of the
	passenger compartment.

	The shift in weight sends the fuselage tipping backwards.


39	EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOUS - DAY				       39

 	The plane breaks free of the tree limbs and DROPS tail-first to
	the jungle floor.

	It SLAMS hard, then flips over onto its roof.


40	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY				       40

	The passengers are prowled on the ceiling of the plane, dazed
	by the impact. Everyone is cut and bruised.

	Out of the open cockpit, they see two approaching dino feet.

	A window near Amanda fogs over with condensation. when it
	clears, she finds herself looking right into enormous eyes.

	Then all hell breaks loose as the plane is SLAMMED across the
	jungle clearing.

	The passengers are hammered against the walls of the plane,
	tumbling like socks in a dryer. Debris, seats and luggage fly
	everywhere.


41	EXT. JUNGLE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY			41

	The plane comes to an abrupt halt as it SMASHES into a tree.

	A gargantuan FOOT steps on the fuselage and FLATTENS it like a 
	paper tube.


42	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY					42

	Inside, windows EXPLODE, raining glass over the passengers. As
	the walls compress, Udesky becomes trapped in the rear of the 
	plane, the others in front.

				BILLY
		Over here!

	Udesky dives into the narrowing gap, and Billy pulls him the
	rest of the way through.

	Billy is as terrified as the rest of them, but he thrives under
	this rush of adrenaline.
	
	Then a huge CLAW digs into the skin of the fuselage and begins
	to slowly PEEL the plane open. Grant looks up in dread at the
	widening tear.

				GRANT
		This way!

	Grant leads the group out the open end of the cockpit. They
	make a mad dash for the jungle.

	A tremendous ROAR causes Billy to look behind him. He can't
	help but steal a glimpse of this terrifying, but utterly
	fascinating, animal.

	Grant yanks him forward.


43	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY						       43

	With Grant in the lead, and Udesky taking up the rear, the group
	tears through the jungle.

	Concealed by the dense undergrowth, the unseen dinosaur bears
	down on them -- mowing down the young trees which TOPPLE all
	around them.

	Grant spots a grove of

	HEAVIER TREES

	and leads the group into it.

	The dinosaur cannot fit between the trunks. It ROARS at
	the fleeing humans, searching desperately for a route after
	them.

	The group continues their relentless pace, putting as much 
	distance as they can between themselves and the beast. Paul
	Kirby looks like he's about to have a heart attack. Even Billy
	is gasping for air.

	They stop, thinking they've outrun it.

	Grant directs the group through some underbrush and into --


44	EXT. CLEARING - CONTINUOUS - DAY				44

	Our friends stop dead in their tracks. Amanda stifles a cry.

	Before them lies an immense unmoving SAUROPOD.

				GRANT
		Don't worry. It's dead.

	Then a full-grown bull

	TYRANNOSAURUS

	rises up behind the carcass. It was feeding, its mouth mottled
	with blood and carrion.

	Grant FREEZES.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Nobody move a muscle.

	Remember: the T-Rex tracks motion.

	Obeying, the group FREEZES for a few long beats. Then Udesky
	takes off running.

	And T-Rex ROARS.

	Everyone runs. T-Rex is right behind them.


45	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							45

	Dashing back the way they came, the group suddenly comes face
	to face with --

	THE FIRST MONSTER.

	We now get our first full unobstructed view of the gigantic
	creature, SPINOSAURUS AEGYPTICUS. Over forty feet long and
	twenty-five feet high, the dinosaur has a bony sail along its
	back. Its head is crocodilian with rows of long, curving teeth.
	Sinewy six foot arms terminate in three fingers hands with
	fourteen inch claws.

	Nowhere else to run, the group scatters into the brush as the
	two behemoth predators rush forward, their ROARS thunderous.

	Paul and Amanda scramble into one direction, Billy and Udesky in
	the other. But Grant can't go anywhere - his foot is stuck 
	between two branches.

	He manages to free himself as the two dinosaurs approach.
	They'll have to deal with each other before eating the humans.

	Grant dives down between two fallen trees as the Spinosaurus and T-
	Rex circle one another like gladiators, each searching for the
	other's weakness.

	Laying flat on his back, Grant lets out a terrified GASP as the
	giant foot of Spinosaurus lands across the two trunks mere
	inches from his face.

	Spinosaurus lunges forward, powerful jaw open wide.

	T-Rex sidesteps the assault, its tail knocking down small
	trees as it spins out of the way.

	In the tress, Paul and Amanda scurry again for cover.

	Between the fallen trunks, Grant attempts to get away on his
	hands and knees.

	T-Rex presses the attack, slamming its tail into the flank of
	its adversary. Spinosaurus is knocked back, and Grant is again
	forced to duck for cover.

	As Spinosaurus struggles to regain its balance, T-Rex dives
	forward. Spinosaurus is driven backwards as T-Rex tries to
	grip its throat.

	Amanda yanks Paul out of their path. They Scramble over to
	Billy.

	Now on its side, Spinosaurus fights back ferociously. It slashes
	at T-Rex with its long arms and razor sharp claws, then finally
	kicks the animal with one mammoth foot.

	Tyrannosaurus staggers back, wounded.

	Down below, Grant is splashed by the blood pouring from the
	dinosaur, as he slowly makes his way towards his fellow humans.

	Spinosaurus lunges for the T-rex with gaping jaws and manages to
	topple T-Rex off its feet and sends the falling dinosaur to the
	ground.

	With an earth-shuttering CRASH, the dinosaur lands between
	Grant and the rest of the group.

	The companions scurry out of the way, but as they do so, the
	head of the T-Rex now lands almost directly on top of them.

	Plastered against an immense tree, the group watches in horror
	as T-Rex starts to rise but is thrown back down as Spinosaurus
	latches onto its throat.

	Spinosaurus crushes the life out of its adversary, and T-Rex
	opens and closes its jaw a mere inches from our terrified 
	friends.

	Finally, Grant reaches the others.

				GRANT
		Come on!

	Spinosaurus lets out a victorious HOWL, and the blood-drenched
	professor leads the group through the undergrowth.


46	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							46

	Winded from running, Paul is caught off-guard as a furious
	Grant slams his back against a tree. Only one thing he wants to
	know --

				GRANT
		Why did you bring us here?

	Paul is too startled to speak. Udesky tires to step in, but
	Grant gives him back a look.

				AMANDA
		Our son is on this island. We need your help
		to find him.

	Still crunched against the tree, Paul pulls out a photo from his
	shirt pocket.

				PAUL
		This is him. Eric. Hes thirteen now. He's
		just about the greatest kid in the world.

	Letting go of Paul, Grant takes the photo, a Sears-style
	portrait of the boy we saw Parasailing at the beginning. He
	shakes his head, disbelieving. He hands the photo to Billy.

	The group splits into two sides -- Paul and Amanda, Grant and
	Billy -- with Udesky stuck between. Dialogue overlaps in
	places.

				AMANDA
		He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.

				BILLY
		Who's that?

				PAUL
		Her new boyfriend.

				AMANDA
		A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted
		to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben
		found a guy who would take them parasailing.
		They never came back.

				PAUL
		We called everyone, did everything we could.
		Because of all the controversy over this
		island, no one will step in. Costa Rica says
		it's a no-fly zone, it's their own damn fault.
		Guys at the U.S Embassy -- our U.S. Embassy --
		said we should "accept the inevitable." You
		believe that?

				GRANT
		So you hired these mercenaries.

				UDESKY
		We prefer "recovery specialists." We do
		overseas custody issues and...

				GRANT
			(interrupting)
		Then you duped us into coming here.

				PAUL
		We needed somebody who knew the lay of the
		land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.

				GRANT
			(disbelieving)
		I have never been on this island!

				PAUL
		Sure you have. You wrote that book...

				BILLY
		That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna.
		The second island.

				PAUL
			(low, to Udesky)
		I didn't know, there were two islands.

				AMANDA
		Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You
		saved those kids.

				GRANT
		A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we
		were better prepared and better armed.
			(finally)
		How many days have they been missing?

	A look between Amanda and Paul.

				PAUL
		Eight weeks.

	Grand and Billy are speechless. It might as well be eight years.

				GRANT
		After what you've seen today, you really
		think your son could be alive?

				AMANDA
		He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much
		about dinosaurs.

	Before anyone else can talk, Grant puts his hand out. He wants
	everyone to shut up while he plans their next move.

				GRANT
		No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we
		can from the plane. Then we head for the
		coast. There may be a boat left, something to
		get us off this island.

				PAUL
		Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.

				GRANT
		You can stick with us, or you can go and look for
		him. Either way you're probably not getting
		out of here alive.

	With that he leaves, A beat later, Billy follows. He has
	genuine sympathy for the Kirby's, but he's logical enough to
	know Grant is right.

	BACK WITH PAUL AND AMANDA

	They look to Udesky.

				PAUL
		What do we do?

	Udesky is clearly at a loss, but for everyone's reassurance he
	tries to mutter some brio.

				UDESKY
		Well, I think we should start searching for your
son. In the direction they're going.

				PAUL
		Excellent.

	They follow after Grant and Billy.


47	EXT. PLANE CRASH SITE						47

	The five survivors search through the wreckage, trying to find
	anything useful. The task is grim. Mindful of Grant's 
	warnings, they move quickly and quietly.

	Udesky picks up a gun out of the swampy water. The barrel is bent
	almost 90 degrees, unless.

	Billy finds his camera, intact.

	Digging a change of clothes out of his suitcase, Paul steps
	around the side of the plane to change. He's in his underwear
	before he notices Amanda is also there changing.

				PAUL
		Sorry.

				AMANDA
		Nothing you haven't seen before.

	A beat. Amanda looks over as they get dressed.

				AMANDA (CONT'D)
		How much weight have you lost?

				PAUL
		Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been
		swimming at the Y.

				AMANDA
		You hate to swim.

				PAUL
		People change.

	A nod to mean, that's the truth.

				PAUL (CONT'D)
		You look good.

				AMANDA
		So do you.

	They make brief eye contact, which Amanda breaks.

	Around the side, Billy is taking photos of a giant footprint the
	dinosaur left in the mud during its attack on the plane. Grant
	looks over.

				GRANT
		How would you classify it?

				BILLY
		Obviously a superpredator.
			(best guess)
		Suchimimus. that snout.

				GRANT
		They never got that big.

				BILLY
		Baryonyx?

				GRANT
		Not with that sail.
			(Billy gives up)
		Spinosaurus Aegypticus.

				BILLY
		I don't remember that on InGen's list.

				GRANT
		That's because it wasn't on their list. Who
		knows what else they were up to?

	Billy looks past Grant to see Paul approaching. He's struggling
	with the straps on his backpack. turning in circles.

	Billy regards him with suspicion.

				BILLY
		So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2,
		did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?

				PAUL
		Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.

				BILLY
		About a thousand feet above it, actually.
			(closer)
		Most mountain-climbers remember how tall
		that mountains were.

	Paul knows he's caught.

				GRANT
		There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?

				PAUL
		There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint
		and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate
		Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The
		"plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces
		accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like 
		that.

				BILLY
		I don't suppose that check you wrote us is
		any good.

				UDESKY
		He paid us half up front. Cash.

				PAUL
		Mortgaged everything we had to do it. Even
		the store. and if we make it off this island
		with my son, I swear, I'll make good on the
		money I owe you. I don't care if it takes me
		the rest of my life.

	Grant and Udesky exchange a dubious glance.

				UDESKY
		However long that is.


48	EXT. JUNGLE PATH - DAY						48

	Amanda, Paul, Billy, Udesky and Grant walk through the jungle.

				AMANDA
		Eric!

				GRANT
		Quiet!

				PAUL
			(loud whisper to Amanda)
		Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous
		territory.

				AMANDA
		Well we should split up or something. We can
		cover twice the area.

				PAUL
		No, Dr. Grant says...

				AMANDA
		Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...

				PAUL
		Well what's the use of hiring an expert if
		your not going to listen to him?

				AMANDA
		Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric.
		Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.

				PAUL
		Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after
		you, don't come crying to me.

				AMANDA
		Oh, don't worry about that.

				PAUL
		What?

				AMANDA
		Nothing.

				PAUL
		What did you say?

				AMANDA
		Nothing.

				PAUL
		What did you say!

				AMANDA
		Just drop it Paul!

	The Kirby's conversation trails off into the jungle. Udesky
	moves up next to Grant and Billy.

				UDESKY
		If they split up, I'm going with you.

	And as they continue forward, Billy spots something in the
	trees ahead.


49	EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY					49

	A parasail chute is caught in the branches of a tree. A yellow
	life vest hangs limply from a branch.

	Paul rushes over, unsnags it, and examines the label.

				PAUL
		Young adult.

				AMANDA
		Eric...

				UDESKY (O.S)
		Hey. Got something here.

	All turn to see Udesky holding up a camcorder encased in a
	waterproof shell.

				AMANDA
		That's Ben's!

	She grabs it from Udesky and pops open the housing. She tries
	the power switch on the camcorder, but the battery's dead.

	Udesky pull out a flashlight from his pack and looks to Amanda.

				UDESKY
		Here, give that to me.

	And as Udesky fiddles with the flashlight, Grant and Billy
	consider the parasail.

				BILLY
		It looks intact.

				GRANT
		We should take it with us to signal any planes.

				UDESKY (O.S)
		I think I've got it.

	Udesky has rigged the wires on the flashlight so that the
	batteries can be used to power the camcorder.

	He brings a live wire to back of the camcorder. A red power
	light comes on.

				AMANDA
		It works!

				UDESKY
		I don't know for how long.

	Udesky swings the tiny screen out and pushes play. The others
	crowd around.

	ON THE SCREEEN

	Eric and Ben play frisbee on the beach.

				PAUL (O.S.)
			(excited)
		That's him. Thats Eric!

				AMANDA (O.S.)
		I filmed this the morning they left.

	Ben catches the frisbee, checks his watch and motions to Eric.

	Eric runs over, and Ben puts his arm around him as they run to
	the camera.

	Paul reacts to this image but holds his tongue.

	THE VIDEO SCREEN -

	The image now CUTS to a shot from aboard Enrique's boat
	speeding towards ISLA SORNA -- the start of the movie. Eric
	points excitedly at the island and smiles at the camera.

	We replay the opening moments of the movie from Ben and Eric's
	perspective, soaring high until...

				ERIC
		Ben!

				BEN
		Unclip the line!

	THE JUNGLE -

	A PAN from face to face of all watching this tape with a
	mixture of hope and nausea.

	ON SCREEN -

	Angle again with Ben's legs in the foreground. Falling fast.

				BEN (CONT'D)
		Hand on! Hang on buddy!

	Now the camera penetrates the jungle canopy and the picture
	and sound become complete chaos: SCREAMS from the both,
	branches BREAKING, flashes of Ben and Eric's frightened faces
	as the camera is buffeted in all directions.

	With a lurch the terrifying descent in finally over, and the
	jungle floor is just ten feet away, swaying back and forth
	beneath Ben and Eric's feet.

				BEN (CONT'D)
		Are you ok, buddy?

	There's GURGLING to his voice. Ben may be more hurt than he's
	letting on.

				ERIC
			(through his sobs)
		I don't know. I think so.

				BEN
		We're okay. It's going to be okay. Here, get
		ready. I'm going to unhook you.

	The sound of PUMPLING is followed by the sight of Eric DROPPING		
	into the frame, landing on the ground rolling. He stands and
	looks back up at Ben.

				ERIC
		I'm all right

				BEN (O.S)
			(weaker)
		We're going to get out of this, pal.

	And on that, the power and picture fade away.

	BACK ON PAUL AND AMANDA - overjoyed.

				PAUL
		See? He's okay. He's alive! Everything's
		going to be all right now.

	Amanda brings a hand to her mouth, silently nodding her head.

	Grant and Billy exchange a dubious look, than begin pulling the
	parasail out of the tree. As they do so, the sail gets caught on
	a branch.

	They pull harder. The branch bends, but the sail won't come
	loose. One last tug and than, SNAP. The branch breaks, the chute
	falls away to reveal

	A SKELETON.

	It swings down directly at Amanda. She SCREAMS.

	Finally, the others are able to pull her away. As they untangle
	the lines, the men are able to get the first view of the remains
	of Ben Hillenbrand, still caught in his harness.

	Amanda's knees buckle. Regaining her balance, she runs off into
	the jungle.

	Paul quickly follows.

				PAUL (CONT'D)
		Amanda!


50	EXT. THICKNESS - DAY						50

	Reeling, Amanda comes to a stop in an area with thick
	undergrowth. It's danger here, very still and quiet.

	She tries to calm herself, but each effort to suppress just
	makes her more emotional. She's surprised as Paul wraps an arm
	around her to comfort her. But she doesn't fight it.

				PAUL
		I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for
		the things I said about him.

				AMANDA
		No, it's...

				PAUL
		I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...

				AMANDA
			(frustrated)
		Its not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out
		here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.

	Saying it aloud, the reality sinks in for both of them

				AMANDA (CONT'D)
		I guess I was hoping that with Ben around,
		there'd be someone to keep him safe.

	Checking in on clients, Udesky stops at the edge of the
	thicket. Something raises the hairs on the back of his neck.

				UDESKY
		Dr. Grant!

	He nods for the others to take a look at this. They head over,
	Grant at the rear.

	As he approaches, Billy is packing up the rest of the chute in a
	backpack. He stops short from what he sees.

	Looking down, we CIRCLE across the jungle floor. Here we find a
	strange, hollowed-out construction made of sod and branches.
	Maybe six feet around.

	Just now noticing the others' stare, Paul looks down into one
	of the bowls at his feet, a half-buried nest. It's filled with
	football-sized eggs, laid in a spiral.

	And this isn't the only nest. Amanda counts twelve in all, laid
	out in an oddly symmetrical pattern.

	The last to arrive, Grant identifies the species in a horrified
	instant.

				GRANT
		Raptors.

And as he says the words, off in the distance, we hear
	the cry of some herbivores, around by the chorus of
	snarls.


							SMASH CUT TO:

51	EXT. FUTHER IN THE FOREST - DAY				51

	The party blasts through the forest, trying to keep up with
	Grant. They haven't even had time to ask --

				AMANDA
			(to Paul)
		Whats a raptor?

	Paul has no idea.

				UDESKY
		They don't look that big. I mean,
		comparatively.

				GRANT
		If we came across one, we might live.

				PAUL
		Well that's good.

				GRANT
		But you never came across just one.

	From the back --

				AMANDA
		Wait! Where's Billy?

	They all stop. The only one not there is --

				Grant
		Billy! Billy!

				AMANDA
			(almost sotto)
		I thought we weren't suppose to yell.

				BILLY (O.S)
		Here!

	He comes in from the left. Excited, he explains to Grant --

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		I got some great pictures of the nest. You
		know this proves raptors raised their young
		in colonies.

	Furious with his student. Grant just keeps moving. There's no
	time to stand around and argue.

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		This speaks to a larger social structure, the
		possibility of Darwinian altruism. It
		changes everything.

	A beat. Trying not to sound presumptuous --

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		We could co-write a paper.

				GRANT
		Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish
		or perish.


52	SCENE PREVIOUSLY OMITTED					52


53	EXT. RIDGE - DAY (HOURS LATER)					53

	Much fatigued, the five now mach upward towards a crest.

	Panting and flushed, they reach the top of the ridge and gaze
	into the distance.

	A jungle valley stretches before them. Not far off in A VAST
	COMPOUND - comprised of several buildings. One building alone
	seems to cover several acres.

	The weary group breathes a sigh of relief.

				PAUL
		I bet there's a very good chance Eric's in
		there. I'd bet my bottom dollar.

	Udesky and Grant share dubious looks and continue down into
	the valley.


54	EXT. INGEN COMPOUND - DAY					54

	The group emerges from the jungles and enters the compound.
	They walk through an overgrown parking lot, littered with
	abandoned vehicles. Some are lying on their side. Others are
	overturned completely.

	They're not going to be driving anywhere.

	A troubled Grant peers through a windshield, partially caved
	in, like some giant head butted the glass. (Think back to Lost 
World)

	And the group finally approaches the front doors of an
	enormous building. As they head up the front steps, we see
	something in the distance behind them:

	CAT-LIKE MOVEMENTS

	on the high ridge. To fast to see what it was. But too ominous
	to dismiss.


55	INT. BUILDING LOBBY - DAY					55

	Our friends now find themselves in a sparse, one quietly
	opulent corporate lobby now in the process of being reclaimed
	by the jungle/ Roots and ivy poke through the floor and walls.

	In the waiting area, the cushions of a sofas and chairs have been
	gnawed at and pulled apart. Dusty coffee mugs and filled
	ashtrays lie on the table. The water has turned brackish in a
	near by cooler.

	Sudden FLAPPING. We look up and see BIRDS nesting in the
	rafters. It is an eerie, haunted place.

				PAUL
			(calling out)
		Eric! Are you here?

				AMANDA
		Eric!

	All listen for a response. Nothing. Paul and Amanda exchange a
	despondent look.

	Sitting on the reception counter is an official-looking
	telephone. Everyone has the same thought, but no one dares.
	Finally -

				AMANDA (CONT'D)
		What the hell.

	Amanda puts the receiver to her ear. Nada.

	With Grant in the lead, they head deeper into the building.

	Unseen by the group, a fleeting SHADOW flits across the lobby's
	dirty windows with terrifying speed.


56	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY						56

	A couple vending machines stand at the one end of this long
	hallway covered with vines.

	Paul notices them and pulls change from his pocket.

				PAUL
		Let's see. I've got about a dollar seventy-
		five. How about you guys?

	Billy SMASHES IN the window of one machine with his boot.
	Picking through the glass, he pulls out some candy bars and
	chips. He checks the expiration date. 	


	CONTINUED:								56

				BILLY
		Thank God for preservatives.

	He tosses the food to the others.

	Paul now turns to his own vending machine and SMASHES it with
	his heal. The glass refuses to break.


57	INT. HATCHING LABORATORY					57

	Grant and Billy push through a set of doors to see
	
	A CAVERNOUS HATCHING FACILITY

	filled with much of the same equipment we recognized from the
	first island, although the sheer size of this place dwarfs any
	of the facilities seen previously.

	As the group walks down the ramp and onto the floor, they begin to
	absorb the incredible array of technology: enormous cryonic
	freezer, their plug pulled years ago; empty incubators; tanks
	of formaldehyde with dinosaur fetuses and body parts.

	Machines with intricate tubing and wing arms stand beside
	conveyer belts cris crossing the room at different levels.

				AMANDA
		This is how you make dinosaurs?

				GRANT
		This is how you play God.

	Billy looks around the lab. He can't help but be impressed.

				BILLY
		Okay if I take pictures?

	Grant nods.

	Billy sets his lucky camera back down on the worktable. Two years
	from now, astute observers of the DVD will not that Billy
	doesn't actually take his camera from the bag; he was carrying
	it because there wasn't any room inside.

	Billy pulls a new roll of film from the bag and zips it shut.

	ACROSS THE LAB

	Amanda is passing a large cylindrical tanks with half-formed
	embryos floating in formaldehyde -- genetic experiments gone
	awry. Finally she reaches

	A GIGANTIC MANIFIED RAPTOR HEAD

	floating in the one tank.

	Something about this specimen catches Amandas attention. She
	bends forward, getting very close to the glass. She peers right
	into the eyes of the nightmarish creature. Then --

	AN ACTUAL RAPTOR

	lunges at her form behind the tank. She SCREAMS.

	Fortunately the raptor can't get between the closely spaced
	tanks. Amanda runs.

				PAUL
		Amanda!

				GRANT
		Back out! Move!

	And as the group races through the lab the Raptors find a
	larger gap between the tanks.


58	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY				58

	Paul leads the way, checking the door for possible escape
	routes or hiding places. Twenty feet behind,

	THE RAPTOR

	rounds a corner, bolting after them. Paul ducks in the closest
	door.

				PAUL
		In here!


59	INT. DINO KENNEL - CONTINUOUS - DAY				59

	The group slams the door behind them and quickly takes in the
	room.

	There are several rows of oversized steel cages, apparently
	used for containing young dinosaurs. Many of the cage doors are
	standing open.

	The group races down a lone aisle. Close behind, the raptor
	BURSTS into the room, ROARS.

	As the Raptor gains ground, Udesky and Billy run into one of the
	open cages, SLAMMING the door behind them.

	Grant, Paul and Amanda duck into another. Before they can
	swing the cage door shut behind them, however, the raptor SLAMS
	into it, driving the door into the cage.

	They are forced back against a chain-like wall, trapped in a
	small triangle space by the advancing door. The angry
	Raptor is now inches away through the cage door.

	Then, suddenly, the raptor looks up. We follow its gaze. The top
	of their triangular enclose is wide open.

	The eager raptor climbs up the chain-like door. Catching the
	tail of an idea, Amanda grabs the door and nods to the others.

				AMANDA
		Push!

	They push hard on the cage door, swinging it and the raptor
	right through the opening of the cage.

	Now the raptor is trapped in a small triangular space, the door
	going right to the ceiling.

	Amanda slides the door's bolt through the chain like wall,
	temporarily trapping the dinosaur.

	The raptor struggles desperately, GRAWLING AND SNARLING, but
	the cage door seems to be holding.

	As everyone rushes back to the door.

	The raptor begins to make a LOW, HAUNTING MOAN.

	As the others head for the door, Grant lingers a step, listening
	to the beast's simple melodic cry. It has the same tones as
	came from the model resonating chamber.

				GRANT
		She's calling for help.


60	EXT. COMPOUND - DAY						60

	The group exits the rear of the lab building and finds itself in
	a large equipment yard. The CALL of the raptor is still audible
	as they head for the tree line.

	Now they moan is ANSWERED from distant jungle quarters.

	The responses quickly MULTIPLY. To the group's dismay, they
	soon find themselves virtually SURROUNDED by raptor CRIES both
	distant and near.

	Grant looks around with amazement. It's vindication of his
	theory on raptor communication, but it couldn't come at a worse
	time.

	Responding to the growls, a herd of grazing HADROSAURS suddenly
	flees across the open space. Then, in the distance behind the
	herd

	A PACK OF RAPTORS

	emerges from the jungles, coming their way.

				GRANT
		Head for the trees!

	From the lab building, the raptor we left imprisoned now BURSTS
	out one of the doors and HOWLS to the pack -- the same cry we
	heard in the lab.

	The raptor pack moves into the hunting formation. One ALPHA-MALE
	RAPTOR. slightly larger than the others, leads the charge up the
	middle.

	Grant risks a looks back. But doesn't stop running.

				GRANT (cont'd)
		THIS WAY!

	In an effort to escape the oncoming raptors, Grant leads the
	group right into the stampeding heard of hadrosaurs.

	Suddenly, all is chaos. Hadrosaurs race past, splitting up the
	group.

	Letting the others get ahead of him, Grant looks back. Much to
	his dismay, the raptors are ignoring the hadrosaurs.

	Indeed, the pack weaves its way through the herd -- the raptors
	only want them.

	In the chaos of the stampede, everyone loses sight of each other.

	Up ahead, Billy trips and falls. As he rolls the strap on his
	camera bag breaks. He doesn't notice it's missing until he's
	already back on his feet and running.

	Amanda and Paul keep close to each other. Further back, Grant
	spots Billy's fallen camera back. He grabs it as he runs past.

	Looking back, Billy sees that Grant now has his back...

				BILLY
		ALAN!

				GRANT
		KEEP GOING!

	They lose sight of each other in the rush.


61-19	OMIT									61-69


69A	EXT. EDGE OF THE JUNGLE - DAY					69A

	As the hadrosaurs WHIP PAST, Paul and Amanda climb up into a
	tree. A raptor leaps at Paul, barely missing his leg.

	Trying to pull Paul up, Amanda nearly loses her balance. This
	time, Paul catchers her.

	Billy climbs up a nearby tree of his own in sight of Paul and Amanda.

	Udesky has nearly reached a tree of his own when he finds
	himself

	HEADED OFF

	by a raptor. He turns to the other way, but finds

	THERE ARE MORE RAPTORS.

	He picks up a fallen branch as these dinosaurs cautiously
	approach. Not more than a few feet away, the leader of the trio
	stops, peering at him.

	Udesky swings hard, but the dinosaurs feints. From behind him,
	another raptor slashes at the back of his legs, severing his
	muscles. Udesky CRIES OUT and drops to the ground.

	IN THE TREETOPS

	Paul, Amanda and Billy can hear him.

				PAUL
		Udesky.

				AMANDA
			(Listening)
		He's this way.

	From here, the thick branches overlap, forming a kind of
	"second floor" above the ground. It's not easy, but you can move
	from branch to branch, tree to tree.

	ON THE FLOOR

	Unable to walk, Udesky attempts to crawl away from the animals.
	The effort clearly causes him great pain. Strangely, the
	raptors suddenly don't seem interested in him anymore.

	Rather, they're "talking" among themselves. Udesky is amazed to
	find him self still alive.

	Suddenly, one of the raptors SLASHES at him again. But it's
	delicately not a mortal blow, just a very painful one. Udesky
	CRIES OUT, louder this time.

	IN THE TREES

	Hearing the new cry, Paul, Amanda and Billy move faster, now
	finally seeing Udesky on the ground. He's face-down, barely
	moving but still MOANING.

	The raptors are gone.

	In the lead, Amanda starts to climb down. But Paul grabs her,
	holds her back.

				PAUL
		It's not safe.

				AMANDA
		We have to help him.

				BILLY
		He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill
		wounded.

				AMANDA
		He's not a kill, he's still alive.

	She breaks from Paul's grip and drops to the ground. She's only
	a foot away from the tree when

	ALL FOUR RAPTORS

	lead out from their hiding places. They almost catch her as
	Billy and Paul pull her back up on the limb

	The raptors stare up at them, angry their plan didn't work.

				PAUL
		They couldnt climb up, so they were trying
		to get us to come down.

				BILLY
		They set a trap
			(amazed)
		They actually set a trap.

	Bored with waiting, the raptors go back to finish off Udesky,
	making a meal out of it. Up in the branches, the survivors are
	horrified and sickened.

	Then, from the deep in the forest, a new RAPTOR CRY. The feasting
	raptors look up, listening, then suddenly run off into the dark
	jungle.

				PAUL
		Where's Grant?


69B	EXT. ELSEWHERE IN THE JUNGLE - DAY				69B

	Climbing higher in a tree, Grant is just feet above a growing
	pack of raptors. He scales one branch, the next, finally
	reaching a perch that the dinosaurs can't jump to.

	LOOKING DOWN

	The entire pack is now standing still, watching him. In the
	center, the Alpha Male lets out a sort of BARK. Responding to the
	cry, the other raptors CALL BACK.

	As terrified as he is, he can't help but be fascinated by their
	communication. Like a hellish bird song, there's a rhythm to it,
	a structure. They're clearly talking about something.

	Under his breath, Grant is able to mimic its patterns.

				GRANT
		What does that mean? What are you saying?

	Of course they can't answer. They just keep using the same
	"phrase."

	Ready to ditch Billy's camera bag in order to climb higher --
	he's had to hold it by the strap -- Grant finds his hand covered
	with a runny slime. He looks down at the camera bag, and that's
	the source. It's oozing out the bottom.

	He unzips the bag to find

	A BROKEN RAPTOR EGG

	inside, the white and green yolk still dripping from the pieces
	of the shell. There's another intact egg beside it.

	This is what the raptors where chasing.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		God damn you, Billy.

	Ever the scientist, Dr. Grant tests a theory even in the face of
	danger: he holds up the intact egg so that the raptors can see it.
	They suddenly go crazy, howling the same phrase but LOUDER.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		It means, "Give us the egg," doesn't it? "We
		want the egg."

	He gently drops the bag to the ground. Although the raptors are
	interested, pulling out the unbroken egg, they're still by no means
	placated. The song may have changed, but they still want Grant
	dead.

	They begin to jump at him, eventually, hopping up on each
	others backs. It's only a matter of time till they reach him.

	Grant moves to climb higher, but sees no branches he can reach.
	And than he hears the low CREAKING. A CRACK. The branch he's
	on is starting to give in.

	He looks down at the face of his enemies, knowing he'll be
	their next meal. And then,

	A SMALL CANISTER

	lands at the base of the trees, immediately SPRAYING out a thick
	cloud of oily fog. It's the first of

	FIVE CANISTERS

	that land in the area, creating a thick cloud. It's not just
	smoke though something far more caustic.

	As it hits the raptors they immediately recoil, those closest
	to the canisters SHRIEKING in pain. Tumbling in the dirt.
	There may be a pheremonal element to the mist as well -- they
	seem panicked, disoriented.

	Pack mentality takes over, and after the first ten raptors take
	off running, so do the rest, some tripping over their feet
	blindly.

	This may be dino-tear gas, but it's not good for humans either.
	Up in the tree, Grant's eyes immediately burn from the vapor
	He squints to see through the fog, where he spots

	A HUMAN SHAPE

	at the edge of the smoke

				VOICE
		Come on! They'll be back!

	Grant half-climbs, half-falls out of the tree, rushing to get
	through the heaviest of the smoke.

	A SMALL DIRTY HAND

	grabs his, pulling him along.


69C	EXT. JUNGLE - LATE DAY						69C

	Eyes swollen from the gas. Grant stumbles, barely able to see as
	the other person pulls him along. It's only now we can identify
	his rescuer as

	ERIC KIRBY,

	the boy he was brought to rescue. A lot has changed in the last
	eight weeks. It's not just dirt and muck -- he's the filthiest
	child you've ever seen -- something primal has come out in him.

	Something wild.


69D	EXT. INGEN COMPOUND - TWILIGHT				69D

	On the far side of the tipped over vehicle, Eric pulls open a
	hatch -- his hiding place. The door opens part way.

	Eric motions for Grant to follow.


69E	INT. INSIDE THE BUNKER - TWILIGHT				69E

	Squeezing in sideways -- it's very tight fit -- Grant finds
	himself in a space no bigger than the inside of a Datsun. lit by
	a small battery-powered lantern. This is where Eric has been
	hiding.

	The minute Grant's inside, Eric goes back to work re-sealing
	the door. This 13-year old boy has become astonishingly
	efficient at staying alive.

				GRANT
		Eric...

	The boy holds up a hand. He listens for a moment. He doesn't
	hear anything outside.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Eric, your parents are both here.

				ERIC
		In Costa Rica?

				GRANT
		On the island.

	Eric truly can't believe it. He hoped to be rescued but...

				ERIC
		They'll never make it. I mean, they can't
		manage when the cable goes out.

				GRANT
		You'd be surprised what people can do when
		they have too.

	Eric studies his guest, finally certain he recognizes him.

				ERIC
		You're Alan Grant, aren't you?
			(off surprised reaction)
		I read both of your books.

				GRANT
		Which one do you prefer?

				ERIC
		The first one. Before you where on the island.
		You liked dinosaurs back then.

				GRANT
		Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me.

	Grant takes a better look around Eric's tiny hideaway,
	impressed with what he's been able to scavenge. Among the many
	items we see another smoke canister, some battery-powered
	lanterns and lots of candy wrappers. This kid's been living on
	chocolate for weeks.

				ERIC
		When InGen cleared out, they left a lot of
		stuff behind.

				GRANT
		Any weapons, radios?

	Eric pulls up a long cattle prod to show Grant.

				ERIC
		Found this, but the battery's dead.

				GRANT
		It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I 
		barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight
		weeks.

	The line catches Eric strangely. It's the first moment of true
	emotion we've seen him in.

				ERIC
		Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.

				GRANT
			(trying to be positive)
		The important thing is we both made it.
		That's something we have in common.

	Eric rips into a candy bar. After a moment, he realizes he
	should offer one to his guest as well.

	Grant takes it. A lone beat. Than, Grant just has to know...

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Did you read Malcolm's book?

				ERIC
		Yeah.

				GRANT
		What did you think?

				ERIC
		I dunno. I mean, it was kind of preachy.
		Chaos-this, chaos-that. And like, to me, the
		guy seemed kind of high on himself.

	Grant smiles.

				GRANT
		That's two things we have in common.


69F	EXT. TREETOPS - NIGHT						69F

	The trio is where we left them, perched up in the branches.
	They're far from safe, but nothing's after them for a
	while.

	In Billy's eyes, we can see a storm of guilt raging. But he
	hasn't said anything. Won't say anything.

				AMANDA
		We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr.
		Grant are out there somewhere.

				PAUL
		I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit
		of good right now. For every scary thing we
		saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times
		more of 'em at night.
			(to Billy)
		Am I right?

				BILLY
		I dont know.

				PAUL
		I thought you were an expert.

				BILLY
		Dr. Grant was.

				AMANDA
		Well Dr. Grant isn't here, so we're going to
		have to figure out what to do ourselves.

	Amanda is impressed by her own determinations. A long beat.

				AMANDA (cont'd)
		So what do we do?

	No one has the faintest clue.


69G	EXT. DEEP IN THE FOREST - NIGHT					69G

	VARIOUS SHOTS; The creatures of Isla Sorna walk past in the
	shadows, some looking up at the light in the trees.

	Suddenly, one of the creatures is attacked by another. We hear
	ROLLING, SNARLING, HISSING, just seeing the outline of the
	fight. Just as fast as it began, the fight is over, the winner
	snakes on the loser.


69H	EXT. TREETOPS - NIGHT (LATER)					69H

	Everyone's moved to different branches, trying to settle in for
	the night. Paul keeps looking over to the tearful Amanda, about
	to say something. He finally does.

				PAUL
		I just want you know, Amanda. It's not
		your fault what happened.

	Amanda looks over, not sure what his absolution.

				PAUL (cont'd)
		Eric has always been headstrong, and you
		throw Ben Hildebrand into the mix and well...

				AMANDA
		Well what?

				PAUL
		Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead.
		What I'm trying to say is, its was just a crazy
		accident. The exact same thing could have
		happened if he was with me. You can't go
		beating yourself up about it.

	Realizing he's trying his best, Amanda cant stay angry with
	him.

				AMANDA
		This wouldn't happen if he was with
		you. I mean, you drive five miles below the
		speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives
		years.

				PAUL
		That one time was just the bumper.

				AMANDA
		He would have been, safe. Completely,
		entirely, suffocatingly safe.
			(beat)
		I would have him to see more of the world than
		Enid, Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the
		world than Enid, Oklahoma. And so yes, it's
		my fault that this happened. I'm sorry that
		you have to be here.

	Really looking at her...

				PAUL
		I'm not sorry at all.


69I	EXT. INGEN COMPOUND - DAY					69I

	Morning on Isla Sorna. A low mist hangs tight to the forest
	floor as Eric seals up his hideaway for hopefully the last time.

	They start walking. Eric pulls something out of his pocket,
	shows it off to Grant.

				ERIC
		Know what this is?

				GRANT
			(takes it)
		A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.

				ERIC
		Mine's new.

	Grant hands it back.

	Eric is becoming more and more a normal thirteen-year old boy.
	There's an innocence to him that's coming back.

				GRANT
		How much of this island have you explored?

				ERIC
		I stayed pretty close to the compound,
		Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's
		where they'd start.

				GRANT
		We need to head for the coast.

				ERIC
		Are you sure?

				GRANT
		Why?

				ERIC
		Closer you get to the water, the bigger
		things get.


69J	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							69J

	Billy and Amanda wait for Paul as he comes out of the bushes,
	hiking up his shorts.

	Trying to take charge...

				BILLY
		We need to stick to the plan. Head for the
		coast.

				AMANDA
		What about Eric and Dr. Grant?

				BILLY
		Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's
		alive, thats where he's headed.

				AMANDA
		What about Eric?

	Billy represses his instinct to say Eric's dead.

				PAUL
			(rationalizing)
		He's probably has a better chance by the coast
		as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs
		would live in the center of the island.
			(to Billy)
		Right?

				BILLY
		Sure.


69K	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							69K

	As Grant and Eric walk, both stop, hearing a strange sound. But
	for a change, it's not an ominous one.

	It's a human one.

	A phone is RINGING, very faintly. Without a word to each other,
	Grant and Eric decide its coming from the right.

69L	EXT. JUNGLE - CONTUNUOUS DAY					69L

	Paul is picking the briars out of his socks as they hike,
	risking tripping on every step. Then Amanda stops short. She's
	the first to hear it:

	THE SAME RINGING.

	After a beat, everyone else can hear it too. And recongnition
	finally lights on Paul's face...

				PAUL
		My phone.

	Suddenly, Paul frantically searches his pockets as the others
	anxiously watch.

				AMANDA
		You had the phone the whole time?

				BILLY
		Where is it?

				PAUL
		I don't know. I don't have it with me.

				AMANDA
		When did you have it last?

				PAUL
		I don't remember

				AMANDA
		Think.

	And Paul wracks his memory...

				PAUL
		The plane. I got a call on the plane, put it in
		my coat pocket, and...

	Bust suddenly, he stops, his face is lighting with an awful
	realization. Amanda couldnt bear the wait...

				AMANDA
		What?...WHAT!?

				PAUL
		I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on
		him when he...

	The hideous implication of his words slowly sink in.


69M	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							69M

	Still following the faint RINGING, Grant and Eric turn to find

	A SAIL

	moving through the low trees. We recognize it as the back of a
	spinosaurus. We might think it's any random spinosaurus,
	except for the RINGING coming from somewhere inside it.

	Grant and Eric press back against a tree, keep perfectly
	still as they hear the THOOOOMB, THOOOOMB, THOOOMB of the
	creature's footsteps reverberating. It's tail RUSTKES against
	the brush.

	It's moving behind them, and it's close.

	We hear the RINGING move from left to right as it passes. So
	far, its has no idea they're there.

	Looking across the clearing, Eric is startled to see

	PAUL AND AMANDA

	are no more than 20 yards away, also hiding. An involuntary
	reflex, Eric calls out...

				ERIC
		Mon! Dad!

	Grant immediately covers the boys mouth. But it's to late.
	The dinosaur has stopped. We still can't see it. We don't know how
	close it is.

	Paul and Amanda spot Eric with Grant. They're a thousand
	emotions at once: relieved, disbelieving, terrified, overjoyed.
	They want to run to him, to yell out to him, but the monster is
	close.

	Grant takes his hand off Eric's mouth. They both stay
	completely silent.

	All this time, the sat-phone is RINGING.

	Than it stops.

	And after an agonizing beat, the beast moves. At first we're
	not sure which direction it's headed, but finally we can tell
	its moving away.

	Once the sail is finally out of sight, Eric breaks from Grant's
	hold and dashes to his parents' arms. They coop him up. Hug
	him, kiss him, their affection unquenchable. He's crying.

				AMANDA
			(reassuring him)
		Sweetheart, you're okay.
			(reassuring herself)
		You're okay.
			(disbelieving)
		You're okay.

				PAUL
		Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men,
		we stick around, huh?

				ERIC
		We do.

	Looking at her grubby son, Amanda licks her shirttail, trying
	to rub his face clean.

				PAUL
		Honey, there's not enough spit in the world
		for that.

	She LAUGHS. It's the first times she's laughed in two months.

	Billy crosses the distance to Grant.

				GRANT
		We need to keep moving.

				BILLY
		Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry
		about the...

				GRANT
		Billy, I can't talk to you now.

	He walks off. Billy follows him.

				BILLY
		Please, okay? Just yell at me. Call me an
		idiot. An asshole. Stupid. Tell me I screwed
		up because I know I did.

	Grant doesn't respond.

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		I thought if we could get a raptor back
		to the mainland, we could get serious money
		for it. Enough to fund the digging for 10
		years. More. Whatever it took.

	Grant shakes his head, disgusted, But doesn't stop.

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		You have to believe me. I did it with the
		best intentions.

				GRANT
			(finally turning on him)
		Some of the worst things imaginable have
		been done with the best intentions. You
		rushed in with no thought to the
		consequences, to yourself or anyone else.
			(finally)
		You're no better than the people who built
		this place.

	Grant keeps walking, leaving Billy with his guilt.


70	INT. CANYON BUILDING - DAY					70

	The group enters a structure with giant windows designed to
	look into the canyon beyond -- only there's nothing to see but a
	thick fog.

	Toward the center of the room, a spiral staircase that leads to
	a lower level.

	With Billy lagging, Grant approaches the stairs and peers down
	the circular opening in the floor. There is not much to see, just
	fog, a glint of sunlight.


71	EXT. RIVER CANYON - DAY						71

	Step by step, Grant leads the group down a rusty spiral
	staircase below the observation room. The stairs end in a lower
	level. Although we're technically outside, this whole place feel
	strangely enclosed.

	There's a thick fog at this level -- clouds, really -- but far
	below we can see the river. And at its banks, a barge.

				GRANT
		We climb down to the barge and follow the
		river out to the ocean. With any luck, the
		Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.

				ERIC
		Then we go home?

				AMANDA
		Then we go home.

	Grant leads everyone down a RAMP to --


72	EXT. LANDING - DAY							72

	A catwalk branches off, a SET OF STAIRS continuing down the
	along the canyon wall.

	Grant starts down the stairs. He's only taken a few steps down
	the rusty staircase suddenly

	BREAKS BENEATH HIS FEET.

	Paul grabs him in the nick of time. The staircase vanish into
	the fog. CLANFING AGAINST the canyon wall. After a few more
	seconds of silence, they hear the CRASH far below.

				AMANDA
		You okay?

	Grant nods and looks in the other direction.

				GRANT
		How about if we try this way?

	Their only other option is a precarious catwalk that
	disappears into the mist.

				AMANDA
		Do you think it goes all the way across?

				GRANT
		One way to find out.

	The only way to get his-near-fall is to push ahead. But his
	stomach turns at being so high.

	Amanda follows. The catwalk creaks and groans, listing
	slightly. She freezes mid-stride.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
			(glancing back)
		We'd better do this one at a time.

	Amanda steps of and Grant carefully pushes forward,
	disappearing into the thick fog.

	The others listen to the CREAKING of the catwalk until it STOPS
	ABRIPTLY.

	SILENCE.

				PAUL
		Dr. Grant?

	More silence. Then, out of the fog, a distant voice call out --

				GRANT (O.S.)
		Come on over. One at a time.

	Amanda steps tentatively forwards. Eric is clinging to her.

				AMANDA
		Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.

				PAUL
		We're not going anywhere, I promise.

	As Paul holds Eric, and Amanda shares a look.

				Amanda
		We're all together now, Eric.

	Eric reluctantly releases her mother. Amanda starts to cross.


73	EXT. REVER CANYON - FAR WALL - DAY				73

	Grant has stopped at a lateral support across the
	catwalk, trying to get the sense of where they are and what
	purpose this place may have served.

	Seeing that the support beams are brace high arched walls of steal
	mesh, it becomes obvious that we are inside this vast
	construction.

	Amanda emerges from the mist and turns back to the catwalk.

				AMANDA
			(calling out)
		Okay! Come on, Eric!


74	EXT. LANDING - DAY							74

	Eric is next to go across. He's still tentative.

				PAUL
		How 'bout if I...

				ERIC
		No, I can do it.

	Billy and Paul look on as Eric disappears into the vapor.

				PAUL
			(muttering to himself)
		That's it Eric. Nice and easy...


75	EXT. CATWALK - DAY							75

	Eric slowly gropes his way forward. He feels a GUST OF WIND and
	a HEAVY THUD ahead on the catwalk which now sways beneath
	him.

	Regaining his balance, Eric peers forward, but the fog prevents
	him from seeing more than fifteen feet ahead. There is an EERIE
	SILENCE. Eric calls out timidly.

				ERIC
		Mom?


75A	EXT. RIVER CANYON - FAR WALL - DAY				75A

	Across the canyon, Grant moves across the later support. With
	his hand on the railing, he sends a white, hardened substance
	dropping into the mist.

	Looking up, Grant notices a large strut, covered with the same
	substance. Realizing what it could be.

				GRANT
		Oh, my God.

				AMANDA
		What is it?

				GRANT
		A bird cage.

	Then, the sound of Eric SCREAMING.


75B	EXT. CATWALK - DAY							75B

	Eric watches as A LOOMING SHAPE emerges from the fog -- a
	nightmarish vision stalking purposefully forward.

	A FULL GROWN PTERANODON,

	standing over seven feet high, walks upright on clawed feet, his
	thirty foot wings folded bat-like at his side.

	The creature sees Eric and fixes him with a demonic glare.

	Eric CRIES OUT and dashes back down the teetering catwalk.

	The Pteranodon ruses to its feet, spreads its thirty-foot wings
	and flies directly at him.

	AT THE OTHER END OF THE CATWALK

	Hearing Eric's SCREAMS, Paul charges onto the catwalk,
	searching in the fog.

				PAUL
		Eric!

				BILLY
		It won't hold!

	Suddenly,

	ERIC

	emerges from the fog, racing toward his father. And then
	
	THE PTERANODON

	swoops out of the fog, opens its giant rear claws, and snatches
	the terrified boy from the catwalk.

	Paul Kirby watches in stunned, abject horror as the Pteranodon
	carries Eric directly overhead --

				PAUL
		ERIC!

	The flying reptile struggles with the boy's weight. Paul
	watches helplessly as Eric is carried high across the canyon.

	Paul runs back alone the catwalk in a desperate attempt to keep
	Eric in sight.

	Billy stays behind, moving back up the platform to try to
	keep the dinosaur in view. With a new idea, he races back up the
	stairs to the observation room. He has a way to save Eric.

	When he reaches the canyon wall, Paul turns a corner and runs
	along another enclosed catwalk leading deeper into the canyon.

	Grant and Amanda now come pounding down the catwalk trying to
	catch up with Paul.

				AMANDA
			(shouting)
		Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?

				PAUL
			(shouting back)
		I'm trying! That thing took him down this
		way!

				GRANT
		Split up!

	THE PTERANODON

	carries Eric deeper into the canyon. The creature's wings beat
	steadily overhead, and the WIND is fierce. Eric looks down and
	sees the river far below.

	The Pteranodon swoops over an isolated outcropping of rocks at
	the end of the canyon and drops Eric into --


75C	EXT. PTERANODON NEST - DAY					75C

	A large bowl of mud and branches the size of a satellite dish.
	Eric lands right on top of a pile of dinosaur bones picked
	clean. Mixed among is one human skull.

	Before Eric has time to cry out, he looks up to find

	SIX PTERANODON HATCHLINGS

	closing in on him with sharp-edged beaks.

	He picks up the human skull and whips it to the hatchlings.
	They easily duck it and keep coming.

76	EXT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS DAY			76

	Grant looks up to see Billy leaning out over the edge of the
	observation platform. He suddenly realizes what Billy is about
	to do.

				GRANT
		BILLY! WAIT!

	Billy SHOUTS BACK, an excited-terrified grin on his face.

				BILLY
		I CAN GET HIM!

				GRANT
		NO!

				BILLY
		I KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES!

	Billy jumps off the railing and

	DROPS TOWARDS THE CANYON BELOW.

	Grant, Paul and Amanda watch as Billy FALLS past them like a
	stone, plummeting towards certain death. But then --

	THE PARASAIL CHUTE

	blossoms above him.

	Not only does it slows Billy's descent, but he even manages to
	catch an updraft and begin to rise.

	He struggles to control the parasail, swooping dangerously
	close to the canyon wall, barely avoiding it.

	Up ahead he catches sight of Eric and steers towards him.


77-80	OMIT									77-80


81	EXT. PTERANODON NEST - DAY					81

	Eric struggles to keep away from the hatchlings. But there's
	no way out of this nest.

	Billy SWOOPS overhead, but he's too high to reach Eric.

				BILLY
		ERIC! HOLD ON!

	He circles around to make another attempt.


82	EXT. ENCLOSED CATWAY - DAY					82

	Paul rounds the corner and finally catches sight of Eric in the
	nest, some fifty feet below, fighting off the hatchlings.

				PAUL
		Hang on, Eric!

	Paul sees an outcropping he could jump onto from here. It's a
	big leap, though, he might not make it. He steels himself up for
	the jump, then chickens out.

	Grant and Amanda come up behind him. Suddenly,

	A SECOND PTERANODON

	CRASH LANDS on the catwalk enclosure about them -- right next
	to a gaping hole in the mesh. The catwalk GROANS with the
	extra weight.

	The pteranodon JAMS its head through the hole, SNAPPING at
	them.


83	EXT. CANYON - IN THE AIR - DAY					83

	Billy circles, making his approach.

	In the nest, Eric kicks at the hatchlings, but they're
	undeterred. Billy and Eric will only have one chance.

	As Billy swoops past, Eric jumps and grabs onto his boot. He is
	yanked up and out of the nest. But than, MOTHER PTERANODON
	shoots past, tearing out a piece of the parasail in its beak.


84-85	OMIT									84-85


86	EXT. OVER THE RIVER - DAY					86

	The pteranodon who landed on the top of the catwalk continues to
	SNAP through the hole in the enclosure.

	Finally the reptile's massive weight proves to much, and the
	entire section of the catwalk BREAKS FREE of the canyon wall
	and FLIPS OVER LATERALLY.

	Amanda, Grant and Paul are able to hang on, but so is the
	pteranodon, who now climbs their way.


87	OMIT									87


88	EXT. OVER THE RIVER - DAY					88

	His parasail badly damaged, Billy tries to keep aloft. Heading
	as low as he dares, he yells to Eric --

				BILLY
		Let go!

	Terrified, Eric falls into the river safely. He surfaces,
	immediately swimming to shore.

	Trying to gain altitude, Billy bends hard to the right. But the
	rigging is too badly damaged. He flies right into the canyon
	wall, hitting hard.

	Instead of tumbling down to the river, he finds himself
	swinging from his harness - the parasail snagged on a rock
	spire above him.


89	EXT. BROKEN CATWALK - DAY					89

	Paul, Grant and Amanda struggle to stay away from the
	pteranodon as it moves towards them.

	Suddenly. the far end of this inverted section of catwalk
	detaches from the canyon wall and

	SWINGS DOWNWARD.

	The force of the action sends the three tumbling directly
	towards the pteranodon.

	Miraculously, they manage to avoid its open beak. But they
	are all sent plummeting toward the river below.


90	EXT. RIVER - DAY							90

	They hit the water hard, resurfacing moments later. The
	current is carrying them downstream.


91	EXT. CANYON WALL - DAY						91

	The two pteranodons who were pursuing Billy now land on nearby
	ledges and consider how best to dispatch their prey.

	Billy frantically tries to unhook his harness, but the tension
	is so tight from his own weight that he can't loosen the
	buckles.


92-93	OMIT							  92-93


94	EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY					      94

	Paul and Amanda emerge from the water by the canyon wall and
	find their son hiding behind a rock, searching the skies for
	Billy.

	Amanda takes Eric tightly in her arms, and Paul urges them to
	keep moving. Up ahead, the mesh of the aviary meets the river.

	Wading the shore, Grant now scans the canyon, searching for
	Billy. It doesn't take long to spot him.

95	EXT. CANYON WALLL - DAY						95

	Billy continues to struggle with the harness but to no avail.

	The doomed young man is suspended high up on the canyon wall
	like a modern Prometheus, an entire FLOCK of pteranodons
	gathering around him preparing to peck away his liver. And
	everything else.

	A MAMMOTH PTERANADON has landed beside him and looks him
	straight in the eye.

	The gigantic creature lunges at him. Billy dodges away as best
	he can. The pteranodon's frustrated bite severs a crucial
	juncture on Billy's harness, and Billy is able to wriggle free.


96	EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY						96

	Eric, Amanda, Paul and Grant watch in amazement as Billy is the
	last to PLUNGE DOWN into the river.

				GRANT
		He made it!

	Billy bobs to the surface and spots the group downstream. He
	waves and begins to swim towards them. Soon he nears the shore
	and gets to his feet, wading as he comes.

	Grant, Paul, Amanda and Eric hurry to meet him.

	Grant is overjoyed to see him alive. But his smile quickly
	fades as he sees

	THE ENTIRE FLOCK OF PTERANODONS

	diving down from above in angry pursuit of their lost prey.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Billy, look out!

	Billy glances behind him. He races forward, motioning fro his
	companions to turn around.

				BILLY
		Get back! Get back!

	Just then Billy is knocked down by the lead pteranodon. It
	strikes from behind with a brutal, calculated beak to the head.
	Billy stumbles and falls to the ground.

	Grant rushes forward with Paul right after him. Amanda takes
	Eric to safety down river.

	Billy SCREAMS as the ENTIRE FLOCK of pteranodons now swarms
	around him, picking him apart with their beaks and claws.

				GRANT
		Billy!

				PAUL
		It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.

	Grant can't take his eyes off Billy, whose BLOOD stains the
	water rushing by.

	And now several pteranodons are heading their way. Difficult
	as it is to leave Billy behind, Grant and Paul make a run for it.

	Just as the pteranodons are about to swoop in for the kill, Alan
	and Paul dive back into the river...


97	EXT. THE RIVER - CONTINUOUS DAY				97

	...and resurfaces on the far side of the mesh aviary wall, GASPING
	for air. Just behind them, the mammoth

	PTERANODON

	CRASHES into the mesh. It tears at the steel, actually ripping
	it in one place.

	At the dock up ahead, Amanda and Eric have found a rusty,
	waterlogged barge that's somehow still floating. Carrying a
	tarp-covered cage, the boat was meant for transporting dinos
	up and down the river.

	Amanda pushes them away from the dock as Alan and Paul climb
	on board.


98	EXT. ON THE BARGE - CONTINUOUS DAY				98

	The current takes the craft downstream, letting us get our
	first good look at the incredible
	
	AVIARY.

	It's a vast, domed mesh structure that spans the entire canyon.
	In all, a feat of remarkable engineering and unmistakable
	hubris.

	Catching their breath, our four survivors look at the cage they
	were caught in.


99	EXT. DOWN RIVER - DAY / LATER					99

	Yanking the starter rope one final time, Paul finally gets the
	engine to turn over, PUTTERING along. Amanda is beside him,
	bailing water.

				PAUL
		My own kid was right in front of me and I
		didn't do a damn thing.

				AMANDA
		You couldn't have made that jump.

				PAUL
		I should have tried. It should have been me
		on that beach back there, not Billy.

				AMANDA
		How would you have helped Eric?
			(he can't answer)
		He needs you, Paul. He needs us.

				PAUL
		He could have died.

				AMANDA
		But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm
		glad about that.


99A	UP ON THE BOW							99A

	Grant is beside Eric, keeping watch, but also feeling the weight
	of Billy's death.

				ERIC
		Do you have any kids?

				GRANT
		No. Although I've studied them in the wild.

	Eric looks over, not sure what that means.

				GRANT (CON'T)
		I have a theory that there's two kinds of
		boys. Those who want to be astronomers and
		those who want to be astronauts.

				ERIC
		I want to be an astronaut.

				GRANT
		See, I was the opposite. I never understood
		why anyone would want to go into space. It's
		so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and
		you're dead. The astronomer -- or the
		paleontologist -- get to study these amazing
		things from a place of complete safety. And
		truthfully, everything you really need to
		learn, you can learn it from the ground.

				ERIC
		But then you never get to go in space.

				GRANT
		Exactly. The difference between imagining
		how things might be and seeing how they
		really are. To be able to touch them. That's
		what Billy wanted to do.

	The barge starts to round a bend. On the bow, Grant and Eric
	are the fist to see something remarkable. Eric GASPS,
	unprepared. We don't know yet what they see.

				GRANT (cont'd)
		I can blame the people who made this island.
		But I can't blame the people who want to see
		it. To study it.

	At the rear of the barge, Paul just now sees what's ahead. Awe-
	struck, he slows the motor and motions for Amanda to take a
	look. And so do we.

	UP AHEAD

	The setting sun illuminates an incredible valley filled with
	dinosaurs. We see armored ANKYLOSAURS with clubbed
	tails. Duck-billed CORYTHOSAURS. We float under the gigantic,
	arching necks of eighty-foot BRACHIOSAURS.

	With the mist from the river and the play of light, we're
	witnessing a kind of primal Eden.

				GRANT (cont'd)
		How's a boy suppose to resist this?


100	EXT. FURTHER DOWNSTREAM - NIGHT				100

	A FULL MOON passes behind clouds. THUNDER quietly rumbles, and
	LIGHTNING flickers in the distance.

	Paul is still at the wheel. The river is narrower here, and
	cautions must be taken to avoid the banks.

	As the barge begins to round another bend. a FAMILIAR HIGH-
	PITCHED SOUND pierces the darkness. Muffled but unmistakable,
	it is the RINGING SAT-PHONE.

	All exchange looks of sheer PANIC, expecting Spinosaurus to
	leap out at any moment. Grant scans the river banks.

				GRANT
		Keep quiet.

	Paul cuts the motor, and time seems to stop as the four stand
	posed for action.

	The barge finishes rounding the curve, and the ringing grows
	LOUDER. The suspense is excruciating until finally...

	Their eyes widen at some horrifying sight, more horrifying
	than anything they've yet seen.

	SEVEN MOUNDS OF DINOSAUR DUNG sit on the patch off treeless flat
	ground just beyond the river bank.

	As our friends consider the sight, an idea comes to them all of them
	almost simultaneously.

	With Eric still in the boat, Amanda, Paul, and Alan jump into
	the river and rush to the bank.


101	EXT. RIVER BANK - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT				101

	The three companions sprint towards the source of the RINGING.

				GRANT
		Find it before it stops ringing!

	And bracing themselves and hocking their breath, they PLUNGE
	their arms into their respective dung-heaps. After a few
	moments of this disgusting search...

				PAUL
		I've got something. I think I've got
		something!

	All turn to Paul. Clearing away the clinging defecation, he
	holds up to a beeper. And still the phone RINGS.

	Returning to their bleak task, they shovel the excrement with
	their arms. Finally:

				AMANDA
		I've got it! I've got it!

	Grant snatches the RINGING SAT-PHONE from Amanda's hands,
	presses a button, and puts it to his ear.

				RECORDED VOICE (ON PHONE)
		You too can own a time share in beautiful
		Guadalajara. Enjoy a meal in one of our four
		star restaurants, explore our coral reefs, or
		just walk on the beach...

	The Kirbys hear the recorded voice and let out a collective,
	heavy sigh. Grant shuts off the phone.

	In all the excitement, none of them notice a fierce horned
	CARNOTAUR right behind them. The giant creature ROARS, ready
	to eat them.

	But as it gets in close, it smells them. Even a dinosaur won't
	eat something that is covered in shit. After a beat, the
	Carnotaur turns and walks away, back into the jungle.

				PAUL
		Can't help but be a little offended.


102	EXT. BACK ON THE BARGE - NIGHT					102

	CLOSE ON the cleaned satellite phone's display. The battery
	level indicator is FLASHING.

				PAUL
		Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy.
		They won't do a God Damn thing.

				GRANT
		Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican
		phone book here, so it will have to be
		somebody we know in the states. Someone we
		can absolutely count on to send help.

				PAUL
			(to Amanda)
		Stan.

				AMANDA
		I wouldn't trust Stan with a snowball in a
		blizzard.

	Paul glares at her. Now Eric notices something odd in the
	river.

				ERIC
		What's that?

	The others look down in the murky water. Just below the
	surface,

	A SHIMMERING WAVE OF SILVER

	passes beneath the boat.

	Then a SINGLE FISH jumps from the water. And another. And
	another.

				GRANT
		Bonitas.

				ERIC
		Something must've scared them.

	Another roll of THUNDER, this time much closer.

				GRANT
		Get the motor going.

	Paul moves the motor and pulls the start cord. The engine
	sputters but won't come to life.

	And now the phone BEEPS. The battery is getting even weaker.

	Grant makes a quick decision and DIALS.

				AMANDA
		Who are you calling?

	But Grant ignores the question. RING. RING.

				GRANT
		Pick up! Pick up!


103	INT. ELLIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT				103

	Wearing his jammies, three-year old Charlie awkwardly picks up
	the phone with both hands. He has the mouthpiece next to his
	lips, but the earpiece is hanging out in space.

				CHARLIE
		Hewwo?

	INTERCUT

	Recognizing who it must be...

				GRANT
		Charlie? Charlie. Get your mother. Right
		away!

	A long silence. Charlie bites his lip, looks around.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Charlie? Are you there?

				CHARLIE
		Hewwo?

	The sat-phone BEEPS again, this time much LOUDER.

	Amanda and Eric watch Grant, realizing their fate may hang on
	this single call. Paul struggles without success to start the
	motor.

	Then, unseen by the group, a

	GIGANTIC FIN

	rises from the water just fifty yards from the barge. It's
	headed right to them and closing fast.

				GRANT
			(desperate)
		Charlie! It's the dinosaur man! Go get
		mommy, okay?

				CHARLIE
		Okay.

	Not sure what to do with the phone, Charlie makes a logical
	choice and hangs it back up.

	He walks away to his mom.


104	EXT. BARGE - NIGHT [END INTERCUTTING]			104

	Grant realizes he's been cut off. He's about to redial when

	WHAM!

	The barge is RAMMED, sending everyone tumbling. Grant manages
	to stay on top of the wheelhouse, but he loses grip on the
	phone, which falls on deck.

	SPINOSAURUS

	rises from the water, towering over the barge. As lightning
	FLASHES and thunder CRACKS, the dinosaur lets out an ear-
	splitting ROAR.

	It lunges at Grant with gaping jaws. Grant leaps out of
	the way just in time as the dinosaur

	RIPS OFF

	the entire wheelhouse.

							            CUT TO:


105	INT. ELLIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT				105

	Charlie leads Ellie into the room. Hands her the phone. Of
	course, it's just a DIAL TONE.

				ELLIE
		Was somebody on the phone?

				CHARLIE
		Dinosaur man.

	Ellie looks at him with confusion, then quickly checks the
	Caller ID box besides the phone. It's international, and not a
	number she recognizes.

							          BACK TO:


106	EXT. THE BARGE - NIGHT						106

	Grant stays one step ahead of the Spinosaurus as the beast rips
	apart the quickly-sinking boat.

	It spits out the wheelhouse and bites down on the stern of the
	boat, ripping off a chunk.

	Grant is heading up to the other three when he hears the sat-
	phone RING.  He spots it, just about to fall into the water.
	Dives for it, answering...

				GRANT
		ELLIE!


106A	INT. ELLIES LIVING ROOM - NIGHT					106A

				ELLIE
		Alan?

	She can hear the Spinosaurus ROAR.

				ELLIE (CONT'D)
		Alan? Alan!

	But he's cut off by a SECOND ROAR, the sound of someone
	SCREAMING.

	And then the line goes dead.

	Ellie pales. Charlie looks at her with a smile.

				CHARLIE
			(imitating)
		Raaaar!


106B	EXT. BACK ON THE BARGE - NIGHT					106B

	Dropping the dead phone, Grant scrambles towards the front of
	the boat and joins Paul, Amanda and Eric, who have taken refuge
	in the dinosaur cage.

	The fearsome beast now lifts the stern of the boat clear out of
	the water.

	The cage SCRAPES across the deck and SLAMS into the gunwale,
	toppling off the barge and

	INTO THE RIVER.

	Grant and the Kirbys are still inside.


107	EXT. THE RIVER - UNDERWATER - NIGHT				107

	The cage sinks. The closest to the door, Paul manages to get out.

	The other three aren't as lucky. The cage rotates as it descends
	and lands on the river bottom with the door side down, trapping
	them inside.

	In the cold murky depths, they pull frantically on the bars.
	Debris and equipment float around them.

	Paul surfaces out of the breath and disoriented. Spinosaurus
	pushes past the boat. If anyone is going to save his family, it
	has to be him.

	And so he dives.

	Pushing with all his might, he manages to tip the heavy
	structure, just enough so Amanda, Eric and Grant can get out.
	Paul himself isn't so lucky.

	Spinosaurus grabs the cage and Paul, throwing both straight up
	out of the water. Paul flies twenty feet away, further from the
	shore.

				AMANDA
		PAUL!

				ERIC
		DAD!

	Spinosaurus is going after the heroic Mr. Kirby, who dives,
	swimming underwater. He's trying to lead it away from his
	family.

				GRANT
			(looking around)
		Up! Up!

	He points to a heavy crane assembly, designed for lifting cages
	off the large boats. Now well accustomed to fleeing on
	command, Amanda sends Eric up first, climbing the scaffolding
	like a jungle gym.

	All the while, they're trying to spot Paul.

	Grant is the last to climb, reaching the first section as
	Spinosaurus returns from the water, SLAMMING into the base of
	the crane. The whole assembly SHUDDERS, threatening to rip into
	the water.

				ERIC
		Where's Dad?

				AMANDA
		Just hold on.

	Try as it might, the beast can't climb the crane. So instead it
	RAMS it, SHAKES it, trying to knock them off. Eric slips, but
	Amanda catches him.

	About to shed his bag to climb higher, Grant finds one last
	hope. It's the resonation chamber model. A beat before he
	decides: It may not be the best choice, but it's the only choice.

	He blows through it, the same EERIE PITCH we heard before. On
	the third try, he's able to approximate the "egg" cry he heard
	the raptors give. He keeps it up, repeating over and over.

	Spinosaurus stops for a beat, confused How this sound could be
	coming from a non-raptor. But then keeps SMASHING.

	We can hear the mounting bolts STRAIN. Soon the whole crane
	will tip.

	But not before a MATCHING CRY is heard in the jungle. Grant
	stops, not certain he heard it. But there it is AGAIN.

	He keeps blowing.

	The crane is close to tipping when a single RAPTOR appears
	from the darkness, CHIRP-BARKING at the Spinosaur, who simply
	bats away.

	But then MORE RAPTORS come. And even MORE. Soon there are
	dozens gathering, circling.

	Grant stops signaling. All three survivors watch with
	horrified fascination, knowing their fate is perilous no matter
	which side wins.

	Looking at his adversaries, Spinosaurus ROARS. And suddenly
	the raptors attack.

	Spinosaurus easily handles the first few, but like ants they
	just keep coming. They climb up his back, slicing, into him with
	their razor-sharp claws.

				GRANT
		Jump! Swim for the far shore!

	All three drop from the crane arm into the water.

	Meanwhile, the fight continues. Spinosaurus rallies, shaking
	off many of the raptors, but they just keep coming. Their
	hooked claws dig in, scraping the meat to the bone.

	Spinosaurus puts up a brave fight to the end, but finally
	collapses, dead. The raptors continue to shred it to ribbons.
	Then one of the raptors looks over to see the survivors
	swimming away.

	But a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. It goes back to
	its meal.


107A	EXT. FAR SHORE - NIGHT						107A

	Grant is trying to move them along. still headed downstream.
	But Eric won't budge another foot.

				ERIC
		We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.

				AMANDA
		I know. I know. I want to look for him too.

				ERIC
		then we should...

	She kneels down, facing him. She's just as upset as he is, but
	motherhood carries the burden of remaining calm.

				AMANDA
		Let me tell you a few things about you Dad,
		okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave,
		and he loves you ever very much.

				ERIC
		He loves you too.

				AMANDA
		Okay. He loves us very very much. And I know
		that right now more than anything, your Dad
		would want to know that we're safe. Okay?

	Eric nods.

				AMANDA (CONT'D)
		We're going to get out of this, and
		everything's going to be all right, I promise.

				A VOICE
		Listen to your mother.

	Out of the darkness steps Paul Kirby. Amanda is knocked over
	with surprise. Eric runs to him, nearly tackling him.

				PAUL
		Good thing I've been swimming, huh?

	Amanda hugs him and Eric so tightly they can't breath.


									CROSSFADE TO:


108-109	OMIT								108-109


110	EXT. BEACH - DAY							110

	The foursome sit back on the wide beach, one facing
	each direction, keeping watch. A light rain is falling, but they
	don't seem to notice.

	Trying to keep his boy's spirit up...

				PAUL
		You remember when we went fishing last
		summer? And I was trying to put the boat in
		and the trailer sank? And then the tow truck
		came and tried to pull it out, but it got
		dragged in? And the truck driver threatened
		to knock your Dad's lights out? So I said I
		was the governor and he believed me?

	Eric really smiles, remembering the day.

				ERIC
		Yeah.

	Amanda is smiling too. She had completely forgotten the
	incident.

				PAUL
		That was a fun day.

	To Paul, after some consideration....

				AMANDA
		We should try fishing again.

				PAUL
		You mean it?

				AMANDA
		I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows?
		Things might turn out differently.

	Her hand takes his, gently brushing off the wet sand, fingertips
	touching. It's a small thing, but it's a start.

	Sensing his cue to leave, Grant gets up and starts walking down
	the beach. Eric hurries to follow him. He speaks
	conspiratorially, not wanting to alarm his parents.

				ERIC
		The lady you called, how do you know she can
		help us?

				GRANT
		She's the one person I could always count on.
		And she's saved me more times than she
		realizes. I owe her everything.

	A long beat as they walk.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		It's strikes me now I never told her that.

				ERIC
		You should.

				GRANT
		You're right.

	As they keep walking, Grant notices something rammed against
	the rocks ahead. It's a speedboat, its hull ripped open from the
	impact.

	And it's not just any boat either -- it's the same Dino-Soar
	boat that was pulling the parasail. Eric hasnt seen it yet, so
	Grant stops him.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Eric, do you know what happened to the boat?
		that brought you here? Why did it crash?

				ERIC
		No. I couldn't see.

				GRANT
		Do me a favor. Go back to your parents for a
		minute, would you?
			(pre-empting objections)
		They look worried.

	Eric nods and heads back to Paul and Amanda. Grant forges on,
	approaching the speedboat wreckage. He doesn't know what he'll
	find, but he needs to look.

	Almost reaching his parents, Eric stops. Looks out over the
	ocean, where he sees

	TWO LIGHTS.

	He doesn't say anything for a moment, trying to make sure
	they're real. They are. And they're coming closer.

				ERIC
			(excited)
		Mom! Dad!

	They look up to see the distant lights, just now making out
	full forms...

				PAUL
		Helicopters. Helicopters!

	He SHOUTS with joy. Paul, Amanda and Eric wave their arms,
	making as much motion as possible. The helicopters -- big
	military choppers -- change direction, heading straight for
	them.

	Paul and Amanda embrace, then kiss, the moment getting the best
	of them

	AT THE SPEEDBOAT

	Grant looks in, prepared to see anything in the wreckage. But
	the cabin is surprisingly intact, just a little blood. There are
	three gashes on the driver's seat back. Grant measures their
	spacing with his fingers.

				ERIC
			(yelling over)
		Dr. Grant! Helicopters are coming!

	Grant looks down to the wet sand around him, finding a trail of
	three-toed tracks.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		We're safe!

				GRANT
			(to himself)
		No we're not.

	THE FIRST CHOPPER.

	flies right overhead. Paul and Amanda are confused, until the
	second helicopter starts to land -- the first on is there to 
	cover them.

	Grant YELLS at the first chopper, trying to wave it away. But
	the noise of the blades is DEAFENDING.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		NO! STAY BACK! THEY'RE IN THE TREES!

	At the treeline, the upper branches are shaking. At first, it
	looks like it's just the wind off the chopper, but
	something more is happening.
	
	A PTERANODON

	flies up out of the trees, the first of twenty. It's a gorgeous
	and terrifying sight.


110A	INT. FIRST CHOPPER - DAWN					110A

	Terrified, the Costa Rican CHOPPER PILOT veers away, but the
	pteranodons are already on him. They SMASH at the windows,
	grabbing on the skids, The chopper rolls wildly.

	One over-eager pteranodon sticks his head up to high, getting
	decapitated by the blade.


110B	EXT. BEACH - DAWN							110B

	As the second chopper touches down on the beach, Eric, Amanda
	and Paul load in. Grant is running their way.


110C	EXT. BY THE TREES - DAWN						110C

	Meanwhile, the first copper is losing the battle even as it
	climbs higher. The helicopter suddenly tips, falling, SMASHING
	into the trees with a massive fireball.


110D	INT. SECOND CHOPPER - DAWN					110D

	Seeing the explosion, the SECOND CHOPPER PILOT takes off. Eric,
	Amanda and Paul are on board, but Grant is still running up.
	The helicopter passes right over him.

				AMANDA
			(to the pilot)
		You have to go back! We can't leave him!

	Seeing a ladder release by the door, Paul throws the lever. A cord-
	and-steel-ladder unfurls, dragging across the sand.


110E	EXT. THE BEACH - DAWN					   110E

	Grant chases after us, catching a rung just as it goes over the
	water. Behind him, pteranodons are circling the wreckage of
	the first chopper and starting to go after the second.

	Buffeted by the wind, Grant climbs the ladder up towards the
	chopper. A pteranodon flies up right behind him, trying to
	bite. It catches Grant's shoulder.

	Grant spins to the far side of the ladder. The pteranodon goes
	to bite him again, but finds it head caught between the rungs.
	As it tries to free itself, it just gets more entangled.

	The entire ladder starts to lift, caught by the updraft from the
	creatures wings.


110F	INT. SECOND CHOPPER - DAWN					110F

	Up with the pilot, Amanda sees the other pteranodons are headed
	back to the island, unable to keep up.

				AMANDA
		They're not following.

	In back, Paul and Eric get the ladder mechanism to begin to
	retract. It reels Grant in faster. It also reels in the
	pteranodon, which may be caught, but is still plenty dangerous.

	As Grant reaches the cabin, they shut off the ladder engine.
	The pteranodon is still working its way free, pulling itself closer
	and closer.

				GRANT
			(shouting over the noise)
		We have to cut it! Find something sharp!

	Everyone checking the cabin for a knife, anything sharp.

	Finally, Eric hands Grant the raptor claw.

	Grant uses it to rip the line. The fibers break and fray, but
	the pteranodon keeps coming closer.

	Paul throws a wrench at the pteranodon, WHACKING it straight
	in the head. It felt good, and damn if it didn't slow it down a
	little.

	Grant has cut through the cord. He started on the second when
	the pteranodon SNAPS at him, going for his hand. There's
	nowhere for Grant to cut without the pteranodon getting him.

	And idea, Grant very deliberately places in his hand on the line,
	pulling away at the last moment. The pteranodon itself bites
	through the line.


110G	EXT. OCEAN - DAWN							110G

	The pteranodon falls away from the helicopter, catching wind
	just before it hits the water.

	It circles and flies back to Isla Sorna.

	As horrifying as the creature was a moment ago, it's suddenly
	beautiful again. Each motion of its giant wings is a small
	symphony.


110H	INT. COPPER / FLYING - DAWN					110H

	Sitting between his parents, Eric looks back at the island in
	the distance.

				ERIC
		What do you think is going to happen with the
		dinosaurs?

				GRANT
		The population will Stabilize eventually.
		They'll adapt to fit different roles.

	ON PAUL AND AMANDA

				PAUL
		Either that, or the government will firebomb
		it back to the Stone Age.

				AMANDA
		I would completely support that.

	ON ERIC AND GRANT

	looking back at the island.

				ERIC
		I hope they don't. I want to come back
		someday.

	And Dr. Grant realizes...

				GRANT
		So do I.

EXT. OCEAN  DAWN
The helicopter flies away across the ocean, leaving the island behind.

1 	EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN  DAY	1

	A speedboat cuts swiftly through the ocean swells beneath the
	looming cliffs of ISLA SORNA.


2 	EXT. BOAT - DAY 							2

	Illegal Costa Rican parasail operator ENRIQUE CARDOSO helps
	Americans BEN HILDEBRAND and twelve-year-old ERIC KIRVY --
	already wearing life-vests -- strap themselves into a two-
	person PARASAIL HARNESS.


3 	EXT. BOAT - DAY 							3

	Ben and Eric clamber onto a makeshift PLATFORM that hangs over
	the back of the board. Dangling from Ben's neck is a CAMCORDER.

				BEN
		You make sure to get us as close as you can,
		okay? If it's a good trip, I'll give you a 
		little extra. 

				ENRIQUE
		Don't worry. I take you close. But not too 
		close.
			(rubbing Eric's head)
		You don't want them to eat you.

	Enrique heads toward the driver's seat and a large SECOND-HAND
	WINCH bolted to the deck.

				ENRIQUE (CONT'D)
		Ready, amigos?

	Ben and Eric nod excitedly and give the thumbs up. Ben lifts the
	camcorder to the record the action.

	Enrique jams the down the throttle down, and with a loud RAOR, the
	speedboat shoots forward. Soon the boat is whipping across the 
	rolling ocean.

	Strapped together, Ben and Eric lean back over the passing
	water, intently watching for Enrique's signal.

	As the boat picks up speed, Enrique eyes the speedometer.

	Ben grabs the end of the RIPCORD attached to the harness. He and
	Eric braces themselves.

	Enrique finally signals with a pulling motion. He pulls
	the winch, Ben yanks the cord and - 

	WOOOSH! A brightly colored PARASAIL blossoms behind the boat,
	hoisting Ben and Eric aloft. In a big BLOCK LETTERS on the
	parasail is stitched "DINO-SOAR."

	THE TOWNLINE unsold rapidly from its enormous reel.

	BEN AND ERIC climb higher and higher.

	ENRIQUE keeps an eye on the clients. When they reach a certain 
	height, he LOCKS OFF the reel.

	High overhead, Ben and Eric are floating in wonderful, quiet
	splendor. The motor of the boat now sounds strangely distant.

	Down below, the boat enters a think blanket of FOG.

	Eric points excitedly at the islands as Ben films him with the
	camera.

	Then, a sudden TUG on the thing line cause Ben to drop the camera,
	which now dangles from his neck.

				ERIC
		What was that?

	A second tug...and now the faintest of screams.

	Ben and Eric look down to find that the boat has disappeared
	into the low bank of FOG.

	By the time the boat emerges on the far side of the mist...THEIR
	IS NO SIGN OF ENRIQUE. The deck is splattered with blood.

	As Ben considers the driverless boat...

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Ben!

	Ben glances over at Eric, staring in horror at something 
	below. Following his gaze, Ben finds that their boat is only
	moments away from crashing into A LARGE REEF.

	Sticking out of the water, the imposing reef is being battered
	by waves.

	AS THE BOAT SMASHES INTO THE REEF, it splinters into a
	number of pieces.

	A panicked Ben turns to Eric.

				BEN
		Unclip your line!

	Eric and Ben frantically unclip their lines. Catching an
	updraft, the parasailers float upward.

	A strong wind sends them wafting over the daunting cliffs
	of ISLA SORNA...


4 	EXT. SUBURBAN BACKYARD - DAY 					4

	TWO PLASTIC DINOSAURS enter the frame and do battle accompanied
	by a child's ferocious sounds.

				CHILD (O.S.)

		RRRRROW! GRRRRRR!

	WINDER TO REVEAL -

	CHARLIE, a three-year old boy, plays in a sandbox with his
	favorite toy dinosaurs. ALAN GRANT squats next to him and
	watches with great delight.

	ELLIE SATLER stands over them, an INFANT in her arms -- a
	picture of the perfect family.

				GRANT
		Oh, actually, Charlie, those two are
		herbivores. They wouldn't be interested in
		fighting each other. But these...
			(picking up two other dinosaurs)
		See, these are carnivores. And this one here
		-- see its claws -- this one here uses its
		claws to gouge at the throat of its opponent

	As Grant demonstrates with some GRUNT and GROANS of his
	own, he only succeeds in frightening the boy.

				ELLIE
			(interrupting)
		Uh, Alan?


				GRANT
		Hmm?

				ELLIE
		He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a
		little older?


				GRANT
		Oh, right.
			(back to Charlie)
		Happy dinosaurs.

	He bounces them along the sandbox edge.

	Then, the sound of a CAR ENGINE turning off and a door
	SLAMMING is heard.

				ELLIE
		That must be Mark.
			(calling out)
		Mark, were back here!

	Ellie and Grant turn to see --

MARK DEGLER coming through the gate carrying a briefcase. He's their age, handsome but not annoyingly so, with a friendly,
	balance demeanor.

	He and Ellie kiss tenderly on the lips.

				ELLIE (CONT'D)
		Good day?

				MARK
		Keeping the world safe.
			(re: baby)
		Here, let me take her.

	Ellie hands off the baby.

				ELLIE
		Mark, this is Alan Grant.

				MARK
		Nice to meet you, Alan. I've heard a lot about
		you.

	The two men shake hands, and we now realize it is Grant
	who is the stranger in this household. Little Charlie runs to
	his father, showing his dinosaur.

				CHARLIE
		Daddy, this is a herbabore.

	Grant smiles uncomfortably, a third wheel.


5 	INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT 					5

	WINDEN to a PARROT in a large cage. Grant is teasing 
the bird with a cookie, holding a it just out of reach.

				GRANT
		What's my name? Come on, Jack, say it. Is my
		name Alan? Say my name.

		The bird doesn't respond.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		He used to know me.

				ELLIE
		Sorry, Alan it's been six years.

	Grant shrugs, gives Jack the cookie, and heads towards the table.
	The three adults are finishing their dessert and coffee. The
	The children have been out to bed.

	An awkward moment of silence. Uncomfortable smiles. Then --

				MARK
		More coffee?

				ELLIE
			(relived)
		Yes. Great.

	Mark stands and collects their cups.

				ELLIE (CONT'D)
		So, Mark's working at the State Department
		now.

				GRANT
		Really? 
(To Mark)
What do you do there?

				MARK
			(with mock bravado)
		I could tell you about it, but than I'd have to
		kill you.

				GRANT
		Indeed.

	Mark smiles, nodding. Then he goes into the kitchen. Another
	uncomfortable silence.

				ELLIE
	So what are you working on now?

				GRANT

	We have a new site in Montana. At least until
	the money runs out.

				ELLIE
		Anything good?

				GRANT
		Raptors, mostly.

				ELLIE
		My favorite.

	Grant leans forward, realizing Ellie's one of the few people he
	can talk to about this.

				GRANT
		You remember the sounds they made?

				ELLIE
		I try not to.

				GRANT
		We've done cranial scans, and raptors
		actually had a quite sophisticated
		resonating chamber. I have a theory that
		their ability to vocalize is the key to their
		social intelligence. The way they can work
		together as a team.

				ELLIE
		You think they could talk to each other?

				GRANT
		To a degree we never imagined.

	And from the cage in the corner of the room...

				JACK
		Bullshit!

	Both look back at the parrot. ELLIE smiles.

				ELLIE
		You taught him that.


6 	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT 					6

	Ellie and Grant head toward the rental car parked in the
	driveway.

				ELLIE
		Good luck with the fund raising.

				GRANT
		It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park,
		you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils
		are out. Everyone wants to see a real live
		dinosaur.

				ELLIE
		Times change Alan. But you're the still the
		best. I mean that.

				GRANT
		The last of my breed.

	A long moment passes between them as both consider where
	they've ended up.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		I'd better get going.

				ELLIE
		Let me know if I can help, Alan. Youre bad
		about asking for help, but please ask me.
		Anything, anytime.

				GRANT
			(deep down knowing he never
			 will)
		Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.

				ELLIE
		Goodbye, Alan.

	Not sure what the right thing to do is, they finally end up with
	a friendly hug. They keep it short.

	Grant gets in his car. Starts the ENGINE.

	He's about to pull off when Ellie knocks on the window. He rolls
	it down.

				ELLIE (CONT'D)
		When I met you, I thought that one day
		millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs
		became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me
		otherwise. When conditions changed,
		dinosaurs changed. They became other things.
		They evolved.

				GRANT
		A well-accepted theory.

				ELLIE
			(simply)
		Alan don't be afraid to evolve.

	Grant hears her, but Ellie knows it didn't really get through.
	A forced half-smile, than Grant waves goodbye.

	Ellie watches as he drives off.


7 	INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY 						7

	The last stop on Grant's fund-raising tour, it's a public
	lecture hosted by some foundation. There are SCIENTISTS and
	STUDENTS here, but also a lot of DINO-FANS, some even with
	costumes.

	Grant finishes his speech to what was a full house -- some
	ATTENDEES are grabbing their coats and sneaking out. This
	wasn't the exciting guest speaker they were all expecting.

	A new slide comes up. Just black and white, and indecipherable.

				GRANT
		It's through the painstaking study of the
		Interior chamber in multiple specimens that
		we can determine this exciting correlation
		between the larynx and the upper plate. That
		lets us theorize -- theorize, mind you -- that
		the raptor might have been capable of bird-
		like vocalizations. Which as you can
		imagine, would be a tremendous breakthrough.

	He's finished, but no one seems to notice at first. Then the
	SYMPOSTUM LEADER stands up, leading a smattering round of
	APPLAUSE.

				SYMPOSTIUM LEADER
		Thank you very much Dr. Grant. Now does
		anyone have a question?

	Nearly every hand goes up. Grant doesn't seem surprised.

				GRANT
		Does anyone have a question that doesn't 
		relate to Jurassic Park?

	Quite a few hands go down.

				GRANT (cont'd)
		Or the incident in San Diego, which I'll
		remind you, I did not witness.

	Now most of the hands are down. Picking one of the few
	remaining...

				MALE STUDENT
		Your theory on raptors is good and all, but
		isn't all this conjecture kind of moot?

	The STUDENT'S BUDDY nods in agreement.

				MALE STUDENT (CONT'D)
		I mean, once the U.N. and Costa Rica and
		everyone decides how to handle the second
		island, scientist will just go in and look
		for themselves.

				TOO-CLEVER SCIENCE REPORTER
		Isn't paleontology itself in danger of
		extinction?

	Recognizing those as fighting words, the symposium leader is
	about to step in. But Grant will take this himself.

				GRANT
		No, and let me be perfectly clear on this
		point. Dinosaurs lived 65 million years ago.
		What's left of them is fossilized in stone
		the actual scientists spend years to
		undercover.
								   (MORE)

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		what John Hammond and InGen created are
		theme park monsters. Nothing more, nothing
		less.

		The class clearly disagrees with his assessment.

				ANOTHER STUDENT
		You're saying you wouldn't want to study
		them if you had the chance?

				GRANT
		No force on this earth or in heaven could get me on
		that island.


8 	INT. DERELICT COCKPIT - DAY 					8

	Looking through the cracked windshield of a junkyard plane, we
	see someone spray painting red circles on the outside of the
	glass.


9 	EXT. AIRCRAFT GRAVEYARD - DAY 					9

	NASH, a wry, intelligent mercenary pilot and soldier, is
	painting huge eyes the windows of a wrecked plane. Finished, he
	tosses the paint can through the open windows and walks quickly
	away from the plane.

	We now see that RED TEETH are painted on the craft's nose. It
	looks absurdly like some angry beast.

	We are one the edge of a dry lake bed, part of an aircraft
	graveyard. Wrecked planes lie all around.

	We hear a phone RINGING...


10 	INT. CARGO PLANE - DAY 					       10

	A RINGING satellite phone rests on a stack of gun cases.

	UDESKY, the leader of this crew, answers it. 

				UDESKY
		Udesky.
			(beat)
		Yes sir. we're good to go. I'll lock it down as
		soon as you drop me the payment.

	With the phone still to his ear, Udesky wanders out of the
	craft...


11 	EXT. CARGO PLANE - DAY 					       11

	Udesky looks over at Nash and COOPER, another mercenary.

	Cooper's the quiet muscle of the bunch, a weapons specialist. He
	finishes loading a massive gun, essentially a hand-cannon. It's
	aimed at Nash's grimacing aircraft.

				UDESKY
		That's right, two of the very best I could
		find. No, I haven't worked with them
		personally, but they come with the highest
		recommendations.

	Then --

	Cooper FIRES at the grimacing aircraft. A projectile rockets
	into the plane and EXPLODES with a fireball.

	Nash and Cooper exchange a satisfied smile.

				UDESKY (CONT'D)
		You've got nothing to worry about, sir. This
		is going to be a piece of cake.

	Pieces of the demolished craft come raining down.


12 	EXT. EXCAVATION BASE CAMP, PT. PECK LAKE, MT - DAY 	12

	CLOSE ON a man's hand, carefully scraping the stone away from a
	dinosaur fossil. We follow his hand back as he wipes off his
	sweaty brow, revealing him to be BILLY BRENNAN, 25, an
	associate professor and site manager. He's a charmer.

	Looking past him, we see CHERYL, 21, a junior at junior of State. She's one
	of a dozen COLLEGE STUDENTS working at the site, and the one
	most smitten with her supervisor.

				CHERYL
		Billy? I don't think I'm doing this right.

	He scoots over, lying down beside her. Checks her work.

				BILLY
		You need to go slowly. See, just take it little
		at a time.

	She's not listening, just watching his eyelashes.

				CHERYL
		I can never tell what's bone and what's rock.

				BILLY
		Technically, it's all rock. The calcium in the
		bones is replaced during fossilization. But
		you can feel the difference. See? Rough,
		smooth. Rough, smooth.

	He runs her bare fingers over the two different patches, showing
	her. After a pause, she runs her finger along his
	stubbly chin...

				CHERYL
		Rough.

	...and along his lips.

				CHERYL (cont'd)
		Smooth.

	Billy may not have started this flirtation, but he's not ending
	it either. It's then that a

	SHADOW

	falls across them. Billy looks up to see...

				BILLY
		Dr. Grant!

	Grant has just returned, a bag over his shoulder.

				GRANT
		Mr. Brennan.

										CUT TO:


12A	EXT. WALKING TO THE MAIN TENTS - DAY 			12A

	Billy takes one of Grant's bags, talking as they go.

				BILLY
		How was your trip? Profitable?

				GRANT
		We'll be broke in four weeks.

				BILLY
		Three weeks. I had to rent some equipment.

	The cross into one of the tents, which only has two "walls". On
	a dust-taped table, a dusty Macintosh is feeing data into a
	strange machine the size of a dorm refrigerator. A mechanical arm sweeps
	back and forth across a tray of fine sand.

				GRANT
		You rented an automated litter box.

				BILLY
		It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan
		data from the raptor skull, than the computer
		breaks it into thousands of slices which this
		thing prints, one layer on top of the other.
		It's the future of paleontology.

				GRANT
		Not if it can't dig.

	The arm stops and suddenly the tray of sand shakes, dropping
	through holes in the bottom to reveal an object the size of 
	a person's fist.

				BILLY
		I give you a raptor's resonating chamber.

	Grant hates technology, but he can't help but be amazed by the
	result. He lifts the strange object up, shaking out the
	remaining sand.

	Billy puts it to his lips and blows through it like a conch shell.
	The resulting SOUND is unique and piercing, the cry of an 
	non-existent animal. Grant is speechless with excitement. And so he
	uses it again and again, producing different SOUNDS and
	variations.

	In the distance, flocks of birds rise to the sky and fly off.

	Billy looks up to see a MAN and a WOMAN getting out of 	
	a Cadillac. Cheryl is pointing them in the direction of the 		
	tent. 									

				BILLY (cont'd) 				
			(falsely casual) 					
		Oh, I forgot to tell you. Some visitors 			
		wanted to come by and talk	to you. I 
told them you'd be happy to see them. 
		maybe even have dinner with them. 						

				GRANT 					
		Absolutely not. 						

				BILLY 						
		They're here. 							

				GRANT 					
		What? 								

	Only now does Grant realize these two people
Who were walking up to them.
Putting on a friendly smile, Billy goes up to them.				

				MAN 						
		Dr. Grant? 							

				GRANT 					
		Yes? 								

				MAN 						
			(extending his hand)					
		Paul Kirby. Kirby Enterprises				 	
			(reaching into his pocket) 	
		My card. 							

	PAUL KIRBY is a talkative optimist with				
	no "off" switch. His wife AMANDA KIRBY, just
as friendly, is harder to read. There seems to be			
	exhaustion behind her eyes. 					

				GRANT 					
		What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby? 				

				PAUL 						
		Well sir, I am a great admirer
of yours, and I have an extremely interesting 
proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife 
and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.					

				GRANT 					
		You know, I've been traveling and I'm very 		
		tired. Maybe some other time. 				

				PAUL
		I guarantee it'll be worth your while.

	Behind Kirby, Bill furtively rubs his thumb and fingers
	together, indicating the guy is loaded.

	Grant musters a weak smile.

				GRANT
		It's be my pleasure.


13 	INT. HELL CREEK BAR AND GRILL, JORDAN, MT - NIGHT 	13

	Theyre only halfway through the entree, but Grant is ready to
	bolt. It's only Billy who's keeping him from being rude. They walk
	over to Paul and Amandas table and sit down.

				PAUL
		First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts,
		Amanda and I have admired your work for
		years.

				AMANDA
		It is truly, whats the word? Inspiring.

				GRANT
		Thank you.

	It's everything Grant can do just to be polite. He desperately
	wants to leave and get back to his dig.

				PAUL
		Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors.
		Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure
		tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2,
		the Nile...

				AMANDA
		We even have two seats reserved aboard the
		first commercial moon flight.

	Billy nudges Grant.

				GRANT
		Hmmm.

				PAUL
		Now, for our wedding anniversary this year
		we wanted to do something really special,
		something...

	He places his hand on his wife's.

				AMANDA
		...once-in-a-lifetime.

				PAUL
		We've arranged for a private airplane to
		take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want
		you to be our guide.

	The Kirby's look to Grant as if they've offered him an amazing
	gift. But Grant just sighs and smooths the tablecloth.

				GRANT
		That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm
		afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can
		refer you to a number of highly qualified...

				PAUL
		No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've
		seen these animals in the flesh. No one else
		has come close to you.

				GRANT
		I'm flattered, but I've taken this little
		adventure tour. And with the air
		restrictions they've imposed after the
		incident in San Diego, you cant fly low
		enough to see anything of interest.

	Paul is momentarily stymied, but Amanda rallies.

				AMANDA
		You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I
		have special permission to fly low.

				BILLY
		How low?

				PAUL
		Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do
		know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone
		else.

				AMANDA
		From what I understand, it's pretty much
		whatever we want.

				GRANT
		That's hard to believe.

				PAUL
		Let's just say that through my business --
		imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've
		made some friends in high places. In this
		case, the Costa Rican government.

				AMANDA
		Dr. Grant, you don't know how important it is
		for us to have you come along. It would make
		all the difference.

	Grant is trying to find another way to say no, when Paul pulls
	out his checkbook.

				PUAL
		And of course, we're prepared to make a
		sizeable contribution to your research here.

	Billy looks at Grant. Don't say no.

				PAUL (cont'd)
		I can write all kinds of numbers on this
		check. Just tell me what exactly it would
		take.

	We HOLD ON a conflicted Dr. Alan Grant.

		  		  CUT TO:

14 	EXT. SKY - DAY 							14

	NNNNNRRRRRRNNNNNRRRRR...

	A SMALL AIRPLANE - a Beechcraft Kingair 200 Turboprop, to be
	exact - cruises through clear blue skies.


15 	INT. PLANE - DAY 							15

	Grant re-settles, trying to get comfortable. Billy is across
	from him, finishing cleaning his camera lenses before putting
	them back in the ragged case.

				GRANT
		Even with what I pay you, you could get a
		better bag.

				BILLY
		No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago
		some buddies and I went hang gliding off
		these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me
		right into the side. BOOM!

				GRANT
		That does sound lucky.

				BILLY
		It was this strap alone that saved my life.
		Got caught on a rock as I was falling.

				GRANT
		Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most
		idiotic.

	Because he hasn't really said it...

				BILLY
		Listen Alan, I really appreciate you
		bringing me along.

				GRANT
		The bones will be there when we get back.
		That's the nice thing about them. They never
		run away.
			(beat)
		And besides, you got me into this. I don't
		intend to be alone with these people.

	ON PAUL AND AMANDA

	sitting near the front of the plane. Paul draws a long, nervous
	breath and looks at Amanda. She seems just as tense.

	Finally finding a comfortable position, Grant puts his hat over
	his eyes, ready to take a nap.

	Done with his camera, Billy turns to someone just off screen.

				BILLY
		So how do you know the Kirby's?

	and we reveal...

	Mercenary Cooper, the weapons specialist we met earlier. He's
	wearing sunglasses so dark you can't tell whether he's staring
	at you or fast asleep.

	He doesn't answer. Did he even hear? And then --

				COOPER
		Through our church.

				BILLY
		What Religion?

				COOPER
		Uhthe one that worships God and believes in being
		Good. 



16 	EXT. SKY - DAY 							16

	The plane continues onward.


17 	INT. PLANE - DAY / HOURS LATER 					17

	Grant slowly wakes in his chair, groggy. All the other
	passengers are fast asleep. Then Grant turns to his right.

	A RAPTOR

	sits besides him. The dinosaur eyes him curiously, then opens
	his mouth...

				RAPTOR
		Alan.

	And than it STRIKES.


18 	INT. PLANE - DAY 					       		18

	Grant wakes up with a start, disoriented. Billy is leaning over
	him.

				BILLY
	Alan. We're almost there.

	The adrenaline still surging through him, Grant turns and looks

	THROUGH THE WINDOW.

	Clouds obscure the view, than parts reveal

	ISLA SORNA

	rising majestically out of the water.


19 	EXT. SKY - COUNTINUOUS DAY 					19

	We watch the plane descend sharply to the island.


20 	INT. PLANE - COUNTINUOUS DAY 					20

	In various combinations, Grant and Billy, Paul and Amanda look
	out the windows at the amazingly green island.

	Cooper looks out through a window of his own.


21 	INT. COCKPIT - COUNTINUOUS DAY 				21

	Here we find the rest of the crew from the junkyard. Nash is
	piloting.

	A VOICE comes over their radio headsets.

				RADIO VOICE
			(Spanish accent)
		Unidentified aircraft approaching Isla
		Sorna, this is San Juan approach. You are
		flying in restricted airspace. Immediately
		turn to the coordinates two-zero-zero. I repeat
		redirect to...

	A look from Nash then Udesky switches off the radio.


22 	EXT. PLANE - COUNTINUOUS DAY 				       22

	The plane now descends to a mere hundred feet above the
	treetops.


23 	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS DAY 				       23

	Paul puts his hand atop Amanda's as they stare intently out the
	window.

	Billy looks to Grant.

				BILLY

		Admit it. You're excited.

	Grant will admit nothing.

	Calling back from the cockpit...

				UDESKY
		Cooper! Yell up if you see anything!

				COOPER
			(yelling back)
		No, I thought I'd keep it to myself.

	Suddenly Grant spots...

				GRANT
		There. There! An Apatosaur. Look at the
		coloration.

EXT. ISLA SORNA  GRASSY FIELD  CONTINUOUS DAY

	An Apatosaur is grazing on the grass.

INT.  PLANE  CONTINUOUS DAY

				BILLY
			(amazed)
		I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see
		skin.

				GRANT
		Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right
		you can see...

	But Paul just waves him away with a hand, staring intently out
	his window. We HOLD ON Grant a moment, thinking that odd.


24 	INT. COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS DAY 				       24

	Udesky puts down his binoculars.

				UDESKY
		South shore is clear. The rest is rock.

				NASH
		Are we on?

				UDESKY
		We're on.


25 	INT. MAIN CABIN - CONTINUOUS DAY  			       25

	Looking out the window, Grant notices they're flying awfully
	low. Just then, he hears a MECHANICAL HUM and a LOW RUSH from
	outside. Now wanting to believe --

				GRANT
		That's not the landing gear?

	Paul, Amanda and Cooper don't respond.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		What you're...
			(realizing)
		You can't land.

	Paul turns back to him.

				PAUL
		Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll
		explain this all in a jiffy.

				GRANT
		This plane can not land!

				AMANDA
		It's going to be all right. Just...

	Grant is out of his seat, heading for the cockpit. He'll wrestle
	the controls if he has to.

	Cooper grabs him, pulling him back. Grant starts to struggle,
	but he's certainly no match. A well-practiced fist hits him
	dead on.

	CUT TO BLACK.


26 	OVER THE DARKNESS 						26

	we hear Amanda's voice, strangely distant but amplified.

				AMANDA
		Eric! Eric! Are you there honey? Ben!
		Erriccc!

	Her calls continue as we FADE UP to...


27 	INT. PLANE - DAY 							27

	GRANT'S P.O.V. -- blurry and disorientated. He finds himself lying
	on the floor of the plane.

	Seeing him come to, Billy helps him slowly get up. Grant's head
	is pounding.

				GRANT
		Tell me we didn't land.

	By his expression, we see Billy would have to lie.

				BILLY
		I think they're looking for someone.


28 	EXT. LANDING STRIP, ISLA SORNA - DAY 			       28

	The jungle has almost reclaimed this patchy vine-covered
	runway. The airplane is parked at one end.

	Nash, Udesky, and Cooper are checking their weapons.

	Amanda is at the edge of the tarmac calling into the jungle on a
	BULLHORN.

	Billy and a groggy Grant emerge from the airplane. Paul trots
	over.

				PAUL
		Dr. Grant, are you alright? I'm sorry we
		had to be so...

	The three mercenaries are now walking into the jungle with
	their guns.

				GRANT
		What the hell is going on? What are they
		doing?

				PAUL
		Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe.
		These guys are really good. One of them was a
		Green...

				GRANT
		Mr. Kirby, trust me, on this island, there is
		no such thing as safe. We have to get back in
		this plane...

	Grant looks to Amanda, who shouts through a bull horn.

				AMANDA
			(on-bullhorn)
		ERRR-IIIC!

				GRANT
		And tell your wife to stop making so
		much noise! We're food to these damn 
animals.

				PAUL
			(yelling)
		Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad
		idea!

				AMANDA
			(on the bullhorn)
		What?

				PAUL
			(pointing broadly at Alan)
		He says it's a bad idea!

				AMANDA
			(on the bullhorn)
		What's a bad idea?

	As in on cue, there is a DEAFENING ROAR from the jungle.

	Everyone turns toward the sound and freezes.

				PAUL
			(to Alan)
		What was that?

	Grant doesn't answer, still listening to the reverberations. 
Then a couple shots are heard.

				BILLY
			(low)
		Is it a rex?

				GRANT
		I don't think so.

	Billy and Paul breathe a small sign of relief.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Sounds bigger.

	Nash and Udesky come RUNNING out of the jungle, headed for
	the plane.

				UDESKY
		We gotta go, now!

				PAUL
		What's the problem? Can't you guys...?

	As Udesky and Nash sprint past Paul in interrupted by a
	second, closer, DEAFENING ROAR. He pales.


29 	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 				       29

	Udesky waits by the door, hustling everyone inside. Nash
	hurries into the cockpit. Everyone scrambles to a seat. Amanda
	climbs next to Paul.

				AMANDA
		We can't just...

				PAUL
		Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and
		come back.

	Udesky closes the door.

				BILLY
		What about the other guy?

				UDESKY
		Coop's a professional. He can handle himself.

	A blood-curdling SCREAM echoes through the jungle followed by
	MACHINE GUN FIRE.

				NASH
			(yelling back)
		We're going!

	Udesky climbs into the copilot's seat, and Nash revs the engine.


30	EXT. RUNAWAY - DAY						30

	The plane starts down the runway.


31	INT. PLANE - DAY							31

	The passengers bounce in their seats as the plane picks up
	speed down the overgrown strip.


32	EXT. RUNWAY - DAY							32

	Suddenly, two hundred yards ahead of the plane,

	COOPER

	emerges from the jungle. He stands in the middle of the runway.
	waving one arm wildly. His second, badly injured arm hangs
	limp by his side.

				COOPER
		Come on, Nash. Slow down, buddy.


33	INT. THE COCKPIT - DAY					       33

	Nash spots Cooper, shoots a glance at the airspeed indicator.

				NASH
		Coop, you know I can't do it pal.

	He slams down full throttle in an attempt to reach flying speed.

	Seeing that Nash has no intention of stopping, Paul shouts from
	the cabin.

				PAUL
		What are you doing? That's Mr. Cooper!


34	EXT. RUNWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY				34

	We are looking down on Cooper from behind. As the plane
	approaches,

	A SHADOW

	falls over the injured mercenary. Then with brutal speed, an
	ENORMOUS BEAST seizes him in its massive jaws and lifts him
	into the air.

	From this angle we get only a glimpse of a long crocodilian
	snout, powerful clawed forearms and spiny sail rising from the
	creature's back.


35	INT. THE COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS - DAY			       35

	All eyes are on the creature as it devours Cooper. Amanda turns
	away in horror.

				AMANDA
		Oh, my God! Paul, my God!


36	INT. THE COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS - DAY			       36

	Looking through the windshield, we see the creature is directly
	in the path of the plane.

	Nash pulls back on the stick. The plane rises.

	The left propeller clips the flank of the enormous
	dinosaur, SNAPPING the blade.

	Blood sprays the windshield and side windows.


37	EXT. RUNWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY 				37

	The turboprop banks into the jungle, out of control.


38	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 					38

	The passengers are thrown about as the craft CRASHES through
	trees, tearing off a wing and pieces of the tail.

	Finally coming to rest in the jungle canopy, the plane settles
	in the trees.

	SILENCE.

	The passengers slowly recover and have a look around. Foliage
	blocks most windows, making it impossible to see out.

				BILLY
		Is anyone hurt?

	Checking themselves, everyone seems pretty much intact.

	Still thinking of himself as in charge...

				UDESKY
		Quiet! We're okay. Let's everybody just stay
		put.

	He attempts to turn on the cockpit radio, but it's dead.

				NASH
		Who's got the sat-phone?

				PAUL
		Right here!

	Paul hands the bulky phone up to Nash, who dials out.

	Grant unstraps himself, climbs to the back to the side door and shoves.
	The door opens a few inches before hitting a branch.

	He looks out the and lets out a quiet gasp as the ground reels

	THIRTY FEET BELOW.

	He quickly shuts and latches the door.

	CLOSE ON the sat-phone. pressed against Nash's ear.

				RECORDED VOICE
		We're sorry. All circuits are busy. Please
		try your call again later...

				NASH
		Shit!

				PAUL
		What is it? What's the matter?

	Amanda SCREAMS.

	A huge reptilian face appears in the cockpit window. Everyone
	else SCREAMS now.
	
	The plane LURCHES - and we hear a deep GROWL.
	
	The passengers hold tight, paralyzed. Nash buckles himself into
	his seat.

	Suddenly, the plane is YANKED from the side to side. Battered this
	way and that, the terrified passengers tightly grip their 
	seats.
	
	Finally, the horrible sounds of WRENCHING METAL as the nose of
	the plane is RIPPED RIGHT OFF.

	Nash and Udesky are suddenly sitting in open air. The nose of
	the plane is tilting downwards, the jungle floor far below.

	The passengers hang almost vertically in their seats,

	Debris tumbles out the open end of the plane, some of it
	striking Nash in the head.

	Udesky unbuckles his seat belt and climbs back up into the
	cabin. Nash follows.

	Suddenly, a long snout with dagger-like teeth pushes past the
	cockpit seats, opens wide, and

	CLAMPS DOWN

	on Nash's legs.

	The pilot CRIES OUT in agony. The others passengers grab onto
	his arms, trying to pull him back. But it's no use. The dinosaur
	rips Nash out of their grasp and down the aisle.

	Nash desperately grabs on to the seat cushion, then watches in
	horror as the fabric RIPS AWAY. He's pulled out of the plane and 
	dropped to the ground. A giant foot steps in the way as the snout
	of the creature reaches down and quickly devourers the screaming
pilot.

	It's horrifying sight, but no one can turn away.

	Pleased with the appetizer, the creature comes back for the
	main course.

	Grant tries to force open the jammed rear door. Billy tries to
	help, but the door won't budge.

	The dinosaur JAMS its snout into the fuselage and lunges for
	Amanda in the first row. She yanks her legs back as the jaws
	SNAP SHUT.

	Behind Amanda, Billy reaches forward, UNSNAPS her seat belt
	and pulls her into the next row back.

	The others unstrap their belts and crowd into the rear of the
	passenger compartment.

	The shift in weight sends the fuselage tipping backwards.


39	EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOUS - DAY				       39

 	The plane breaks free of the tree limbs and DROPS tail-first to
	the jungle floor.

	It SLAMS hard, then flips over onto its roof.


40	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY				       40

	The passengers are prowled on the ceiling of the plane, dazed
	by the impact. Everyone is cut and bruised.

	Out of the open cockpit, they see two approaching dino feet.

	A window near Amanda fogs over with condensation. when it
	clears, she finds herself looking right into enormous eyes.

	Then all hell breaks loose as the plane is SLAMMED across the
	jungle clearing.

	The passengers are hammered against the walls of the plane,
	tumbling like socks in a dryer. Debris, seats and luggage fly
	everywhere.


41	EXT. JUNGLE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY			41

	The plane comes to an abrupt halt as it SMASHES into a tree.

	A gargantuan FOOT steps on the fuselage and FLATTENS it like a 
	paper tube.


42	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY					42

	Inside, windows EXPLODE, raining glass over the passengers. As
	the walls compress, Udesky becomes trapped in the rear of the 
	plane, the others in front.

				BILLY
		Over here!

	Udesky dives into the narrowing gap, and Billy pulls him the
	rest of the way through.

	Billy is as terrified as the rest of them, but he thrives under
	this rush of adrenaline.
	
	Then a huge CLAW digs into the skin of the fuselage and begins
	to slowly PEEL the plane open. Grant looks up in dread at the
	widening tear.

				GRANT
		This way!

	Grant leads the group out the open end of the cockpit. They
	make a mad dash for the jungle.

	A tremendous ROAR causes Billy to look behind him. He can't
	help but steal a glimpse of this terrifying, but utterly
	fascinating, animal.

	Grant yanks him forward.


43	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY						       43

	With Grant in the lead, and Udesky taking up the rear, the group
	tears through the jungle.

	Concealed by the dense undergrowth, the unseen dinosaur bears
	down on them -- mowing down the young trees which TOPPLE all
	around them.

	Grant spots a grove of

	HEAVIER TREES

	and leads the group into it.

	The dinosaur cannot fit between the trunks. It ROARS at
	the fleeing humans, searching desperately for a route after
	them.

	The group continues their relentless pace, putting as much 
	distance as they can between themselves and the beast. Paul
	Kirby looks like he's about to have a heart attack. Even Billy
	is gasping for air.

	They stop, thinking they've outrun it.

	Grant directs the group through some underbrush and into --


44	EXT. CLEARING - CONTINUOUS - DAY				44

	Our friends stop dead in their tracks. Amanda stifles a cry.

	Before them lies an immense unmoving SAUROPOD.

				GRANT
		Don't worry. It's dead.

	Then a full-grown bull

	TYRANNOSAURUS

	rises up behind the carcass. It was feeding, its mouth mottled
	with blood and carrion.

	Grant FREEZES.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Nobody move a muscle.

	Remember: the T-Rex tracks motion.

	Obeying, the group FREEZES for a few long beats. Then Udesky
	takes off running.

	And T-Rex ROARS.

	Everyone runs. T-Rex is right behind them.


45	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							45

	Dashing back the way they came, the group suddenly comes face
	to face with --

	THE FIRST MONSTER.

	We now get our first full unobstructed view of the gigantic
	creature, SPINOSAURUS AEGYPTICUS. Over forty feet long and
	twenty-five feet high, the dinosaur has a bony sail along its
	back. Its head is crocodilian with rows of long, curving teeth.
	Sinewy six foot arms terminate in three fingers hands with
	fourteen inch claws.

	Nowhere else to run, the group scatters into the brush as the
	two behemoth predators rush forward, their ROARS thunderous.

	Paul and Amanda scramble into one direction, Billy and Udesky in
	the other. But Grant can't go anywhere - his foot is stuck 
	between two branches.

	He manages to free himself as the two dinosaurs approach.
	They'll have to deal with each other before eating the humans.

	Grant dives down between two fallen trees as the Spinosaurus and T-
	Rex circle one another like gladiators, each searching for the
	other's weakness.

	Laying flat on his back, Grant lets out a terrified GASP as the
	giant foot of Spinosaurus lands across the two trunks mere
	inches from his face.

	Spinosaurus lunges forward, powerful jaw open wide.

	T-Rex sidesteps the assault, its tail knocking down small
	trees as it spins out of the way.

	In the tress, Paul and Amanda scurry again for cover.

	Between the fallen trunks, Grant attempts to get away on his
	hands and knees.

	T-Rex presses the attack, slamming its tail into the flank of
	its adversary. Spinosaurus is knocked back, and Grant is again
	forced to duck for cover.

	As Spinosaurus struggles to regain its balance, T-Rex dives
	forward. Spinosaurus is driven backwards as T-Rex tries to
	grip its throat.

	Amanda yanks Paul out of their path. They Scramble over to
	Billy.

	Now on its side, Spinosaurus fights back ferociously. It slashes
	at T-Rex with its long arms and razor sharp claws, then finally
	kicks the animal with one mammoth foot.

	Tyrannosaurus staggers back, wounded.

	Down below, Grant is splashed by the blood pouring from the
	dinosaur, as he slowly makes his way towards his fellow humans.

	Spinosaurus lunges for the T-rex with gaping jaws and manages to
	topple T-Rex off its feet and sends the falling dinosaur to the
	ground.

	With an earth-shuttering CRASH, the dinosaur lands between
	Grant and the rest of the group.

	The companions scurry out of the way, but as they do so, the
	head of the T-Rex now lands almost directly on top of them.

	Plastered against an immense tree, the group watches in horror
	as T-Rex starts to rise but is thrown back down as Spinosaurus
	latches onto its throat.

	Spinosaurus crushes the life out of its adversary, and T-Rex
	opens and closes its jaw a mere inches from our terrified 
	friends.

	Finally, Grant reaches the others.

				GRANT
		Come on!

	Spinosaurus lets out a victorious HOWL, and the blood-drenched
	professor leads the group through the undergrowth.


46	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							46

	Winded from running, Paul is caught off-guard as a furious
	Grant slams his back against a tree. Only one thing he wants to
	know --

				GRANT
		Why did you bring us here?

	Paul is too startled to speak. Udesky tires to step in, but
	Grant gives him back a look.

				AMANDA
		Our son is on this island. We need your help
		to find him.

	Still crunched against the tree, Paul pulls out a photo from his
	shirt pocket.

				PAUL
		This is him. Eric. Hes thirteen now. He's
		just about the greatest kid in the world.

	Letting go of Paul, Grant takes the photo, a Sears-style
	portrait of the boy we saw Parasailing at the beginning. He
	shakes his head, disbelieving. He hands the photo to Billy.

	The group splits into two sides -- Paul and Amanda, Grant and
	Billy -- with Udesky stuck between. Dialogue overlaps in
	places.

				AMANDA
		He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.

				BILLY
		Who's that?

				PAUL
		Her new boyfriend.

				AMANDA
		A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted
		to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben
		found a guy who would take them parasailing.
		They never came back.

				PAUL
		We called everyone, did everything we could.
		Because of all the controversy over this
		island, no one will step in. Costa Rica says
		it's a no-fly zone, it's their own damn fault.
		Guys at the U.S Embassy -- our U.S. Embassy --
		said we should "accept the inevitable." You
		believe that?

				GRANT
		So you hired these mercenaries.

				UDESKY
		We prefer "recovery specialists." We do
		overseas custody issues and...

				GRANT
			(interrupting)
		Then you duped us into coming here.

				PAUL
		We needed somebody who knew the lay of the
		land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.

				GRANT
			(disbelieving)
		I have never been on this island!

				PAUL
		Sure you have. You wrote that book...

				BILLY
		That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna.
		The second island.

				PAUL
			(low, to Udesky)
		I didn't know, there were two islands.

				AMANDA
		Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You
		saved those kids.

				GRANT
		A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we
		were better prepared and better armed.
			(finally)
		How many days have they been missing?

	A look between Amanda and Paul.

				PAUL
		Eight weeks.

	Grand and Billy are speechless. It might as well be eight years.

				GRANT
		After what you've seen today, you really
		think your son could be alive?

				AMANDA
		He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much
		about dinosaurs.

	Before anyone else can talk, Grant puts his hand out. He wants
	everyone to shut up while he plans their next move.

				GRANT
		No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we
		can from the plane. Then we head for the
		coast. There may be a boat left, something to
		get us off this island.

				PAUL
		Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.

				GRANT
		You can stick with us, or you can go and look for
		him. Either way you're probably not getting
		out of here alive.

	With that he leaves, A beat later, Billy follows. He has
	genuine sympathy for the Kirby's, but he's logical enough to
	know Grant is right.

	BACK WITH PAUL AND AMANDA

	They look to Udesky.

				PAUL
		What do we do?

	Udesky is clearly at a loss, but for everyone's reassurance he
	tries to mutter some brio.

				UDESKY
		Well, I think we should start searching for your
son. In the direction they're going.

				PAUL
		Excellent.

	They follow after Grant and Billy.


47	EXT. PLANE CRASH SITE						47

	The five survivors search through the wreckage, trying to find
	anything useful. The task is grim. Mindful of Grant's 
	warnings, they move quickly and quietly.

	Udesky picks up a gun out of the swampy water. The barrel is bent
	almost 90 degrees, unless.

	Billy finds his camera, intact.

	Digging a change of clothes out of his suitcase, Paul steps
	around the side of the plane to change. He's in his underwear
	before he notices Amanda is also there changing.

				PAUL
		Sorry.

				AMANDA
		Nothing you haven't seen before.

	A beat. Amanda looks over as they get dressed.

				AMANDA (CONT'D)
		How much weight have you lost?

				PAUL
		Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been
		swimming at the Y.

				AMANDA
		You hate to swim.

				PAUL
		People change.

	A nod to mean, that's the truth.

				PAUL (CONT'D)
		You look good.

				AMANDA
		So do you.

	They make brief eye contact, which Amanda breaks.

	Around the side, Billy is taking photos of a giant footprint the
	dinosaur left in the mud during its attack on the plane. Grant
	looks over.

				GRANT
		How would you classify it?

				BILLY
		Obviously a superpredator.
			(best guess)
		Suchimimus. that snout.

				GRANT
		They never got that big.

				BILLY
		Baryonyx?

				GRANT
		Not with that sail.
			(Billy gives up)
		Spinosaurus Aegypticus.

				BILLY
		I don't remember that on InGen's list.

				GRANT
		That's because it wasn't on their list. Who
		knows what else they were up to?

	Billy looks past Grant to see Paul approaching. He's struggling
	with the straps on his backpack. turning in circles.

	Billy regards him with suspicion.

				BILLY
		So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2,
		did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?

				PAUL
		Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.

				BILLY
		About a thousand feet above it, actually.
			(closer)
		Most mountain-climbers remember how tall
		that mountains were.

	Paul knows he's caught.

				GRANT
		There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?

				PAUL
		There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint
		and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate
		Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The
		"plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces
		accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like 
		that.

				BILLY
		I don't suppose that check you wrote us is
		any good.

				UDESKY
		He paid us half up front. Cash.

				PAUL
		Mortgaged everything we had to do it. Even
		the store. and if we make it off this island
		with my son, I swear, I'll make good on the
		money I owe you. I don't care if it takes me
		the rest of my life.

	Grant and Udesky exchange a dubious glance.

				UDESKY
		However long that is.


48	EXT. JUNGLE PATH - DAY						48

	Amanda, Paul, Billy, Udesky and Grant walk through the jungle.

				AMANDA
		Eric!

				GRANT
		Quiet!

				PAUL
			(loud whisper to Amanda)
		Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous
		territory.

				AMANDA
		Well we should split up or something. We can
		cover twice the area.

				PAUL
		No, Dr. Grant says...

				AMANDA
		Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...

				PAUL
		Well what's the use of hiring an expert if
		your not going to listen to him?

				AMANDA
		Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric.
		Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.

				PAUL
		Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after
		you, don't come crying to me.

				AMANDA
		Oh, don't worry about that.

				PAUL
		What?

				AMANDA
		Nothing.

				PAUL
		What did you say?

				AMANDA
		Nothing.

				PAUL
		What did you say!

				AMANDA
		Just drop it Paul!

	The Kirby's conversation trails off into the jungle. Udesky
	moves up next to Grant and Billy.

				UDESKY
		If they split up, I'm going with you.

	And as they continue forward, Billy spots something in the
	trees ahead.


49	EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY					49

	A parasail chute is caught in the branches of a tree. A yellow
	life vest hangs limply from a branch.

	Paul rushes over, unsnags it, and examines the label.

				PAUL
		Young adult.

				AMANDA
		Eric...

				UDESKY (O.S)
		Hey. Got something here.

	All turn to see Udesky holding up a camcorder encased in a
	waterproof shell.

				AMANDA
		That's Ben's!

	She grabs it from Udesky and pops open the housing. She tries
	the power switch on the camcorder, but the battery's dead.

	Udesky pull out a flashlight from his pack and looks to Amanda.

				UDESKY
		Here, give that to me.

	And as Udesky fiddles with the flashlight, Grant and Billy
	consider the parasail.

				BILLY
		It looks intact.

				GRANT
		We should take it with us to signal any planes.

				UDESKY (O.S)
		I think I've got it.

	Udesky has rigged the wires on the flashlight so that the
	batteries can be used to power the camcorder.

	He brings a live wire to back of the camcorder. A red power
	light comes on.

				AMANDA
		It works!

				UDESKY
		I don't know for how long.

	Udesky swings the tiny screen out and pushes play. The others
	crowd around.

	ON THE SCREEEN

	Eric and Ben play frisbee on the beach.

				PAUL (O.S.)
			(excited)
		That's him. Thats Eric!

				AMANDA (O.S.)
		I filmed this the morning they left.

	Ben catches the frisbee, checks his watch and motions to Eric.

	Eric runs over, and Ben puts his arm around him as they run to
	the camera.

	Paul reacts to this image but holds his tongue.

	THE VIDEO SCREEN -

	The image now CUTS to a shot from aboard Enrique's boat
	speeding towards ISLA SORNA -- the start of the movie. Eric
	points excitedly at the island and smiles at the camera.

	We replay the opening moments of the movie from Ben and Eric's
	perspective, soaring high until...

				ERIC
		Ben!

				BEN
		Unclip the line!

	THE JUNGLE -

	A PAN from face to face of all watching this tape with a
	mixture of hope and nausea.

	ON SCREEN -

	Angle again with Ben's legs in the foreground. Falling fast.

				BEN (CONT'D)
		Hand on! Hang on buddy!

	Now the camera penetrates the jungle canopy and the picture
	and sound become complete chaos: SCREAMS from the both,
	branches BREAKING, flashes of Ben and Eric's frightened faces
	as the camera is buffeted in all directions.

	With a lurch the terrifying descent in finally over, and the
	jungle floor is just ten feet away, swaying back and forth
	beneath Ben and Eric's feet.

				BEN (CONT'D)
		Are you ok, buddy?

	There's GURGLING to his voice. Ben may be more hurt than he's
	letting on.

				ERIC
			(through his sobs)
		I don't know. I think so.

				BEN
		We're okay. It's going to be okay. Here, get
		ready. I'm going to unhook you.

	The sound of PUMPLING is followed by the sight of Eric DROPPING		
	into the frame, landing on the ground rolling. He stands and
	looks back up at Ben.

				ERIC
		I'm all right

				BEN (O.S)
			(weaker)
		We're going to get out of this, pal.

	And on that, the power and picture fade away.

	BACK ON PAUL AND AMANDA - overjoyed.

				PAUL
		See? He's okay. He's alive! Everything's
		going to be all right now.

	Amanda brings a hand to her mouth, silently nodding her head.

	Grant and Billy exchange a dubious look, than begin pulling the
	parasail out of the tree. As they do so, the sail gets caught on
	a branch.

	They pull harder. The branch bends, but the sail won't come
	loose. One last tug and than, SNAP. The branch breaks, the chute
	falls away to reveal

	A SKELETON.

	It swings down directly at Amanda. She SCREAMS.

	Finally, the others are able to pull her away. As they untangle
	the lines, the men are able to get the first view of the remains
	of Ben Hillenbrand, still caught in his harness.

	Amanda's knees buckle. Regaining her balance, she runs off into
	the jungle.

	Paul quickly follows.

				PAUL (CONT'D)
		Amanda!


50	EXT. THICKNESS - DAY						50

	Reeling, Amanda comes to a stop in an area with thick
	undergrowth. It's danger here, very still and quiet.

	She tries to calm herself, but each effort to suppress just
	makes her more emotional. She's surprised as Paul wraps an arm
	around her to comfort her. But she doesn't fight it.

				PAUL
		I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for
		the things I said about him.

				AMANDA
		No, it's...

				PAUL
		I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...

				AMANDA
			(frustrated)
		Its not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out
		here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.

	Saying it aloud, the reality sinks in for both of them

				AMANDA (CONT'D)
		I guess I was hoping that with Ben around,
		there'd be someone to keep him safe.

	Checking in on clients, Udesky stops at the edge of the
	thicket. Something raises the hairs on the back of his neck.

				UDESKY
		Dr. Grant!

	He nods for the others to take a look at this. They head over,
	Grant at the rear.

	As he approaches, Billy is packing up the rest of the chute in a
	backpack. He stops short from what he sees.

	Looking down, we CIRCLE across the jungle floor. Here we find a
	strange, hollowed-out construction made of sod and branches.
	Maybe six feet around.

	Just now noticing the others' stare, Paul looks down into one
	of the bowls at his feet, a half-buried nest. It's filled with
	football-sized eggs, laid in a spiral.

	And this isn't the only nest. Amanda counts twelve in all, laid
	out in an oddly symmetrical pattern.

	The last to arrive, Grant identifies the species in a horrified
	instant.

				GRANT
		Raptors.

And as he says the words, off in the distance, we hear
	the cry of some herbivores, around by the chorus of
	snarls.


							SMASH CUT TO:

51	EXT. FUTHER IN THE FOREST - DAY				51

	The party blasts through the forest, trying to keep up with
	Grant. They haven't even had time to ask --

				AMANDA
			(to Paul)
		Whats a raptor?

	Paul has no idea.

				UDESKY
		They don't look that big. I mean,
		comparatively.

				GRANT
		If we came across one, we might live.

				PAUL
		Well that's good.

				GRANT
		But you never came across just one.

	From the back --

				AMANDA
		Wait! Where's Billy?

	They all stop. The only one not there is --

				Grant
		Billy! Billy!

				AMANDA
			(almost sotto)
		I thought we weren't suppose to yell.

				BILLY (O.S)
		Here!

	He comes in from the left. Excited, he explains to Grant --

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		I got some great pictures of the nest. You
		know this proves raptors raised their young
		in colonies.

	Furious with his student. Grant just keeps moving. There's no
	time to stand around and argue.

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		This speaks to a larger social structure, the
		possibility of Darwinian altruism. It
		changes everything.

	A beat. Trying not to sound presumptuous --

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		We could co-write a paper.

				GRANT
		Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish
		or perish.


52	SCENE PREVIOUSLY OMITTED					52


53	EXT. RIDGE - DAY (HOURS LATER)					53

	Much fatigued, the five now mach upward towards a crest.

	Panting and flushed, they reach the top of the ridge and gaze
	into the distance.

	A jungle valley stretches before them. Not far off in A VAST
	COMPOUND - comprised of several buildings. One building alone
	seems to cover several acres.

	The weary group breathes a sigh of relief.

				PAUL
		I bet there's a very good chance Eric's in
		there. I'd bet my bottom dollar.

	Udesky and Grant share dubious looks and continue down into
	the valley.


54	EXT. INGEN COMPOUND - DAY					54

	The group emerges from the jungles and enters the compound.
	They walk through an overgrown parking lot, littered with
	abandoned vehicles. Some are lying on their side. Others are
	overturned completely.

	They're not going to be driving anywhere.

	A troubled Grant peers through a windshield, partially caved
	in, like some giant head butted the glass. (Think back to Lost 
World)

	And the group finally approaches the front doors of an
	enormous building. As they head up the front steps, we see
	something in the distance behind them:

	CAT-LIKE MOVEMENTS

	on the high ridge. To fast to see what it was. But too ominous
	to dismiss.


55	INT. BUILDING LOBBY - DAY					55

	Our friends now find themselves in a sparse, one quietly
	opulent corporate lobby now in the process of being reclaimed
	by the jungle/ Roots and ivy poke through the floor and walls.

	In the waiting area, the cushions of a sofas and chairs have been
	gnawed at and pulled apart. Dusty coffee mugs and filled
	ashtrays lie on the table. The water has turned brackish in a
	near by cooler.

	Sudden FLAPPING. We look up and see BIRDS nesting in the
	rafters. It is an eerie, haunted place.

				PAUL
			(calling out)
		Eric! Are you here?

				AMANDA
		Eric!

	All listen for a response. Nothing. Paul and Amanda exchange a
	despondent look.

	Sitting on the reception counter is an official-looking
	telephone. Everyone has the same thought, but no one dares.
	Finally -

				AMANDA (CONT'D)
		What the hell.

	Amanda puts the receiver to her ear. Nada.

	With Grant in the lead, they head deeper into the building.

	Unseen by the group, a fleeting SHADOW flits across the lobby's
	dirty windows with terrifying speed.


56	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY						56

	A couple vending machines stand at the one end of this long
	hallway covered with vines.

	Paul notices them and pulls change from his pocket.

				PAUL
		Let's see. I've got about a dollar seventy-
		five. How about you guys?

	Billy SMASHES IN the window of one machine with his boot.
	Picking through the glass, he pulls out some candy bars and
	chips. He checks the expiration date. 	


	CONTINUED:								56

				BILLY
		Thank God for preservatives.

	He tosses the food to the others.

	Paul now turns to his own vending machine and SMASHES it with
	his heal. The glass refuses to break.


57	INT. HATCHING LABORATORY					57

	Grant and Billy push through a set of doors to see
	
	A CAVERNOUS HATCHING FACILITY

	filled with much of the same equipment we recognized from the
	first island, although the sheer size of this place dwarfs any
	of the facilities seen previously.

	As the group walks down the ramp and onto the floor, they begin to
	absorb the incredible array of technology: enormous cryonic
	freezer, their plug pulled years ago; empty incubators; tanks
	of formaldehyde with dinosaur fetuses and body parts.

	Machines with intricate tubing and wing arms stand beside
	conveyer belts cris crossing the room at different levels.

				AMANDA
		This is how you make dinosaurs?

				GRANT
		This is how you play God.

	Billy looks around the lab. He can't help but be impressed.

				BILLY
		Okay if I take pictures?

	Grant nods.

	Billy sets his lucky camera back down on the worktable. Two years
	from now, astute observers of the DVD will not that Billy
	doesn't actually take his camera from the bag; he was carrying
	it because there wasn't any room inside.

	Billy pulls a new roll of film from the bag and zips it shut.

	ACROSS THE LAB

	Amanda is passing a large cylindrical tanks with half-formed
	embryos floating in formaldehyde -- genetic experiments gone
	awry. Finally she reaches

	A GIGANTIC MANIFIED RAPTOR HEAD

	floating in the one tank.

	Something about this specimen catches Amandas attention. She
	bends forward, getting very close to the glass. She peers right
	into the eyes of the nightmarish creature. Then --

	AN ACTUAL RAPTOR

	lunges at her form behind the tank. She SCREAMS.

	Fortunately the raptor can't get between the closely spaced
	tanks. Amanda runs.

				PAUL
		Amanda!

				GRANT
		Back out! Move!

	And as the group races through the lab the Raptors find a
	larger gap between the tanks.


58	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY				58

	Paul leads the way, checking the door for possible escape
	routes or hiding places. Twenty feet behind,

	THE RAPTOR

	rounds a corner, bolting after them. Paul ducks in the closest
	door.

				PAUL
		In here!


59	INT. DINO KENNEL - CONTINUOUS - DAY				59

	The group slams the door behind them and quickly takes in the
	room.

	There are several rows of oversized steel cages, apparently
	used for containing young dinosaurs. Many of the cage doors are
	standing open.

	The group races down a lone aisle. Close behind, the raptor
	BURSTS into the room, ROARS.

	As the Raptor gains ground, Udesky and Billy run into one of the
	open cages, SLAMMING the door behind them.

	Grant, Paul and Amanda duck into another. Before they can
	swing the cage door shut behind them, however, the raptor SLAMS
	into it, driving the door into the cage.

	They are forced back against a chain-like wall, trapped in a
	small triangle space by the advancing door. The angry
	Raptor is now inches away through the cage door.

	Then, suddenly, the raptor looks up. We follow its gaze. The top
	of their triangular enclose is wide open.

	The eager raptor climbs up the chain-like door. Catching the
	tail of an idea, Amanda grabs the door and nods to the others.

				AMANDA
		Push!

	They push hard on the cage door, swinging it and the raptor
	right through the opening of the cage.

	Now the raptor is trapped in a small triangular space, the door
	going right to the ceiling.

	Amanda slides the door's bolt through the chain like wall,
	temporarily trapping the dinosaur.

	The raptor struggles desperately, GRAWLING AND SNARLING, but
	the cage door seems to be holding.

	As everyone rushes back to the door.

	The raptor begins to make a LOW, HAUNTING MOAN.

	As the others head for the door, Grant lingers a step, listening
	to the beast's simple melodic cry. It has the same tones as
	came from the model resonating chamber.

				GRANT
		She's calling for help.


60	EXT. COMPOUND - DAY						60

	The group exits the rear of the lab building and finds itself in
	a large equipment yard. The CALL of the raptor is still audible
	as they head for the tree line.

	Now they moan is ANSWERED from distant jungle quarters.

	The responses quickly MULTIPLY. To the group's dismay, they
	soon find themselves virtually SURROUNDED by raptor CRIES both
	distant and near.

	Grant looks around with amazement. It's vindication of his
	theory on raptor communication, but it couldn't come at a worse
	time.

	Responding to the growls, a herd of grazing HADROSAURS suddenly
	flees across the open space. Then, in the distance behind the
	herd

	A PACK OF RAPTORS

	emerges from the jungles, coming their way.

				GRANT
		Head for the trees!

	From the lab building, the raptor we left imprisoned now BURSTS
	out one of the doors and HOWLS to the pack -- the same cry we
	heard in the lab.

	The raptor pack moves into the hunting formation. One ALPHA-MALE
	RAPTOR. slightly larger than the others, leads the charge up the
	middle.

	Grant risks a looks back. But doesn't stop running.

				GRANT (cont'd)
		THIS WAY!

	In an effort to escape the oncoming raptors, Grant leads the
	group right into the stampeding heard of hadrosaurs.

	Suddenly, all is chaos. Hadrosaurs race past, splitting up the
	group.

	Letting the others get ahead of him, Grant looks back. Much to
	his dismay, the raptors are ignoring the hadrosaurs.

	Indeed, the pack weaves its way through the herd -- the raptors
	only want them.

	In the chaos of the stampede, everyone loses sight of each other.

	Up ahead, Billy trips and falls. As he rolls the strap on his
	camera bag breaks. He doesn't notice it's missing until he's
	already back on his feet and running.

	Amanda and Paul keep close to each other. Further back, Grant
	spots Billy's fallen camera back. He grabs it as he runs past.

	Looking back, Billy sees that Grant now has his back...

				BILLY
		ALAN!

				GRANT
		KEEP GOING!

	They lose sight of each other in the rush.


61-19	OMIT									61-69


69A	EXT. EDGE OF THE JUNGLE - DAY					69A

	As the hadrosaurs WHIP PAST, Paul and Amanda climb up into a
	tree. A raptor leaps at Paul, barely missing his leg.

	Trying to pull Paul up, Amanda nearly loses her balance. This
	time, Paul catchers her.

	Billy climbs up a nearby tree of his own in sight of Paul and Amanda.

	Udesky has nearly reached a tree of his own when he finds
	himself

	HEADED OFF

	by a raptor. He turns to the other way, but finds

	THERE ARE MORE RAPTORS.

	He picks up a fallen branch as these dinosaurs cautiously
	approach. Not more than a few feet away, the leader of the trio
	stops, peering at him.

	Udesky swings hard, but the dinosaurs feints. From behind him,
	another raptor slashes at the back of his legs, severing his
	muscles. Udesky CRIES OUT and drops to the ground.

	IN THE TREETOPS

	Paul, Amanda and Billy can hear him.

				PAUL
		Udesky.

				AMANDA
			(Listening)
		He's this way.

	From here, the thick branches overlap, forming a kind of
	"second floor" above the ground. It's not easy, but you can move
	from branch to branch, tree to tree.

	ON THE FLOOR

	Unable to walk, Udesky attempts to crawl away from the animals.
	The effort clearly causes him great pain. Strangely, the
	raptors suddenly don't seem interested in him anymore.

	Rather, they're "talking" among themselves. Udesky is amazed to
	find him self still alive.

	Suddenly, one of the raptors SLASHES at him again. But it's
	delicately not a mortal blow, just a very painful one. Udesky
	CRIES OUT, louder this time.

	IN THE TREES

	Hearing the new cry, Paul, Amanda and Billy move faster, now
	finally seeing Udesky on the ground. He's face-down, barely
	moving but still MOANING.

	The raptors are gone.

	In the lead, Amanda starts to climb down. But Paul grabs her,
	holds her back.

				PAUL
		It's not safe.

				AMANDA
		We have to help him.

				BILLY
		He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill
		wounded.

				AMANDA
		He's not a kill, he's still alive.

	She breaks from Paul's grip and drops to the ground. She's only
	a foot away from the tree when

	ALL FOUR RAPTORS

	lead out from their hiding places. They almost catch her as
	Billy and Paul pull her back up on the limb

	The raptors stare up at them, angry their plan didn't work.

				PAUL
		They couldnt climb up, so they were trying
		to get us to come down.

				BILLY
		They set a trap
			(amazed)
		They actually set a trap.

	Bored with waiting, the raptors go back to finish off Udesky,
	making a meal out of it. Up in the branches, the survivors are
	horrified and sickened.

	Then, from the deep in the forest, a new RAPTOR CRY. The feasting
	raptors look up, listening, then suddenly run off into the dark
	jungle.

				PAUL
		Where's Grant?


69B	EXT. ELSEWHERE IN THE JUNGLE - DAY				69B

	Climbing higher in a tree, Grant is just feet above a growing
	pack of raptors. He scales one branch, the next, finally
	reaching a perch that the dinosaurs can't jump to.

	LOOKING DOWN

	The entire pack is now standing still, watching him. In the
	center, the Alpha Male lets out a sort of BARK. Responding to the
	cry, the other raptors CALL BACK.

	As terrified as he is, he can't help but be fascinated by their
	communication. Like a hellish bird song, there's a rhythm to it,
	a structure. They're clearly talking about something.

	Under his breath, Grant is able to mimic its patterns.

				GRANT
		What does that mean? What are you saying?

	Of course they can't answer. They just keep using the same
	"phrase."

	Ready to ditch Billy's camera bag in order to climb higher --
	he's had to hold it by the strap -- Grant finds his hand covered
	with a runny slime. He looks down at the camera bag, and that's
	the source. It's oozing out the bottom.

	He unzips the bag to find

	A BROKEN RAPTOR EGG

	inside, the white and green yolk still dripping from the pieces
	of the shell. There's another intact egg beside it.

	This is what the raptors where chasing.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		God damn you, Billy.

	Ever the scientist, Dr. Grant tests a theory even in the face of
	danger: he holds up the intact egg so that the raptors can see it.
	They suddenly go crazy, howling the same phrase but LOUDER.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		It means, "Give us the egg," doesn't it? "We
		want the egg."

	He gently drops the bag to the ground. Although the raptors are
	interested, pulling out the unbroken egg, they're still by no means
	placated. The song may have changed, but they still want Grant
	dead.

	They begin to jump at him, eventually, hopping up on each
	others backs. It's only a matter of time till they reach him.

	Grant moves to climb higher, but sees no branches he can reach.
	And than he hears the low CREAKING. A CRACK. The branch he's
	on is starting to give in.

	He looks down at the face of his enemies, knowing he'll be
	their next meal. And then,

	A SMALL CANISTER

	lands at the base of the trees, immediately SPRAYING out a thick
	cloud of oily fog. It's the first of

	FIVE CANISTERS

	that land in the area, creating a thick cloud. It's not just
	smoke though something far more caustic.

	As it hits the raptors they immediately recoil, those closest
	to the canisters SHRIEKING in pain. Tumbling in the dirt.
	There may be a pheremonal element to the mist as well -- they
	seem panicked, disoriented.

	Pack mentality takes over, and after the first ten raptors take
	off running, so do the rest, some tripping over their feet
	blindly.

	This may be dino-tear gas, but it's not good for humans either.
	Up in the tree, Grant's eyes immediately burn from the vapor
	He squints to see through the fog, where he spots

	A HUMAN SHAPE

	at the edge of the smoke

				VOICE
		Come on! They'll be back!

	Grant half-climbs, half-falls out of the tree, rushing to get
	through the heaviest of the smoke.

	A SMALL DIRTY HAND

	grabs his, pulling him along.


69C	EXT. JUNGLE - LATE DAY						69C

	Eyes swollen from the gas. Grant stumbles, barely able to see as
	the other person pulls him along. It's only now we can identify
	his rescuer as

	ERIC KIRBY,

	the boy he was brought to rescue. A lot has changed in the last
	eight weeks. It's not just dirt and muck -- he's the filthiest
	child you've ever seen -- something primal has come out in him.

	Something wild.


69D	EXT. INGEN COMPOUND - TWILIGHT				69D

	On the far side of the tipped over vehicle, Eric pulls open a
	hatch -- his hiding place. The door opens part way.

	Eric motions for Grant to follow.


69E	INT. INSIDE THE BUNKER - TWILIGHT				69E

	Squeezing in sideways -- it's very tight fit -- Grant finds
	himself in a space no bigger than the inside of a Datsun. lit by
	a small battery-powered lantern. This is where Eric has been
	hiding.

	The minute Grant's inside, Eric goes back to work re-sealing
	the door. This 13-year old boy has become astonishingly
	efficient at staying alive.

				GRANT
		Eric...

	The boy holds up a hand. He listens for a moment. He doesn't
	hear anything outside.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Eric, your parents are both here.

				ERIC
		In Costa Rica?

				GRANT
		On the island.

	Eric truly can't believe it. He hoped to be rescued but...

				ERIC
		They'll never make it. I mean, they can't
		manage when the cable goes out.

				GRANT
		You'd be surprised what people can do when
		they have too.

	Eric studies his guest, finally certain he recognizes him.

				ERIC
		You're Alan Grant, aren't you?
			(off surprised reaction)
		I read both of your books.

				GRANT
		Which one do you prefer?

				ERIC
		The first one. Before you where on the island.
		You liked dinosaurs back then.

				GRANT
		Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me.

	Grant takes a better look around Eric's tiny hideaway,
	impressed with what he's been able to scavenge. Among the many
	items we see another smoke canister, some battery-powered
	lanterns and lots of candy wrappers. This kid's been living on
	chocolate for weeks.

				ERIC
		When InGen cleared out, they left a lot of
		stuff behind.

				GRANT
		Any weapons, radios?

	Eric pulls up a long cattle prod to show Grant.

				ERIC
		Found this, but the battery's dead.

				GRANT
		It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I 
		barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight
		weeks.

	The line catches Eric strangely. It's the first moment of true
	emotion we've seen him in.

				ERIC
		Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.

				GRANT
			(trying to be positive)
		The important thing is we both made it.
		That's something we have in common.

	Eric rips into a candy bar. After a moment, he realizes he
	should offer one to his guest as well.

	Grant takes it. A lone beat. Than, Grant just has to know...

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Did you read Malcolm's book?

				ERIC
		Yeah.

				GRANT
		What did you think?

				ERIC
		I dunno. I mean, it was kind of preachy.
		Chaos-this, chaos-that. And like, to me, the
		guy seemed kind of high on himself.

	Grant smiles.

				GRANT
		That's two things we have in common.


69F	EXT. TREETOPS - NIGHT						69F

	The trio is where we left them, perched up in the branches.
	They're far from safe, but nothing's after them for a
	while.

	In Billy's eyes, we can see a storm of guilt raging. But he
	hasn't said anything. Won't say anything.

				AMANDA
		We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr.
		Grant are out there somewhere.

				PAUL
		I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit
		of good right now. For every scary thing we
		saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times
		more of 'em at night.
			(to Billy)
		Am I right?

				BILLY
		I dont know.

				PAUL
		I thought you were an expert.

				BILLY
		Dr. Grant was.

				AMANDA
		Well Dr. Grant isn't here, so we're going to
		have to figure out what to do ourselves.

	Amanda is impressed by her own determinations. A long beat.

				AMANDA (cont'd)
		So what do we do?

	No one has the faintest clue.


69G	EXT. DEEP IN THE FOREST - NIGHT					69G

	VARIOUS SHOTS; The creatures of Isla Sorna walk past in the
	shadows, some looking up at the light in the trees.

	Suddenly, one of the creatures is attacked by another. We hear
	ROLLING, SNARLING, HISSING, just seeing the outline of the
	fight. Just as fast as it began, the fight is over, the winner
	snakes on the loser.


69H	EXT. TREETOPS - NIGHT (LATER)					69H

	Everyone's moved to different branches, trying to settle in for
	the night. Paul keeps looking over to the tearful Amanda, about
	to say something. He finally does.

				PAUL
		I just want you know, Amanda. It's not
		your fault what happened.

	Amanda looks over, not sure what his absolution.

				PAUL (cont'd)
		Eric has always been headstrong, and you
		throw Ben Hildebrand into the mix and well...

				AMANDA
		Well what?

				PAUL
		Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead.
		What I'm trying to say is, its was just a crazy
		accident. The exact same thing could have
		happened if he was with me. You can't go
		beating yourself up about it.

	Realizing he's trying his best, Amanda cant stay angry with
	him.

				AMANDA
		This wouldn't happen if he was with
		you. I mean, you drive five miles below the
		speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives
		years.

				PAUL
		That one time was just the bumper.

				AMANDA
		He would have been, safe. Completely,
		entirely, suffocatingly safe.
			(beat)
		I would have him to see more of the world than
		Enid, Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the
		world than Enid, Oklahoma. And so yes, it's
		my fault that this happened. I'm sorry that
		you have to be here.

	Really looking at her...

				PAUL
		I'm not sorry at all.


69I	EXT. INGEN COMPOUND - DAY					69I

	Morning on Isla Sorna. A low mist hangs tight to the forest
	floor as Eric seals up his hideaway for hopefully the last time.

	They start walking. Eric pulls something out of his pocket,
	shows it off to Grant.

				ERIC
		Know what this is?

				GRANT
			(takes it)
		A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.

				ERIC
		Mine's new.

	Grant hands it back.

	Eric is becoming more and more a normal thirteen-year old boy.
	There's an innocence to him that's coming back.

				GRANT
		How much of this island have you explored?

				ERIC
		I stayed pretty close to the compound,
		Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's
		where they'd start.

				GRANT
		We need to head for the coast.

				ERIC
		Are you sure?

				GRANT
		Why?

				ERIC
		Closer you get to the water, the bigger
		things get.


69J	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							69J

	Billy and Amanda wait for Paul as he comes out of the bushes,
	hiking up his shorts.

	Trying to take charge...

				BILLY
		We need to stick to the plan. Head for the
		coast.

				AMANDA
		What about Eric and Dr. Grant?

				BILLY
		Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's
		alive, thats where he's headed.

				AMANDA
		What about Eric?

	Billy represses his instinct to say Eric's dead.

				PAUL
			(rationalizing)
		He's probably has a better chance by the coast
		as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs
		would live in the center of the island.
			(to Billy)
		Right?

				BILLY
		Sure.


69K	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							69K

	As Grant and Eric walk, both stop, hearing a strange sound. But
	for a change, it's not an ominous one.

	It's a human one.

	A phone is RINGING, very faintly. Without a word to each other,
	Grant and Eric decide its coming from the right.

69L	EXT. JUNGLE - CONTUNUOUS DAY					69L

	Paul is picking the briars out of his socks as they hike,
	risking tripping on every step. Then Amanda stops short. She's
	the first to hear it:

	THE SAME RINGING.

	After a beat, everyone else can hear it too. And recongnition
	finally lights on Paul's face...

				PAUL
		My phone.

	Suddenly, Paul frantically searches his pockets as the others
	anxiously watch.

				AMANDA
		You had the phone the whole time?

				BILLY
		Where is it?

				PAUL
		I don't know. I don't have it with me.

				AMANDA
		When did you have it last?

				PAUL
		I don't remember

				AMANDA
		Think.

	And Paul wracks his memory...

				PAUL
		The plane. I got a call on the plane, put it in
		my coat pocket, and...

	Bust suddenly, he stops, his face is lighting with an awful
	realization. Amanda couldnt bear the wait...

				AMANDA
		What?...WHAT!?

				PAUL
		I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on
		him when he...

	The hideous implication of his words slowly sink in.


69M	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							69M

	Still following the faint RINGING, Grant and Eric turn to find

	A SAIL

	moving through the low trees. We recognize it as the back of a
	spinosaurus. We might think it's any random spinosaurus,
	except for the RINGING coming from somewhere inside it.

	Grant and Eric press back against a tree, keep perfectly
	still as they hear the THOOOOMB, THOOOOMB, THOOOMB of the
	creature's footsteps reverberating. It's tail RUSTKES against
	the brush.

	It's moving behind them, and it's close.

	We hear the RINGING move from left to right as it passes. So
	far, its has no idea they're there.

	Looking across the clearing, Eric is startled to see

	PAUL AND AMANDA

	are no more than 20 yards away, also hiding. An involuntary
	reflex, Eric calls out...

				ERIC
		Mon! Dad!

	Grant immediately covers the boys mouth. But it's to late.
	The dinosaur has stopped. We still can't see it. We don't know how
	close it is.

	Paul and Amanda spot Eric with Grant. They're a thousand
	emotions at once: relieved, disbelieving, terrified, overjoyed.
	They want to run to him, to yell out to him, but the monster is
	close.

	Grant takes his hand off Eric's mouth. They both stay
	completely silent.

	All this time, the sat-phone is RINGING.

	Than it stops.

	And after an agonizing beat, the beast moves. At first we're
	not sure which direction it's headed, but finally we can tell
	its moving away.

	Once the sail is finally out of sight, Eric breaks from Grant's
	hold and dashes to his parents' arms. They coop him up. Hug
	him, kiss him, their affection unquenchable. He's crying.

				AMANDA
			(reassuring him)
		Sweetheart, you're okay.
			(reassuring herself)
		You're okay.
			(disbelieving)
		You're okay.

				PAUL
		Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men,
		we stick around, huh?

				ERIC
		We do.

	Looking at her grubby son, Amanda licks her shirttail, trying
	to rub his face clean.

				PAUL
		Honey, there's not enough spit in the world
		for that.

	She LAUGHS. It's the first times she's laughed in two months.

	Billy crosses the distance to Grant.

				GRANT
		We need to keep moving.

				BILLY
		Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry
		about the...

				GRANT
		Billy, I can't talk to you now.

	He walks off. Billy follows him.

				BILLY
		Please, okay? Just yell at me. Call me an
		idiot. An asshole. Stupid. Tell me I screwed
		up because I know I did.

	Grant doesn't respond.

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		I thought if we could get a raptor back
		to the mainland, we could get serious money
		for it. Enough to fund the digging for 10
		years. More. Whatever it took.

	Grant shakes his head, disgusted, But doesn't stop.

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		You have to believe me. I did it with the
		best intentions.

				GRANT
			(finally turning on him)
		Some of the worst things imaginable have
		been done with the best intentions. You
		rushed in with no thought to the
		consequences, to yourself or anyone else.
			(finally)
		You're no better than the people who built
		this place.

	Grant keeps walking, leaving Billy with his guilt.


70	INT. CANYON BUILDING - DAY					70

	The group enters a structure with giant windows designed to
	look into the canyon beyond -- only there's nothing to see but a
	thick fog.

	Toward the center of the room, a spiral staircase that leads to
	a lower level.

	With Billy lagging, Grant approaches the stairs and peers down
	the circular opening in the floor. There is not much to see, just
	fog, a glint of sunlight.


71	EXT. RIVER CANYON - DAY						71

	Step by step, Grant leads the group down a rusty spiral
	staircase below the observation room. The stairs end in a lower
	level. Although we're technically outside, this whole place feel
	strangely enclosed.

	There's a thick fog at this level -- clouds, really -- but far
	below we can see the river. And at its banks, a barge.

				GRANT
		We climb down to the barge and follow the
		river out to the ocean. With any luck, the
		Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.

				ERIC
		Then we go home?

				AMANDA
		Then we go home.

	Grant leads everyone down a RAMP to --


72	EXT. LANDING - DAY							72

	A catwalk branches off, a SET OF STAIRS continuing down the
	along the canyon wall.

	Grant starts down the stairs. He's only taken a few steps down
	the rusty staircase suddenly

	BREAKS BENEATH HIS FEET.

	Paul grabs him in the nick of time. The staircase vanish into
	the fog. CLANFING AGAINST the canyon wall. After a few more
	seconds of silence, they hear the CRASH far below.

				AMANDA
		You okay?

	Grant nods and looks in the other direction.

				GRANT
		How about if we try this way?

	Their only other option is a precarious catwalk that
	disappears into the mist.

				AMANDA
		Do you think it goes all the way across?

				GRANT
		One way to find out.

	The only way to get his-near-fall is to push ahead. But his
	stomach turns at being so high.

	Amanda follows. The catwalk creaks and groans, listing
	slightly. She freezes mid-stride.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
			(glancing back)
		We'd better do this one at a time.

	Amanda steps of and Grant carefully pushes forward,
	disappearing into the thick fog.

	The others listen to the CREAKING of the catwalk until it STOPS
	ABRIPTLY.

	SILENCE.

				PAUL
		Dr. Grant?

	More silence. Then, out of the fog, a distant voice call out --

				GRANT (O.S.)
		Come on over. One at a time.

	Amanda steps tentatively forwards. Eric is clinging to her.

				AMANDA
		Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.

				PAUL
		We're not going anywhere, I promise.

	As Paul holds Eric, and Amanda shares a look.

				Amanda
		We're all together now, Eric.

	Eric reluctantly releases her mother. Amanda starts to cross.


73	EXT. REVER CANYON - FAR WALL - DAY				73

	Grant has stopped at a lateral support across the
	catwalk, trying to get the sense of where they are and what
	purpose this place may have served.

	Seeing that the support beams are brace high arched walls of steal
	mesh, it becomes obvious that we are inside this vast
	construction.

	Amanda emerges from the mist and turns back to the catwalk.

				AMANDA
			(calling out)
		Okay! Come on, Eric!


74	EXT. LANDING - DAY							74

	Eric is next to go across. He's still tentative.

				PAUL
		How 'bout if I...

				ERIC
		No, I can do it.

	Billy and Paul look on as Eric disappears into the vapor.

				PAUL
			(muttering to himself)
		That's it Eric. Nice and easy...


75	EXT. CATWALK - DAY							75

	Eric slowly gropes his way forward. He feels a GUST OF WIND and
	a HEAVY THUD ahead on the catwalk which now sways beneath
	him.

	Regaining his balance, Eric peers forward, but the fog prevents
	him from seeing more than fifteen feet ahead. There is an EERIE
	SILENCE. Eric calls out timidly.

				ERIC
		Mom?


75A	EXT. RIVER CANYON - FAR WALL - DAY				75A

	Across the canyon, Grant moves across the later support. With
	his hand on the railing, he sends a white, hardened substance
	dropping into the mist.

	Looking up, Grant notices a large strut, covered with the same
	substance. Realizing what it could be.

				GRANT
		Oh, my God.

				AMANDA
		What is it?

				GRANT
		A bird cage.

	Then, the sound of Eric SCREAMING.


75B	EXT. CATWALK - DAY							75B

	Eric watches as A LOOMING SHAPE emerges from the fog -- a
	nightmarish vision stalking purposefully forward.

	A FULL GROWN PTERANODON,

	standing over seven feet high, walks upright on clawed feet, his
	thirty foot wings folded bat-like at his side.

	The creature sees Eric and fixes him with a demonic glare.

	Eric CRIES OUT and dashes back down the teetering catwalk.

	The Pteranodon ruses to its feet, spreads its thirty-foot wings
	and flies directly at him.

	AT THE OTHER END OF THE CATWALK

	Hearing Eric's SCREAMS, Paul charges onto the catwalk,
	searching in the fog.

				PAUL
		Eric!

				BILLY
		It won't hold!

	Suddenly,

	ERIC

	emerges from the fog, racing toward his father. And then
	
	THE PTERANODON

	swoops out of the fog, opens its giant rear claws, and snatches
	the terrified boy from the catwalk.

	Paul Kirby watches in stunned, abject horror as the Pteranodon
	carries Eric directly overhead --

				PAUL
		ERIC!

	The flying reptile struggles with the boy's weight. Paul
	watches helplessly as Eric is carried high across the canyon.

	Paul runs back alone the catwalk in a desperate attempt to keep
	Eric in sight.

	Billy stays behind, moving back up the platform to try to
	keep the dinosaur in view. With a new idea, he races back up the
	stairs to the observation room. He has a way to save Eric.

	When he reaches the canyon wall, Paul turns a corner and runs
	along another enclosed catwalk leading deeper into the canyon.

	Grant and Amanda now come pounding down the catwalk trying to
	catch up with Paul.

				AMANDA
			(shouting)
		Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?

				PAUL
			(shouting back)
		I'm trying! That thing took him down this
		way!

				GRANT
		Split up!

	THE PTERANODON

	carries Eric deeper into the canyon. The creature's wings beat
	steadily overhead, and the WIND is fierce. Eric looks down and
	sees the river far below.

	The Pteranodon swoops over an isolated outcropping of rocks at
	the end of the canyon and drops Eric into --


75C	EXT. PTERANODON NEST - DAY					75C

	A large bowl of mud and branches the size of a satellite dish.
	Eric lands right on top of a pile of dinosaur bones picked
	clean. Mixed among is one human skull.

	Before Eric has time to cry out, he looks up to find

	SIX PTERANODON HATCHLINGS

	closing in on him with sharp-edged beaks.

	He picks up the human skull and whips it to the hatchlings.
	They easily duck it and keep coming.

76	EXT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS DAY			76

	Grant looks up to see Billy leaning out over the edge of the
	observation platform. He suddenly realizes what Billy is about
	to do.

				GRANT
		BILLY! WAIT!

	Billy SHOUTS BACK, an excited-terrified grin on his face.

				BILLY
		I CAN GET HIM!

				GRANT
		NO!

				BILLY
		I KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES!

	Billy jumps off the railing and

	DROPS TOWARDS THE CANYON BELOW.

	Grant, Paul and Amanda watch as Billy FALLS past them like a
	stone, plummeting towards certain death. But then --

	THE PARASAIL CHUTE

	blossoms above him.

	Not only does it slows Billy's descent, but he even manages to
	catch an updraft and begin to rise.

	He struggles to control the parasail, swooping dangerously
	close to the canyon wall, barely avoiding it.

	Up ahead he catches sight of Eric and steers towards him.


77-80	OMIT									77-80


81	EXT. PTERANODON NEST - DAY					81

	Eric struggles to keep away from the hatchlings. But there's
	no way out of this nest.

	Billy SWOOPS overhead, but he's too high to reach Eric.

				BILLY
		ERIC! HOLD ON!

	He circles around to make another attempt.


82	EXT. ENCLOSED CATWAY - DAY					82

	Paul rounds the corner and finally catches sight of Eric in the
	nest, some fifty feet below, fighting off the hatchlings.

				PAUL
		Hang on, Eric!

	Paul sees an outcropping he could jump onto from here. It's a
	big leap, though, he might not make it. He steels himself up for
	the jump, then chickens out.

	Grant and Amanda come up behind him. Suddenly,

	A SECOND PTERANODON

	CRASH LANDS on the catwalk enclosure about them -- right next
	to a gaping hole in the mesh. The catwalk GROANS with the
	extra weight.

	The pteranodon JAMS its head through the hole, SNAPPING at
	them.


83	EXT. CANYON - IN THE AIR - DAY					83

	Billy circles, making his approach.

	In the nest, Eric kicks at the hatchlings, but they're
	undeterred. Billy and Eric will only have one chance.

	As Billy swoops past, Eric jumps and grabs onto his boot. He is
	yanked up and out of the nest. But than, MOTHER PTERANODON
	shoots past, tearing out a piece of the parasail in its beak.


84-85	OMIT									84-85


86	EXT. OVER THE RIVER - DAY					86

	The pteranodon who landed on the top of the catwalk continues to
	SNAP through the hole in the enclosure.

	Finally the reptile's massive weight proves to much, and the
	entire section of the catwalk BREAKS FREE of the canyon wall
	and FLIPS OVER LATERALLY.

	Amanda, Grant and Paul are able to hang on, but so is the
	pteranodon, who now climbs their way.


87	OMIT									87


88	EXT. OVER THE RIVER - DAY					88

	His parasail badly damaged, Billy tries to keep aloft. Heading
	as low as he dares, he yells to Eric --

				BILLY
		Let go!

	Terrified, Eric falls into the river safely. He surfaces,
	immediately swimming to shore.

	Trying to gain altitude, Billy bends hard to the right. But the
	rigging is too badly damaged. He flies right into the canyon
	wall, hitting hard.

	Instead of tumbling down to the river, he finds himself
	swinging from his harness - the parasail snagged on a rock
	spire above him.


89	EXT. BROKEN CATWALK - DAY					89

	Paul, Grant and Amanda struggle to stay away from the
	pteranodon as it moves towards them.

	Suddenly. the far end of this inverted section of catwalk
	detaches from the canyon wall and

	SWINGS DOWNWARD.

	The force of the action sends the three tumbling directly
	towards the pteranodon.

	Miraculously, they manage to avoid its open beak. But they
	are all sent plummeting toward the river below.


90	EXT. RIVER - DAY							90

	They hit the water hard, resurfacing moments later. The
	current is carrying them downstream.


91	EXT. CANYON WALL - DAY						91

	The two pteranodons who were pursuing Billy now land on nearby
	ledges and consider how best to dispatch their prey.

	Billy frantically tries to unhook his harness, but the tension
	is so tight from his own weight that he can't loosen the
	buckles.


92-93	OMIT							  92-93


94	EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY					      94

	Paul and Amanda emerge from the water by the canyon wall and
	find their son hiding behind a rock, searching the skies for
	Billy.

	Amanda takes Eric tightly in her arms, and Paul urges them to
	keep moving. Up ahead, the mesh of the aviary meets the river.

	Wading the shore, Grant now scans the canyon, searching for
	Billy. It doesn't take long to spot him.

95	EXT. CANYON WALLL - DAY						95

	Billy continues to struggle with the harness but to no avail.

	The doomed young man is suspended high up on the canyon wall
	like a modern Prometheus, an entire FLOCK of pteranodons
	gathering around him preparing to peck away his liver. And
	everything else.

	A MAMMOTH PTERANADON has landed beside him and looks him
	straight in the eye.

	The gigantic creature lunges at him. Billy dodges away as best
	he can. The pteranodon's frustrated bite severs a crucial
	juncture on Billy's harness, and Billy is able to wriggle free.


96	EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY						96

	Eric, Amanda, Paul and Grant watch in amazement as Billy is the
	last to PLUNGE DOWN into the river.

				GRANT
		He made it!

	Billy bobs to the surface and spots the group downstream. He
	waves and begins to swim towards them. Soon he nears the shore
	and gets to his feet, wading as he comes.

	Grant, Paul, Amanda and Eric hurry to meet him.

	Grant is overjoyed to see him alive. But his smile quickly
	fades as he sees

	THE ENTIRE FLOCK OF PTERANODONS

	diving down from above in angry pursuit of their lost prey.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Billy, look out!

	Billy glances behind him. He races forward, motioning fro his
	companions to turn around.

				BILLY
		Get back! Get back!

	Just then Billy is knocked down by the lead pteranodon. It
	strikes from behind with a brutal, calculated beak to the head.
	Billy stumbles and falls to the ground.

	Grant rushes forward with Paul right after him. Amanda takes
	Eric to safety down river.

	Billy SCREAMS as the ENTIRE FLOCK of pteranodons now swarms
	around him, picking him apart with their beaks and claws.

				GRANT
		Billy!

				PAUL
		It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.

	Grant can't take his eyes off Billy, whose BLOOD stains the
	water rushing by.

	And now several pteranodons are heading their way. Difficult
	as it is to leave Billy behind, Grant and Paul make a run for it.

	Just as the pteranodons are about to swoop in for the kill, Alan
	and Paul dive back into the river...


97	EXT. THE RIVER - CONTINUOUS DAY				97

	...and resurfaces on the far side of the mesh aviary wall, GASPING
	for air. Just behind them, the mammoth

	PTERANODON

	CRASHES into the mesh. It tears at the steel, actually ripping
	it in one place.

	At the dock up ahead, Amanda and Eric have found a rusty,
	waterlogged barge that's somehow still floating. Carrying a
	tarp-covered cage, the boat was meant for transporting dinos
	up and down the river.

	Amanda pushes them away from the dock as Alan and Paul climb
	on board.


98	EXT. ON THE BARGE - CONTINUOUS DAY				98

	The current takes the craft downstream, letting us get our
	first good look at the incredible
	
	AVIARY.

	It's a vast, domed mesh structure that spans the entire canyon.
	In all, a feat of remarkable engineering and unmistakable
	hubris.

	Catching their breath, our four survivors look at the cage they
	were caught in.


99	EXT. DOWN RIVER - DAY / LATER					99

	Yanking the starter rope one final time, Paul finally gets the
	engine to turn over, PUTTERING along. Amanda is beside him,
	bailing water.

				PAUL
		My own kid was right in front of me and I
		didn't do a damn thing.

				AMANDA
		You couldn't have made that jump.

				PAUL
		I should have tried. It should have been me
		on that beach back there, not Billy.

				AMANDA
		How would you have helped Eric?
			(he can't answer)
		He needs you, Paul. He needs us.

				PAUL
		He could have died.

				AMANDA
		But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm
		glad about that.


99A	UP ON THE BOW							99A

	Grant is beside Eric, keeping watch, but also feeling the weight
	of Billy's death.

				ERIC
		Do you have any kids?

				GRANT
		No. Although I've studied them in the wild.

	Eric looks over, not sure what that means.

				GRANT (CON'T)
		I have a theory that there's two kinds of
		boys. Those who want to be astronomers and
		those who want to be astronauts.

				ERIC
		I want to be an astronaut.

				GRANT
		See, I was the opposite. I never understood
		why anyone would want to go into space. It's
		so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and
		you're dead. The astronomer -- or the
		paleontologist -- get to study these amazing
		things from a place of complete safety. And
		truthfully, everything you really need to
		learn, you can learn it from the ground.

				ERIC
		But then you never get to go in space.

				GRANT
		Exactly. The difference between imagining
		how things might be and seeing how they
		really are. To be able to touch them. That's
		what Billy wanted to do.

	The barge starts to round a bend. On the bow, Grant and Eric
	are the fist to see something remarkable. Eric GASPS,
	unprepared. We don't know yet what they see.

				GRANT (cont'd)
		I can blame the people who made this island.
		But I can't blame the people who want to see
		it. To study it.

	At the rear of the barge, Paul just now sees what's ahead. Awe-
	struck, he slows the motor and motions for Amanda to take a
	look. And so do we.

	UP AHEAD

	The setting sun illuminates an incredible valley filled with
	dinosaurs. We see armored ANKYLOSAURS with clubbed
	tails. Duck-billed CORYTHOSAURS. We float under the gigantic,
	arching necks of eighty-foot BRACHIOSAURS.

	With the mist from the river and the play of light, we're
	witnessing a kind of primal Eden.

				GRANT (cont'd)
		How's a boy suppose to resist this?


100	EXT. FURTHER DOWNSTREAM - NIGHT				100

	A FULL MOON passes behind clouds. THUNDER quietly rumbles, and
	LIGHTNING flickers in the distance.

	Paul is still at the wheel. The river is narrower here, and
	cautions must be taken to avoid the banks.

	As the barge begins to round another bend. a FAMILIAR HIGH-
	PITCHED SOUND pierces the darkness. Muffled but unmistakable,
	it is the RINGING SAT-PHONE.

	All exchange looks of sheer PANIC, expecting Spinosaurus to
	leap out at any moment. Grant scans the river banks.

				GRANT
		Keep quiet.

	Paul cuts the motor, and time seems to stop as the four stand
	posed for action.

	The barge finishes rounding the curve, and the ringing grows
	LOUDER. The suspense is excruciating until finally...

	Their eyes widen at some horrifying sight, more horrifying
	than anything they've yet seen.

	SEVEN MOUNDS OF DINOSAUR DUNG sit on the patch off treeless flat
	ground just beyond the river bank.

	As our friends consider the sight, an idea comes to them all of them
	almost simultaneously.

	With Eric still in the boat, Amanda, Paul, and Alan jump into
	the river and rush to the bank.


101	EXT. RIVER BANK - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT				101

	The three companions sprint towards the source of the RINGING.

				GRANT
		Find it before it stops ringing!

	And bracing themselves and hocking their breath, they PLUNGE
	their arms into their respective dung-heaps. After a few
	moments of this disgusting search...

				PAUL
		I've got something. I think I've got
		something!

	All turn to Paul. Clearing away the clinging defecation, he
	holds up to a beeper. And still the phone RINGS.

	Returning to their bleak task, they shovel the excrement with
	their arms. Finally:

				AMANDA
		I've got it! I've got it!

	Grant snatches the RINGING SAT-PHONE from Amanda's hands,
	presses a button, and puts it to his ear.

				RECORDED VOICE (ON PHONE)
		You too can own a time share in beautiful
		Guadalajara. Enjoy a meal in one of our four
		star restaurants, explore our coral reefs, or
		just walk on the beach...

	The Kirbys hear the recorded voice and let out a collective,
	heavy sigh. Grant shuts off the phone.

	In all the excitement, none of them notice a fierce horned
	CARNOTAUR right behind them. The giant creature ROARS, ready
	to eat them.

	But as it gets in close, it smells them. Even a dinosaur won't
	eat something that is covered in shit. After a beat, the
	Carnotaur turns and walks away, back into the jungle.

				PAUL
		Can't help but be a little offended.


102	EXT. BACK ON THE BARGE - NIGHT					102

	CLOSE ON the cleaned satellite phone's display. The battery
	level indicator is FLASHING.

				PAUL
		Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy.
		They won't do a God Damn thing.

				GRANT
		Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican
		phone book here, so it will have to be
		somebody we know in the states. Someone we
		can absolutely count on to send help.

				PAUL
			(to Amanda)
		Stan.

				AMANDA
		I wouldn't trust Stan with a snowball in a
		blizzard.

	Paul glares at her. Now Eric notices something odd in the
	river.

				ERIC
		What's that?

	The others look down in the murky water. Just below the
	surface,

	A SHIMMERING WAVE OF SILVER

	passes beneath the boat.

	Then a SINGLE FISH jumps from the water. And another. And
	another.

				GRANT
		Bonitas.

				ERIC
		Something must've scared them.

	Another roll of THUNDER, this time much closer.

				GRANT
		Get the motor going.

	Paul moves the motor and pulls the start cord. The engine
	sputters but won't come to life.

	And now the phone BEEPS. The battery is getting even weaker.

	Grant makes a quick decision and DIALS.

				AMANDA
		Who are you calling?

	But Grant ignores the question. RING. RING.

				GRANT
		Pick up! Pick up!


103	INT. ELLIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT				103

	Wearing his jammies, three-year old Charlie awkwardly picks up
	the phone with both hands. He has the mouthpiece next to his
	lips, but the earpiece is hanging out in space.

				CHARLIE
		Hewwo?

	INTERCUT

	Recognizing who it must be...

				GRANT
		Charlie? Charlie. Get your mother. Right
		away!

	A long silence. Charlie bites his lip, looks around.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Charlie? Are you there?

				CHARLIE
		Hewwo?

	The sat-phone BEEPS again, this time much LOUDER.

	Amanda and Eric watch Grant, realizing their fate may hang on
	this single call. Paul struggles without success to start the
	motor.

	Then, unseen by the group, a

	GIGANTIC FIN

	rises from the water just fifty yards from the barge. It's
	headed right to them and closing fast.

				GRANT
			(desperate)
		Charlie! It's the dinosaur man! Go get
		mommy, okay?

				CHARLIE
		Okay.

	Not sure what to do with the phone, Charlie makes a logical
	choice and hangs it back up.

	He walks away to his mom.


104	EXT. BARGE - NIGHT [END INTERCUTTING]			104

	Grant realizes he's been cut off. He's about to redial when

	WHAM!

	The barge is RAMMED, sending everyone tumbling. Grant manages
	to stay on top of the wheelhouse, but he loses grip on the
	phone, which falls on deck.

	SPINOSAURUS

	rises from the water, towering over the barge. As lightning
	FLASHES and thunder CRACKS, the dinosaur lets out an ear-
	splitting ROAR.

	It lunges at Grant with gaping jaws. Grant leaps out of
	the way just in time as the dinosaur

	RIPS OFF

	the entire wheelhouse.

							            CUT TO:


105	INT. ELLIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT				105

	Charlie leads Ellie into the room. Hands her the phone. Of
	course, it's just a DIAL TONE.

				ELLIE
		Was somebody on the phone?

				CHARLIE
		Dinosaur man.

	Ellie looks at him with confusion, then quickly checks the
	Caller ID box besides the phone. It's international, and not a
	number she recognizes.

							          BACK TO:


106	EXT. THE BARGE - NIGHT						106

	Grant stays one step ahead of the Spinosaurus as the beast rips
	apart the quickly-sinking boat.

	It spits out the wheelhouse and bites down on the stern of the
	boat, ripping off a chunk.

	Grant is heading up to the other three when he hears the sat-
	phone RING.  He spots it, just about to fall into the water.
	Dives for it, answering...

				GRANT
		ELLIE!


106A	INT. ELLIES LIVING ROOM - NIGHT					106A

				ELLIE
		Alan?

	She can hear the Spinosaurus ROAR.

				ELLIE (CONT'D)
		Alan? Alan!

	But he's cut off by a SECOND ROAR, the sound of someone
	SCREAMING.

	And then the line goes dead.

	Ellie pales. Charlie looks at her with a smile.

				CHARLIE
			(imitating)
		Raaaar!


106B	EXT. BACK ON THE BARGE - NIGHT					106B

	Dropping the dead phone, Grant scrambles towards the front of
	the boat and joins Paul, Amanda and Eric, who have taken refuge
	in the dinosaur cage.

	The fearsome beast now lifts the stern of the boat clear out of
	the water.

	The cage SCRAPES across the deck and SLAMS into the gunwale,
	toppling off the barge and

	INTO THE RIVER.

	Grant and the Kirbys are still inside.


107	EXT. THE RIVER - UNDERWATER - NIGHT				107

	The cage sinks. The closest to the door, Paul manages to get out.

	The other three aren't as lucky. The cage rotates as it descends
	and lands on the river bottom with the door side down, trapping
	them inside.

	In the cold murky depths, they pull frantically on the bars.
	Debris and equipment float around them.

	Paul surfaces out of the breath and disoriented. Spinosaurus
	pushes past the boat. If anyone is going to save his family, it
	has to be him.

	And so he dives.

	Pushing with all his might, he manages to tip the heavy
	structure, just enough so Amanda, Eric and Grant can get out.
	Paul himself isn't so lucky.

	Spinosaurus grabs the cage and Paul, throwing both straight up
	out of the water. Paul flies twenty feet away, further from the
	shore.

				AMANDA
		PAUL!

				ERIC
		DAD!

	Spinosaurus is going after the heroic Mr. Kirby, who dives,
	swimming underwater. He's trying to lead it away from his
	family.

				GRANT
			(looking around)
		Up! Up!

	He points to a heavy crane assembly, designed for lifting cages
	off the large boats. Now well accustomed to fleeing on
	command, Amanda sends Eric up first, climbing the scaffolding
	like a jungle gym.

	All the while, they're trying to spot Paul.

	Grant is the last to climb, reaching the first section as
	Spinosaurus returns from the water, SLAMMING into the base of
	the crane. The whole assembly SHUDDERS, threatening to rip into
	the water.

				ERIC
		Where's Dad?

				AMANDA
		Just hold on.

	Try as it might, the beast can't climb the crane. So instead it
	RAMS it, SHAKES it, trying to knock them off. Eric slips, but
	Amanda catches him.

	About to shed his bag to climb higher, Grant finds one last
	hope. It's the resonation chamber model. A beat before he
	decides: It may not be the best choice, but it's the only choice.

	He blows through it, the same EERIE PITCH we heard before. On
	the third try, he's able to approximate the "egg" cry he heard
	the raptors give. He keeps it up, repeating over and over.

	Spinosaurus stops for a beat, confused How this sound could be
	coming from a non-raptor. But then keeps SMASHING.

	We can hear the mounting bolts STRAIN. Soon the whole crane
	will tip.

	But not before a MATCHING CRY is heard in the jungle. Grant
	stops, not certain he heard it. But there it is AGAIN.

	He keeps blowing.

	The crane is close to tipping when a single RAPTOR appears
	from the darkness, CHIRP-BARKING at the Spinosaur, who simply
	bats away.

	But then MORE RAPTORS come. And even MORE. Soon there are
	dozens gathering, circling.

	Grant stops signaling. All three survivors watch with
	horrified fascination, knowing their fate is perilous no matter
	which side wins.

	Looking at his adversaries, Spinosaurus ROARS. And suddenly
	the raptors attack.

	Spinosaurus easily handles the first few, but like ants they
	just keep coming. They climb up his back, slicing, into him with
	their razor-sharp claws.

				GRANT
		Jump! Swim for the far shore!

	All three drop from the crane arm into the water.

	Meanwhile, the fight continues. Spinosaurus rallies, shaking
	off many of the raptors, but they just keep coming. Their
	hooked claws dig in, scraping the meat to the bone.

	Spinosaurus puts up a brave fight to the end, but finally
	collapses, dead. The raptors continue to shred it to ribbons.
	Then one of the raptors looks over to see the survivors
	swimming away.

	But a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. It goes back to
	its meal.


107A	EXT. FAR SHORE - NIGHT						107A

	Grant is trying to move them along. still headed downstream.
	But Eric won't budge another foot.

				ERIC
		We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.

				AMANDA
		I know. I know. I want to look for him too.

				ERIC
		then we should...

	She kneels down, facing him. She's just as upset as he is, but
	motherhood carries the burden of remaining calm.

				AMANDA
		Let me tell you a few things about you Dad,
		okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave,
		and he loves you ever very much.

				ERIC
		He loves you too.

				AMANDA
		Okay. He loves us very very much. And I know
		that right now more than anything, your Dad
		would want to know that we're safe. Okay?

	Eric nods.

				AMANDA (CONT'D)
		We're going to get out of this, and
		everything's going to be all right, I promise.

				A VOICE
		Listen to your mother.

	Out of the darkness steps Paul Kirby. Amanda is knocked over
	with surprise. Eric runs to him, nearly tackling him.

				PAUL
		Good thing I've been swimming, huh?

	Amanda hugs him and Eric so tightly they can't breath.


									CROSSFADE TO:


108-109	OMIT								108-109


110	EXT. BEACH - DAY							110

	The foursome sit back on the wide beach, one facing
	each direction, keeping watch. A light rain is falling, but they
	don't seem to notice.

	Trying to keep his boy's spirit up...

				PAUL
		You remember when we went fishing last
		summer? And I was trying to put the boat in
		and the trailer sank? And then the tow truck
		came and tried to pull it out, but it got
		dragged in? And the truck driver threatened
		to knock your Dad's lights out? So I said I
		was the governor and he believed me?

	Eric really smiles, remembering the day.

				ERIC
		Yeah.

	Amanda is smiling too. She had completely forgotten the
	incident.

				PAUL
		That was a fun day.

	To Paul, after some consideration....

				AMANDA
		We should try fishing again.

				PAUL
		You mean it?

				AMANDA
		I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows?
		Things might turn out differently.

	Her hand takes his, gently brushing off the wet sand, fingertips
	touching. It's a small thing, but it's a start.

	Sensing his cue to leave, Grant gets up and starts walking down
	the beach. Eric hurries to follow him. He speaks
	conspiratorially, not wanting to alarm his parents.

				ERIC
		The lady you called, how do you know she can
		help us?

				GRANT
		She's the one person I could always count on.
		And she's saved me more times than she
		realizes. I owe her everything.

	A long beat as they walk.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		It's strikes me now I never told her that.

				ERIC
		You should.

				GRANT
		You're right.

	As they keep walking, Grant notices something rammed against
	the rocks ahead. It's a speedboat, its hull ripped open from the
	impact.

	And it's not just any boat either -- it's the same Dino-Soar
	boat that was pulling the parasail. Eric hasnt seen it yet, so
	Grant stops him.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Eric, do you know what happened to the boat?
		that brought you here? Why did it crash?

				ERIC
		No. I couldn't see.

				GRANT
		Do me a favor. Go back to your parents for a
		minute, would you?
			(pre-empting objections)
		They look worried.

	Eric nods and heads back to Paul and Amanda. Grant forges on,
	approaching the speedboat wreckage. He doesn't know what he'll
	find, but he needs to look.

	Almost reaching his parents, Eric stops. Looks out over the
	ocean, where he sees

	TWO LIGHTS.

	He doesn't say anything for a moment, trying to make sure
	they're real. They are. And they're coming closer.

				ERIC
			(excited)
		Mom! Dad!

	They look up to see the distant lights, just now making out
	full forms...

				PAUL
		Helicopters. Helicopters!

	He SHOUTS with joy. Paul, Amanda and Eric wave their arms,
	making as much motion as possible. The helicopters -- big
	military choppers -- change direction, heading straight for
	them.

	Paul and Amanda embrace, then kiss, the moment getting the best
	of them

	AT THE SPEEDBOAT

	Grant looks in, prepared to see anything in the wreckage. But
	the cabin is surprisingly intact, just a little blood. There are
	three gashes on the driver's seat back. Grant measures their
	spacing with his fingers.

				ERIC
			(yelling over)
		Dr. Grant! Helicopters are coming!

	Grant looks down to the wet sand around him, finding a trail of
	three-toed tracks.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		We're safe!

				GRANT
			(to himself)
		No we're not.

	THE FIRST CHOPPER.

	flies right overhead. Paul and Amanda are confused, until the
	second helicopter starts to land -- the first on is there to 
	cover them.

	Grant YELLS at the first chopper, trying to wave it away. But
	the noise of the blades is DEAFENDING.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		NO! STAY BACK! THEY'RE IN THE TREES!

	At the treeline, the upper branches are shaking. At first, it
	looks like it's just the wind off the chopper, but
	something more is happening.
	
	A PTERANODON

	flies up out of the trees, the first of twenty. It's a gorgeous
	and terrifying sight.


110A	INT. FIRST CHOPPER - DAWN					110A

	Terrified, the Costa Rican CHOPPER PILOT veers away, but the
	pteranodons are already on him. They SMASH at the windows,
	grabbing on the skids, The chopper rolls wildly.

	One over-eager pteranodon sticks his head up to high, getting
	decapitated by the blade.


110B	EXT. BEACH - DAWN							110B

	As the second chopper touches down on the beach, Eric, Amanda
	and Paul load in. Grant is running their way.


110C	EXT. BY THE TREES - DAWN						110C

	Meanwhile, the first copper is losing the battle even as it
	climbs higher. The helicopter suddenly tips, falling, SMASHING
	into the trees with a massive fireball.


110D	INT. SECOND CHOPPER - DAWN					110D

	Seeing the explosion, the SECOND CHOPPER PILOT takes off. Eric,
	Amanda and Paul are on board, but Grant is still running up.
	The helicopter passes right over him.

				AMANDA
			(to the pilot)
		You have to go back! We can't leave him!

	Seeing a ladder release by the door, Paul throws the lever. A cord-
	and-steel-ladder unfurls, dragging across the sand.


110E	EXT. THE BEACH - DAWN					   110E

	Grant chases after us, catching a rung just as it goes over the
	water. Behind him, pteranodons are circling the wreckage of
	the first chopper and starting to go after the second.

	Buffeted by the wind, Grant climbs the ladder up towards the
	chopper. A pteranodon flies up right behind him, trying to
	bite. It catches Grant's shoulder.

	Grant spins to the far side of the ladder. The pteranodon goes
	to bite him again, but finds it head caught between the rungs.
	As it tries to free itself, it just gets more entangled.

	The entire ladder starts to lift, caught by the updraft from the
	creatures wings.


110F	INT. SECOND CHOPPER - DAWN					110F

	Up with the pilot, Amanda sees the other pteranodons are headed
	back to the island, unable to keep up.

				AMANDA
		They're not following.

	In back, Paul and Eric get the ladder mechanism to begin to
	retract. It reels Grant in faster. It also reels in the
	pteranodon, which may be caught, but is still plenty dangerous.

	As Grant reaches the cabin, they shut off the ladder engine.
	The pteranodon is still working its way free, pulling itself closer
	and closer.

				GRANT
			(shouting over the noise)
		We have to cut it! Find something sharp!

	Everyone checking the cabin for a knife, anything sharp.

	Finally, Eric hands Grant the raptor claw.

	Grant uses it to rip the line. The fibers break and fray, but
	the pteranodon keeps coming closer.

	Paul throws a wrench at the pteranodon, WHACKING it straight
	in the head. It felt good, and damn if it didn't slow it down a
	little.

	Grant has cut through the cord. He started on the second when
	the pteranodon SNAPS at him, going for his hand. There's
	nowhere for Grant to cut without the pteranodon getting him.

	And idea, Grant very deliberately places in his hand on the line,
	pulling away at the last moment. The pteranodon itself bites
	through the line.


110G	EXT. OCEAN - DAWN							110G

	The pteranodon falls away from the helicopter, catching wind
	just before it hits the water.

	It circles and flies back to Isla Sorna.

	As horrifying as the creature was a moment ago, it's suddenly
	beautiful again. Each motion of its giant wings is a small
	symphony.


110H	INT. COPPER / FLYING - DAWN					110H

	Sitting between his parents, Eric looks back at the island in
	the distance.

				ERIC
		What do you think is going to happen with the
		dinosaurs?

				GRANT
		The population will Stabilize eventually.
		They'll adapt to fit different roles.

	ON PAUL AND AMANDA

				PAUL
		Either that, or the government will firebomb
		it back to the Stone Age.

				AMANDA
		I would completely support that.

	ON ERIC AND GRANT

	looking back at the island.

				ERIC
		I hope they don't. I want to come back
		someday.

	And Dr. Grant realizes...

				GRANT
		So do I.

EXT. OCEAN  DAWN
The helicopter flies away across the ocean, leaving the island behind.

THE LOST WORLD JURASSIC PARK

 
			THE LOST WORLD
			 JURASSIC PARK

			Screenplay by
			  David Koepp
	
		     based on the novel by
			Michael Crichton

	EXT. TROPICAL LAGOON - DAY

	A 135-foot-luxury yacht is anchored just offshore in a 
	tropical lagoon.  The beach is a stunning crescent of white
	sand at the jungle fringe, utterly deserted.

				ISLA SORNA
		87 miles southeast of Nublar

	Two SHIP HANDS, dressed in white uniforms, have set up a
	picnic table with three chairs on the sand and are carefully
	laying out luncheon service -- fine china, silver, crystal
	decanters with red and white wine.

	PAUL BOWMAN, fortyish, sits in a chair off to the side,
	reading.  MRS. BOWMAN, painfully thin, with the perpetually
	surprised look of a woman who's had her eyes done more than
	once, supervises the settings of the table.

	She looks up and sees a little girl, CATHY, seven or eight
	years old, wandering off down the beach.

				MRS. BOWMAN
		Cathy!  Don't wander off!

	Cathy keeps wandering.

				MRS. BOWMAN (cont'd)
		Cathy, come back!  You can look for
		shells right here!

	Cathy gestures, pretending she can't hear.

				BOWMAN
			(eyes still in his book)
		Leave her alone.

				MRS. BOWMAN
		What about snakes?

				BOWMAN
		There's no snakes on a beach.  Let
		her have fun, for once.

	FURTHER DOWN THE BEACH,

	Cathy keeps wandering away, MUTTERING to herself as her
	parents' quarreling voices fade in the distance.

				CATHY
		Please be quiet, please be quiet
		please be quiet...

	Rounding a curve in the beach, her parents disappear from view
	behind her.  A RUSTLING sound draws her attention, and she
	turns, toward where the thick jungle foliage gives way to the
	sand.

	A large bush, maybe twelve feet tall, is moving, its branches
	swaying and shaking.  Curious, Cathy walks up to the bush,
	which abruptly stops moving.

	A small, lizard-like animal, dark green with brown stripes
	along its back, steps out from the bush.  Only about a foot
	tall, it stands on its hind legs, balancing on its thick tail.
	It walks upright, bobbing its head like a chicken.

				CATHY
		Well, hello there!

	The animal (a COMPSOGNATHUS) just stares at her.  Cathy squats
	down on her haunches.

				CATHY (cont'd)
		What are you?  A little bird or
		something?

	She opens her hand.  She's got a handful of goldfish crackers.

				CATHY (cont'd)
		Are you hungry?  You want a goldfish?

	The compy bobs forward a few steps, cautiously.

				CATHY (cont'd)
		Come on.  I won't hurt you.

	The compy draws closer.  Cathy holds the cracker in the palm
	of her hand.  The compy gets closer still --

	-- and hops numbly up onto Cathy's palm.  Her arm dips a bit
	under the weight, but it's not that heavy, and she holds it up
	easily.  It bobs its head, scarfs up the goldfish, and eats
	it.

	Enchanted, Cathy breaks into an enormous grin and returns her
	hand, calling back over her shoulder.

				CATHY (cont'd)
		Mom!  Dad!  You gotta come see this!
		I found something!

	She turns back.

	Thirty more compys have come out onto the sand.  They're
	standing there, bobbing anxiously, staring at her from a few
	feet away.  Cathy's smile fades.

	She turns her head slowly to the right.  TWENTY MORE COMPYS
	have come in from that side, forming a semi-circle, bobbing
	and CHIPPING as they surround her.

				CATHY (cont'd)
			(terrified)
		What do you guys want?

	BACK ON THE BEACH,

	the table is set.  Mrs. Bowman calls out.

				MRS. BOWMAN
		Cathy, sweetheart!  Lunch is ready!

	From around the curve of the beach, a flock of birds bolts
	from the jungle trees as Cathy's shrill SCREAMS suddenly
	pierce the air.

				MRS. BOWMAN
		PAUL!

	She takes off, running down the beach, Mr. Bowman leaps out of
	his chair and follows, and all available deck hands race off
	to help, kicking up geysers of sand behind them.

	DOWN THE BEACH,

	Mrs. Bowman stops dead in her tracks when she rounds the bend
	in the beach.  We don't see what she sees, but we hear the
	frenzied SQUEAKING of the strange compys.  Mr. Bowman and the
	Hands race past her to help Cathy as Mrs. Bowman lets loose a
	horrified, slack-jawed SCREAM, her mouth a perfect oval.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. BOARD ROOM - DAY

	Mrs. Bowman's screaming face dissolves slowly over the
	YAWNING face of a bored CORPORATE EXECUTIVE, TWENTY OTHER
	EXECUTIVES sit around a conference table in the boardroom of a
	monied corporation.  All are in expensive suits, most are over
	sixty.  There are rows of BACKBENCHERS too, whispering in their
	lawyers who sit behind their clients, whispering in their
	ears.  Empty coffee cups and fast food containers on the table
	hint that everyone's been here a long time.

	A familiar VOICE resounds through the boardroom as we move
	down the long table, pat the grim faces of the board members.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		The hurricane seemed like a disaster
		at the time, but now I think it was a
		blessing, nature's way of freeing
		those animals from their human
		confines.  Of giving them another
		chance to survive, but this time as
		they were meant to, without man's
		interference.

	The source of the voice is JOHN HAMMOND, the founder of InGen
	and creator of Jurassic Park.  But he's not in the room.  His
	image is on a closed circuit TV screen, which has been wheeled
	up to the end of the table.

	And he doesn't look good.  He's terribly infirmed, propped up
	in bed, his face pale and drawn, medical equipment BEEPING
	around him.

				HAMMOND (cont'd)
		There are some corporate issues that
		are not about the bottom line.  We
		have so much still to learn about
		those creatures.  A whole world of
		intricate, interlocking behaviors,
		vanished everywhere -- except for
		Site B. Please.  Let's not do what
		is good for more men at the expense
		at what is best for all mankind.

	The CHAIRMAN, seventyish, nods awkwardly to the television.

				CHAIRMAN
		Thank you, John.  Mr. Ludlow?

	He turns to PETER LUDLOW, late thirties, a man with the
	anxious look of someone who insists the buck stop on his desk.
	Ludlow flips open a file, pulls out a stack of black and white
	eight by tens, and tosses them on the table.

				LUDLOW
			(an accent similar to
			 Hammond's)
		These pictures were taken in a
		hospital in Costa Rica forty-eight
		hours ago, after an American family
		on a yacht cruise stumbled onto Site
		B.  The little girl will be fine, but
		her parents are wealthy, angry, and
		very fond of lawsuits.  But that's
		hardly new to us, is it?
			(takes a paper from the
			 file)
		Wrongful death settlements, partial
		list:  family of Donald Gennaro, 36.5
		million dollars; family of Robert
		Muldoon, 12.6 million.  Damaged or
		destroyed equipment, 17.3 million.
		Demolition, de-construction, and
		disposal of Isla Nublar facilities,
		organic and inorganic, one hundred
		and twenty-six million dollars.  The
		list goes on, gentlemen -- research
		funding, media payoffs.  Silence is
		expensive.

	He's warming up.  Not a bad performer.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		This corporation has been bleeding
		from the throat for four years.  You,
		our board of directors, have set
		patiently and listened to ecology
		lectures while Mr. Hammond signed
		your checks and spent your money.
		You have watched your stock drop from
		seventy-eight and a quarter to
		nineteen flat with no good and in
		sight.  And all along, we have held a
		significant product asset that we
		could have safely harvested and
		displayed for profit.  Enormous
		profit.

	He reaches out to a model on the table and gives it a shove,
	sending it sliding down the length of the table in front of
	them.  It's a mini-mall version of a zoo.  Cages hold tiny
	replicas of various kinds of dinosaurs while Boy Scout troops
	and Tourists look on in wonder.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Enough money to wipe out four years
		of lawsuits and damage control and
		unpleasant infighting, enough to not
		only send our stock back to where it
		was but to double it.  And the one
		thing, the only thing standing
		between us and this asset is a
		born-again naturalist who happens to
		be our own CEO.  Well, I don't work
		for Mother Nature.  I work for you.

	Two of his Backbenchers distribute documents from a stack.
	Ludlow takes one and reads from it.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		"Whereas the Chief Executive
		Officer has engaged in wasteful and
		negligent business practices to
		further his own personal
		environmental beliefs --
		Whereas these practices have 
		affected the financial performance
		of the company by incurring
		significant losses --
		Whereas the shareholders have been
		materially harmed by these losses --
		Thereby, be it resolved that John
		Parker Hammond should be resolved from
		the office of Chief Executive
		Officer, affective immediately."  Mr.
		Chairman, I move the resolution be
		put to an immediate vote.  Do I have
		a second?

				BOARD MEMBER
		I second the motion,  Mr. Chairman,
		Please poll the members by a show of
		hands.

	The CHAIRMAN signs heavily, feeling like a traitor.  He can't
	bear to look at Hammond on the TV monitor.

				CHAIRMAN
		All those in favor of InGen Corporate
		Resolution 213C, please signify your
		approval by raising your right hand.

	It starts slowly, guiltily, but every hand in the room goes
	up.  Ludlow sits back, victorious.  Hammond, furious, raises
	his right hand, which holds a remote control, and points it at
	the TV screen.  It goes blank.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. WELDER'S YARD - NIGHT

	Sparks fly out the windows and doors of a shed in the middle
	of a welder's yard.  Scrap iron and steel lies everywhere.
	Somewhere inside the shed, a phone RINGS.

	The WHOOSH of the arc welder shuts off.  DIETER STARK, a big
	barrel-chested man of forty or so, his face streaked with soot
	and grime, steps outside with a cordless phone, a cigarette
	dangling from his lips.

				DIETER
		Yeah.

	He takes a deep drag while someone talks on the other end.  He
	smiles and blows out a cloud of smoke.

							CUT TO:
	INT. NEW YORK SUBWAY - NIGHT

	Smoke turns into steam as a subway THUNDER into a station
	underneath Manhattan.  The door WHOOSH open, spit out some
	COMMUTERS and suck up a few more.

	A tall man hurries down the platform, limping heavily, moving
	as fast as he can.  The subway doors begin to close, but just
	before they meet --

	-- the man jams a cane in between, stopping them.  The man
	is IAN MALCOLM, fortyish, dressed in black from head to toe.
	There's a hard wisdom in Malcolm's eyes that may not have been
	there's a few years ago -- he know what you think, and he
	doesn't care.

	INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT

	MALCOLM finds a seat on the crowded subway car and sits down.
	He looks awful.  Tired.  Weathered.  He notices a CURIOUS MAN
	across from his is staring at his.  Malcolm looks away.  The
	Curious Man still stares.  Nervy, the Curious Man gets up and
	approaches.

				MALCOLM
			(under his breath)
		Shit.

	The Curious Man sits down next to Malcolm, grinning.

				MAN
		You're him, aren't you?

				MALCOLM
		Excuse me?

				MAN
		The guy.  The scientist.  I saw you
		on TV.
			(conspiratorially)
		I believed you.

	No response from Malcolm.  The guy leans in even closer.

				MAN (cont'd)
		Roooooarr.

				MALCOLM
			(a withering look)
		I was misquoted.  I was merely
		speculating on the evolutionary
		scenario of a Lost World.  I never
		said I was in any such place.

	He gets up and moves to another seat on the car, away from the
	Curious Man.  As he sits down, he notices two other COMMUTERS
	across from him are staring at him.

	He looks at them.  They looks away.

	He pulls the collar of his coat up tight around him.  Nowhere
	to hide.

	INT. JOHN HAMMOND'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	A UNIFORMED BUTLER has a question:

				BUTLER
		Whom shall I tell Mr. Hammond is
		calling?

	MALCOLM stands in the foyer of an expensively decorated Park
	Avenue apartment.

				MALCOLM
		Ian Malcolm

	A door opens and a little dog comes YAPPING out of the back.
	It bounds straight at Malcolm, GROWLING, jaws SNAPPING.  It
	lunges --

	-- and Malcolm BATS it away with one swift swing of his cane.
	The dog rolls across the floor and slinks away, WHINING.  The
	Butler looks at Malcolm disapprovingly.
	
				BUTLER
		Not an animal lover?

				MALCOLM
		Not really.

	INT. HAMMOND'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	MALCOLM enters a darkened bedroom.  JOHN HAMMOND lies in the
	bed we saw earlier, on the other side of the room;

	Medical equipment has been disguised as well as possible among
	the furniture and flowers, but the sheer abundance of it tells
	us that whatever has stricken him is going to win this battle.

				HAMMOND
		Ian!  Don't linger in the doorway
		like an ingenue, come in, come in!

	Malcolm steps further into the room.

				HAMMOND (cont'd)
		It's good to see you.  It really is.
		How's the leg?

				MALCOLM
		Resentful.

				HAMMOND
		When you have a lot of time to think,
		it's funny who you remember.  It's
		the people who challenged you.  It is
		the quality of our opponents that
		gives our accomplishments meaning.  I
		never told you how sorry I was about
		what happened after we returned.
	
	Noticing Hammond's deteriorated condition, Malcolm finds it
	hard to sustain anger.
	
				MALCOLM
		I didn't know you -- weren't well.
		
				HAMMOND
		It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are
		finally killing me.
		
				MALCOLM
		They do have motives.  Why did you
		want to see me?  Your message said it
		was urgent.
		
				HAMMOND
		You were right -- and I was wrong.
		There!  Did you ever think you'd hear
		me say that?  Spectacularly wrong.
		Instead of observing those animals, I
		tried to control them.  I squandered
		an opportunity and we still know next
		to nothing about their lives.  Not
		their lives as man would have them,
		behind electric fences, but in the
		wild.  Behavior in their natural
		habitat, the impossible dream of any
		paleontologist.  I could have had it,
		but I let it slip away.
			(pause)
		Thank God for Site B.
		
	Malcolm just looks at him for a long moment.
	
				MALCOLM
		What?
		
				HAMMOND
			(a spark in his eye)
		Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle
		compact to you?
		
				MALCOLM
		What are you talking about?
	
				HAMMOND
		The hatchery, in particular?  You
		know my initial yields had to be low,
		far less than one percent, that's a
		thousand embryos for every single
		live birth.  Genetic engineering on
		that scale implies a giant operation,
		not the spotless little laboratory I
		showed you.

				MALCOLM
		I don't believe you.

				HAMMOND
		Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian,
		something for the tourists, Site B
		was the factory floor.  We built it
		first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some
		miles from Nublar.

				MALCOLM
		No, no, no, no, no, no . . .

				HAMMOND
		After the accident at the park, a
		hurricane wiped out our facility on
		Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave
		the animals to fend for themselves.
		And they did.  For four years I've
		fought to keep them safe from human
		meddling, now I want you to go there
		and document them.

				MALCOLM
		Are you out of your mind?  I still
		have nightmares, my reputation's a
		joke, my leg is shot -- you think I
		need more of that?

				HAMMOND
		It would be the most extraordinary
		living fossil record the world has
		ever seen.

				MALCOLM
		So what?

	Hammonnd picks up a thick file folder from the night table near
	to him and open it on his lap.  Inside, there are memos,
	charts, maps and photographs.

				HAMMOND
		I've been putting this together for
		over a year.
			(MORE)
		I have personal suggestions for your
		entire team, phone numbers, contact
		people.  They won't believe you about
		what they're going to see, so don't
		bother trying to convince them.  Just
		use my checkbook to get them there.
		I'll fund your expedition through my
		personal accounts, as such money and
		equipment as you need, but only if
		you leave immediately.  If we
		hesitate, all will be lost.

				MALCOLM
		John . . .

				HAMMOND
		You'll need an animal behaviorist,
		someone with unimpeachable
		credentials.  I believe you already
		know Sarah Harding.  She's got
		theories about parenting and
		nurturing among hunter/scavengers I
		bet she'd be dying to prove on a
		scale like this.  If you convince her
		to go, it'll be a major coup.  When
		she publishes, the scientific
		community must take it seriously.

	Malcolm just shakes his head, flipping through the file sadly.

				HAMMOND
		Your documentation, you should use
		forensic photographic methods,
		Hasselbladt still cameras, high
		definition video.  When the trick
		photography analysts take your
		evidence apart, make it impossible
		for them to say there was enhancement
		or computer graphic imaging.  Oh,
		this is very important -- avoid the
		island interior at all costs.  Stick
		to the outer rim.  Everything you
		need to know can be found there.
		Vindication lies on the outer rim.

	Malcolm gently closes the file and pushes it back to Hammond.

				MALCOLM
		I'm not going, John.

				HAMMOND
			(fatigue returning)
		Ian, you are my last chance to give
		something of real value to the world.
		I can't walk so far and leave no
		footprints; die and leave nothing
		with my name on it.  I will not  be
		known only for my failures.  And you
		will not allow yourself to go down in
		history as a lunatic.  You're too
		smart.  You'e too proud.  Dr.
		Malcolm.  Please.  This is a chance
		at redemption.  For both of us.
		There's no time to equivocate, we
		must seize it now, before --

	He stops, staring over Malcom's shoulder.  Malcom turns.
	PETER LUDLOW, still in his overcoat, is standing in the
	doorway to the bedroom.  He looks back and forth from Hammond
	to Malcolm suspiciously.

				LUDLOW
		Hello, Uncle John.  Dr. Malcolm.

	Malcolm doesn't answer.  He seems to know Ludlow, and dislikes
	him.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Did I interrupt something?

	Malcolm turns back to Hammond.

				MALCOLM
		Find someone else.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HAMMOND'S APARTMENT/FOYER - NIGHT

	In the foyer, LUDLOW hands MALCOLM his coat, just a trifle
	rudely, and shepherds him to the door.

				LUDLOW
		So, you two were just, uh, telling
		old campfire stories, were you?

				MALCOLM
		Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a
		second that you and I don't know the
		truth.  You can convince Time
		magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer
		of whatever you want, but I was 
		there.

				LUDLOW
		You signed a non-disclosure agreement
		before you went to the island that
		expressly forbade you from discussing
		anything you saw.  You violated that
		agreement.

				MALCOLM
		You cost me my livelihood.  That on
		which I relied to support my
		children.

				LUDLOW
		If your university felt you were
		causing it embarrassment by selling
		wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly
		see how I am to--

				MALCOLM
		I didn't tell anything, I told the
		truth.

				LUDLOW
		You version of it.

				MALCOLM
		There are no versions of the truth!
		This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's
		my life.

				LUDLOW
		We made a generous compensatory offer
		for your injuries.

				MALCOLM
		It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen
		never--

				LUDLOW
		InGen is my livelihood, Dr.
		Malcolm, and I will jealously defend
		its interests.  People will know what
		I want them to know when I want them
		to know it.

	Ludlow tosses something to Malcolm, hard.  It sails across the
	foyer, upright, and Malcolm reaches out and catches it with
	one hand.  It's his cane.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Don't forget that.

	Malcolm stares at him for a long moment.  Finally, he turns
	and walks away.

	But he does not out of the apartment.  Instead, he
	walks directly past Ludlow, crosses the living room, and steps
	back into Hammond's bedroom, closing the door behind him with
	a determined CLICK.

	INT. HAMMOND'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	HAMMOND looks up, hopeful, as MALCOLM comes back into the room
	and walks over to his bed.  He reaches down --

	-- and picks up the file folder.

				MALCOLM
		Do you have a satellite phone?

	INT. MOMBASSA BAR - DAY

	ROLAND TEMBO, late sixties, skin like leather and the diamond
	hard look of a cobra, sits at a table in the middle of an
	African cafe/bar in Mombassa.

	It's daytime and the place is half full, mostly with locals,
	but there are a few obnoxious TOURISTS too, Americans on
	safari who somehow found the local handout.

	They're a noisy bunch, but Roland tunes them out, calmly
	eating his lunch and drinking a beer while he reads a book,
	eyeglasses hanging low on his nose.

	Roland suddenly stops reading and furrows his brow.  He looks
	up.  He SNIFFS the air once, then smiles and calls out a
	person's name.

				ROLAND
		Ajay?

	He turns around.  AJAY (AH-jay) SIDHU, a wiry East Indian in
	his late forties, is standing behind him, caught trying to
	sneak up.

				AJAY
			(delighted)
		How did you know?

				ROLAND
			(taps his nose)
		That cheap aftershave I send you
		every Christmas, you actually wear
		it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit
		down, what brings you to Mombassa?

				AJAY
		You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the
		last time you answered your phone?

				ROLAND
		Last time I plugged it in, I suppose.
		Why?

	Behind them, the group of TOURISTS, all men, laughs loudly.
	One of them, the MOST OBNOXIOUS TOURISTS, berates the WAITRESS.

				AJAY
		I got a call from a gentleman who's
		going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts.
		If he's to be believed, it's a most,
		uh, unique expedition.  And very
		well-funded.

				ROLAND
		Well, I'm a very well-funded old son
		of a bitch.  You go.

	The Most Obnoxious Tourist bellows for the Waitress.  His
	buddies LAUGHS.  Roland throws a glance, annoyed.

				AJAY
		But alone?  We always had great
		success together, you and I.

				ROLAND
		Just a little bit too much, I
		think.

				AJAY
		How do you mean?

				ROLAND
		A true hunter doesn't mind if the
		animal wins.  If it escapes.  But
		there weren't enough escapes from you
		and me, Ajay.  I've decided to spend
		a bit less time in the company of
		death.  Maybe I just feel too close
		to it my--

	The Waitress comes to the Tourists' table and the Most
	Obnoxious Tourist actually paws her ass.  Roland is out of his
	chair in a second.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
			(to Ajay)
		Excuse me.

	Romand walks over to the Tourists' table, says something to
	the Waitress in the local dialect, and she walks away, behind
	him.  He stares down at the Most Obnoxious Tourist.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		You, sir -- are no gentleman.

				TOURIST
		Is that supposed to be an insult?

				ROLAND
		I can think of none greater.

	The Tourist looks at his Buddies and laughs.

				TOURIST
		Buzz off, you silly old bastard.

				ROLAND
		What do I have to do to pick a fight
		with you, bring your mother into it?

				TOURIST
		Are you kidding?  I could take you
		with one arm tied down.

				ROLAND
		Really?

	IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR,

	the Waiter finishes tying a man's wrist to his belt in the
	back of his pants with a napkin.  He pulls the knot tight and
	the man turns around.

	It's Roland, with his arm tied down.  The Tourist stands
	across from him.

				TOURIST
		I mean my arm.

	POW!  Roland punches him square in the jaw.  The Tourist
	reels, stunned.  Enraged, he lunges at Roland, swinging with
	both arms.

	Roland bobs, neatly ducking the punches, waits for the Tourist
	to turn around, and POPS him thrice in the face.  The Tourist
	spins and goes down to the floor, face first.  A cloud of
	sawdust and a loud CHEER from the locals rise up in the bar.

	BACK AT HIS TABLE,

	Roland drops the napkin on the table and sits back down with
	Ajay.  In the background, the Tourist's Buddies hurriedly
	carry their fallen cohort out of the bar.

				ROLAND
		Sorry.  We were saying?

				AJAY
		You broke that idiot's jaw for no
		reason other than your boredom.  Tell
		the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even
		interested in knowing this
		expedition's quarry?

				ROLAND
		Ajay.  Go on up to my ranch, take a
		look around the trophy room, and tell
		me what kind of quarry you think
		could possibly be of any interest
		to me.

	Ajay just smiles.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. AFRICAN SAVANNAH - NIGHT

	The African savannah appears in shades of fluorescent green,
	seen through night-vision goggles.  An ANIMAL YELP comes from
	the left and the green vista sweeps abruptly toward it.  The
	world blurs momentarily, then comes into focus on a field of
	long grass.

	The grass ripples in a complex pattern as animals move
	stealthily through it.  One animal head pops up above the
	grass for a split-second, teeth bared, a white stripe between
	its eyes.  SARAH HARDING pulls the goggles away from her face.

				SARAH
		Hyenas.  Ace Face is the striped
		snout.

	Sarah is thirty, with a compact, athletic body built for the
	outdoors.  She loos through the goggles again, sweeping ahead
	of the hyenas to their prey.

	It's a herd of African buffalo, standing belly-deep in the
	grass, agitated, bellowing and stamping their feet.

	Sarah turns to MAKENA, her African assistant.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		They'll try to take down a calf.
		Come on.

				MAKENA
		Closer?

	Sarah scurries up and over a rock face.  Makena follows.
	Closer now, they watch as the hyenas rush the herd, running
	through it, trying to break it up.

				MAKENA (cont'd)
		You know, we could see everything
		from up on the edge of that cliff.

				SARAH
		No way.

				MAKENA
		But the view would --

				SARAH
		No cliffs.
			(into a pocket recorder)
		F1 headed sough, F2 and F5 flanking,
		twenty yards.  F3 center.  F6
		circling wide east.  Can't see F7.

	While she talks, breathless, fascinated by the drama before
	her, Sarah continues to creep closer and closer to the action.
	Makena follows, with growing unease.

				MAKENA
		Sarah.

				SARAH
		F8 circling north.  F1 straight
		through, disrupting.  Herd moving,
		stamping.  There's F7.  Straight
		through.  F8 angling through from the
		north.

	She's practically on top of the animals now.

				MAKENA
		Dr. Harding.

	Makena has a hold of Sarah's sweatshirt and is tugging her
	back, at least trying to slow down her progress as Sarah,
	wide-eyed with fascination, creeps even closer.

	Suddenly there is a tremendous BELLOWING and the grass right
	in front of them rips apart, trampled under the feet of the
	hyenas as they cluster around a fallen buffalo calf.  They
	yelp and jump, their muzzles bloody.

	The adults move aside, making room as the hyena pups come
	forward, squealing to get at the kill.  Sarah's eyes shine
	with excitement and she moves even closer, whispering into the
	tape recorder.

				SARAH
		Brooding behavior in evidence at the
		kill site, pups are ushered forward
		and adults help them eat, pulling
		flesh away from the carcass and--

	A telephone rings.

	Sarah stops in mid-sentence, unsure if she heard what she
	thought she heard.  It rings again, the unmistakable CHIRPING
	of a cellular phone.  Sarah and Makena both move at once,
	pawing at a backpack.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			(a frantic whisper)
		I thought you turned it off!

	Two hyenas look inquisitively in the direction of the phone.
	Sarah comes up with it and jabs at a button in irritation.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		Yes?!

	Someone speaks on the other end.  Sarah rolls her eyes.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		Ian.  This better be important.

	Sarah doesn't say anything for a long moment, just listens as
	the voice on the other end talks.  And talks.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		When?

							CUT TO:

	INT. MOBILE FIELD SYSTEMS - DAY

	Ian Malcolm's leg, badly scarred, is bared and draped over the
	end of a bench.  Two sandbags are fastened to his ankle and
	MALCOLM is lifting them, painfully rehabbing his injury while
	talking on a satellite phone.

				MALCOLM
		We leave in twenty-four hours.  Five
		member team.

	Behind them, the SPARKS of a acetylene torch fly as WORKMEN
	make modifications on several vehicles, including a dark-green
	Mercedes Benz AAV (all-activity vehicle).  The hood of the AAV
	is up and the V-6 engine has been pulled out; a new, smaller
	engine is lowered in its place.  To one side are two long
	trailers, connected by an accordion-like passageway, like on a
	subway car, allowing one to be towed behind the other.

				MALCOLM
		Eddie Carr's handling all our
		equipment and he'll be there to
		maintain it.  He's designing special
		field trailers now, top of the line
		mobile research units.

	EDDIE CARR, fortyish, is barking out orders to the Workmen.

				EDDIE
		No, no, look at the plans, Henry,
		you can't place that strut laterally,
		it has to be crosswise, LOOK AT THE
		PLANS!

	From the ceiling, a large metal age CRASHES down, landing
	next to them on the floor with a deafening CLANG.  They leap
	back and look up.  A WORKMAN waves from a scaffolding.

				WORKMAN
		Sorry, Eddie!  Specs say it can't
		deform at 12,000 PSI, we had to test
		it

	Eddie bends down to inspect the cage, which is rectangular,
	constructed of inch-thick titanium-alloy bars.  Malcolm hangs
	up the phone and walks up, joining him.

				MALCOLM
		Any damage?

				EDDIE
		Minimal.

				MALCOLM
		"Minimal" is too much.   It has to be
		light, it has to be strong --

				EDDIE
		Light and strong, light and strong,
		sure, why not, it's only impossible.
		God save me from academics.

				MALCOLM
		You are an academic.

				EDDIE
		Former academic.  Now I actually make
		things.  I don't just talk.

				MALCOLM
		You think I'm all talk, Eddie?

				EDDIE
			(doesn't look at him)
		It doesn't matter what I think.

				MALCOLM
		Is there anything we've forgotten?
		Anything at all?

	Behind them, someone CLEARS THEIR THROAT.  Eddie and Malcolm
	turn around.  KELLY MALCOLM, an African-American girl around
	twelve years old, stands in the doorway to the garage, a
	duffel bag slung over one shoulder.  She looks at Malcolm and
	breaks into a wide grin.

				KELLY
		Hi, Dad.

				MALCOLM
		Kelly!  What are you doing here?

	She drops the bag on the floor, and wraps her arms around him
	in a warm embrace.  He responds stiffly.

				KELLY
		Vacation.  I'm all yours.  You didn't
		forget, did you?

	She pulls back and looks at him.

				KELLY (cont'd)
		Did you?

							CUT TO:

	INT. EDDIE'S OFFICE - DAY

	KELLY is slumped in a chair in Eddie's office next to the
	construction floor.  Outside the glass windows work on the
	vehicles continues unabated.  MALCOLM hangs up the phone.

				MALCOLM
		Okay, Karen is expecting you in half
		an hour.  You only have to stay with
		her one night, she'll put you on a
		bus in the morning and your mother
		will be at the station when you get
		there.

				KELLY
		I don't even know this woman.

				MALCOLM
		Well, I do, and she's fantastic.
		She'll take you to the museum, maybe
		to a movie if you play your cards
		right.  You're going to have a
		fantastic time.

				KELLY
		Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you
		going?

				MALCOLM
		I can't tell you.  But I'll be back
		within a week.

				KELLY
		My vacation is over in a week.

				MALCOLM
		I'll make it up to you this summer.
		I promise.

				KELLY
		I'm your daughter all the time, you
		know.  Not just when it's convenient.

				MALCOLM
		Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you
		to say that?

				KELLY
		No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own
		once in a while.

	From the construction floor, EDDIE calls out.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
		Dr. Malcolm!

	Malcolm looks at her, trying to make peace.  Quickly.

				MALCOLM
		Is that kid still bothering you?

				KELLY
		Which one?

				MALCOLM
		You know, at the bus stop.  With the
		hair?

				KELLY
		That was about a year ago.

				MALCOLM
		Well, is he?

				KELLY
		No.  Richard talked to his parents.

				MALCOLM
		That Richard.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
		Ian, come here a minute!

				KELLY
			(to Malcolm)
		I could come with you.

				MALCOLM
		Out of the question.  You'd miss the
		gymnastics trials.  You've been
		training for that for a year.

				KELLY
		I don't care about the trials, I
		want to be with you.  I could be your
		research assistant, like I was in
		Austin.

				MALCOLM
		This is nothing like Austin.  Forget
		about it.

				KELLY
		You like to have kids, you just
		don't want to be with them, do you?

	He looks at her, hurt.  Eddie calls out a third time,
	impatient now.  Grateful for the escape, Malcolm gets up and
	heads for the door.  He pauses guiltily.

				MALCOLM
		I'm not like you wan me to be.  I've
		what I can be.

	He leaves.

	INT. MAIN FLOOR - DAY

	While MALCOLM and EDDIE argue over something in the
	background, KELLY circles around the trailers and looks up at
	the windows.  They're all made of tempered glass, fine wire
	mesh inside it.  She looks around, to see if anybody's
	watching.  They're not, so she quickly slips inside the front
	trailer.

	INT. TRAILER - DAY

	Inside, the trailer is a miracle of planning and design.  It's
	divided into sections, for different laboratory functions.
	The main area is a biological lab, with specimen trays,
	dissecting pans, and microscopes that connect to video
	monitors.

	Next to it there's an extensive computer section, a bank of
	processors, and a communications section.  All the lab
	equipment is miniaturized and built into small tables that
	slides into the walls.  Everything is bolted down.

	She notices a large map on the wall.  Off the coat of Costa
	Rica, there is an area that has been circled in heavy black
	ink.

	Kelly puts a finger on the map, crossing westward, through the
	Pacific Ocean.  Thegre are dozen s of islands out here, but in
	the highlighted region, there is a semi-circle of five.
	Matanceros.  Muerte.  Tacano.  Pena.  And Sorna.  Underneath
	the whole island chain, there is a bold legend.

	"The Five Deaths," it says.

	Slowly, an ocean barge starts to chug its way across the
	face of the map, leaving a wake that rolls the printed letters
	of those three ominous words.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. OPEN SEA - DAY

	The map dissolves slowly away as the barge SPALASEHS through
	five foot ocean swells in the open sea.  The barge is crammed
	with equipment, the AAV, trailers, a jeep, and the members of
	Malcolm's team.

	ON THE BOAT,

	MALCOLM stands in the bow, riding the choppy seas.  Next to
	him, DR. JUTTSON, fortyish, holds onto the railing,
	seasick.  He SHOUTS over the DRONE of the boat's engines.

				JUTTISON
			(as the waves pound the
			 boat)
		Couldn't -- we just -- airlift --
		into the -- island?

				MALCOLM
		Dr. Harding insisted we go by sea!
		Helicopters are too disruptive.
		These aren't piles of bones you'll be
		studying this time, Dr. Juttson, they
		live, they breathe, and they react!

	Juttson looks at him skeptically --

	-- and throws up.

	AT THE BACK OF THE BOAT,

	NICK VAN OWEN, a good-looking American in his late
	twenties, is sitting amid a pile of video cameras and other
	photographic equipment, playing with a Game Bow.  SARAH
	HARDING, dressed in field gear, sits down next to him.

				SARAH
		So what's your story, Nick?

				NICK
		I was a cameraman for Nightline for
		six years, been freelance since '91.
		Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.

				SARAH
		That must be interesting.  What drew
		you there?

				NICK
		Women.  'Bout eighty percent female
		in Greenpeace.

				SARAH
		Very noble of you.
			(of the noisy Game Boy)
		You don't think you're bringing that
		thing onto the island, do you?

	Nick grins and shuts it off.

				NICK
		Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the
		woolly mammoths.

				SARAH
		You think this is all a joke?

				NICK
		Oh, please.  How am I supposed to
		keep a straight face when --
			(gestures to the
			 black-clad Malcolm)
		-- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm
		going to Skull Island?

				SARAH
			(not amused)
		Ian's a very good friend of mine.

				NICK
		He doesn't need a friend, he needs a
		shrink.

				SARAH
		I believe in him.

	But her face says even she has her doubts.

				NICK
		Come on, there's only one reason any
		of us are here.  His check cleared.

	She looks at him.

				SARAH
		Drop the cynical pose.  You can't
		pull it off while playing Donkey
		Kong.

	The boat's CAPTAIN, a Costa Rican, points ahead and SHOUTS to
	them.

				CAPTAIN
		There it is!

	They all turn and look out over the bow.  Up ahead, shear,
	reddish-gray cliffs of volcanic rock rise dramatically out of
	the fog-heavy ocean.

				CAPTAIN (cont'd)
		Isla Sorna!

	The boat ROARS ahead, plowing into a heavy wreath of fog.  The
	mist swirls and encircles it.

	EXT. ISLAND FIORD - DAY

	A narrow inlet cuts through the steep cliffs, leading to the
	island interior.  The barge bursts through the fog at the
	mouth of the fiord and heads deeper into the island.

	EXT. LAGOON - DAY

	Lush green plants drip everywhere in this verdant lagoon.
	Sulfurous yellow steam issues from the ground, bleaching the
	nearby foliage white.  In the distance one can hear the cries
	of JUNGLE BIRDS.

	The boat is now beached and the CREW flips the tarps off the
	AAV, the jeep, and the trailers.  The trucks back down a
	narrow ramp and onto the soft clay shore at the edge of the
	lagoon.  There is a large three-toad animal imprint in the
	clay at the water's edge, and the AAV backs right over it,
	swapping its track for the animal's.

	MALCOLM is at the edge of the water with the CAPTAIN.

				MALCOLM
		Be back in three days, but keep the
		satellite phone on and your radio
		tuned to the frequency I specified in
		case we need you sooner.

				CAPTAIN
		Don't worry.  I've lived around here
		all my life, these islands are
		completely --

	In the distance, they hear the faint, strange ROAR of a very
	large animal.  The Captain looks at Malcolm, eyes wide.

				CAPTAIN (cont'd)
		-- safe.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. GRASSY PLAIN - DAY

	The jeep tows the double trailer to the edge of a grassy plain
	just beyond the lagoon, overlooking the interior of the
	island.  The noon sun is high overhead; below, the valley
	shimmers in midday heat.

	EDDIE connects a flexible cable to the jeep's power winch and
	flicks it on.  The cable turns slowly in the sunlight.  Moving
	along the length of it, we see the cable leads to a pile of
	aluminum, some kind of strut assembly painted a camouflage
	color.

	As the winch pulls the cable tight, the jumble of thin struts
	begins to move, slowly rising into the air.  The emerging
	structure climbs, spidery, struts unfolding, fifteen feet into
	the air.  The light house at the top (the cage that was
	tested back at Eddie's workshop) is now just beneath the
	lowest branches of the nearby trees, which almost conceal it
	from view.

	NICK lights a cigarette and carelessly tosses the match on the
	ground.  Malcolm notices.

				MALCOLM
		Listen.  I know you all have probably
		concluded that I'm out of my mind.

	Is it our imagination, or did the trees behind Malcolm just
	sway slightly?

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		That's all right, for now.  But just
		humor me and be careful.

	No, it's not our imagination, there they go again.  Whole
	trees shivering and swaying from left to right and back
	again.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		Even if you think I'm harmless and
		deluded, I promise --

	Now the trees CREAKS and GROAN as they sway.  Everyone has seen
	it, and now Malcolm turns around too.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		-- this place is for real.

							CUT TO:

	INT. DOUBLE TRAILERS - DAY

	It's quiet inside the trailers that serve as their command
	post/living quarters.  The books are lined up neatly on the
	shelves.  The computers sit, booted up and awaiting data
	input.

	All the way in the back, past the spare tires and life
	preservers and canned food and bottled water, up in one
	storage bin all the way on top, there's a RUSTLING SOUND.

	A plastic student ID card pops out in the cracks under the
	bin's door.  A photograph in the lower right hand corner of
	the card is visible -- it's Kelly, Malcolm's twelve-year-old
	daughter.

	The card wriggles against the lock and, with a soft CLICK, the
	door pops open.  KELLY herself tumbles out, wrapped in several
	blankets and carrying a mason jar half full of a yellowish
	liquid.  We can guess.

	She leaps to her feet, blinks the light out of her eyes, and
	bolts to the back of the trailer as fast as she possibly can.
	She races through a narrow door and SLAMS it shut.

	A sign on the door says "RESTROOM."  Inside, a SIGH of relief
	is heard.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. JUNGLE TRAIL - DAY

	Along a stream bed, the jungle trees still shiver.  NICK loads
	a three quarter inch tape into his heavy video camera and
	chews anxiously on a piece of gum.  SARAH and DR. JUTTSON are
	beside him as the group nervously follows the GROANING forest
	trees to their right.

	At the rear, EDDIE and MALCOLM walk side by side.  Eddie is
	carrying a heavy silver rifle, an aluminum canister hanging
	beneath the barrel.  He shows it to Malcolm, his voice low and
	urgent.

				EDDIE
		Lindstradt air rifle.  Fires a
		subsonic Fluger impact-delivery dart.

	He cracks open the cartridge bank, revealing a row of plastic
	containers filled with straw-colored liquid.  Each is tipped
	with a three inch needle and carries a bright yellow warning
	tag -- "EXTREME DANGER!  LETHAL TOXICITY!"

				EDDIE (cont'd)
		I loaded the enhanced venom of Conus
		purpurascens, the South Sea cone
		shell.  Most powerful neurotoxin in
		the world.  Acts within a
		two-thousandth of a second.  Faster
		than the nerve-conduction velocity.
		The animal's down before it feels the
		prick of the dart.

	From their right, the shaking trees seen closer now.  By
	walking down the stream bed, the humans are tracking right
	along with the animals as they move in the foliage.

				MALCOLM
			(to Eddie)
		Is there an antidote?

				EDDIE
		Like if you shoot yourself in the
		foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be
		dead  before you realized you'd
		accidentally pulled the trigger.

	Ahead of them, thick foliage blocks the path of the dried up
	stream bed to the height of about fifteen feet.  But around
	them, the CRASHING sounds get louder and closer, the swaying
	trees shiver right beside them.  Eddie raises the rifle in
	defense as the trees right at the edge of the stream bed sway
	and part.  Above the foliage, they see the sudden
	movement --

	-- of a row of STEGOSAUR fins.  The spade-shaped fins run
	along a ridge down the middle of the animal's back, about
	three feet tall each.  The group freezes, amazed, and as the
	stegosaur continues on, they get a good look at it through a
	break in the foliage.

	It's a large dinosaur with a small head, a thick neck, and a
	huge lumbering body.

	A double row of plates runs along the crest of its back, and
	it has a dragging trail with long spikes in it.

	The gum drops out of Nick's mouth, FLOPS onto his shirt, and
	sticks there.

				NICK
		Oh --

				JUTTSON
		-- my --

				EDDIE
		-- God!

				SARAH
		It's beautiful!

	A second stegosaur, a baby about a quarter the size of the
	first animal, breaks through the foliage, following the adult.

	While the group is reaching to that, the earth vibrates and
	a third stego, by far the biggest of the three, walks out of
	the foliage right behind them, crossing within ten feet.

	Apparently unconcerned about these little creatures in their
	environment, the stegos continue on across the stream bed.

	Sarah raises a still camera and shoots pictures.  Her shutter
	is muted, so that a muffled CLICK is all that's audible.

	Juttson raises a pocket recorder to his lips and whispers into
	it breathlessly.

				JUTTSON
		Stegosaurus, family Stegosauridae,
		infraorder Stegosauria, suborder
		Thyreophora.  Length, adult male,
		estimate twenty-five to thirty feet.

	His breathy words turn into almost helpless laughter, of all
	things, as he can't contain his astonishment.  Eddie covers
	his mouth, trying to keep him quiet.

				SARAH
			(to Juttsn)
		That was a pair bond!  A family
		group, even, long after that infant
		was nestbound!

				JUTTSON
		I want to see the nesting ground!

	Nick turns to Malcolm, eyes like saucers, and makes a futile,
	wordless, boy-was-I-wrong-on-this-one gesture.  Malcolm
	smiles, leans over, and TAPS softly on Nick's video camera.
	Nick raises it to his shoulder and flicks it on as the group
	continues on into the bush after the animals.

	IN THE BUSH,

	the baby wanders away from the group and ambles over near
	where Sarah crouches in the bushes.  Sarah raises her camera
	again and silently SNAPS a picture.  She WHISPERS to Juttson,
	who is beside her.

				SARAH
		Lone nest -- not colonial.  I don't
		see an egg clutch...

	She gestures and Juttson peers through a pair of field
	glasses.

				JUTTSON
			(whispering back)
		The empty shells are crushed and
		trampled.  The young stay in the
		birth environment, that's conclusive!

				SARAH
		Not without a shot of the nest.

	She sees an opportunity.  As the baby heads back to its
	parents, Sarah scoots right along with it, moving behind it,
	using its body as a shield to block her from the view of the
	other two.

	Nick and Eddie's faces whiten in alarm.  Nick reaches out to
	stop her, but he barely gets hold of the sole of her boot
	before she pulls away from him and duckwalks out into the
	clearing.

	IN THE CLEARING,

	Sarah slinks along behind the baby stego as it walks back,
	toward the nest, chewing the branches it carries in its south.
	She raises up sightly, squeezing off pictures of the herd,
	ever better as she gets closer.

	BACK AT THE HILL,

	the others can only watch her, aghast.

				NICK
		She's gutty.

				MALCOLM
		She's nuts.

	IN THE CLEARING,

	Sarah keeps moving closer.  The baby passes a small grouping
	of rocks and Sarah ducks behind them.  She's now in a perfect
	position to photograph the nest, and she squeezes off picture
	after picture from this ideal vantage point.

	She shoots the last picture on the roll --

	-- and the camera's autowinder WHIRS to life.  Sarah looks
	down in horror as the camera's motor WHINES loudly in her
	hands.

	Th noise startles the animals.  The male turns toward her
	the plates on its back bristling.  Sarah gets to her feet and
	starts to move away, slowly.

	The male turns away from her and swings its tail, spikes
	extended.  It WHIZZES through the air, right at her, but Sarah
	leaps back at the last second --

	-- and the tail's spikes THUD into the dirt where she was.

	Sarah CRUNCHES to the ground and the three stegosaurs dart
	away, disappearing into the bush, moving surprisingly quickly
	for animals their size.

	The others run to Sarah, help her to her feet, and pull her
	back, against a massive tree trunk.  But the tree trunk lifts
	right up off the ground.

	It's no tree, it's a DINOSAUR'S LEG, a massive one, six feet
	across, God knows how many feet high.  The Group gasps and
	looks up as a MAKENCHIASAURUS, an enormous saurupod over a
	hundred feet from nose to tail,  lumbers away from them.

	The Group stares in wonder as the mamenchiasaur stops and
	HONKS furtively, its long neck stretched out above them.

	Now a second mamenchiasaur neck cranes out of the
	surrounding forest trees and wraps around the first.  The
	first mamenchiasaur THUNDERS around in a semi-circle, getting
	into position behind the second.

	Nick swings his video camera straight up and the group
	suddenly finds itself in the middle of a mamenchiasaur mating.

	The mighty tails swing and SNAP around them as the two animals
	come together, and trees start snapping and falling, CRASHING
	to the jungle floor.

	The group panics and bolts for cover toward the only place
	where the trees are not falling -- which is directly underneath
	the animals!

	Amid HONKS and BLEATS, the swinging tails continue to deforest
	the jungle around them.

	The noise and chaos is deafening, drowning out the LAUGHTER
	and SCREAMS of the fascinated and terrified group.

	There is a momentary lull and the group dashes out from
	underneath the animals, disappearing into the thick forest.

	A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY,

	the Group collapses to the ground, breathless, chests heaving
	with wild, frightened laughter.  Sarah goes to Malcolm and
	throws her arms around him, exhilarated.

				SARAH
		Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so
		glad!

				JUTTSON
			(out of breath)
		Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you
		an apology.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. JUNGLE TRAIL - DAY

	Suddenly, the Gathereres are taking their expedition a lot more
	seriously.  They march quickly back to base camp, their energy
	and excitement palpable.  NICK strikes a match and raises it
	to a cigarette with a shaking hand, but SARAH leans in and
	blows it out.

				SARAH
		No more smoking.  We leave no scent
		of any kind.  No hair tonics, no
		cologne, seal all our food in plastic
		bags.  We will observe and document,
		but we will not interact.

				MALCOLM
		That's a scientific impossibility,
		you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty
		principle.  Whatever you study, you
		also change.

	Nick ejects the used videotape from his camera and pulls out a
	sharpie, to label it.

				NICK
		What should I call this?  "Jurassic
		Pork?"

	Eddie, next to him, laughs.

				SARAH
			(still to Malcolm)
		And let's forget about the high hide.
		We can't do this kind of work up in a
		tower, we need to be out in the
		field, as close to the animals as
		possible.

				JUTTSON
		I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in
		a family group, but there's never
		been anything in the fossil record to
		prove the carnivores did.

				SARAH
		Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas,
		jackals, nearly all species of
		predator birds --

				JUTTSON
		That doesn't say a thing about T-rex,
		they could have been rogues.  Robert
		Burke certainly thinks they were.

				SARAH
		We've got to see one to find out.
		Is there any --

				MALCOLM
		No way.

				NICK
		Oh, my God.

				SARAH
		-- way we could safely --

				NICK
		Oh, no!

	He takes off, running as fast as he can, down the trail,
	toward base camp.  They look ahead, in the direction Nick is
	running.  A plume of black smoke is rising up over the trees.

				EDDIE
		Fire!

							CUT TO:

	EXT. BASE CAMP - DAY

	NICK bursts out of the trees and races toward the thick plume
	of smoke.  In the middle of the base camp, someone has neatly
	built a campfire surrounded by stones.  Flames burn in the
	middle.

	Nick races over to it and stomps it out as the OTHERS emerge
	from the trees behind him.

				MALCOLM
		A campfire?!

	Nick grabs a jug of water, but Sarah steps in.

				SARAH
		No!  Water mixes the smoke billow,
		use dirt!

	They start to kick and rake dirt onto the fire with their
	hands and feet.  Eddie and Dr. Juttson jump in and help out.

				MALCOLM
		Who the hell started a campfire?!

				VOICE (o.s.)
		It was just to make lunch.

	Malcolm turns toward the source of the voice.  KELLY stands in
	the doorway of the trailer, sheepish.

				KELLY (cont'd)
			I wanted it ready when you got back.

	The whole group stares, stunned, none more so than Malcolm
	himself.

				MALCOLM
		Oh ... man.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. BASE CAMP - LATER

	Later, and base camp is a blur of activity.  SARAH, JUTTSON,
	NICK, and EDDIE are hard at work, burying the remains of the
	fire, sealing their food in plastic bags, loading camera
	equipment, packing up specimen containers and other
	information-gathering equipment.

	MALCOLM, meanwhile, is lecturing Kelly.

				MALCOLM
		You know you were putting yourself in
		a potentially dangerous situation,
		but you didn't bother to find out
		how dangerous before you leapt in.
		You don't have the faintest idea
		what's going on on this island!

				SARAH
			(loading a backpack)
		What do you want to do, Ian, lock her
		up for curiosity?  Where do you think
		she gets it?

				JUTTSON
			(to Nick)
		Do you have chromium tapes?  The
		others fog in high-

				NICK
		-humidity, I know.
			(waving a tape)
		Highest lead density on the market.

				EDDIE
			(to Malcolm)
		We've got a lot of heavy marching
		ahead of us.  I'm not carrying 
		anybody.

				KELLY
		I can keep up.

				MALCOLM
		You're going home.  I'm sending a
		radio call for the boats.  We'll all
		go down to the lagoon and wait for
		them.

				SARAH
		Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a
		high school vice-principal.

				MALCOLM
		I'm her father.

				KELLY
		Sure, now.

	Nick leans over and whispers to Eddie, gesturing to Malcolm
	and Kelly.

				NICK
		Do you see any family resemblance
		here?

				MALCOLM
		You can't stay, Kelly, that's it.
		It's too dangerous.

				SARAH
		If it's so dangerous, why'd you bring
		any of us?

				KELLY
		You're wrong, Dad.  I do know
		what's going on on this island.

				MALCOLM
		How could you possibly?

				KELLY
		Because you said so.  Maybe nobody
		else believed you, but I always
		did.

	He looks at her, touched.  Nick mutters to Eddie again.

				NICK
		The kid scores with cheap sentiment.

				SARAH
		Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've
		made two invasive landings in one
		day.  That'll have to go in any paper
		I write, and it will leave room for
		people to say our findings were
		contaminated.  You know the academic
		world as well as I do, once they
		smell blood in the water, you're
		dead.  Our presence has got to be one
		hundred percent antiseptic.  That
		means if we bend a blade of grass, we
		bend it right back the way it-

	A low sound has been rising while she speaks, and now it comes
	BOOMING over the jungle around them, a THUNDEROUS racket that
	shakes the very ground beneath them.  Suddenly, three C-130
	military cargo planes THUNDER overhead and ROAR toward the
	island interior, flying very low.  The planes are enormous,
	fat-assed creatures, their rear cargo doors hanging open.

	AT A RIDGE,

	the members of the gatherer expedition hit the dirt and peer
	over a ledge, watching as the airplanes bank and circle over a
	specific spot.

	Eddie raises a pair of field glasses.

	DOWN BELOW,

	huge metal equipment containers are shoved out the back of the
	cargo bays.  They SNAP off trees like matchsticks, CRUSH flat
	anything foolish enough to exist where they want to land.

	Now MEN pour out the rear of the planes, their low-altitude
	parachutes billowing open behind them.

	UP ON THE RIDGE,

	Nick looks at Sarah.

				NICK
		You were saying something about
		antiseptic?

							CUT TO:

	EXT. HUNTERS' CAMP - DAY

	Metal container doors CLANG to the ground, jeep engines ROAR
	to life in a cloud of thick black diesel smoke, blue laser
	barriers SIZZLE and BURN through foliage as this group of
	HUNTERS establishes a perimeter around their new camp.

	PETER LUDLOW, dressed in brand new Banana Republic safari
	wear, steps into the center of the camp and surveys the
	surroundings.  He turns to DR. ROBERT BURKE, a ragged,
	pony-tailed man in wire-rimmed glasses.

				LUDLOW
		Welcome to your dream come true, Dr.
		Burke.

	Burke has a detailed set of satellite recon photographs that
	he spreads out on the hood of a jeep.

				BURKE
		I believe the large herbivores forage
		in open plains, like bison, which
		would explain the great variety of
		heat dots we're reading in the
		flatlands around this waterhole.
		Right -- here.

				LUDLOW
		Then that's where we're going.

	Burke flips open a manifest that he will carry with him at all
	times.  Inside, there are dozens of sketches of various kinds
	underneath.  As each vehicle ROARS out of the equipment
	container, Burke slips a waterproof eight by ten card with an
	icon of the various dinosaurs on the island into a slot in the
	dashboard.

				BURKE
			(calling them off)
		Hadrosaurus!  Carinthosaurus!
		Maiasaurus!

	As the procession goes on, Ludlow turns to DIETER STARK, the
	man we saw welding earlier.

				LUDLOW
		This is as good a place as any for
		base camp.  First priority is the
		laser barriers, I want them all up
		and running in thirty minutes.  Half
		an hour, understand?

	Dieter nods and turns to some of the HUNTERS, who number about
	twenty in all, that are working nearby.  But someone steps in
	front of Dieter, cutting him off.  It's ROLAND TEMBO, the
	hunter from the bar in Mombassa.

				ROLAND
		Cancel that, Dieter.

				LUDLOW
		What?  Why?

	Roland points to a stream running nearby.

				ROLAND
		Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do
		you want to set up base camp or an
		all-you-can-eat people bar?

				LUDLOW
			(thinks)
		You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new
		spot.  And remember, we're after
		herbivores only -- no unnecessary
		risks.

	Dieter SIGHS and goes to work.  Roland puts an arm around
	Ludlow and pulls him aside.

				ROLAND
		Peter, if you want me to run your
		little camping trip, there are two
		conditions.  First -- I'm in
		charge, and when I'm not around,
		Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the
		checks, tell us we're doing a good
		job, and open your case of scotch
		when we have a good day.  Second
		condition -- my fee.  You can keep
		it.  All I want in exchange for my
		services is the right to hunt one of
		the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck
		only.  Why and how are my business.
		If you don't  like either of those
		conditions, you're on your own.  Go
		ahead and set up your camp right
		here, or in a swamp, or in the middle
		of a rex nest, for all I care.  But
		I've been on too many safaris with
		rich dentists to listen to any more
		suicidal ideas.  Okay?

				LUDLOW
			(what else can he say?)
		Okay.

				ROLAND
		Good lad.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. JUNGLE

	The jungle foliage shivers, quakes, and finally falls as the
	Hunters' convoy ROARS into the hart of the jungle.  DIETER
	STARK stands in the front of the lead vehicle, the
	"speedbird," waving the convoy forward, his Driver (CARTER) at
	the wheel beside him.

	LUDLOW is in the back seat of the speedbird next to DR. BURKE.
	ROLAND and AJAY, his tracker, are in the second jeep.  They
	look up as the brakelights on the speedbird flash and the car
	stops, forcing the rest of the convoy to halt as well.

	In the front, the speedbird flashes its lights at something in
	front of it.  Dieter climbs out, plainly irritated.  He walks
	around the front of the car and sees --

	-- four PACHYCEPHALOSAURS eating grass in the middle of the
	jungle trail.  They're about five feet tall, thick, heavy-set
	animals whose distinctive feature is an enormous skull casing,
	a tall, impressive crown that rises on the tops of their
	heads.  Dieter doesn't seem impressed.  He looks back at
	Ludlow, who look at Dr. Burke.

	Burke stands up in his seat, a look of wonder on his face.

				BURKE
		Pachycephalosaurus!

				LUDLOW
		Carnivore?

				BURKE
			(enchanted)
		Huh?  No!  No, herbivore, late
		Cretaceous.  Very unusual plant
		eater, see that distinctive domed
		skull?  That's nine inches of solid
		bone.

				LUDLOW
			(who cares?)
		Just get them out of the way, Dieter.

				DIETER
		COME ON, MOVE IT!!

	The pachys look up at him sluggishly, still eating, like cows
	chewing their cuds.  As unimpressive with him as he is with
	them, they go back to their grass.

				DIETER (cont'd)
		Oh, for God's --

	He slings his rifle off his  shoulder and aims it at the
	closest animal.  Behind him, Roland has climbed out of the
	second jeep.

				ROLAND
		Dieter.  This is a round-up, not a
		war.  Use your powers of persuasion.

	Dieter gestures to the speedbird to pull ahead, which it does,
	slowly, toward the animals.  The pachys look up, alert, but do
	not move.  Dieter walks toward them.

				DIETER
		Come on, come on, don't have all
		day!

				BURKE
			(going on to no one in
			 particular)
		See, the pachy's neck attaches at the
		bottom of its skull instead of the
		back of its head, as with reptiles.

	The speedbird draws closer.  The first pachy stares at it
	intently.  The lead vehicle gets closer, closer --

	-- and BANGS into the pachy, knocking it back a few feet, out
	of the way.

				BURKE (cont'd)
		So when it lowers its head, its neck
		lines up directly with its
		backbone --

	BEHIND DIETER,

	Ajay is staring at something on the ground at his feet.  He
	takes a few steps further into the foliage, then turns back
	toward Roland.

				AJAY
		Roland.

	UP AT THE FRONT,

	the pachys turn and hop away.  Dieter turns and heads back to
	the speedbird.  As he reaches for the door, a VOICE calls
	"look out!" from behind him.  Dieter spins around, just in
	time to see --

	-- the first pachy in full charge.  It SLAMS headfirst into
	the speedbird, SMASHING the headlights and denting the grill.

				BURKE
			(concluding his lecture)
		Which is perfect for absorbing
		impact.

	Dieter turns and runs around to the front of the car.  The
	pachy has backed up  for another run and is now CHARGING RIGHT
	AT HIM.

	Dieter retreats, quickly, and rips open the passenger door to
	protect himself.

	SLAM!  The pachy clobbers the door, sending Dieter flying
	against the car, knocking the wind out of him.

	In the other jeeps, the rest of the HUNTERS stand up or lean
	out the window for a better look, laughing.

	POW!!  The pachy head-butts the tire next to Dieter.  It
	bounces off, tumbles to the ground, and rolls to its feet as
	Dieter gets to his knees and crawls toward the back of the
	speedbird.

	But the pachy is quicker and lunges at Dieter again.  He's
	forced to hit the dirt and crawls quickly underneath the
	speedbird, just as the animal SLAMS into the rear of the
	vehicle.

	Now the other three animals join the jun.  Ludlow and the
	Driver have to cover their heads as the animals lunge at the
	car again and again, SMASHING the steel-meshed windows and
	MANGLING the quarter panels.  The rest of the group watches,
	vastly amused.

	A FEW STEPS INTO THE JUNGLE,

	Ajay and Roland are staring at something on the ground -- an
	animal footprint, three-toed, enormous.

				AJAY
		It matches the pictures.

				ROLAND
		It certainly does.

	Roland gets up and goes back to his vehicle, ignoring the
	pachy demolition derby that continues up at the speedbird.
	Roland opens a case in the back of the jeep, revealing --

	-- his gun.  It's an antique elephant gun, a double barreled
	.600 Nitro Express.  Nearly a hundred years old, it's still in
	immaculate condition, its rosewood stock buttery smooth,
	bisons delicately engraved along its silver breach.

	The barrels are twenty-four inches long, topped with an ivory
	bead foresight at the business end.  Roland scoops up the gun,
	breaks the breach, and pulls two rounds of ammunition from his
	shirt pocket.

	Four inches long and three-quarters of an inch in diameter,
	these are the largest full metal jacket cartridges ever made.
	He slips one into each barrel and heads back into the bush.

	Roland pauses before he goes, as if noticing the animals
	trashing the speedbird for the first time.

				ROLAND
		HEY!

	The pachys all freeze, staring at him.  Roland waves one hand,
	HISSES sharply between his teeth --

	-- and the pachys scatter, back into the jungle.  Takes care
	of that problem.  Roland turns and heads back into the jungle,
	calling out over his shoulder to Ludlow.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		Don't worry about us.  We'll catch
		up.

				LUDLOW
		Where do you think you're going?!

				ROLAND
		To collect my fee.

	And with that he disappears into the foliage.

	The Driver of the Speedbird drops it into gear and the
	battered car GROANS forward.  As it moves ahead, it reveals
	DIETER, lying underneath it, ego bruised worse than body.

	IN THE JUNGLE,

	Ajay takes a step into the bush, but at a ninety degree
	angle away from the direction in which the animals tracks
	lead.

				ROLAND
		Ajay.

	Ajay turns.  Roland points in the direction in which the
	footprints lead.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		I'm no tracker, but even I can read
		this spoor.

				AJAY
		Do you wish to go where the animal
		has been, or where the animal is?

	Roland smiles.  Ajay sets off in his direction and Roland
	follows.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. ISLAND RIDGE - DAY

	Seen from a ridge above them, the hunters' convoy continues to
	plow through the jungle.  But how the hunters themselves are
	being tracked, followed by the GATHERERS.  They scurry along
	as fast as they can, trying to keep pace with the moving
	vehicle below.

				EDDIE
		Why didn't you tell us about these
		guys, Ian?!

				MALCOLM
		Because I didn't know!  I don't have
		the faintest idea what they're doing
		here.

				NICK
			(angry)
		Ruining everything, that's what
		they're doing.  You could choke on
		the diesel smoke already!

				SARAH
		Ian, nothing we observe will be valid
		if we're trailing along in the wake
		of an army.

	Kelly has a pair of binoculars and is studying the vehicles as
	they move below.

				KELLY
		"InGen."  What's InGen?

				MALCOLM
		Where does it say that?

				KELLY
		On the side of that one truck.

	Malcolm takes the binoculars and stares down there himself.

				JUTTSON
		InGen is a genetics corporation,
		isn't it?

				NICK
			(to Malcolm)
		Is that who we're really working
		for?!  Gene splicers?!

				MALCOLM
		No!  We're an independently funded
		expedition.

				SARAH
		Funded by whom?

				MALCOLM
		John Hammond.

				JUTTSON
		But he's the head of InGen!

				NICK
		You gotta be kidding.
			(to Malcolm)
		You dragged me out of Greenpeace to
		be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't
		get anybody else?

				KELLY
		Yeah, what have you done, Dad?

				SARAH
		We'd better keep moving, or we'll
		lose them.

	The group moves on ahead, but Malcolm lingers, angry, staring
	through the binoculars.

				MALCOLM
		What are you doing to me, John?

	EXT. THE CAVES - DAY

	AJAY and ROLAND make their way through the foliage and come
	into a small clearing, where a cluster of caves is carved into
	the rock.  Ajay freezes, gesturing ahead, to the cave on the
	far left.

	Roland pulls up a handful of grass and releases it on the
	breeze.  It floats back between his legs.  That's good.

	He proceeds toward the cave, carefully, Ajay behind him.  They
	can see nothing beyond the yawning mouth of the cave, only a
	black interior.

	Roland pauses, looking down.  On the ground to his right he
	sees the partially eastern leg of a creature.  It's old,
	crawling with white maggots and flies.

	Roland continues on.  Closer to the cave, he now passes the
	skull of a large animal, some of the flesh and green skin
	still adhering to the bone.  It, too, is covered with flies.

	Still he continues on.  A short rise leads into the cave, and
	they edge up it.  From inside the cave, they can hear an odd
	SQUEAKING sound, very high-pitched.

	Crawling now, Roland and Ajay scale a four-foot circular
	rampart of dried mud, and peer into --

	-- the tyrannosaur nest.  It's flattered inside, about ten
	feet in diameter, completely encircled by earthen walls.

	A BABY TYRANNOSAUR, about four and a half feet long, is in the
	center of the nest.  It has a large head, very large eyes, and
	its body is covered with a fluffy red down, which gives it a
	scraggly appearance.

	It SQUEAKS repeatedly, tearing awkwardly at the remains of a
	chunk of animal flesh, biting decisively with tiny, sharp
	teeth.

	The cave itself is a foul boneyard.  ANIMAL CARCASSES litter
	the edges, flies BUZZ in the captive air.  Roland raises a
	bandana to his nose to cover the stench.  He  turns to Ajay and
	WHISPERS.

				ROLAND
		It's the rex nest.

	Ajay nods.  The baby tyrannosaur hears the whisper and looks
	up, cocking its head in curiosity.

				AJAY
		Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck
		to return?

				ROLAND
			(shakes his head no)
		If the nest is upwind, so are we.
		When he comes back, he'll know we're
		here before we have a chance.  The
		truck --

	In the nest below, the baby SQUEAKS angrily at the intruders.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		-- is to get him to come where we
		want him.

	The baby SQUEAKS again, indignant.  Roland turns and looks
	down at it.  Thinking.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. RIDGE - DUSK

	As the sun glows bright orange on the horizon, NICK raises a
	pair of binoculars to his eyes and peers down at the vista
	below the ridge.

	In the lenses of the binoculars, we can clearly see a mixed
	herd of midsized herbivores -- HARDOSAURS, PACHYCEPHALOSAURS,
	and CALLIMIMUSES -- racing across the plain below.
	
	MALCOLM, also staring through binoculars, lies on the ridge
	beside him.  SARAH is several feet behind them, her back
	pressed against a tree, unwilling to go to the lip of the
	ridge.

	THROUGH NICK'S BINOCULARS

	We see a shaky point of view of the herd running.  The
	binoculars whip to the right --

	-- revealing a jeep chasing the herd  Not just one jeep, in
	fact, but a whole FLEET OF HUNTER PURSUIT VEHICLES!

	There are two herding jeeps, one motorcycle, as speedier
	mini-jeep, and, further behind, a container truck and a
	wrangler's pickup truck.

	Although there's a great deal of commotion below, up here it's
	almost eerily silent.

	ON THE RIDGE,

	Nick lowers the binoculars, angry.  When he raises them again,
	the sun FLARES off the lens --

	EXT. THE PLAIN - DUSK

	-- and when the brilliant flare clears, we're right down in
	the middle of the roundup.  Engines ROAR, wheels spin and dig
	in the dirt, men SHOUT and radios SQUAWK as the hunter
	vehicles pursue the fleeting herd they're flushed.

	The HUNTER SHOUT and SHRIEK with glee, incredulous and
	thrilled by the spectacular animals they're pursuing.

				HUNTER
		LOOK AT THESE THINGS!

				HUNTER 2
		THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL, MAN, THEY'RE
		BEAUTIFUL!!!

	One of the pursuit vehicles (a "snagger"), pulls ahead of the
	others.  DIETER STARK stands in the passenger seat, holding a
	long pole with a noose dangling from the end of it.

	He swings the pole out over the side of the jeep and SHOUTS to
	the driver.

				DIETER
		FASTER!

	The Driver hits the gas and the snagger leaps forward, gaining
	on the herd.  Aware of the danger behind them, the herd veers
	to the right, toward the cover of thick jungle --

	-- but the motorcycle ROARS in from the right side, cutting
	them off, herding them back out into the open.

	BACK IN THE CONTAINER TRUCK,

	PETER LUDLOW stands in a "conning tower," a command post in
	the heaviest pursuit vehicle.  He BARKS into a walkie-talkie.

				LUDLOW
		Alive, Dieter, and uninjured!

	BACK ON THE SNAGGER,

	the Driver can barely keep up with the twists and feints
	thrown by the herd ahead of him.  Dieter CURSES and throws the
	lasso pole into the back of the jeep.  Ludlow's voice
	continues over the radio in Dieter's jeep.

				LUDLOW (o.s.)
		Those are very expensive animals!
		Can you hear me?!

				DIETER
			(to the Driver)
		Turn that off!

	The Driver SNAPS off the radio as Dieter grabs a long-barreled
	rifle from the back of the vehicle.

	THE MOTORCYCLE

	guns it again, forcing the herd back into the middle of the 
	plain.  From the trees to the left, two heads on enormous
	necks rise up in alarm.  Two APATOSAURS are startled from the
	bush and lumber out across the middle of the plain.

	The herd doesn't even break stride, but keeps running,
	scampering after the giants and stampeding right between their
	massive legs.

	One smaller pachycephalosaur bolts loose, but the motorcycle
	cuts it off and herds it back into the middle, which now takes
	the motorcycle right through the rising and falling legs of
	the apotosaurs.

	The bike chases the pachy out the other side, and as the
	apatosaurs disappear into the distance, the cycle isolates the
	juvenile.

	Another truck, a "scissor rig," spots the isolated animal.
	High in the back of the truck, a HUNTER mans a tranquilizer
	cannon, drawing a bead on the pachy as the cycle runs it down.

	He FIRES and the tranquilizer dart hits the animal in the
	neck.  Its pace slows and another HUNTER from the truck tosses
	a lasso around its neck.

	They crank a winch, reeling in the animal.

	As the truck gain on it, two six-foot padded arms with what
	look like heavy airbags on the insides open up on the front of
	the truck.

	As the animal is pulled in, the scissors close with a
	hydraulic WHIR, trapping the animal between its airbags.

	Now a pick-up rig ROARS up and drops its back gate.  The
	scissor rig rolls forward, depositing the squirming pachy in
	this dino-contaiment vehicle.

	Two HUNTERS throw levers on the side of the scissor bars and
	the scissor rig backs away, leaving the animal, still pinched
	between the bars, imprisoned in the back of the pick-up rig.

	The Hunters quickly fit new scissor bars onto the scissor rig
	and it takes off, back into the hunt.

	BACK ON THE SNAGGER,

	Dieter, rifle in hand, drops down into the passenger seat,
	whips a harness over himself and CLICKS it into place.  He
	jabs his thumb into a flashing red button in the dashboard.

	Immediately, a motor underneath the seat HUMS to life and the
	seat itself telescopes, extending a good four feet out to

	Dieter raises the gun, picks a CARINTHOSAUR, a red-crested
	herbivore, from the rear of the fleeting herd, and takes aim.

	BANG!!

	The carinthosaur staggers as a tranquilizer dart sticks in
	its left hindquarter.

	UP ON THE RIDGE,

	there is utter quiet.  Nick and the others stare wordlessly at
	the spectacle below.

	DOWN ON THE PLAIN,

	the snagger SHUDDERS to a halt in the dirt, kicking up a huge
	cloud of dust and dirt.

	The motorcycle spins to a stop beside it, its DRIVER pushing
	his mask up to reveal his sweat and dirt-streaked face.

	The wrangler truck backs up and drops its rear door, which
	CLANGS heavily to the ground.

	FOUR WRANGLERS carrying wire noose poles and chains race down
	the ramp and out of the truck.

	Dieter jumps off the snagger.  He puts down his tranquilizer
	gun, picks up a long steel rod, and walks forward slowly.
	Ahead of him, the carinthosaur is still on its feet.

	The sedated animal staggers, fighting to retain its balance
	while it is surrounded by the wary Wranglers.

				DIETER
		Easy -- easy -- not too close!
		Full extension!

	The Wranglers adjust their poles, extending them another three
	feet, which allows them to stay further from the reeling, ten
	foot tall animal.

				DIETER (cont'd)
		Now!

	Almost as one, the Wranglers flip their noose over the
	stunned animal's neck.  It thrashes, but the Wranglers hold
	their poles tightly, surrounding and immobilizing it.

	UP ON THE RIDGE,

	Nick turns away.  He can't watch.

	DOWN ON THE PLAIN,

	a bolero-type device, a rope with a round weight at either
	end, whips around the carinthosaur's legs.  The animal THUDS
	to the dirt with a SNORT of a defeat.

	Ludlow steps up next to Dieter and both of them stare down at
	the helpless animal.  Ludlow's breathing heavily, eyes
	glowing.

	The animal is still thrashing, pumping its legs crazily.
	Dieter turns a knob on the side of the steel rod he's holding
	and thrusts it into the defenseless animal's neck.

	A blue arc of electricity CRACKS and dances over the
	carinthosaur's body.  The animal convulses in pain, a
	horrible, high-pitched SQUEALING rips the air.

	DR. BURKE, their paleontologist, hurries forward with a
	syringe.

	He draws a certain amount of tranquilizer from a bottle and
	injects it into the animal's thigh.

	CARTER, Dieter's Driver, steps up with a can of spray paint
	and quickly tags the animal with an ID number in day-glo
	orange.

	Dieter pulls the card with an icon of a carinthosaur from the
	dashboard of the jeep and marks a black X over the drawing of
	the animal.

				DIETER
		Next case.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. RIDGE - NIGHT

	Night has fallen over the island.  The hunters have
	established base camp in an area they have trampled and
	cleared just below the ridge.  Blue laser fences encircle the
	perimeter.  Inside, half a dozen tents are set up around a
	central campfire.

	The vehicles are all parked at one end, away from the tents.
	At the other end, there is a row of at least a dozen "capture
	containers," cages that hold the imprisoned dinosaurs they
	have already rounded up.

	SARAH, MALCOLM, and NICK stand at the edge of the ridge above,
	looking down at the scene.  Sarah stands a bit further back
	from the others, not wanting to get too close to the edge.
	VOICES waft up to them, raucous, LAUGHING, some even SINGING.

	DR. JUTTSON has a pair of night-vision binoculars trained on
	the cages.

				JUTTSON
		Carinthosaurus -- compsognathus --
		triceratops -- pachycephalosaurus --
		or small scavengers only.

	Malcolm, also with binoculars, furrows his brow, seeing
	something below.

	THROUGH MALCOLM'S BINOCULARS,

	he sees PETER LUDLOW, standing in the middle of the camp,
	pointing, giving orders.

	ON THE RIDGE,

	Malcolm drops the binoculars.

				MALCOLM
		Ludlow.  That's why Hammond was in
		such a hurry for me to get here.  He
		knew they were coming.

	He gives the binoculars to Sarah, who moves forward gingerly.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		You okay?

				SARAH
			(irritated)
		Heights, I can't help it.  Put your
		arm here, will you?

	She puts his arm around her waits, to steady her while she is
	close to the cliff edge.

				JUTTSON
		What do they want?

				MALCOLM
		They want their money back.  To
		InGen, this island is nothing more
		than a bed investment.

				JUTTSON
		We should get back to base camp.
		Eddie's waiting for us.

				MALCOLM
		I can't believe Peter Ludlow's
		running all this.

				SARAH
		He isn't.  Check out the guy walking
		past the fire.

	She hands the binoculars to Malcolm.

	THROUGH THE BINOCULARS,

	Malcolm sees ROLAND, who's walking with AJAY, weapons and
	equipment slung over their shoulders.

				SARAH (o.s.)
		I've seen him before.  In Brazil.  He
		and that guy with him were
		spearhunting jaguars.  Said it was
		immoral to go after them any other
		way.  He's not just a hunter, he's a
		philosopher.  Kind of guy who beats
		you up with your own argument.

	BACK ON THE RIDGE,

				SARAH (cont'd)
		He's the one in charge.

				MALCOLM
		Well, if that's true -- the man in
		charge just left camp.

	Nick, who has been quietly fuming next to them, now steps
	forward.

				NICK
		Then this is our chance.

				MALCOLM
		Our chance to do what?

				NICK
		I don't know these guys, but I know
		'em.  I've seen 'em on Japanese
		whalers, French barges trying to dump
		barrels of nuclear waste in the North
		Atlantic.  They're all the same.
		They spray us with water cannon when
		we try to stop 'em, sink our boats,
		and then call us crazy.

	He rummages through his pack, coming up with various tools.  A
	hunting knife.  A bolt cutter.

				NICK (cont'd)
		Nobody has to come with me.  I've
		done this before.

				SARAH
		Why, Nick.  You are a tree-hugger.

	He looks at her, hurt.

				NICK
		There' no reason for name calling.

				MALCOLM
		Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back
		to camp right away.  Leave the other
		car for us and we'll meet you there
		in an hour or so.

				KELLY
		What are you guys gonna do?

				MALCOLM
			(signs)
		Exactly what John Hammond wanted us
		to do.

							CUT TO:

	INT. TENT - HUNTER'S CAMP - NIGHT

	In the hunters' supply tent, a case of twelve-year-old scotch
	sits open amid crate after crate of weapons and ammunition.
	PETER LUDLOW reaches in and pulls a bottle out.

	EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

	In the jungle, LUDLOW approaches a small clearing.  ROLAND is
	bent over a small stake in the ground, chaining something to
	it.  As Ludlow approaches and walks around him, he sees what
	protest.  Roland looks up.

				ROLAND
		Offering a little incentive.

	Ludlow laughs and shakes his head.  He takes a drink and
	offers Roland one.  Roland accepts.  Ludlow notices Roland's
	gun leaning against a tree.

				LUDLOW
		What kind of gun is that?

				ROLAND
		My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made
		in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to
		him after he took down his last
		elephant.  8700 foot pound striking
		force.

				LUDLOW
		How close do you have to be?

				ROLAND
		Forty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume
		it'll take a slug in the brain case
		to bring him down.

				LUDLOW
		Why not just use a scope and a poison
		dart and snipe him from a hill?

	Roland just looks at him.

				ROLAND
		Or a laser beam from a satellite?

	Ludlow leans down, close to the baby rex, and examines it
	while it thrashes on its chain.  Its mouth has been bound shut
	with a leather strap.

				LUDLOW
		You rally think this'll draw the
		parent?

				ROLAND
		I once saw a bull elephant die
		charging a jeep.  All the jeep had
		done was startle the bull's calves.
		I saw a lioness carry wounded prey
		four and a half miles, all the way
		back to its den, just to teach its
		cubs how to finish off a kill.

				LUDLOW
		Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.

				ROLAND
		Rex won't be any different.  It'll
		come.

				LUDLOW
		You're kidding yourself.  An adult
		T-rex cares about one thing --
		filling its own belly.  It acts the
		way people wish they could, that's
		why everyone's fascinated by it.  If
		people had the chance to see one
		dinosaur and one only, ninety-nine
		percent would --

	He stops, an idea on his face.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Wait.  Why not?  Sedatives...
		growth inhibitors...

				ROLAND
		What?

				LUDLOW
		I hadn't planned on bringing
		carnivores back because of the
		liability risk, but I only thought of
		adults, it never occurred to me --
			(close to the animal)
		You are a billion dollar idea, my
		little f-

	CRACK!  The tyrannosaur, even with its jaws clamped shut,
	lunges at Ludlow's face, head-butting him right across the
	bridge of the nose.  Ludlow staggers back, WAITING in pain,
	clutching his bleeding face.

	Roland laughs.  Ludlow, like an enraged child, snatches up
	Roland's gun and brings the butt down viciously on the rex's
	leg.  The bone breaks with a dry SNAP and the animal HOWLS in
	pain.

	Roland lunges and throws Ludlow to the ground, but the damage
	is done.

				ROLAND
		What the hell you do that for?!

	As his pain eases, Ludlow feels a bit foolish, but he attempts
	to cover.

				LUDLOW
		Had to.  To keep him still for the
		trip.

				ROLAND
		You've broken its leg!

				LUDLOW
		We've got to transport it seven
		thousand miles.  Would you prefer it
		bit off the leg of a crew member?

	He gets up, brushes himself off, and heads back to the camp,
	trying to salvage his dignity.  Roland watches him go.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. EDGE OF HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT

	At the edge of the hunters' camp, NICK, SARAH, and MALCOLM
	scramble down a hillside and stop at the edge of the laser
	barriers.  There are three beams, each about two feet apart,
	the tallest almost six feet off the ground.

	Nick reaches the edge and crouches.  Sarah, helped by Malcolm,
	steps up onto his back and jumps over the top, landing with a
	CRUNCH.  Nick is next, given a boost by Malcolm, who is then
	left alone on the other side.

	He backs up a few steps, jogs right at the lasers, then
	springs off his good leg --

	-- and does the Fosburry Flop right over the top.  He lands
	with a THUD, to the silent admiration of the other two.

	FURTHER IN THE CAMP,

	the three of them creep along, hiding behind a stack of fuel
	barrels.  They lean around the edge for a look.  They're
	directly behind the row of vehicle.

	They move, into the open, covering the ground between them and
	the jeeps.  Reaching them, Nick hits the dirt and wriggles
	under the first one.  Malcolm and Sarah stand lookout.

	UNDER THE JEEP,

	Nick pulls the bolt cutter from his back pocket.  He squirms
	along until he finds the jeep's fuel line --

	-- and he snips it.  He ducks out of the way just as the
	stream of fuel begins to pour into the dirt.

	MALCOLM AND SARAH

	move slowly down the line, standing watch as Nick crawls out
	from under the first jeep and proceeds to the second.  They
	hear another SNIP, then keep moving, to cover him as he moves
	to the third.

	From in the distance, Malcolm hears a sound, a faint,
	high-pitched SCREECHING.  He turns and looks to that
	direction.

	EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT

	It's the baby T-rex, still SCREENING.  Up in a nearby tree,
	ROLAND and AJAY have spread some broken branches crosswise to
	form a high hide of their own about ten feet off the ground.

	They wait.

	Roland raises his binoculars.  The light of the camp spills
	all the way out here, illuminating some of the jungle.  He
	scans it, searching for any sign of movement.

	EXT. HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT

	Back in the camp, Sarah, Malcolm, and Nick have finished with
	all of the vehicles except the badly battered one, which is
	parked some distance away, undergoing repairs.  The motor pool
	area is now a soggy lake of spilled gasoline.

	The saboteurs walk casually across the camp, unnoticed in the
	drunken revelry.  They pass several tents, the shadows of the
	partiers visible as they move inside.

	They continue across the camp and arrive at the other side --

	-- to face the caged animals.  The carinthosaur that was
	tranquilized earlier stands there dully, eyes heavy and
	glassy, still under the effects.  They pass a stegosaur, its
	row of fine bristling.

	And finally they reach the largest cage, which houses a
	triceratops the size of a pickup truck, Nick pulls out his
	trusty bolt cutters.  He looks at them, a glint in his eye.

				NICK
		Hang on.  We may encounter some
		turbulence.

	INT. HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT

	In one of the hunter tents, PETER LUDLOW leans over the
	satellite recon pictures of the island, planning the next
	day's assault with DIETER and DR. BURKE, their paleontologist.
	There are small wooden dinosaur models scattered around the
	photos, indicating where certain species can be found.

				BURKE
		If you're really interested in
		infants, we'll have better luck at
		the seaside, because the sands offer
		a cushioning surface where the egg
		clutches can -- can --

	He trails off.  A low RUMBLING sound can be heard outside, and
	the little wooden dinosaurs start shaking on the board.

	They look at each other.  The RUMBLING gets louder.  Outside,
	someone SHOUTS; on the board, the little dinosaurs start
	hopping and bouncing from the vibrations, the SHOUTS outside
	turn to SCREAMS, they turn and look at the back of the tent --

	-- and the triceratops bursts right through the canvas!

	EXT. CAMP - NIGHT

	HUNTERS go flying as the tent-covered triceratops, its horns
	tearing through the canvas, RUMBLES across the camp.  Men
	SHOUT in alarm, the triceratops BELLOWS in anger and
	confusion, chaos reigns.

	In the crush of PEOPLE running every which way, MALCOLM and
	SARAH are swept off in one direction while NICK is buffeted
	in another.  They SHOUT, but cannot be heard over the frey.

	The triceratops, blinded by the canvas shroud, stomps right
	through the fire in the middle of the camp AND THE TENT BURSTS
	INTO FLAME.

	Now really upset, the animal panics and lashes out in all
	directions, blasting through tents, demolishing and/or setting
	ablaze anything that gets in its way.  Its considerable
	hindquarters SLAM into a parked jeep, sending it rolling
	across the camp.

	The jeep flattens the largest tent and SLAMS down on its side.
	Its broken gas line SPRAYS gas over the ground, the gas hits
	one of the dozens of small blazes the triceratops has left in
	its wake, and the flame shoots up the ribbon of gas.

	The jeep explodes.

	OUT IN THE JUNGLE CLEARING,

	Roland and Ajay, up in the tree, leap to their feet as a
	fireball rises up from the camp in the distance.

				ROLAND
		What in God's -- !

	BACK IN THE CAMP,

	the rest of the newly-freed animals now storm through the
	camp.  The blue laser barriers bounce crazily and go out as
	the sending units are trampled underfoot by the fleeing
	animals.

	AT THE RIDGE OF CAMP,

	Nick takes advantage of the downed lasers to slip part the
	bordere of the camp and disappear into the jungle in one
	direction, while Malcolm and Sarah vanish in the other.

	The burning tent, which was the equipment tent, now detonates
	in a series of smaller EXPLOSIONS.

	Dieter and several others are knocked to the ground by the
	series of concessive blasts.  He drags himself up onto all
	fours, charred and bruised.  A burning tire rolls slowly past
	him, spinning to a stop --

	-- at ROLAND's feet.  Dieter looks up at him.

				ROLAND
		Last time I leave you in charge.

	OUT IN THE JUNGLE,

	Nick breaks out into the jungle clearing, the same one where
	Ajay and Roland had their blind.  He sees the baby tyrannosaur
	chained to the stake.

				NICK
		Sick bastards.

	He goes to the animal, which now BLEATS in pain, its broken
	leg hanging at an odd angle.  With one strong tug, Nick pulls
	the stake out of the ground.

	BACK IN THE CAMP,

	Roland surveys the destruction.  The fire has spread and
	several tents are now tongues of flame flapping in the air,
	the animals are gone or going, and their personnel are
	scattered and terrified.  PETER LUDLOW, breathless, face
	smeared with dirt, and smoke, staggers up to Roland.

				LUDLOW
		What in Christ's name is going on?!

				ROLAND
		Isn't it obvious?

	He holds up the sniped padlock from one of the animal cages.

				NICK (cont'd)
		We're not alone on this island.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

	MALCOLM and SARAH race back up onto the ridge trail, where the
	green AAV is parked.  NICK bursts around from the other side
	of the car.

				SARAH
		Nick, thank God, we didn't know
		if --

	Malcolm opens the rear door.

				NICK
		Wait, don't ---

	With a piercing SHRIEK, the BABY TYRANNOSAUR, now in the back
	of the AAV, flings itself at the open doorway, jaws SNAPPING
	just short of Malcolm's nose.

				MALCOLM
		HOLY SHIT!!

	He SLAMS the door.

	DOWN IN THE HUNTERS' CAMP,

	Roland hears the commotion up on the ridge and looks up.

				ROLAND
		Do we have anyone up there?

	BACK UP ON THE RIDGE,

	Malcolm is confronting Nick.

				MALCOLM
		?!

 NICK 		It has a broken leg!

 MALCOLM 		So do it a favor and put it out of
		its misery!

 NICK 		No!  Get in the car before they hear 
		us!

	He runs around and leaps in the driver's seat.  Sarah slips
	into the passenger seat, quickly, leaving Malcolm no choice
	but the rear.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT 
	The AAV SLAPS through the jungle foliage.  From inside the

 INT. AAV - NIGHT 
	The baby writhes on the base seat next to Malcolm, who has
	flattened himself against the door, as far away from the
	animal as possible.

 SARAH 		Ian, close the window, it's going to
		wake every predator in the jungle!

	Malcolm leans over the enraged animal and cranks up its
	window.  The tyrannosaur SLASHES with one of its powerful hind
	legs, ripping the flesh of his forearm.  He SHOUTS in pain.

	Outside, the listening jungle whizzes by.

 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	Up in the high hide, EDDIE, DR. JUTTSON, and KELLY are
	standing watch, scanning the jungle for any sign of their
	returning comrades.

	Juttson yanks the night-vision binoculars away from his face
	as he spots the AAV, pulling up to the base camp a couple
	hundred yards away.

 JUTTSON 		There they are!

	They all turn and look, but Eddie furrows his brow, watching
	them pull the wounded animal from the back seat.

 EDDIE 		What is that they have with them?

 EXT. CAMP - NIGHT 
	SARAH and NICK carry the SCREECHING baby tyrannosaur in their
	arms, headed for the trailer.  MALCOLM, holding his bleeding
	arm, isn't far behind.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	SARAH and NICK bring the SCREAMING infant to the metal dining
	table and hold it down.  MALCOLM is right behind them.

 MALCOLM 		This is exceedingly unwise.

	Sarah turns away from a drawer of medical supplies, holding a
	small syringe.  Her shirt is streaked with blood from the
	baby's injured leg.

 SARAH 		Too late to worry about that!  Hold
		him together, Nick!

	Nick tightens his grip on the animal and Sarah makes an
	injection into its thigh, over its loudly voiced objections.

 MALCOLM 		Just do whatever you have to do and
		get it out of here as quickly as
		possible.

	Sarah picks up a small ultrasound transducer and runs it over
	the animal's leg.  A green and white skeletal image appears on
	a monitor next to the table.

 SARAH 		Okay, there's the metatarsals --
		tibia, fibula -- there it is!  See
		it?  That's a fracture, just above
		the epiphysis.

	They peer closely at the monitor.

 NICK 		That little black line?

 SARAH 		That little black line means death
		for this infant.  The fibula won't
		heal straight, so the ankle joint
		can't pivot when he stands on his
		hind feet.  The baby won't be able to
		run, and probably can't even walk.
		It'll be crippled, and a predator
		will pick it off before it gets more
		than a few weeks old.

 MALCOLM 		Can you set up?

 SARAH 			(thinking)
		It has to be temporary, something
		that'll break apart and fall off as
		the animal grows...

 MALCOLM 		Think fast, Sarah.

	The tyrannosaur, still in pain, SHRIEKS again.

 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	Through their binoculars, the rest of the group watches the
	trailer carefully.  Even inside, the animal's SCREECHES are
	clearly audible.  Kelly is getting scared.

 KELLY 		What are they doing?  Why don't
		they hurry?!

 EDDIE 		Give me the radio.

	From the trailer, the baby lets out a long, plaintive
 SHRIEK -- 
	One by one, Eddie, Kelly, and Juttson turn around and stare
	into the night jungle.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	NICK holds the animal while SARAH fits an aluminum foil cuff
	around its injured leg and paints it with a coating of resin.
	MALCOLM, at the window, stares out anxiously.  The animal
	thrashes again.

 NICK 		Give it more morphine!

 SARAH 		We'll kill it with too much, we'll
		put it into respiratory arrest!  I'm
		almost done.  Damn it, I need
		another adhesive, something pliable I
		can --

	Her eyes fall on Nick.  She holds out her hand, urgently.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		Spit!

	He spits his bubblegum into the palm of her hand.  The baby
	rex CRIES OUT again.

 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	From the swaying jungle, there is another answering ROAR.

	And this one's closer.

	In the high hide, the rest of the group stares, trembling.  In
	the distance, a flock of birds SHRIEKS and takes flight as the
	tops of some trees move, a whole section of forest suddenly
	coming alive, as if brushed by wind.

	But it's not the wind.

	They hear noises, THUDS in the jungle.  And then another
	section of forest trembles.  Closer.  Another flock of birds
	bursts out of the treetops and swarms past the high hide.

 KELLY 		What is it?

	Dr. Juttson puts an arm around Kelly, instinctively pulling
	her closer to him.  Eddie WHISPERS urgently into the
	walkie-talkie.

 EDDIE 		Sarah, come in!

 JUTTSON 		It's moving.  Fast.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	There is a radio box mounted on the far wall of the trailer.
	The speaker BUZZES urgently with Eddie's VOICE.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
		Sarah, Malcolm, can you hear me?!

	On the table, Sarah is frantically molding Nick's bubblegum
	into place on the makeshift splint.  But the baby rex,
	regaining its strength, is thrashing again.

 SARAH 		Hold it down, Nick!

 NICK 		I'm trying!

				EDDIE (o.s.)
			(from the radio)
		Is anybody there?!

	Malcolm moves to answer the radio, but Sarah SHOUTS to him.

 SARAH 		Ian, get the bottle of amoxicillin
		and fill a syringe!  Quick injection
		of antibiotics and I can get it out
		of here!

	Forsaking the radio, Malcolm moves to the medicine drawer and
	comes up with what she wants.  Working fast, he draws twenty
	cc's of the pink liquid.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
			(still from the radio, now
			 desperate)
 SARAH OR IAN, ANSWER ME! 
	They ignore him as Sarah grabs the syringe and makes the
	injection.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
 WHATEVER YOU BROUGHT INTO THE TRAILER, GET IT OUT NOW! 
 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	Eddie has given up on whispering as he clutches the radio
	desperately.

 EDDIE WE ESTIMATE TWO LARGE ADULTS HEADED IN YOUR DIRECTION! I REPEAT -- 
 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	Nick, Sarah, and Malcolm spin around at hearing that terrible
	piece of information.

 MALCOLM 		Oh, Christ.

	He bolts over to the wall speaker and hits the button.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		Let me talk to Kelly, is she--

	A deafening ROAR sound from just outside the trailer,
	followed immediately by a CRASHING sound.  They whirl and look
	to the window, just in time to see --

	--  the AAV tumbling by, rolling on its side!

	There is another ROAR, and the baby, on the table, ROARS in
	response.  Outside the window, the head of a full-grown
	TYRANNOSAURUS REX lowers and peers inside.

	Malcolm, Sarah, and Nick all freeze in absolute terror.

	The rex outside GURGLES, making material cooing noises.  The
	baby rex, calm for the first time, GURGLES back.

	But across the trailer, in the opposite window, ANOTHER T-REX
 HEAD SUDDENLY APPEARS. 
	This one ROARS, deeply, a roar so low and loud it rattles
	anything in the trailer that isn't tied down.

 NICK 		What do they want?!

 MALCOLM 		What do you think they want?!

 SARAH 		That's impossible, they can't have
		the sensory equipment to track it all
		the way here!

 MALCOLM 		Current evidence seems to be to the
		contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT
 TO THEM! 
	Nick, hands shaking, grabs the shoulder video camera he used
	earlier.  He whips out the cassette that's in there, hurls it
	into an open duffel bag with half a dozen others, SLAMS a
	fresh cassette in, and flicks the "ON" switch.

	Sarah and Malcolm, meanwhile, hurry to the other end of the
	trailer, carrying the baby rex.  Outside, the two adult rexes
	stay with them, walking in the same direction, watching them
	through the window.

 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	Seen from outside, the light inside the trailers clearly
	illuminates Sarah and Malcolm as they carry the bay rex.  The
	adult rexes tower over the trailer, twice as tall and nearly
	as long.  They walk slowly alongside it, hunched over,
	watching their infant.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	At the door to the trailer, Sarah un-muzzles the frantic baby.

 SARAH 		Ready?

	Malcolm reaches for the door handle.

 NICK 		Wait!

	He dives down on the floor under them, pointing the video
	camera up at the door, getting the best shot.  Malcolm takes a
	breath, turns the knob, and throws open the door.

	Outside, the enormous rex heads pause for a moment, staring,
	surprised.

	Although terrified, Sarah actually starts to sing.

 SARAH 			(softly)
		Born free, as free as the wind blows.
		As free as the grass grows --

 MALCOLM 		Are you insane?!

 SARAH 		I swear to God, it works with lions
		sometimes!  There we are -- your baby
		is free --

	The baby, excited, wriggles free of them and lands on the
	ground outside.  Not wasting a second, Malcolm SLAMS the door
	shut.

	The three of them freeze, not daring to breath.  Outside, they
	can hear the SNUFFLING and COOING of the animals as they
	inspect their young --

	-- and then the soft THUD of their footsteps, growing fainter
	as they move away.

	From the wall, EDDIE'S VOICE comes over the radio, relieved.

 EDDIE 		They're going back into the jungle.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	EDDIE, JUTTSON, and KELLY sag back against the railings of the
	high hide.

 EDDIE 		Thank God.  Thank God.

	MALCOLM'S VOICE comes over the radio.

				MALCOLM (o.s.)
		Kelly?  Are you all right?

	She takes the radio, her voice shaky.

 KELLY 		Uh huh.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	MALCOLM is at the radio.

 MALCOLM 		Wait there.  I'll come up in a
		minute.  Don't move, understand?

				KELLY (o.s.)
		I understand.

	Malcolm slump against the wall of the trailer.  SARAH and
	NICK sit on the floor leaning against the opposite wall,
	completely drained.  Sarah pulls out her pocket recorder and
	speaks shakily into it.

 SARAH 		Note to Dr. Juttson -- Tyrannosaurus
		rex does nurture its young.

	They laugh weakly.

 NICK 		There's, uh -- there's an unwritten
		rule when a news crew is in a war
		zone.  You stop the van every two
		miles and decide whether or not to go
		on.  Whether or not you feel lucky.
		One "no" from anybody in the group
		and you turn around right there, no
		question asked, nobody embarrassed.
			(pause)
		Well?  Do we go on?
	Immediately:

 SARAH 		No.

 MALCOLM 		No.

 NICK 		No way.

	They all laugh.

 MALCOLM 		All right.  I'm satisfied with the
		evidence we have right now.
		I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will
		too.
			(to Sarah)
		Do you have enough to publish?

 SARAH 		They will come after me.  But I can
		collect some stool samples, for DNA
		with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest
		of you to back me up, it should stand
		when we get back.

 MALCOLM 			(getting up)
		Then the only thing left to do is
		make sure we do get back.  I'll
		call the mainland on the satellite
		phone and have them send the boat
		right now.  This expedition is over.

	He goes to the desk and picks up the heavy gray satellite
	phone that's resting in a battery pack.  The front panel
	lights up, a brilliant green.

	But from the wall speaker, the radio CRACKLES and EDDIE'S
	VOICE breaks through, soft and empty.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
		Oh, God.  I am so sorry.

	Malcolm and Sarah look at the speaker box.

 MALCOLM 		What the hell is he sorry f-

	A low RATTLE sneaks into the trailer.  Malcolm, Sarah, and
	Nick takes a step forward from the walls, looking around.  The
	RATTLE gets louder, the trailer shakes and vibrates,
	everything in it starts to BANG against the walls --

	-- and something huge SMASHES into the side of the trailer.

	They're all thrown against the far wall, there is an
	earsplitting CRACK of electricity, the entire trailer rocks
	and sparks a brilliant blue, and then everything goes black.

	The satellite phone flies out of Malcolm's hands and SMACKS
	against the wall.  It lands on the floor, its number pad still
	glowing green.

	Nick crawls over and looks out one of the windows.  Outside,
	the flank of one of the tyrannosaurs wipes past the window,
	revealing the second tyrannosaur, charging straight at the
	trailer!

 NICK HANG ON TO SOMETHING! 
	They hurl themselves at the nearest solid object and hang on
	for dear life.  The charging rex SLAM into the side of the
	trailer, which rocks up on one side, BANGS back  down, and is
	quickly RAMMED again by the furious animal.  This time the
	entire trailer rolls over, completely upside down.

	Sarah, Nick, and Malcolm let go of their precarious handholds
	and drop onto the ceiling.  The tables, chairs, lab equipment,
	everything that's bolted down clings to the floor above them;
	everything that isn't RAINS DOWN ON THEM.

	But the rexes aren't done.  The trailer JOLTS INTO MOTION,
	sliding forwards.

 SEEN FROM OUTSIDE, 
	the upside down trailer, which is the rear of the two
	trailers, slides along the muddy ground, pushing up earth in
	front of it.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
 SARAH 		They're pushing us!

	Malcolm, frantic, crawls up to a window to get a look outside.
	He looks down and sees a T-rex footprint in the earth outside
	as they move past it.

	He cranks his head to get a look at the direction in which
	they are being pushed.  His eyes widen at something he sees
	outside the window.

 MALCOLM 		Oh, God.

 SARAH 		What?!

 MALCOLM 		They're pushing us over the cliff.

	Sure enough, out the back window, we see a few more feet of
	muddy earth, and then nothing but inky black.  The three of
	them look at each other for a moment --

	-- and then crawl like hell toward the other end of the
	trailer.  The opposite end reaches the edge of the cliff and
	starts up to tip ever-so-slightly downward.  They reach the
	accordion-like connector and Malcolm crawls into it.

 THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD OF THE FRONT TRAILER, 
	which is right-side-up, Malcolm can see the two rexes hard at
	it, pushing the front end of the trailer.

 IN THE REAR TRAILER, 
	Nick has a pretty good grip at the top of the trailer, but
	Sarah can only cling to an air vent in the ceiling as stuff
	starts to roll and tumble past her, headed downhill.

	The angle increases, the trailer dips, and now stuff starts to
	freefall, right past her, some SMASHING her in the head.

	Malcolm, still in the connecting tube, grabs hold.  Sarah,
	starting to be pulled downward, paws at the refrigerator,
	getting a g rip on the handle.  The door, held by a safety
	latch, doesn't open.

	Below Sarah, debris falls to the rear window of the trailer.
	Through the CRACKING glass, we can see the surf, CRASHING five
	hundred feet below.

	The refrigerator bolts suddenly CRUNCH free of the wall.  The
	box strains on its power cord.

	Still clinging to the handle, Sarah swings wildly as it starts
	to come loose, swaying above her.

	The safety latch on the door gives, it swings open, and a
	shower of food BANGS off of her as gravity empties the
	contents.

	Sarah loses her grip and plummets through the now-vertical
	trailer.  She SCREAMS, covers her head, and SMASHES into the
	rear window.  The glass spiderwebs, but does not break.

 FIVE HUNDRED FEET BELOW, 
	an enormous wave POUNDS the rocky shore.  Above, Sarah is a
	tiny figure, sprawled out on the glass, held invisibly by the
	breaking window.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
	Nick SHOUTS to her.

 NICK SARAH! DON'T MOVE! 
	Sarah, stunned by the fall, blinks a few times, regaining her
	senses.  She looks down, at the crashing surf so far below.
	For a person with a fear of heights, this is a real drag.  As
	she stares, the rocks seem to move even farther away from her.
	She blanches; the world spins around her.

 SARAH 		OH... GOD ... please...

	Her breath fogs the cracked glass.  Slowly, she tries to get
	up, caaaaaarefully pulling herself up to her hands and knees.

	But as she puts pressures on her hands, the glass CRACKS even
	more, tiny spiderwebs shooting out around her fingers.  The
	whole glass panel sags, bowing out around the bottom of the
	trailer.

 UP ABOVE HER, 
	Malcolm looks down and sees the satellite phone precariously
	balanced on one leg of the kitchen table, its number pad still
	glowing green.  Nick is closest to it.

 MALCOLM 		Nick!  Grab the phone!

 SARAH 
	looks to her right, at a metal grating that runs along the
	wall of the trailer.  She shifts her weight, leaning on one
	hand to reach for the grating with the other.

 NICK 
	reaches for the satellite phone, its antenna just six inches
	from his outstretched fingers.

 SARAH 
	leans toward the metal grating, all hairline cracks shoot out
	around her pivot hand, shaking through the glass.  The
	splintered glass spread like a disease, it reaches the edge
	of the frame --

	-- and her hand CRACKS right through the glass.  She GASPS and
	pulls her hand out, but now she knees SMASH through the
	glass.

 NICK 
	has two fingers on the phone, but suddenly the whole trailer
	shudders and the heavy phone tips off the table leg and falls.

 NICK SARAH LOOK OUT! 
 SARAH 
	lunges for the metal grating and clings to it just as the
	heavy phone whizzes past her head and SMASHES into the glass,
	opening up a huge hole in the center of the back window.

 UNDERNEATH THE TRAILER, 
	glass, food, lab equipment, and the precious satellite phone
	fall out the broken window and SMASH on the rocks far below.

 IN THE CLEANING, 
	the trailers are split, like an L, the rear trailer hanging
	straight down, the forward one resting on the edge of the
	cliff.  Satisfied with their work, the T-rexes turn and lumber
	back into the jungle.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
	Sarah climbs carefully up the metal grating.  Above her, Nick
	lowers himself as far as he can, reaching for her.

 ON THE CLIFFSIDE, 
	we realize the hanging trailer halted its descent because one
	corner of it is wedged in the branches of a tree that grows
	out from the muddy cliff.

	But now those branches SPLINTER.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
	Malcolm sees the bellows, the connector between the trailers,
	stretch as the lower trailer JERKS and dips lower.

 BELOW HIM, 
	Sarah mountain-climbs through the trailer's kitchen,
	inadvertently kicking the faucet on as she struggles for
	purchase.

 OUTSIDE, 
	the tree branch SNAPS and the trailer jerks, stretching down
	again.  The bellows expands to its full length, stretching
	like a Slinky.

 INSIDE, 
	Nick knows he has to hurry.  He climbs down, bouncing off the
	built-in furniture, moving ever closer to Sarah.

	But Sarah slips and loses her grip, dropping a few feet.  She
	gabs hold of the sink, the flowing water spraying her face.

 EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT 
	EDDIE CARR is in the driver's seat of the jeep, racing through
	the jungle as fast as he can.

 EDDIE 		Hang on -- hang on --

	The foliage SMACKS the windshield, then clears suddenly,
	revealing the endangered trailers on the cliffside ahead of
	him.  The jeep bounces through the deep footprints left by the
	rex and SKIDS to a halt.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	Sarah loses her grip on the sink and falls, SMASHING into the
	frame of the half-broken rear window again.

 OUTSIDE, 
	Eddie bolts out of the car and runs to the front trailer.  He
	SHOUTS in through the broken front window.

 EDDIE HEY! HELLO?! 
 IN THE REAR TRAILER, 
	The three look up from their precarious positions.

 MALCOLM WE'RE IN HERE! GET SOME ROPE! 
 OUTSIDE, 
	Eddie turns and run back to the jeep.  He grabs a coil of
	rope, secures one end around a tree, and hurries back to the
	trailer.

 IN THE REAR TRAILER, 
	Eddie dashes over the mess in the front trailer and crawls out
	into the extended connector.  He peers over the edge, down
	into the second trailer, and tosses the rope.

 EDDIE 		Catch!

	The rope falls through the center of the trailer, its end
	dangling all the way out the smashed rear window.  But the
	trailer SHUDDERS, starting to move again.

 SARAH 		We're sliding!

 EDDIE 		Climbs up if you can!

 OUTSIDE, 
	Eddie runs out of the trailer in time to see the wheels
	dragging forward through the mud as the weight of the dangling
	trailer pulls the whole thing toward the edge of the cliff.

	He runs for the jeep and grabs hold of the power winch on the
	front grill.

	Behind him, the trailer rolls closer to the edge of the cliff.

	Eddie races back to the trailer, pulling out a length of cable
	behind him.  He runs up to the still-moving trailer, dives for
	its towing hook, the cable goes taut --

	-- and he falls short.  Just by six inches, but he's out of
	cable.

 EDDIE 		Damn it!

 INSIDE THE TRAILER, 
	Nick and Sarah are now together, clinging to the rope near the
	bottom of the trailer as it shifts around them.  Malcolm is
	further up, also clinging to the rope.

 OUTSIDE, 
	dirt and rocks pile up around the wheels and spill over the
	edge of the cliff.

	Eddie, back at the jeep, reels out more winch cable.  He turns
	and races back to the trailer just as gravity starts to LIFT
 THE FRONT END OFF THE GROUND! 
	Eddie dives again, and this time the cable hook CLICKS
	securely into the trailer's towing hook.  The trailer lurches
	toward the edge of the cliff and stops.

	But the jeep is jerked forward by the sudden pressure.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
	Malcolm clings to the rope in the middle of the trailer while
	Nick and Sarah try to struggle up it, but a sudden dig knocks
	them back, and their hands slide down the line.  SCREAMING,
	they slide through the trailer and their feet SMASH through
	the remains of the rear window.

	Regaining hold of the rope at the very end, the two of them
	now find themselves hanging out of the rear end of the trailer,
	dangling over the rocky shore below.

 IN THE JEEP, 
	Eddie hits the gas and the tires slosh in the mud, trying to
	get a grip.  The jeep pulls just enough to lower the front
	trailer back to earth.  But the tires spin, fighting to hold
	it there.

 ON THE CLIFFSIDE 
	Sarah and Nick dangle, desperate.

 IN THE JEEP 
	Eddie CHUNKS the shifter into four wheel drive and GUNS the
	engine.  As the motor ROARS, the sound is topped by another
	ROAR, in the distance.

	And this one's not a machine.  But Eddie doesn't hear it.  He
	GUNS the engine again.  There is another ROAR from the jungle.

	Eddie hears this one.  He darts a look at the side view
	mirror.  In it, he sees one of the TYRANNOSAURS bolt out of
	the jungle behind him.

	He GASPS and looks at the other side view.  In it, he sees the
	OTHER REX racing toward him.

	The tyrannosaurs STOMP forward to confront the ROARING jeep.
	The first rex bends over, CHOMPS down on the rear tire, and
	lifts the car to its teeth.

	But the spinning tire LINGS in the rex's mouth, burning it.
	Surprised by the fight in this foe, the rex loses its grip and
	the jeep BANGS back down onto the ground.

	Eddie, horrified, dives down under the steering wheel, to get
	away.  The gas pedal pops up --

	-- which makes the trailer pitch over the side of the cliff.

	But the rex STOMPS down on the jeep to prevent its escape.
	The trailers stop.

	Now the rexes lean down, over the jeep, and focus on Eddie,
	who still covers under the steering wheel.  The first rex
	SNAPS at him, hitting the steering column with it, leaving Eddie fully
	exposed.

	He SCREAMS and the second rex lashes in, seizing him in its
	teeth and tossing him out of the car.

	Eddie pops up into the air between the two rexes, both their
	heads flash at him at the same time, and in a split-second, he
	disappears between their teeth.

	Now completely ignored, the jeep rolls freely forward and the
	trailers drop over the edge of the cliff.

 INSIDE THE TRAILER, 
	Nick, Sarah and Malcolm cling to each other and the rope as
	the trailers fall around them.  The windows flash by as the
	trailers plummet, equipment BANGS and SCRAPES them, but they
	hold on to the rope, still tied to the tree, for dear life.

 ON THE CLIFFSIDE, 
	the trailers slide the rest of the way, exposing the three,
	who pop out the space where the front windshield was.
	Dangling from the rope, they look up and see the jeep, which
	is now rolling to the edge of the cliff.

	It falls, past them, and the whole mess EXPLODES on the rocks
	below.  Finally, it is silent, except for the sound of the
	surf.

 EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT 
	It's quiet up here too, the rexes nowhere to be seen.  At the
	cliff, a hand appears from over the edge.  Then another.
	SARAH pulls herself up, back onto solid ground, then comes
	NICK, then both of them reach over and help MALCOLM up over
	the edge.

	They collapse there, in the mud, completely exhausted.

 MALCOLM 			(softly)
		Eddie?

	He looks at the other two.  They glance around, then drop
	their heads.  Sarah hears a SOUND in the distance.

 SARAH 		Oh, God.  Now what?

	From the edge of the jungle, a cris-cross of flashlight beams
	moves toward them.  But rather than the three or four that
	would signify their own group, there are nearly twenty of
	them.

	The HUNTERS, PETER LUDLOW is in the lead, ROLAND and AJAY
	with him.  DIETER is there too, shepherding KELLY and DR.
	JUTTSON along in front of him.

	Malcolm sees Kelly, they call out to each other, and race
	together.  Malcolm falls to his knees and hugs her as tightly
	as he possibly can.

 MALCOLM 		Are you all right?!  Anything broken?

 KELLY 		I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I
		thought you, are you okay?!

 MALCOLM 		I'm fine... I'm fine...

	Roland looks around, at the mess that was their base camp.

 ROLAND 			(mostly to himself)
		That's what you think.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. RUINED BASE CAMP - NIGHT 
	In the ruins of the first team's base camp, the survivors of
	the night's two separate catastrophes stand face to face, in a
	heated argument.

	MALCOLM sits off to the side, still holding Kelly in his arms,
	just looking down at the ground and shaking his head.  There's
	something about his posture of defeat that is far more ominous
	than any of the hot tempers that are flaring.  LUDLOW rants to
	SARAH while DIETER looms menacingly over NICK.

 LUDLOW 		Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go
		to jail just for being here, did
		you know that?

 SARAH 		Don't start a legal argument with me,
		this island isn't your property, and
		neither are these animals!

	DR. JUTTSON has encountered DR. BURKE.

 JUTTSON 		What are you doing here, Burke?
		There's no TV cameras, what's the
		point?

 BURKE 		Dr. Juttson, you exist outside the
		classroom.  I am amazed.

	Dieter continues to get in Nick's face.

 NICK 		Are you looking for a problem?

 JUTTSON 			(an urgent whisper)
		Everyone, keep your voices down!

 ROLAND 		Back off, Dieter.

 JUTTSON 		Listen to me, by moving the baby
		rex into our camp, we changed the
		adults' perceived territory!

 LUDLOW 		Their what?

 SARAH 			(she understands)
		Oh, God.

 JUTTSON 		That's why they persisted in
		destroying the trailers, they now
		feel they have to defend this entire
		area!  We're not safe here.

 LUDLOW 			(of Sarah and Nick)
		Thanks to you people.

 SARAH 		Hey, we came here to observe, you
		came here to strip-mine the place!
		It's a looter mentality, all you care
		about is what you can take.

 ROLAND 		None of that matters.  Our
		communications equipment's been
		destroyed.  If your radio and
		satellite phone were in those
		trailers that went off the cliff, and
		I'm guessing by the look on his
		face --

	He points at Malcolm, who is still off to the side, sitting in
	stunned silence.  Malcolm looks up and nods, slowly.  The
	grimness of their situation sinks in.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		We are stuck here, ladies and
		gentlemen.  And we're stuck together.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT 
	Back in the hunters' now-demolished camp, members of the two
	groups combine their diminished supplies.  They have half a
	dozen large plastic containers of water, thirty-seven
	containers of food, ranging from Ziploc bags to aluminum tins,
	a variety of weapons, mot of them borne on the hips or
	shoulders of the HUNTER team, the charred and scraggly
	remnants of several pieces of now-useless electrical
	equipment, a flare gun and several flares, somebody's tattered
	paperback ("Crime and Punishment"), a box of Hershey bars, and
	a cartoon of Marlboros.

	ROLAND supervises the assembling of the resources, which are
	displayed in front of him.  LUDLOW, NICK, SARAH, JUTTSON, and
	MALCOLM, who is still holding KELLY close to him, are with
	him.  They hold their discussion in quiet tones.

 ROLAND 		If we can't stay in the rex's
		territory, we have to move tonight.

 SARAH 		Move where?  Our boat's not coming
		for two days, your airlift is waiting
		for an order you have no way to
		send --

	Ludlow refers to the charred and trampled satellite
	photographs of the island, which are still mostly legible.

 LUDLOW 		There's a communication center, here,
		in the old worker village.  Hammond
		put in some kind of renewable power
		source replenishing.  It may still
		work.  If we could get there, we
		could send a radio call for the
		airlift.

 NICK 		How far is the village?

 LUDLOW 		I said if we could get there.

 NICK 		Well, how far is it?

 LUDLOW 		A day's walk, maybe more.  That's not
		the problem.

 ROLAND 		What is?

 LUDLOW 		The velociraptors.

	Malcolm looks up sharply.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Our infrareds show their nesting
		sites are concentrated in the island
		interior.  That's why we planned on
		keeping to the outer rim.

	Malcolm shepherds Kelly away from the conversation and mutters
	something to her quietly in the background.

 DIETER 		What are velociraptors?

 JUTTSON 		Carnivores.  Pack hunters.  About six
		feet long, three or four hundred
		pounds, and very, very fast.

	Dieter brandishes his weapon.

 DIETER 		I think we can handle ourselves
		against them.

	Malcolm rejoins the conversation, alone.  He keeps his voice
	low.

 MALCOLM 		No.  I'm quite certain you can't.

 ROLAND 		Look, we have two choices.  We can
		hike back down to the lagoon, where
		we can sit for two days, in the open,
		next to a heavily used water source
		while we're waiting for your boat to
		arrive, or we can head for the
		village, where we might find some
		shelter and we can call for help.

 MALCOLM 		We'd never make it past the raptors.
		Trust me, I have some experience in
		this matter.

	Roland looks at him.

 ROLAND 		That may be.  But you weren't with
		me at the time.

	Malcolm just shakes his head, then turns and walks back to
	Kelly.  Roland turns to the others.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		Load up.  Let's get this moveable
		feast underway.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. ISLAND - NIGHT 
	The SURVIVORS set forth, marching through the jungle in a
	column.  Two HUNTERS strap on small shoulder-mounted
	servo-flashlights.  Wires run from the lights end in
	sensor pads which they stick to the skin of their necks.  Thus
	attached, when the hunters turn their heads, the servo-lights
	turn with them, illuminating whatever direction they look in.

	MALCOLM screws the barrel into the Lindstradt rifle and slings
	it over his shoulder as he marches, limping heavily.  He looks
	down at KELLY, who is marching alongside him.  His face shows
	the deepest of regret.  He shakes his head, cursing himself.

 MALCOLM 		Damn it.

	He looks away as Kelly looks up at him, questioning.  ROLAND
	falls into step with Malcolm and notices his limp.

 ROLAND 		You all right?

	Malcolm looks at him, then looks away without answering.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		Wrong question?

 MALCOLM 		You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?

 ROLAND 		What's that?

 MALCOLM 		A statistical phenomenon.  Says
		everything in the world goes in
		streaks.  It's real, you see it
		everywhere -- in weather, in river
		flooding, in baseball, in blackjack,
		in stock markets.  Once things go
		bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad
		things cluster.  They go to hell
		together.

 ROLAND 		Feeling a bit blue, are we?

	Malcolm glances at Kelly, who has taken a slightly faster pace
	and is a few steps ahead of them now.

 MALCOLM 		Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.

 ROLAND 		Why did you come here?

 MALCOLM 		So that others would know about this
		place?

 ROLAND 		Why should they?

 MALCOLM 		Because it exists.

 ROLAND 		It'll still exit if they go on not
		knowing, won't it?

 MALCOLM 		Yes.  And people will live in the
		absence of truth.

 ROLAND 		So the truth is more important to you
		than your life?

 MALCOLM 			(lowers is voice)
		I don't care about my life.  But if
		I'd ever thought for a second that
		she would be in danger --

	Roland follows his gaze forward, to Kelly, who's about ten
	yards ahead now.

 ROLAND 		She yours?

 AHEAD OF THEM, 
	Kelly can hear their voices, faint, but clear.  They are not
	as far away as they think they are.

				MALCOLM (o.s.)
		I'm afraid so.  I don't know what the
		hell I'm doing with kids.  I never
		should have had her.

	Kelly's face shows she heard that part.

 BEHIND HER, 
	Malcolm, unaware, continues with Roland.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		Why are you here?

 ROLAND 		Somewhere on this island, there
		exits the greatest predator that
		ever lived.  And the second greatest
		predator must take him down.

 MALCOLM 		But why?

 ROLAND 		You remember that guy, about twenty
		years ago, I forget his name, but he
		climbed Everest without any oxygen,
		came down almost dead.  And they
		asked him, "why did you go up there
		to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I
		went up there to live."

 MALCOLM 			(nods)
		It's called self-testing.  But in
		your case, it sounds more like
		self-destruction.  A uniquely human
		characteristic.  In fact, human
		beings destroy things so well that I
		sometimes think that's our function.
		Maybe every few sons, some animal
		comes along that kills off the rest
		of the world, clears the decks, and
		lets evolution proceed to his next
		phase.  Maybe death and destruction
		are our job, maybe we're supposed
		to destroy ourselves and every other
		living thing that-

	Every person on the trail within earshot has stopped and is
	staring at Malcolm, shaken by his words.  Roland grabs Malcolm
	by the shirt collar and pulls him close, GROWLING in his ear.

 ROLAND 		Tell you what.  You can see whatever
		you want to, to me, but you will not
		spew any more nihilist rants at
		anyone else in the group.  I'm
		fighting panic, and you push the
		wrong buttons.  Understand?

	Malcolm just blinks.  This guy's in charge.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. JUNGLE - DAWN 
	As a purple dawn dissolves the night sky, the SURVIVORS
	stagger on, exhausted.  Some are starting to tire, and there
	are spaces in the column.  MALCOLM's limp seems to be getting
	worse.  NICK reaches out, to take Malcolm's pack, but Malcolm
	swats his hand away.

	KELLY, still ahead of him, falls into step with SARAH.

 KELLY 		I don't think -- my dad doesn't
		think we're going to make it.

	Sarah looks at her.

 SARAH 		Your dad is wrong.  About a lot more
		than he knows.

	She puts an arm around her.  Kelly looks up at her, grateful.
	The long march continues.

 UP AT THE FRONT, 
	NICK catches up to ROLAND.

 NICK 		I think you should call a break.

 ROLAND 		Another half hour.

 NICK 		Some of them won't make another half
		hour.  We didn't come this far to
		start dropping in the middle of the
		jungle.  If you don't call it, I
		will.

	Roland looks at him, steely, then SHOUTS to the group.

 ROLAND FIVE MINUTES BREAK! 
	Immediately, the marchers drop where they stood, absolutely
	drained.

 AT THE REAR OF THE GROUP, 
	DRS. BURKE and JUTTSON are bickering.

 JUTTSON 		I can't believe you're still angry
		about that.

 BURKE 		You know, it's very easy to criticize
		the first person who studies
		something.

 JUTTSON 		No, it's easy to criticize sloppy
		research and hasty conclusions.

 NEARBY, 
	MALCOLM checks Nick's bag of videotapes, making sure they're
	still dry and undamaged.  Sarah comes up, watching him.

 SARAH 		You know, even if we do get those
		tapes back, people are going to say
		it's just another hoax.  Ian
		Malcolm's alien autopsy.

 MALCOLM 		Maybe.  Maybe not.

 SARAH 		Ian, they will misplace our evidence,
		shoot holes in our testimony, and say
		some special effects genius created
		the animals.  The only way people
		will ever believe that dinosaurs
		exist is if you dump a T-rex in the
		middle of times Square.

	He doesn't look at her.  She sits down beside her.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		There's something more important that
		you should be thinking about instead.

 BEHIND THEM, 
	Dr. Burke, furious, has stalked away from Juttson and sits
	down on a rock.  H does a double take, noticing something
	behind the rock.  He leans over and picks it up.

	It's an oval shape about eight inches long, with a pebbled
	exterior.  A dinosaur egg.

	Burke's face lights up, fascinated, and he carefully pieces
	the egg in a satchel he wears over one shoulder.

 AT THE REAR OF THE GROUP, 
	DIETER STARK pulls a wad of toilet paper from his pack, drops
	the pack on the ground, and turns to the Hunter nearest him --
	CARTER, his driver, who has his back turned.

 DIETER 		Wait here for me, would ya Carter?

	He steps off the path, into the jungle.  But as we come around
	the front of Carter, we see he's wearing a Walkman, the
	headphone BLARING tinnily in his ears.

	And he didn't hear a word.

 EXT. THICK OF THE JUNGLE - DAY 
	Only a few feet off the path, it's primary forest, the growth
	so thick that almost all sunlight is obscured.  DIETER claws
	forward until he finds a suitable spot to relieve himself.

	He clears away a bunch of leaves and debris and raises his
	hand to his belt buckle.  He freezes, hearing something we
	didn't.  He glances around, head darting, alert to any danger.

	Nothing there.  Just a few distant ANIMAL CALLS--

	-- and s SCURRYING around to his left.

	Dieter snaps his head in that direction.  At first, he sees
	nothing, but as he moves closer, gun extended in front of him,
	he sees a small dinosaur, a COMPSOGRATHUS, the same
	chicken-sized animal Cathy saw on the beach so long ago.

 DIETER 		It's not polite to --

	He pulls the steel rod out of a loop in his belt and touches
	it to the compy's back.  The blue bolt of electricity CRACKS
	and dances over the compy's body and it convulses in pain.

				DIETER (cont'd)
		-- sneak up on people.

	The wounded compsognathus scurries back into the jungle,
	whimpering.  Dieter clambers through the foliage ten or twelve
	paces, pushes aside two large palm fronds, and steps out
	into --

	-- more jungle.  He stops, puzzled, not sure if he went back
	or forward.

	He looks behind him.  He pauses, recalculating the path he
	took coming into the jungle, MUTTERING to himself, gesturing
	with his hands, retracing his steps.

	He adjusts his angle slightly to the right and heads off in
	that direction.  But after five or six hard-fought steps, he
	stops again.  Still nothing but jungle.

 DIETER HEY! CARTER! YELL OR SOMETHING, I GOT TURNED AROUND IN HERE! 
 ON THE TRAIL, 
	Dieter's cries are faint, but audible.  The only Marchers hear
	enough to hear him is CARTER, but the Walkman is blaring in
	his ears.

				DIETER (o.s.)
		...Carter... me?...

 IN THE JUNGLE, 
	Dieter hears that SCURRYING sound again, this time from his
	right.  He adjusts his angle again and SCRAPES through the
	foliage, moving faster and faster.

	Panicking, he ties to run, but the roots rise high out of the
	ground in the jungle, and he trips on one and falls flat on
	his face.

	He looks up.  The SCURRYING sound comes again, this time ten
	times louder than before, like a hundred feet coming at him.

	Dieter GASPS as something rushes in at him.

	He whirls to his right.  Whatever it is rushes in from that
	side as well.  And the left.  And behind him.  Dieter
	scrambles up into a sitting position --

	-- and laughs.  He is surrounded by at least forty compys now,
	the same as the one he wounded.

	For a long moment, they just stare at him.  Slowly, he brings
	his gun around, to point it at them.

 DIETER 		Easy -- wait -- one more sec-

	As one, the compys SHRIEK and hurl themselves forward,
	covering Dieter's body.  Their teeth and claws FLASH as they
	each try to grab a scrap of his flesh, tearing savagely.

	Dieter SCREAMS and flails, waving his arms and legs wildly.
	Some of the tiny animals lose their grip and sail off,
	SMASHING into trees or the ground.  But dozens of others hang
	on, and Dieter falls over backwards, now lying on his back on
	the ground.

	Hysterical, he fights like hell to get to his feet, SCREAMING,
	shaking, swatting the compys loose.  He spins, and that tactic
	seems to work, as the compys themselves begin to panic and
	drop off of him.  But he also loses his grip on his weapon,
	which goes flying, landing in the thick foliage five or six
	feet from him.

	Losing the attack, the compys turn and dart away en masse,
	stopping ten yards away from him.

	But they turn and regroup, facing him in a line, hopping up
	and down, CHIRPING and SHRIEKING.

	Dieter bounds into the foliage, looking for his gun.  But the
	compys follow him in and he's forced to flee, abandoning his
	lost weapon.

	Ten feet on, he stops, knowing he's screwed without the gun.
	He turns to face the pursuing compys.

	They stop.

	Dieter charges them, SHOUTING, waving his arms.

	The compys turn and run.  Dieter stops.

	The compys stop.  They stare back at him.  There is a moment
	of quiet, then they start to hop again, CHIRPING and
 SQUEALING. 
	Dieter, tired of this game, turns and runs away.

	The compys follow.

 EXT. JUNGLE - DAY 
	From the front of the convoy, ROLAND SHOUTS out.

 ROLAND 		Break's over, move on!

	The exhausted marchers drag themselves back to their feet and
	start to march again.  At the rear of the group, someone taps
	Carter, who is still listening to his music.  Carter gets up,
	hoists his backpack, and marches away.

	Behind him, Dieter's pack is left, forgotten, on the jungle
	trail.

 EXT. DEEP IN THE JUNGLE - DAY 
	DIETER stumbles along, exhausted.  He reaches the edge of a
	stream that runs under the foliage, and his feet slip on the
	stones.  He falls, into the rocky stream.

	Behind him, the army of compys pours over the little hill he
	just crested.  They disappear for a moment, down an incline --

	-- And then swarm over his body.  In a frenzy of splashing,
	Dieter shrugs them off and crawls away, through the stream.
	He gets to his feet but falls again, this time over a log.  A
	geyser of water splashes up in the air behind the log as
	Dieter drops out of sight.

	The compys leap over the log and disappear from view too,
	throwing up their own splashes of water.  SCREECHING,
	CHIRPING, and the sound of TEARING flesh mixes with Dieter's
 SCREAMS. 
	Now, as more compys leap over the log and splash into the
	water below, the geysers that shoot up into our field of view
	are pink.

	And then they're a deep, deep red.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. JUNGLE - DAY 
	The group has stopped again.  Near the rear, SARAH, NICK,
	MALCOLM, LUDLOW, and ROLAND are in a tense conversation with
 CARTER. 
 ROLAND 		How long ago was this?

 CARTER 		Seven, eight minutes.

	Roland looks at them, thinking.  Finally:

 ROLAND 		Then he's dead.  Nobody tells the
		little girl.  Last thing we need is
		screaming hysterics.

	He turns and heads back to the front of the column.

 SARAH 		We have to send someone to look for
		him!

 ROLAND 		You go if you like, but we're not
		waiting for you.  MOVE IT OUT!!

	They look at each other, appalled, but the column starts to
	move.  Numbed, shocked, but left with no choice, they move on,
	one by one.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. ISLAND RIDGE - DUSK 
	The column of MARCHERS has finally reached the island ridge,
	where they are silhouetted against the setting sun.  They're
	taking a break, sprawled out on rocks or over the ground.

	MALCOLM sits next to KELLY, who's sitting on a log.

 MALCOLM 		You okay?

	She doesn't look at him, just gets up and walks away, going to
	sit over next to SARAH.

	Malcolm watches, pained, but Sarah puts an arm around her and
	makes a "she's okay" gesture to Malcolm.

 AT THE RIDGE, 
	ROLAND steps up to the very edge and peers into the island
	interior.  From his vantage point, he's able to see all the
	way to the far side of the island, a rim of herd black cliff,
	miles away.  Between here and the cliffs there is nothing but
	gently undulating jungle.

	He refers to one of the satellite recon photos.

 ROLAND 		Looks like the worker village is down
		in there, about a mile and a half
		northeast from the base of these
		cliffs.

	MALCOLM is next to him.

 MALCOLM 		There must be a game trail, some kind
		of path that goes down there.

	Roland looks around at the exhausted MARCHERS.

 ROLAND 		They'll have to rest before we look
		for it.  Eat.  Sleep.  Two hours.
		Then we hit it.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT 
	The group has made camp in the jungle.  The mood is somber,
	most of the MARCHERS asleep already.  Three or four tents have
	been put up.

 IN ONE TENT, 
	KELLY sits quietly in a corner, her eyes wide, knees hugged up
	to his chest.  SARAH comes in.

 SARAH 		There you are.  Your dad's looking
		for you.

 KELLY 		I doubt that.

	Sarah takes off her outer shirt and hangs it over a bar to dry
	the broad red smear across its front.

 SARAH 		Oh, come on.  Go talk to him.

 KELLY 		Why?  He likes to be alone.  I can
		stay with you.

 IN THE CAMPSITE, 
	all is still.  The nocturnal jungle HOOTS and BUZZES around
	the sleeping marchers.

	In his tent, ROLAND abruptly sits up.  As if he heard
	something.  He looks out the open flap.  In the middle of the
	campsite, he sees AJAY stop in his tracks, head cocked.

	Roland gets up and goes outside, joining Ajay in the middle of
	the camp.

 ROLAND 		You hear something?

 AJAY 		No.  I feel something.

	Roland looks at him.  This isn't so good.  He looks out at the
	shifting jungle.  He notices a thin plume of smoke rising up
	over the trees just barely outside the edge of camp.

 ROLAND 		Oh, no.

 IN SARAH'S TENT, 
	Kelly and Sarah have laid down on top of sleeping bags, trying
	to get a few minutes' rest.  Sarah's shirt hangs over them,
	swaying in the gentle breeze coming through the open flap.

	As the shirt dangles there, swinging softly from side to side,
	we notice the broad red smear across the front.  Oh, that's
	right -- it's blood.

	The baby T-rex's blood.

 AT THE RIDGE OF CAMP, 
	the thin plume of smoke leads down to a tiny cooking fire
	that's been lit by DR. BURKE.

	He's set a small frying pan on top of it, and now he CRACKS
	the dinosaur egg he picked up earlier into the pan.

	Roland and Ajay run up behind him.

 ROLAND 			(hisses)
 ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?! 
	Burke leaps out of the way as Roland kicks dirt on the fire.

 BMBB! 
	Roland, Ajay, and Burke all freeze.  What was that?

 IN SARAH'S TENT, 
	Sarah and Kelly sit up.  They felt it too.

 BMBB! 
 AT THE COCKING FIRE, 
 ROLAND 		Get my weapon.

	Ajay turns and trots away a few steps, then stops cold,
	staring down at the ground.

 BMBB! 
	A recent rain has all left puddles scattered around the camp, and
	impact tremors now create ripples in the puddles -- concentric
	circles spreading to the outer edges.

 BMBB! 
 IN SARAH'S TENT, 
	Sarah and Kelly are frantically sealing up any opened food
	into Ziploc bags.

 BMBB! 
	Now they leap into Sarah's sleeping bag, to seal themselves,
	and draw the zipper up, all the way around.

	Outside, the silhouette of the rex's head passes by the tent.
	Sarah works faster, her fingers struggling to close the last
	few inches, but --

	-- the rex head pokes through the flap of the tent.  It
	sniffs, SNORTING the air in and out.  It looks around the
	tent.

	It sniffs Sarah's hanging shirt, the one that is stained with
	the blood of the baby tyrannosaur.  The adult tyrannosaur
	GURGLES again, COOING and cocking its head curiously.

	In the sleeping bag, Sarah and Kelly's eyes are barely
	visible, wide in panic.  The rex sniffs and nudges the bag,
	trying to figure out what this thing is.

	It rolls the bag over once, decides it's uninteresting, and
	then rises, straights up --

	-- taking the whole tent with it!  The stakes pop out of the
	ground as the tent rises high up into the air and flutters
	away, leaving the sleeping bag fully exposed on the ground
	beneath it.

 IN THE CAMPSITE, 
	the SECOND TYRANNOSAUR now steps out of the jungle, joining
	the first.  Panic hits the camp as the sleeping HUNTERS wake
	up.  Many of them start to run.

	Roland scrambles toward his tent, where he can see his weapon
	lying near the open flap.  As he draws close, an enormous
	T-rex foot stomps down on the tent, driving the rifle deep
	into the mud.

	Roland, weaponless, stands frozen, watching as the panicked
	Hunters flee in all directions.

 ROLAND FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, DON'T RUN! 
	But they ignore him, sweeping him up in the wave of flushed
	prey that pours across the campsite.  Some toss random and
	ill-aimed GUNSHOTS back at the rexes.

 ACROSS THE CAMPSITE, 
	NICK bursts out of the crowd, sees Kelly and Sarah struggling
	to get out of the sleeping bag, and grabs each by an arm.  He
	rips them to their feet and sweeps them off ahead of him, into
	the jungle.

 IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CROWD, 
	MALCOLM, blinking back sleep, stands a good head above the
	rest of the panicking crowd.  Frantically, he scans the group.

 MALCOLM KELLY? KEEEEELLLY?! 
	But he can't see her.

 AT THE EDGE OF CAMP, 
	the two rexes join forces, herding the fleeing Hunters into a
	narrow ravine.

 UP ON A ROCK RACE, 
	Roland scrambles up a steep rock face.  No way in hell he's
	going down  that ravine.  He sees Malcolm, still in the middle
	of the camp, start to head for the ravine.

 ROLAND MALCOLM! OVER HERE! 
	Malcolm runs over and hurls himself at the rock face,
	scrambling to climb up the smooth, steep boulders.

	Behind him, one of the rexes spots him and lunges across the
	camp toward him.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
 FASTER!! 
	Malcolm gives it everything he's got, clawing his way up the
	rock face --

	-- and rex draws closer and pounces at his legs --

	-- and Roland reaches down, grabs Malcolm by the hair and
	pulls him up, out of the rex's grasp.

	The rex falls short, but he's close enough that we can hear
	his teeth SNAP together, closing around nothing but air.  It
	turns, sees easier prey in the fleeing Hunters, and takes off
	after them.

	Malcolm lands on top of the rock ledge with a CRUNCH.  Roland
	unceremoniously dumps a fistful of hair in his lap.

 IN THE RAVINE, 
	Kelly, in the middle of the fleeing crowd with Sarah and Nick,
	hears her father screaming her name and looks up.  Malcolm and
	Roland are on the rock ridge above them, keeping pace.

 MALCOLM 			(shouting)
 KELLY, UP HERE! 
	But Kelly continues to flee, as the rexes are in the ravine
	now, and drawing closer to the group.

	Some Hunters try to leap up and scale the rocks, but the
	ravine is deepening, there's no way out.  One rex grabs hold
	of a Hunter in its teeth and hurls him against the rock face.

	The second rex picks up another Hunter and snaps its massive
	head left and right quickly, to break its victim's neck.  The
	Hunter goes flying forward and crashes into --

	-- CARTER, Dieter's driver, who stumbles and falls.  The rest
	of the fleeing humans run around or over him, but when the
	rex lifts its foot, we see Carter is actually stuck to the
	bottom of it --

	-- and when the animal takes its next step it CRUSHES him into
	the earth.

 UP ON TH ROCK FACE, 
	Malcolm is frantic.

 MALCOLM 		I gotta get down there!

 DOWN IN THE RAVINE, 
	it's obvious no one is going to outrun the rexes, and Nick
	knows it.  He bursts ahead of Sarah and Kelly and spots
	something off to his left.

	It's a waterfall, apparently right in front of a sheer rock
	face.  But there's something about the way the water is
	falling that tells him something.

 NICK SARAH KELLY COME HERE! 
	He grabs each of them and hauls them forward, running straight
	at the waterfall.  Apparently, he intends to jump right into
	the rock, and he's dragging them along with him.

 SARAH WHAT ARE YOU- 
 NICK JUMP! 
	The three of them spring right at the waterfall and disappear
	THROUGH the water.

	DR. BURKE, fleeing along with everyone else, is watching as
	they vanish.

 BEHIND THE WATERFALL, 
	there is a small recess, which is what Nick had hoped for.
	It's small, only four or five feet deep, but it's just enough
	for him, Sarah, and Kelly to cover behind the flowing water.
	Breathless, terrified, they can hear the mayhem outside.

 NICK 		Shhhh... shhhh...

	With an enormous SPLASH, something bursts through the
	cascading water and crashes into them.

	Dr. Burke.

 BURKE 		Get out of the way!

	He pulls his way up against the far wall, as far away from the
	water as he can.

	FOOOOM!  Now another shape bursts through the watery curtain.

	A Tyrannosaur head.  Burke gave away the hiding spot.

	The four SCREAM as the rex's jaws SNAP left and right,
	searching for them, falling just inches short.  They squeeze
	as far back against the wall as they can get.

	The rex can't quite get its head all the way through the
	opening --

	-- so it uses its tongue.  A long, dark blue shape slithers
	out of its mouth and touches the humans, trying to wrap around
	them, to pull them out of the cave.

	Burke, blind with panic, forces himself even further into the
	cave, which pushes Kelly further out.

 SARAH STOP IT YOU'RE PUSHED HER OUT STOP IT! 
	But Burke doesn't listen, throwing elbows to make room for
	himself.  His movements dislodge a portion of muddy earth, and
	a flurry of enormous cockroaches, eight or nine inches long
	each, pour out of the wall and swarm over his face and neck.

	Burke SCREAMS and instinctively leaps away, toward the flowing
	water.

	And that's all the leverage the rex needs.  It curls its
	tongue, wrapping Burke up in it and pulling him between its
	teeth.  SCREAMING hideously, he is dragged out, through the
	waterfall, and disappears.

	Sarah, Nick, and Kelly stare in horror as the white screen of
	water turn pink.

 UP ON THE ROCK FACE, 
	Malcolm and Roland see the rex walk away from the waterfall
	with Burke, leaving the hiding place unmolested.  Malcolm is
	nearly hysterical.

 ROLAND 		She's okay!  They'll stay in there,
		she's okay!

 IN A JUNGLE CLEARING, 
	routed Hunters emerge from the gully at the edge of he
	jungle.  Ahead of them, there is a large open plain covered by
	long "elephant" grass.

	AJAY, running along with them, stops abruptly at the edge of
	the grass, SHOUTING to the others.

 AWAY NO! DON'T GO INTO THE LONG GRASS! 
	Not in the frenzy, they ignore him.  Behind Ajay, the enormous
	shadows of the two pursuing tyrannosaurs stop as well, holding
	up at the edge of the jungle.

	Ajay, torn between a sense of responsibility and his better
	judgement, opts for the former and races into the grass after
	the other Hunters, waving his arms.

 UP ABOVE THEM, 
	Roland and Malcolm come out onto a rocky ledge that has a view
	of the plain below.  Roland can see the Hunters leaving trails
	as they plow through the grass.

 ROLAND 		Elephant grass!

 ON THE PLAIN, 
	the groups of Hunters wades into the middle of the long grass.
	One of them stops and turns, looking back at the jungle trees.

 HUNTER 		They gave up!  They're not chasing
		us!

	There are CHEERS, SIGHS OF relief.  In the distance, AJAY'S
	VOICE can be heard, faintly calling to them to come back.  Up
	on the rock in the distance, they can see Roland, waving his
	arms madly.

	But in the giddiness of their escape, they pay it no mind.
	They continue plowing into the high grass, anything to get
	further away from the tyrannosaurs.

 ABOUT FIFTY YARDS AWAY, 
	the tops of three animal heads rise up slowly, backlit by
	the full moon.  In the distance, the heads can seethe Hunter
	party.  The heads descend, back into the grass.

 BACK WITH THE HUNTERS, 
	they continue forward, oblivious.  Now behind them, four
	more heads rise up in the grass.  As then descend.

	On all sides of the Hunters, the grass ripples as animals move
	forward toward them, undetected, inexorable as torpedoes.

	And these torpedoes are on target.  One Hunter is suddenly
	dragged down, yanked silently below the surface of the tall
	grass.

	In his place, a long, lizard-like tail rises up as the animal
	drops its head to make the kill.

	Behind him, two more Hunters are taken down, and two more
	animal tails rise up in their place.  A Hunter ahead hears the
	RUSTLING and turns.  His face turns white as, behind him --

	-- a VELOCIRAPTOR springs out of the grass.

	Velociraptor runs upright on its powerfully muscled hind legs,
	the second tow of each foot bearing an extra-large curved
	claw, carried in a retracted position, with which it slashes
	on attack.

	Like now.  This raptor SNARLS and SLAMS into the body of the
	Hunter, taking him down.  A feeding frenzy ensues.  The
	Hunters run in all directions, but are pulled down and vanish
	into the twitching long grass.

	Another raptor enters from the right, leaps high into the air,
	past the full moon, SLAMS into the chest of more human prey,
	and takes him down, into the grass.

	Behind them, Ajay's face falls, defeated.  He looks around,
	realizing he too is now stranded in the middle of the long
	grass.

	Around him, four torpedo trails head straight for him.

	Ajay simply closes his eyes.

 UP ON THE ROCK, 
	Roland turns away from the carnage, pained.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. RUINED CAMPSITE - NIGHT 
	SARAH, MALCOLM, KELLY, NICK, ROLAND, DR. JUTTSON, and PETER
	LUDLOW stand in the ruins of their campsite, their ranks
	decimated, spirits shattered.

	Roland is at the hole in the ground where his tent once was.
	He has pulled his .800 Nitro Express from the mud and more or
	less cleaned it, now he's checking the loads.

	Kelly, nearly catatonic with fear, clings to Sarah, and it
	doesn't look as if she'll ever let go.  Malcolm, who is on his
	knees picking through the wreckage of a tent, looks over at
	them, but Sarah waves him off -- "she's okay."

	Roland appears, standing over the group.  He looks at Malcolm,
	who has found the Lindstradt rifle, intact.

 ROLAND 		How many rounds did you find for that
		weapon?

 MALCOLM 		Four, counting the one in the
		chamber.

 ROLAND 		Don't let it out of your hands again.
			(to Sara, but looking at
			 Kelly)
		Can the kid walk?

 SARAH 		Ask her.

 ROLAND 		Can the kid walk?

 KELLY 		I can.  I can walk.

	While he addresses the group, Roland straps on one of the
	servo-lights, the shoulder-mounted flashlights that follow
	your gaze.

 ROLAND 		We're going to find a path down into
		the interior of the island.  Load up
		whatever you think you need, and I
		mean need.  If you can't carry it
		indefinitely, don't bring it.  We'll
		hit the worker village in a couple
		hours and be out of here before dawn.

 AT THE EDGE OF CAMP, 
	Roland bends over one of the three-toed footprints left by the
	rex.  Behind him, the rest of the group is packing up,
	slinging the remnants of their equipment over their shoulders.

	Roland bends over and SNIFFS the footprint.  It's filled with
	a liquid of some kind.

	He takes his canteen, dumps the remaining water into the
	ground, and plunges the canteen into the footprint, filling
	it.  Ludlow hovers over his shoulder.

 LUDLOW 		What is that?

 ROLAND 		Piss.

	Ludlow doesn't ask.

 NOW AT THE FIRE, 
	Roland stares down at the ashes of the cooking fire that led
	to such disaster.  He grabs a handful of the ash and shoves it
	in his pants pocket.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. VALLEY OF DEATH - NIGHT 
	ROLAND and LUDLOW (who, along with Sarah and Malcolm, is also
	wearing a servo-light now) maneuver down a rugged hillside and
	come out in a flattened area.  Ludlow GASPS, looking ahead in
	wonderment.  MALCOLM breaks through the hillside's foliage a
	moment later.  He too stares in amazement.

	SARAH and KELLY come next, then NICK, then JUTTSON.  One by
	one, they all stop and stare.

 SARAH 		God help us.

	They're standing in a flat, sandy area lined with boulders at
	the sides.  The flat area stretches fifty yards from side to
	side and as far as they can see ahead.  But that's not what
	amazes them so.

	Everywhere, the sand is dotted with dinosaur skeletons.  Some
	are huge, apatosaurs, sixty feet from head to tail tip.
	Others are smaller, herbivores of many different kinds.  The
	more intact skeletons lie on their sides, their ribcages arcs
	of pale bone.  but just as many have been ripped apart, bits
	of carcass tossed in every direction.

 NICK 		I do not feel lucky.

 ROLAND 		Keep moving.

	They march on, tiny figures moving among the mountainous
	skeletons by the light of the full moon.  Roland notices one
	carcass in particular, a recent kill.  It's an enormous
	HADROSAUR with fresh bites taken out of it.

	He bends down, studying the soft earth around it for
	footprints.

 FURTHER ON, 
	Malcolm looks up, noticing the bony shapes around them, which
	fall in heavy shadows like cell bars, seem to be changing.

	He turns, and his servo-light shines on the bones.  But
	they're not bones any more at all, they're pipes, the animal
	graveyard now given over to the lifeless skeletons of manmade
	objects -- twisted, rotting machinery.

 LUDLOW 		We made it!

	They hurry over a small rise --

 EXT. WORKER VILLAGE - NIGHT 
	-- and find themselves at the edge of what was once Isla
	Sorna's worker village.  The size of a football field, the
	town is divided by a main street that's dotted on both sides
	by stores, residences, cafes, a gas station.  All the way at
	the far end is a large, blocky, four-story building.

	But the town is a mess.  The hurricane that hit here must have
	been ferocious, for everywhere things are smashed, broken,
	upended.  And the jungle has stepped into the breath, growing
	up, around, and over everything.  Huge root systems snake
	through the street, making it almost impassable.

 MALCOLM 		The jungle.  It's always ready to
		return.

	Roland catches up and looks at Ludlow.

 ROLAND 		Where's the power and radio setup?

 LUDLOW 		Operations building.  Far end of the
		street.

	A light rain falls as they start down the street, carefully,
	silently, Roland and Malcolm with their weapons at the ready.

	They pass the skeleton of a fallen water tower.  An empty gas
	station, its vine-snarled pumps now useless.  The only sound
	is the low mechanical HUM of the servo-lights as they follow
	the group's gazes obediently.

	Every few feet, the group encounters strange, grayish lumps
	that lies in random places in the middle of the street.
	Malcolm, curious, stops and taps one of them.  It's a rock-hard.
	Nick looks over his shoulder.

 NICK 		Lava?

 MALCOLM 		No.

 NICK 		What are they?

 MALCOLM 		I don't know.

	Finally, they reach the operation building, at the far end of
	the town.

 LUDLOW 		The radio rig is inside.  It runs
		directly from the geothermal
		generator, so power shouldn't be a
		problem.

 ROLAND 		Good.

	He pulls out his canteen.  Ludlow watches as he screws the top
	off, moves toward the building, and starts splashing the
	contents on the outside of it.

	The rest of the group just stares at him.

 MALCOLM 		What's he got in there?

 LUDLOW 		Piss.

 SARAH 		What?

 LUDLOW 		Don't ask me.  The guy's completely
		out to lunch.

 NICK 		What in God's name would he want
		with-

	Roland rejoins them.

 ROLAND 		Tyrannosaur urine.  I don't want
		anything to do with it, and neither
		does any other animal on this island.
		This building is now demarcated as
		the rex's territory.  As long as you 
		stay in that building, you'll all be
		safe until the helicopter comes.

	He drops his pack, swings his gun off his shoulder, and checks
	the load.  Dr. Juttson looks fearful.

 JUTTSON 		Where are you going?

 ROLAND 		After the rex.  I saw a fresh kill
		back in the valley with tyrannosaur
		tracks all around it.  If I'm not
		back in time, don't wait for me.

 SARAH 		You've got to be kidding.

 ROLAND 		Runs against my nature to hole up in
		a cave and wait.

 LUDLOW 		Do you think the rex might have the
		infant with it?

 ROLAND 		Possible.

	Ludlow takes off his hat and turns to Nick.

 LUDLOW 		You know how to work a radio, don't
		you?

 SARAH 		You're going too?

 LUDLOW 		I lost everything I came after on
		this trip, but one T-rex in one theme
		park could single-handedly bail
		InGen out of Chapter 11.

	He takes a slip of paper from the brim of his hat and hands it
	to Nick.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		This is the broadcast frequency.  ID
		yourself as "Harvest Leader."  You
		know what to tell 'em.

 MALCOLM 		You gentlemen feel you have to do
		this now?

 ROLAND 		Now's the perfect time.  The animal
		just fed, so it won't stalk us for
		food.  Predators don't hurt when
		they're not hungry.

	Ludlow double checks the clip on his semi-automatic rifle --

 NICK 		No.

	-- and SMACKS it back into the belly of the gun.

				NICK (cont'd)
		Only humans do.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT 
	The console of a sophisticated radio set-up glows brightly,
	all green, red, and yellow.  NICK tunes the dial to a specific
	frequency.  The radio WHINES and HISSES tuning in.

 NICK 			(into microphone)
		CQ, CQ.  This is InGen Operation
		Harvest Leader to Harvest Base.  Come
		in, please.

	The remaining SURVIVORS, minus Ludlow and Roland, shine their
	flashlights around the dusty, vine-hung interior of the
	communications room.  On the wall a row of chrome letters says
	"We Make The Future,"  but the words are obscured by a tangle
	of vines.  Mushrooms and fungi sprout from the carpet.

	On one wall, there is a mural of what the completed Jurassic
	Park would have looked like.  Big hotels, Ford Explorers with
	tourists leaning out the windows taking pictures, big crowds
	at the fences around the animal exhibits.  But none of it came
	true, and now even the mural is runny and dust-covered.

	There is a pause, filed only with radio static.  Sarah looks
	at Nick tensely, waiting.  Finally, a VOICE comes over the
	radio, clean as can be.

				VOICE (o.s.)
		Go ahead, Harvest Leader.

	They all breath a sign of relief.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	With Roland and Ludlow gone on the hunt and the rest of the
	group inside the operations building, main street stands
	deserted and silent.

	Nearly deserted, anyway.  Moonlight shadows lengthen at one
	end of the street --

	-- and FIVE VELOCIRAPTORS STROLL INTO TOWN.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. VALLEY OF DEATH - NIGHT 
	ROLAND AND LUDLOW are back in the valley of death, standing
	amid the giant skeletons of long-dead animals.  Roland bends
	down, checking the carcass of the freshly-chewed HADROSAUR he
	saw earlier.

	A set of giant three-toed rex tracks leads away from the
	carcass, down the stream bed.  Roland follows them.  Ludlow
	follows Roland.

	As they near a bend in the stream, Roland looks down, at the
	surface of the water.  A pattern of ripples moves toward them,
	washing over their ankles.  Roland follows the ripples with
	his eyes.  From up head, around the bend, he can hear the
	sound of an animal eating and drinking.  A very large animal.

	He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a  pinch of the ashes
	from the cooking fire that he scooped up earlier and releases
	that on the wind.  They float there for a second, suspended,
	then blow back at him.

 LUDLOW 		We're downwind.  Good.

	Roland darts a contemptuous look at him.  He puts a finger to
	his lips, gesturing for silence, then steps up, onto the
	shore.  Ludlow follows.

	They creep forward, toward the sounds.  They round the bend
	and Roland hits his belly, edging up over a small rise.

	Over the rise, he sees the TYRANNOSAUR, about a hundred yards
	ahead.  It's stooped over the stream bed, drinking.  Like a
	bird, it dips its head in the water and then straightens up,
	to let the water fall down its throat.  A dozen COMPYS are at
	the water as well, drinking.

	Roland gently FLICKS the safety on his gun to "off."

	Ludlow edges toward the cover of a low-hanging branch.  As he
	puts his weight on one knee, it presses down hard on the
	middle of a small stick, which CRACKS in half.  Roland turns,
	eyes blazing.

	Out in the open, the tyrannosaur snaps its head sharply as
	well, staring in the direction of the sound.  But since
	Roland's own head is turned, he doesn't see the dinosaur's
	reaction.  Roland holds a warning finger out to Ludlow.

	Roland turns his head back.  The tyrannosaur is gone.

 FURTHER ON, 
	the trail of three-toed tyrannosaur footprints stops abruptly.
	Roland stops too, gesturing for Ludlow to freeze behind him.
	Roland glances both ways, looking for any sign of the track.

	To the right, the ground gives way to hard black volcanic rock.
	A short distance behind them, the rock is solid, a massive,
	green, pebbled boulder ten feet high.  Roland frowns and
	WHISPERS in Ludlow's ear again.

 ROLAND 		We took to the rock.

 LUDLOW 		Why?

	In front of Roland, a palm frond sways gently in the night
	breeze.  Roland's eyes widen.  He pulls out another pinch of
	campfire ash and releases it on the wind.

	This time, the ash blows off, straight away from him.

 ROLAND 		Wind shift.

	They freeze, terrified.  Behind them, the enormous green
	pebbled boulder --

	-- opens an eye.

	That's no boulder, that's the MALE TYRANNOSAUR, standing
	rock-solid still, its natural camouflage blending into the
	surrounding foliage perfectly.  Very slowly and almost
	silently, the rex brings its head all the way around until it
	is staring directly down at them from about ten feet away.

	Roland and Ludlow stand frozen, their back to the rex,
	unaware of its presence.

	Until it exhales.  The soft SNORT of its breath isn't quite
	audible, but it brushes the hair on the backs of their necks
	ever so slightly.

	Their hearts drop into their stomachs.  Ludlow speaks, his
	voice a queasy HISS.

 LUDLOW 		It's... behind... us.

 ROLAND 			(the very softest whisper)
		It's just fed.  It won't attack unless
		it's threatened.  Don't move.

	As the rex silently cocks its head, sizing up the danger from
	these intruders, it breathes again.  A few strands of Ludlow's
	hair flap in the exhalation.  He closes his eyes, near tears.

	He can't take it.  His eyes dart, glancing down at the weapon
	he holds in his hands.  Unfortunately, it's extended in front
	of him, away from the rex.

	He risks another HISS.

 LUDLOW 		If I don't move, I can't shoot it.

 ROLAND 		Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.

	Behind them, the rex appears satisfied.  It starts to swing
	its massive head around, back toward the jungle.  It lifts one
	great leg and takes a step into the trees.

	Roland signs and closes his eyes, relieved.

	But Ludlow seizes the opportunity.  He whips his weapon around
	and drops to one knee.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
 NO! 
	The rex is infinitely quicker.  Ludlow just has time to
	squeeze off a short burst of semi-automatic gunfire when the
	animal whirls, takes one elegant step forward, and POUNCES.

	Ludlow's bullets rip harmlessly through the foliage between
	the rex's legs as its big head snaps forward and comes down,
	jaws wide.  They close around Ludlow's body, lift his straight
	up into the air, and toss him once, readjusting their grip so
	it is firmly around his midsection.

	The whole combination of movements takes but half a second.
	By the time Roland turns around, the animal has pivoted and
	darted back into the jungle, carrying Ludlow, still SCREAMING
	and writhing in its mouth.

	Roland raises his gun, to draw a bead on the animal, but
	through the shivering trees, he can only see that the
	tyrannosaur is gone.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT 
	MALCOLM SARAH, NICK, KELLY, and DR. JUTTSON wait nervously in
	the communications room.  An empty can of Dr. Pepper sitting
	on one of the countertops begins to RATTLE.  They look over at
	it, confused, as the lightweight aluminum can CHATTERS on the
	formica counter.

	Other objects in the lab begin to rattle too.  Glass jars
	CLANK against one another, books start to drop off the
	shelves, a stool shudders across the floor.

 KELLY 		What's going on?!

	Above them, the rotting wooden roof of the building starts to
	actually tear away, chunks of moldy timber flying up into
	the night.  They look up, a deafening ROAR fills the room --

	-- and a helicopter's searchlight floods in!

	As the chopper dips lower, looking for a place to land, the
	violent prop wash rips away huge chunks of the roof over their
	heads.

 INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT 
	Up above the operations building, the helicopter circles.  The
	roof of the building is all arches and rotten timber,
	impossible to land open.

	Below, the PILOTS see the SURVIVORS through the torn roof of
	the building.  They wave frantically, their flashlight beams
	piercing the night sky.

 PILOT 		There they are!

	The Co-Pilot scans the street below, but it's choked with
	overturned cars and fallen trees.

 CO-PILOT 		No LZ in the street, too much debris!

 PILOT 		Check the other buildings!

	The Co-Pilot nods and they peel off, swooping over the rest of
	the village.

	At the far end of the street, the Co-Pilot brings the
	searchlight to bear on the large, flat roof of a three story
	building.

	The Pilot gives him a thumbs-up.

 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	MALCOLM, SARAH, KELLY, NICK and finally DR. JUTTSON run out
	the front of the operations building.  At the end of the
	street, they can see the helicopter as it descends slowly over
	the building, to land on its roof.

 MALCOLM 		There it is!

	Happily, the group double-times it down the street, headed for
	the chopper.  Again, those strange rock formations are
	everywhere.  Some seem to be on the sides of buildings, as if
	they once dripped there and then turned to stone.

	This time Sarah pauses at one that is dripping over to the side
	of a car like solidified lava.  Her face falls as a thought
	occurs to her.

 SARAH 		Ian.  It's guano.

 MALCOLM 		What?

 SARAH 		These formations.  They're dried --

 MALCOLM 		Birdshit?

	A VELOCIRAPTORS jumps onto a fallen tree trunk behind them.

	They don't see it.

 NICK 		Who cares?  Let's go!

	Unaware of the raptor's presence, they resume their trot
	toward the helicopter.  Behind them, the raptor crouches and
	SNARLS, but the sound is lost under the WHINE of the
	helicopter's engines.  It springs, covering the distance
	between them quickly.

	The animal SLAMS into JUTTSON, the last person in the group,
	and takes him down.  Juttson is thrown forward, into the
	others, who fall like dominoes.

	Juttson SCREAMS, his voice an unnatural, high-pitched SQUEAL,
	as the raptor flips him over and lowers its jaws into him.

	Sarah looks up, panicked.  Her eyes widen at the sight of a
	SECOND RAPTOR, this one running straight at hr at top speed.
	She buries her face in the dirt, covering her head with her
	hands --

	-- and the raptor's foot SLAMS into the ground between her
	legs as it bounds over her and dives onto Juttson, joining the
	first raptor in the kill.

	Panicked, the group scatters in all directions.  Kelly jumps
	up and scrambles into the middle of the street, where she hits
	the dirt and crawls under a fallen shed in the middle of the
	road.

	Malcolm rolls over to the space where Kelly was, but she's
	gone now.  He looks around frantically.

 MALCOLM 		Kelly?!  KELLY?!

	Sarah rolls onto her feet and sprints toward the building
	nearest her.

	Behind her, a THIRD RAPTOR gives chase, bounding after her
	with horrifying speed.  Sarah runs flat-out, but her speed is
	nothing compared to the raptor's, and it gains on her rapidly.

	The walls of a structure of some kind close in around Sarah,
	and as she leaps across a leather seat and SLAMS a door behind
	her, we realize she's crawled into the back seat of an
	abandoned car.

	But the car door is thin protection against the charging
	raptor, which SLAMS into the window, head first.  The window
	spinderwebs, but does not yield.  The raptor crumples to the
	ground.

	Sarah looks up, through a three inch hole in the middle of the
	web.  The raptor leaps back to its feet and plunges its nose
	into the tiny hole, thrashing, widening it.

	Sarah SCREAMS and the animal forces its entire head through
	the hole, SNAPPING its jaws just short of her face.

	She hurls herself over the seat and into the front as the
	animal penetrates even further into the car, but its torso
	will not fit through the window opening.  It pulls away.

	In the front seat, Sarah gets some very bad news.

	There's no windshield.

	The raptor springs up onto the hood, its claws CLATTERING on
	the sheet metal, and tosses its body through the opening --

	-- just as Sarah hurls herself out the door.  While the raptor
	struggles to right itself in the front seat, Sarah runs to the
	nearest building, ducks inside, and SLAMS the heavy wooden
	door.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 
	MALCOLM races between the idled gas pumps and into the gas
	station building, closing the door behind him.  A moment
	later, a raptor bounds after him, SLAMMING into the door.

	Meeting resistance, it bounces off, notices the plate glass
	window next to the door, and pounces at that.  The window
	SHATTERS and the raptor clings to the ledge, staring inside,
	its tail hanging out.

	Just as it gets inside, Malcolm opens the door and comes back
	out, keeping the place of wall between them.  He pulls the
	Lindstradt rifle off his back and tries to take aim --

	-- but the raptor whirls and springs, forcing him back inside,
	through the door again.

	Willing to play along, the raptor turns and jumps through the
	window again.

 INT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 
	Balancing on the window frame, the raptor HISSES and crouches,
	ready to spring at Malcolm.

	Malcolm takes cover behind the door, which is hanging open
	between them.  He raises the rifle.

	Th raptor springs into the door, BLASTING it off its hinges,
	knocking Malcolm right through a window behind him.

	But the door SMACKS up against the wall, covering the window,
	preventing the raptor from following Malcolm out that way.

	For the moment.

 EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 
	Malcolm flies through the window and CRUNCHES to the ground.
	He GROANS  in agony and rolls off his bad leg, which is twisted
	unnaturally beneath him, and claws in the mud for the gun.

	ROUGH HANDS reach down, grab him by the shirt, and haul him to
	his feet.  It's NICK.  He drags Malcolm away, but in the
	commotion Nick's duffel slips off his shoulder and lands in
	the street, spilling some of the precious videotapes.

	Malcolm scoops them up.

 NICK 		Come on!

 MALCOLM 		Where's Kelly?

 NICK 		She's with Sarah!

	They race off, down the street.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. KILN HOUSE - NIGHT 
	High above SARAH, we see she is standing alone in a three
	story kiln house, a windowless shed used for firing pottery
	and other construction projects.  Catwalks lined with heavy
	chains hang above her, and onto the floor below, she turns in
	circles, wondering what to do now.

	From outside the kiln house, she hears SCRATCHING, digging
	sounds.  From the other side of the door comes an animal
	SNORT, and a small puff of dust and dirt billows up through
	the crack along the ground.

 ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR, 
	the claws of one of the raptors dig furiously, trying to
	tunnel underneath.

 INSIDE, 
	Sarah runs to the opposite wall, falls to her knees, and
	starts digging a tunnel of her own, clawing frantically at the
	ganging tools always and CLANKS as it tears at the earth below
	it.

	Sarah digs faster.  So does the raptor.

	With about eight inches of space under the wall, Sarah grabs
	hold of the bottom of one of the plans and pries it up as
	hard as she can.  It snaps off with a loud CRACK.

	At the door, the raptor stops digging.  It's silent for a
	moment.

	Sarah has a good foot and a half of space under her wall now.
	She starts to lower her body into it --

 -- JUST AS THE RAPTOR'S CLAWS FLASH THROUGH FROM THE OTHER SIDE! 
	Sarah falls back, SCREAMING, leaps to her feet, and jumps up,
	grabbing hold of one of the catwalks above.  She starts to
	climb, up, anywhere up, as the RAPTOR now squirms and thrashes
	its way inside, coming in through her hole.

	Sarah climbs, hauling herself up, leaping from one catwalk to
	another.

	The raptor leaps up onto a catwalk as well and follows her.

 EXT. KILM HOUSE - NIGHT 
	A window in the slanted roof of the kiln house EXPLODES in a
	shower of glass as SARAH kicks through it and climbs outside.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	Nick drags a badly limping MALCOLM down the main street.  They
	can see helicopter at the far end, engine ROARING and
	searchlight playing over them as they draw closer.  They
	approach a rusted, abandoned pickup in the middle of the
	street --

	-- and a RAPTOR leaps on top of it.  Its claws CLACK on the
	roof as it goes into its pre-attack crouch.

	They don't stick around to negotiate.  Nick hauls Malcolm off
	into the nearest building.

 INT. WORKER HOTEL - NIGHT 
	NICK and MALCOLM hurry inside and SLAM the door behind them.
	They're standing in the lobby of a hotel of some kind,
	probably used for overnight guests and day workers who had to
	spend the night.  The room and staircase wind around a large,
	open-aired central area four stories tall.  They SHOUT at each
	other, frantic.

 MALCOLM 		We can't stay in here!

 NICK 		We're sure as hell not going back out
		there"

 MALCOLM 		This is single-wall construction!
		It's just a shack!

 NICK 		It'll hold!

 MALCOLM 		For sixty seconds, maybe!  Look at
		this!
			(RAPS on the door with his
			 knuckles)
		You could-

	With a CRASH, the wood SPRINTERS around the lock and the door
	swings open violently.  Malcolm is thrown aside, landing hard
	on the floor.

	A VELOCIRAPTOR stands HISSING in the doorway.  Nick throws his
	weight against the door.  SLAMMING it hard against the raptor.

	Malcolm rolls over and paws the gun off his back.

	SLAM!  The raptor charges the door again, this time BLASTING
	it off its hinges, knocking Nick to the floor beneath it.  The
	raptor turns and SNARLS at Malcolm.

	Malcolm swings the gun around --

	-- the raptor lunges at him --

	-- Malcolm's finger closes on the trigger --

	-- and the raptor lands on top of him.

	The weight of the animal CRUSHES him into the floor, but the
	gun barrel now stands between them.  The raptor CHOMPS down
	hard on the barrel, its teeth GRINDING on the metal, and SNAPS
	its head, to tear it from Malcolm's hands.

	Malcolm pulls the trigger.

	The raptor's eyes pop wide as the dart SLAMS into the back of
	its throat.  It makes a GURGLING sound, then convulses
	violently and rolls off of Malcolm, yanking the gun from his
	hands as it falls and dies.

	Nick scrambles out from under the door.  Malcolm tries to
	wrench the gun from the raptor's clenched jaws, but it won't
	budge.

 NICK 			(helping him out)
		Head for the roof!

 MALCOLM 		I have to find Kelly!

 NICK 		I think she's with Sarah!

 MALCOLM DAMN IT, BE SURE!! 
 CUT TO: 
 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	KELLY remains huddled under the fallen shed, trembling with
	fear.  She holds her breath and freezes, as just outside, only
	two feet from where she's hiding --

	-- a RAPTOR'S FEET pick their way past her, down the middle of
	the street.

	Kelly closes her eyes and suppresses a scream.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT 
	NICK and MALCOLM burst onto the roof of the now-burning
	hotel and SLAM the door behind them.  The helicopter is now
	only three rooftops away.  They turn and head for it, Nick in
	the lead, but there's an eight foot gap between the buildings.

 MALCOLM 		It's too wide!

	Nick looks around, desperate.  A fallen power pole leans
	against the building they're standing on, its lines gone
	slack.

 NICK 		Help me push this!

	Malcolm understands.  He and Nick throw a shoulder into the
	pole and give it a mighty push, tipping it over in the other
	direction.  One good hard shove and it falls to the far
	building, THUDDING against it solidly.

	Its power lines are not taut, a lifeline from this rooftop to
	the next.  Nick grabs hold and starts to pull himself across
	the gap, hand over hand.

	Behind them, the door of the building SPLINTERS and CRASHES
	open as a raptor throws all its weight into it.  Malcolm leaps
	onto the power line without hesitation and starts pulling
	himself across.

	But even with the door wide open, the raptor on the other side
	hesitates.  It SNARLS and backs away, refusing to come out
	onto the roof.

 ON THE OTHER ROOFTOP, 
	Malcolm lands next to Nick on the second rooftop.  They look
	back at the frightened animal, which takes tow steps out onto
	the roof, SNARLS, and backs into the doorway again.

 NICK 		It's afraid to come onto the roof!

	Malcolm looks around, at the rooftop.  Strange bits of scrap
	and debris seem to have been arranged there, in an odd,
	concentric pattern.

 MALCOLM 		Something's wrong.

 NICK 		Look!  Sarah!

	He points to the roof of the kilm house, in the distance.
	Malcolm turns, and sees SARAH crawling across the tile.  His
	face turns white.

 MALCOLM SHE'S ALONE!! 
 CUT TO: 
 EXT. KILM HOUSE ROOF - NIGHT 
	SARAH has problems.  Still on top of the kilm house, she
	reaches the edge and pushes off the roof, leaping to the roof
	of the next building.

	She lands at the peak of the intersection of the two sides of
	sloping roof.  As she pulls herself up --

	-- a RAPTOR appears on the rooftop behind her.  In full
	stride, it leaps, sails over her, and lands on the roof
	ahead of her.

	Sarah swings to her left and starts to crawl down the slope,
	away from the raptor.  Suddenly the roof board under her
	SPRINTERS and CRACKS under her weight.  The whole section
	pulls up and starts to slide off the roof.  Sarah, clinging to
	it, rides the roof  planks down, away from the raptor.

	She looks over her shoulder, down --

	-- and sees ANOTHER RAPTOR, waiting for her on the roof of the
	building below.

	Sarah quickly rolls off the sliding section of roof, which
	keeps sliding, falling.  The raptor below jumps up, just in
	time to get WHACKED in the head by the falling roof section.

	Sarah tries to cling to the Spanish tile roof, fingers and
	nails slipping on the slick ceramic surface.  She slides all
	the way to the edge, grabs hold of the gutter, and dangles
	there, suspended above one raptor and trapped below another.

	The raptor above works its way down.  The one below leaps up,
	at her dangling legs.  She has left them in time with its
	jumps, to avoid losing her feet.  This can't go on for long.

	Desperate, she pulls one of the Spanish tiles up from the roof
	and hurls it at the raptor below.  It hits the animal in the
	head, for all the good that does.

	But Sarah keeps on, pulling and throwing more tiles.  She
	edges to the right, toward a fresh supply.

	The raptor above edges even closer, claws CLICKING on the
	slick roof.

	Something interesting is happening.  As Sarah pulls the loose
	tiles free, the ones above slide down, to take their place.
	Sarah sees this and pulls more free, knocking them out of the
	way as fast as she can.

	Suddenly an avalanche of loose tiles breaks loose and the
	footing underneath the raptor above disintegrates.  The
	animal's feet flail and grasp, it slides towards the edge amid
	the tumbling tiles.

	Sarah, seeing it coming, swings in close to the building,
	hugging it as closely as she can.  The raptor falls off the
	roof, right past her --

	-- and CRUNCHES into the raptor below.  Both animals SNARK and
	attack one another.

	Now Sarah, her grip exhausted, falls too, landing right next
	to the enraged animals.  They fight and roll, RIGHT OVER HER.
	She GROANS and hugs the wood below her, the raptors continue
	to thrash and bite, they roll back, toward her, she rolls out
	of their way --

	-- and plunges through a hole in the roof.

 INT. LAB - NIGHT 
	Sarah falls through the roof of a deserted laboratory and
	lands in the tray of an old-fashioned hanging fluorescent
	light fixture.

	One end of the fixture's support SNAPS, it drops at a 45
	degree angle, Sarah slides out the other end and CRASHES
	through a window.

 EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
	Sarah lands in the mud in the street below.

 CUT TO: 
EXT. BETWEEN TWO BUILDING - NIGHT 
	With a THUD, MALCOLM lands in the mud between two other
	building, one of which he has just climbed off of.  Panicked,
	he leaps to his feet and starts to SHOUT.

 MALCOLM 		Kelly!  KELLY!

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	SARAH sprints down the main street as fast as she can, toward
	the building on which sits the helicopter.  Above her, she can
	see NICK has now reached the helicopter and is waving to her.

	Sarah reaches the fallen water tower, which is next to the
	helicopter building, and starts to climb it.

 ELSEWHERE IN THE STREET, 
	KELLY is still covering underneath the fallen shed.  In the
	distance, she can see the helicopter.  But she is trembling
	with fear, unable to move.

	The whole shed suddenly RATTLES as something heavy hits it
	outside.  Kelly's mouth drops open to scream, but her terror
	is so complex that no sound comes out.  She raises her hands
	in self-defense, whatever's outside ROARS with effort, the
	entire shed is suddenly RIPPED right up off of her, and she
	looks up --

	-- into her father's eyes.

 KELLY 		Dad!

 MALCOLM 		Come on!

	He grabs her by the hand and they take off down the street.

 ON THE ROOFTOP, 
	Sarah emerges at the top of the water tower structure and
	leaps onto the roof, into Nick's arms.

 NICK 		Where's Kelly?

 SARAH 		Where's Ian?

	Eyes wide with panic, they both turn and look down at the
	street below, where they see KELLY and MALCOLM, racing at top
	speed down the middle of the street --

 -- WITH A VELOCIRAPTOR CHASING THEM. 
 DOWN IN THE STREET, 
	Malcolm and Kelly have a twenty yard advantage on the animal.
	They're pretty fast, but it's faster.

	Above them, Nick and Sarah are at the edge of the roof,
	SHOUTING and urging them on.  They push it, faster.

	They reach the base of the fallen water tower, the jumble of
	struts and metal poles that Sarah climbed.

 MALCOLM CLIMB! 
	Kelly leaps ahead of him and grabs hold of one of the poles,
	pulling herself neatly up to her feet and reaching for the
	next one.

	Malcolm stretches and makes the same effort, but for him it's
	much harder.

	Below them, the raptor springs and SLAMS into the struts,
	shaking the whole structure.  It pulls itself up.

	Higher up, Kelly climbs fast, hands gliding over the poles.
	She breaks out into the open, where a long, narrow pole runs
	on a slight incline up to the roof.  She scampers across it,
	running the balance beam.

	She reaches the other side, on a ledge below the roofline, and
	looks back.  Malcolm is at the other end, hesitating, drained,
	breathing hard.

 KELLY DAD, COME ON! 
	Below him, the raptor closes in.  Malcolm sets out across the
	beam, his legs shaking.  He places his feet carefully, he
	doesn't have nearly the balance Kelly did.

	The raptor draws closer.

				KELLY (cont'd)
 FASTER! 
	Malcolm slips.

	One foot twists right off the bar and he spins, arms flailing,
	trying to regain his tenuous balance.

	But he overcompensates and his whole body, wrenches out from
	under him.  He falls, the bar SMACKS him hard in the chest,
	knocking the wind out of him, and he drops, flipping right off
	the bar and bouncing painfully through the maze of bars below.

	He drops right past the pursuing velociraptor, CRUNCHING to
	a halt in a nest of bars ten feet off the ground, probably
	cracking a rib.  Kelly SCREAMS from above him.

				KELLY (cont'd)
 DAD! 
	She stares down in horror at her father.  Wrenched in among
	the bars, Malcolm is helpless as the animal crouches only six
	feet above him now, with an open attack route.

	The animal SNARKS and goes into its pre-attack crouch.

	Up above, Kelly wipes the palms of her hands on her jeans
	and leaps out into space, grabbing hold of one of the bars.

	The raptor springs.

	Kelly spins around, over the top of the bar, and, at the very
	peak of her trajectory, she lets go.

	The raptor sails through down from above, feet first, SLAMMING
	both of them squarely into the raptor's side, sending it
	hurtling into space.

	She lands hard and awkwardly, CLANGING into the spidery
	scaffolding next to Malcolm as the raptor SMASHES to the
	ground below.  But Kelly manages to hold on.

 KELLY GET UP! 
	She grabs hold of Malcolm and pulls him to his feet.

 ON THE ROOF, 
	Kelly and Malcolm appear over the roofline.  The PILOTS SHOUTS
	from inside.

 PILOT LET'S GO LET'S GO LET'S GO!! 
	Malcolm and Kelly scramble toward the helicopter.  But at the
	opposite side of the roof, a RAPTOR claws its way over the
	edge as well.

	Malcolm sees it and they lunge for the helicopter, but the
	animal is far faster.  It's only ten feet away, then five,
	they're surely done for this time, when --

 -- KA-BOOM! 
	There comes the loudest single gunshot anyone has ever heard,
	and the raptor flies off its feet and lands ten feet across
	the roof, dead.  They look up, to the source of the
	gunshot.

	It's ROLAND, standing at the edge of the roof, holding his
	smoking .600 Nitro Express.

	But there's no time for celebration, as suddenly the
	helicopter's left skid CRACKS right through the surface of the
	roof.

 PILOT HURRY! THE ROOF'S GIVING WAY! 
	The skid dips even further, ripping right through the
	thatch-and-wood construction.  Kelly, who had one foot in the
	helicopter, loses her balance --

	-- as the roof caves in beneath her.

 MALCOLM KELLY! 
	She falls,  SCREAMING, through the hole and down, into the
	building below.

 ONE FLOOR DOWN, 
	Kelly lands with a CRUNCH on the floor immediately below the
	roof, about nine feet down.  But her landing is cushioned by
	an inordinate amount of straw and leaves that have been
	arranged there.  She lifts one hand, and a yellowy, viscous
	substance drips off of it.

	It's yolk.  She looks around, noticing half a dozen large,
	oblong shapes.  Eggs.

	Above her, Malcolm is scrambling, climbing down to her through
	the wreckage of the CREAKING, crumbling roof.

 MALCOLM 		Kelly!  I'm coming!

	Kelly climbs to her knees, but behind her, a large, dark shape
	is moving.  Rising.  Unfolding, in a way.

 IT'S A PTERANODON. 
	Yep, flying dinosaur.  The enormous animal raises its head, a
	brilliant blue crest extending two feet behind its long,
	saber-like beak.  It SQUAWKS at Kelly in fury.  She can only
	stare, spellbound.

	Malcolm reaches her and grabs hold as the angry animal unfurls
	its massive twenty-two foot wingspread.

 ON THE ROOF, 
	the helicopter lurches as it sinks further into the crumbling
	roof, and now the skids are getting tangled in the debris.
	Roland races over to the hole, climbs in a few feet, and
	starts kicking at it, making it larger.

 ROLAND 		Give me a ladder!

 IN THE PTERANODON NEST, 
	Malcolm tries to haul Kelly back up the way he came, but a
	SECOND PTERANODON now appears from the depths of the building,
	SCREECHING in fury at these invaders who have landed in the
	middle of their clutch of eggs.

	An emergency rescue ladder drops through the hole in the roof.
	Malcolm grabs Kelly with one arm and the ladder with the other
	and they start to climb out of the nest.

 ON THE ROOF, 
	Malcolm and Kelly climb the ladder and are pulled into the
	belly of the chopper just as two enormous beaks break
	through the surface of the roof around them.

	The pteranodons are emerging.

 MALCOLM GO GO GO GO GOG GO! 
	The helicopter lurches up a few feet, but it yanked to an
	abrupt stop.  The engines WHINE, the chopper just hovers
	there.

 PILOT 		We're snagged on something!

	They loos down. BOTH PTERANODONS have come out through the
	hole in the roof and are clinging to the skids of the
	helicopter.  They flap their gigantic wings in unison, and
	drag the helicopter off, into the air, away from the nest --

	-- and let go.  Freed, the helicopter gains altitude quickly.

 IN THE HELICOPTER, 
	the PILOTS gape as the pteranodons coast along, right next to
	the helicopter.

 PILOT 		Hang on!  If I tip it hard, I can cut
		'em with the rotors!

 SARAH 		NO!  Don't!  They're not attacking!

	They look out the windows, where, indeed, the magnificent
	animals are merely accompanying them, flying escort as the
	chopper gains altitude.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		They're protecting their nest.
		That's all.  That's all they're
		doing.

	Kelly, completely drained, sits between Sarah and Malcolm,
	each of whom has a protective arm around her.  She sags
	against her father's chest, nothing left.

	He holds her tight and WHISPERS in her ear.

 MALCOLM 		Thank you.  Kelly, thank God.  Thank
		God for you...

 IN THE NIGHT SKY, 
	over the island, the helicopter steadily gains altitude.  A
	hundred feet.  Three hundred.  A thousand.

	As the helicopter is clearly leaving the island, the
	pteranodons now peel off, their job done.  One of them banks
	sharply, right in front of the moon.  The moonlight
	silhouettes it, shining right through its membranous wings,
	lighting it up like a Halloween skeleton.

	Below, the tiny green island melts away into the vastness of
	the wine-dark sea.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. TYRANNOSAUR NEST - NIGHT 
	Elsewhere in the forest, it's not such a happy story.  PETER
	LUDLOW, still alive, drops through the air and CRUNCHES to the
	muddy ground.  Dizzy, bleeding, the breath knocked out of him,
	he opens his eyes and sees a sloping bank of dried mud.

	From behind him, he hears a CHIRPING sound.  He turns.

	He's in the tyrannosaur nest.

	The BABY TYRANNOSAUR faces him, still with a strange
	aluminum-foil cast on its leg.  The baby SQUEAKS with
	excitement as it toddles toward him.

	Ludlow scrambles to his feet, unsure what to do.  Both ADULT
	TYRANNOSAURS stand outside the nest, staring down at him.

	The baby runs toward Ludlow, so he turns and runs away.

	But in an instant, the male brings its head down, knocking
	Ludlow to the ground.  Then it raises its head again.
	Watching.  Waiting.

	Ludlow gets up again and tries to run, but now the female rex
	strikes, knocking him over again.

	Ludlow tries to crawl away, on all fours.  The male bends down
	and closes its jaws around one of his legs, holding it
	tightly.  Ludlow SCREAMS --

	-- and the rex bits down decisively.  The bone breaks with a
	dry SNAP.  Ludlow HOWLS in pain, unable to move, and the baby
	toddles forward eagerly.  Ludlow can only stare as it leaps
	up, onto his chest, and opens its jaws wide.

	Peter Ludlow SCREAMS.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. CEMETERY - DAY 
	Snow falls in a gray midwinter sky.  In a cemetery, a group of
	fifty MOURNERS is grouped around a gravesite next to a coffin
	that is festooned with cascades of flowers.  On a table, there
	is an array of framed photographs --

	-- of JOHN HAMMOND.  A MINISTER reads from the Bible while the
	Mourners wipe away tears.  IAN MALCOLM stands a respectful
	distance from the group, KELLY right beside him.  Malcolm's
	face is blank, tired, his sunburn out of place with the white
	winter setting around him.

	At gravesite, a Young Woman turns, looking back over her
	shoulder.  About sixteen, she's lovely, with long blonde hair
	and an honest, open face.  She notices Malcolm, recognizes
	him.

	She nudges a Young Man next to her, about thirteen years old.
	The Young Man turns and breaks into a smile just as welcoming.

	As the ceremony breaks up, they walk over to him.

 MALCOLM 		Hello, Lex.  Tim.

	LEX stands on her tiptoes and kisses Malcolm on the cheek.
	TIM extends a hand and Malcolm shakes it.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		This is Kelly.  My daughter.

	They nod their hellos.

 LEX 		I'm glad you came, Dr. Malcolm

 MALCOLM 		I'm sorry about your grandfather.

 TIM 		Thank you.

 LEX 		We were going to call you, in a few
		days.  Tim and I have been thinking,
		and we've decided we want people to
		know about the island.  About what we
		all saw.

 TIM 		We think it's something our
		grandfather would want us to do.

 MALCOLM 			(pause)
		Why?

 LEX 		Because it's true.

	Malcolm looks at her for a long moment.

 MALCOLM 		I know, Lex.  But even if we're the
		only ones who ever know, it'll still
		be true.  You see, I've decided
		that if the world found out about
		what your grandfather created, it
		wouldn't be around for very long.

 LEX 		But -- it was real.  You can't let
		people go on saying it's not.

 MALCOLM 		That's the thing about reality.

	He looks down at Kelly.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		Even when people stop believing in
		it, it doesn't go away.

	Kelly smiles and takes his hand, her slender fingers
	interlocking with his.

 EXT. JUNGLE - DAY 
	Back on Isla Sorna, we float over the deserted worker village,
	moving lightly, as in a dream.

 MALCOLM (V.O.) 		Do you feel the cold wind blowing on
		your face?  That's real.

	We sweep low, landing on the roof the helicopter took off
	from, the nest below now careful rebuilt with straw and
	scrap, a dozen unblemished eggs in the middle of it.

 MALCOLM (V.O.) 		Do you see the four of us, standing
		here together, alive?  That's real.

	A PTERANODON land gently on the nest.  Ever so carefully, it
	positions itself over the eggs, lowers itself to roosting
	position, and folds its giant wings around its body.

 MALCOLM (V.O.) 		And maybe that's still that matters.

	The animal raises its head, opens its beak, and SQUAWKS
	approvingly up at the heavens.

	EXT. TROPICAL LAGOON - DAY

	A 135-foot-luxury yacht is anchored just offshore in a 
	tropical lagoon.  The beach is a stunning crescent of white
	sand at the jungle fringe, utterly deserted.

				ISLA SORNA
		87 miles southeast of Nublar

	Two SHIP HANDS, dressed in white uniforms, have set up a
	picnic table with three chairs on the sand and are carefully
	laying out luncheon service -- fine china, silver, crystal
	decanters with red and white wine.

	PAUL BOWMAN, fortyish, sits in a chair off to the side,
	reading.  MRS. BOWMAN, painfully thin, with the perpetually
	surprised look of a woman who's had her eyes done more than
	once, supervises the settings of the table.

	She looks up and sees a little girl, CATHY, seven or eight
	years old, wandering off down the beach.

				MRS. BOWMAN
		Cathy!  Don't wander off!

	Cathy keeps wandering.

				MRS. BOWMAN (cont'd)
		Cathy, come back!  You can look for
		shells right here!

	Cathy gestures, pretending she can't hear.

				BOWMAN
			(eyes still in his book)
		Leave her alone.

				MRS. BOWMAN
		What about snakes?

				BOWMAN
		There's no snakes on a beach.  Let
		her have fun, for once.

	FURTHER DOWN THE BEACH,

	Cathy keeps wandering away, MUTTERING to herself as her
	parents' quarreling voices fade in the distance.

				CATHY
		Please be quiet, please be quiet
		please be quiet...

	Rounding a curve in the beach, her parents disappear from view
	behind her.  A RUSTLING sound draws her attention, and she
	turns, toward where the thick jungle foliage gives way to the
	sand.

	A large bush, maybe twelve feet tall, is moving, its branches
	swaying and shaking.  Curious, Cathy walks up to the bush,
	which abruptly stops moving.

	A small, lizard-like animal, dark green with brown stripes
	along its back, steps out from the bush.  Only about a foot
	tall, it stands on its hind legs, balancing on its thick tail.
	It walks upright, bobbing its head like a chicken.

				CATHY
		Well, hello there!

	The animal (a COMPSOGNATHUS) just stares at her.  Cathy squats
	down on her haunches.

				CATHY (cont'd)
		What are you?  A little bird or
		something?

	She opens her hand.  She's got a handful of goldfish crackers.

				CATHY (cont'd)
		Are you hungry?  You want a goldfish?

	The compy bobs forward a few steps, cautiously.

				CATHY (cont'd)
		Come on.  I won't hurt you.

	The compy draws closer.  Cathy holds the cracker in the palm
	of her hand.  The compy gets closer still --

	-- and hops numbly up onto Cathy's palm.  Her arm dips a bit
	under the weight, but it's not that heavy, and she holds it up
	easily.  It bobs its head, scarfs up the goldfish, and eats
	it.

	Enchanted, Cathy breaks into an enormous grin and returns her
	hand, calling back over her shoulder.

				CATHY (cont'd)
		Mom!  Dad!  You gotta come see this!
		I found something!

	She turns back.

	Thirty more compys have come out onto the sand.  They're
	standing there, bobbing anxiously, staring at her from a few
	feet away.  Cathy's smile fades.

	She turns her head slowly to the right.  TWENTY MORE COMPYS
	have come in from that side, forming a semi-circle, bobbing
	and CHIPPING as they surround her.

				CATHY (cont'd)
			(terrified)
		What do you guys want?

	BACK ON THE BEACH,

	the table is set.  Mrs. Bowman calls out.

				MRS. BOWMAN
		Cathy, sweetheart!  Lunch is ready!

	From around the curve of the beach, a flock of birds bolts
	from the jungle trees as Cathy's shrill SCREAMS suddenly
	pierce the air.

				MRS. BOWMAN
		PAUL!

	She takes off, running down the beach, Mr. Bowman leaps out of
	his chair and follows, and all available deck hands race off
	to help, kicking up geysers of sand behind them.

	DOWN THE BEACH,

	Mrs. Bowman stops dead in her tracks when she rounds the bend
	in the beach.  We don't see what she sees, but we hear the
	frenzied SQUEAKING of the strange compys.  Mr. Bowman and the
	Hands race past her to help Cathy as Mrs. Bowman lets loose a
	horrified, slack-jawed SCREAM, her mouth a perfect oval.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. BOARD ROOM - DAY

	Mrs. Bowman's screaming face dissolves slowly over the
	YAWNING face of a bored CORPORATE EXECUTIVE, TWENTY OTHER
	EXECUTIVES sit around a conference table in the boardroom of a
	monied corporation.  All are in expensive suits, most are over
	sixty.  There are rows of BACKBENCHERS too, whispering in their
	lawyers who sit behind their clients, whispering in their
	ears.  Empty coffee cups and fast food containers on the table
	hint that everyone's been here a long time.

	A familiar VOICE resounds through the boardroom as we move
	down the long table, pat the grim faces of the board members.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		The hurricane seemed like a disaster
		at the time, but now I think it was a
		blessing, nature's way of freeing
		those animals from their human
		confines.  Of giving them another
		chance to survive, but this time as
		they were meant to, without man's
		interference.

	The source of the voice is JOHN HAMMOND, the founder of InGen
	and creator of Jurassic Park.  But he's not in the room.  His
	image is on a closed circuit TV screen, which has been wheeled
	up to the end of the table.

	And he doesn't look good.  He's terribly infirmed, propped up
	in bed, his face pale and drawn, medical equipment BEEPING
	around him.

				HAMMOND (cont'd)
		There are some corporate issues that
		are not about the bottom line.  We
		have so much still to learn about
		those creatures.  A whole world of
		intricate, interlocking behaviors,
		vanished everywhere -- except for
		Site B. Please.  Let's not do what
		is good for more men at the expense
		at what is best for all mankind.

	The CHAIRMAN, seventyish, nods awkwardly to the television.

				CHAIRMAN
		Thank you, John.  Mr. Ludlow?

	He turns to PETER LUDLOW, late thirties, a man with the
	anxious look of someone who insists the buck stop on his desk.
	Ludlow flips open a file, pulls out a stack of black and white
	eight by tens, and tosses them on the table.

				LUDLOW
			(an accent similar to
			 Hammond's)
		These pictures were taken in a
		hospital in Costa Rica forty-eight
		hours ago, after an American family
		on a yacht cruise stumbled onto Site
		B.  The little girl will be fine, but
		her parents are wealthy, angry, and
		very fond of lawsuits.  But that's
		hardly new to us, is it?
			(takes a paper from the
			 file)
		Wrongful death settlements, partial
		list:  family of Donald Gennaro, 36.5
		million dollars; family of Robert
		Muldoon, 12.6 million.  Damaged or
		destroyed equipment, 17.3 million.
		Demolition, de-construction, and
		disposal of Isla Nublar facilities,
		organic and inorganic, one hundred
		and twenty-six million dollars.  The
		list goes on, gentlemen -- research
		funding, media payoffs.  Silence is
		expensive.

	He's warming up.  Not a bad performer.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		This corporation has been bleeding
		from the throat for four years.  You,
		our board of directors, have set
		patiently and listened to ecology
		lectures while Mr. Hammond signed
		your checks and spent your money.
		You have watched your stock drop from
		seventy-eight and a quarter to
		nineteen flat with no good and in
		sight.  And all along, we have held a
		significant product asset that we
		could have safely harvested and
		displayed for profit.  Enormous
		profit.

	He reaches out to a model on the table and gives it a shove,
	sending it sliding down the length of the table in front of
	them.  It's a mini-mall version of a zoo.  Cages hold tiny
	replicas of various kinds of dinosaurs while Boy Scout troops
	and Tourists look on in wonder.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Enough money to wipe out four years
		of lawsuits and damage control and
		unpleasant infighting, enough to not
		only send our stock back to where it
		was but to double it.  And the one
		thing, the only thing standing
		between us and this asset is a
		born-again naturalist who happens to
		be our own CEO.  Well, I don't work
		for Mother Nature.  I work for you.

	Two of his Backbenchers distribute documents from a stack.
	Ludlow takes one and reads from it.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		"Whereas the Chief Executive
		Officer has engaged in wasteful and
		negligent business practices to
		further his own personal
		environmental beliefs --
		Whereas these practices have 
		affected the financial performance
		of the company by incurring
		significant losses --
		Whereas the shareholders have been
		materially harmed by these losses --
		Thereby, be it resolved that John
		Parker Hammond should be resolved from
		the office of Chief Executive
		Officer, affective immediately."  Mr.
		Chairman, I move the resolution be
		put to an immediate vote.  Do I have
		a second?

				BOARD MEMBER
		I second the motion,  Mr. Chairman,
		Please poll the members by a show of
		hands.

	The CHAIRMAN signs heavily, feeling like a traitor.  He can't
	bear to look at Hammond on the TV monitor.

				CHAIRMAN
		All those in favor of InGen Corporate
		Resolution 213C, please signify your
		approval by raising your right hand.

	It starts slowly, guiltily, but every hand in the room goes
	up.  Ludlow sits back, victorious.  Hammond, furious, raises
	his right hand, which holds a remote control, and points it at
	the TV screen.  It goes blank.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. WELDER'S YARD - NIGHT

	Sparks fly out the windows and doors of a shed in the middle
	of a welder's yard.  Scrap iron and steel lies everywhere.
	Somewhere inside the shed, a phone RINGS.

	The WHOOSH of the arc welder shuts off.  DIETER STARK, a big
	barrel-chested man of forty or so, his face streaked with soot
	and grime, steps outside with a cordless phone, a cigarette
	dangling from his lips.

				DIETER
		Yeah.

	He takes a deep drag while someone talks on the other end.  He
	smiles and blows out a cloud of smoke.

							CUT TO:
	INT. NEW YORK SUBWAY - NIGHT

	Smoke turns into steam as a subway THUNDER into a station
	underneath Manhattan.  The door WHOOSH open, spit out some
	COMMUTERS and suck up a few more.

	A tall man hurries down the platform, limping heavily, moving
	as fast as he can.  The subway doors begin to close, but just
	before they meet --

	-- the man jams a cane in between, stopping them.  The man
	is IAN MALCOLM, fortyish, dressed in black from head to toe.
	There's a hard wisdom in Malcolm's eyes that may not have been
	there's a few years ago -- he know what you think, and he
	doesn't care.

	INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT

	MALCOLM finds a seat on the crowded subway car and sits down.
	He looks awful.  Tired.  Weathered.  He notices a CURIOUS MAN
	across from his is staring at his.  Malcolm looks away.  The
	Curious Man still stares.  Nervy, the Curious Man gets up and
	approaches.

				MALCOLM
			(under his breath)
		Shit.

	The Curious Man sits down next to Malcolm, grinning.

				MAN
		You're him, aren't you?

				MALCOLM
		Excuse me?

				MAN
		The guy.  The scientist.  I saw you
		on TV.
			(conspiratorially)
		I believed you.

	No response from Malcolm.  The guy leans in even closer.

				MAN (cont'd)
		Roooooarr.

				MALCOLM
			(a withering look)
		I was misquoted.  I was merely
		speculating on the evolutionary
		scenario of a Lost World.  I never
		said I was in any such place.

	He gets up and moves to another seat on the car, away from the
	Curious Man.  As he sits down, he notices two other COMMUTERS
	across from him are staring at him.

	He looks at them.  They looks away.

	He pulls the collar of his coat up tight around him.  Nowhere
	to hide.

	INT. JOHN HAMMOND'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	A UNIFORMED BUTLER has a question:

				BUTLER
		Whom shall I tell Mr. Hammond is
		calling?

	MALCOLM stands in the foyer of an expensively decorated Park
	Avenue apartment.

				MALCOLM
		Ian Malcolm

	A door opens and a little dog comes YAPPING out of the back.
	It bounds straight at Malcolm, GROWLING, jaws SNAPPING.  It
	lunges --

	-- and Malcolm BATS it away with one swift swing of his cane.
	The dog rolls across the floor and slinks away, WHINING.  The
	Butler looks at Malcolm disapprovingly.
	
				BUTLER
		Not an animal lover?

				MALCOLM
		Not really.

	INT. HAMMOND'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	MALCOLM enters a darkened bedroom.  JOHN HAMMOND lies in the
	bed we saw earlier, on the other side of the room;

	Medical equipment has been disguised as well as possible among
	the furniture and flowers, but the sheer abundance of it tells
	us that whatever has stricken him is going to win this battle.

				HAMMOND
		Ian!  Don't linger in the doorway
		like an ingenue, come in, come in!

	Malcolm steps further into the room.

				HAMMOND (cont'd)
		It's good to see you.  It really is.
		How's the leg?

				MALCOLM
		Resentful.

				HAMMOND
		When you have a lot of time to think,
		it's funny who you remember.  It's
		the people who challenged you.  It is
		the quality of our opponents that
		gives our accomplishments meaning.  I
		never told you how sorry I was about
		what happened after we returned.
	
	Noticing Hammond's deteriorated condition, Malcolm finds it
	hard to sustain anger.
	
				MALCOLM
		I didn't know you -- weren't well.
		
				HAMMOND
		It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are
		finally killing me.
		
				MALCOLM
		They do have motives.  Why did you
		want to see me?  Your message said it
		was urgent.
		
				HAMMOND
		You were right -- and I was wrong.
		There!  Did you ever think you'd hear
		me say that?  Spectacularly wrong.
		Instead of observing those animals, I
		tried to control them.  I squandered
		an opportunity and we still know next
		to nothing about their lives.  Not
		their lives as man would have them,
		behind electric fences, but in the
		wild.  Behavior in their natural
		habitat, the impossible dream of any
		paleontologist.  I could have had it,
		but I let it slip away.
			(pause)
		Thank God for Site B.
		
	Malcolm just looks at him for a long moment.
	
				MALCOLM
		What?
		
				HAMMOND
			(a spark in his eye)
		Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle
		compact to you?
		
				MALCOLM
		What are you talking about?
	
				HAMMOND
		The hatchery, in particular?  You
		know my initial yields had to be low,
		far less than one percent, that's a
		thousand embryos for every single
		live birth.  Genetic engineering on
		that scale implies a giant operation,
		not the spotless little laboratory I
		showed you.

				MALCOLM
		I don't believe you.

				HAMMOND
		Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian,
		something for the tourists, Site B
		was the factory floor.  We built it
		first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some
		miles from Nublar.

				MALCOLM
		No, no, no, no, no, no . . .

				HAMMOND
		After the accident at the park, a
		hurricane wiped out our facility on
		Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave
		the animals to fend for themselves.
		And they did.  For four years I've
		fought to keep them safe from human
		meddling, now I want you to go there
		and document them.

				MALCOLM
		Are you out of your mind?  I still
		have nightmares, my reputation's a
		joke, my leg is shot -- you think I
		need more of that?

				HAMMOND
		It would be the most extraordinary
		living fossil record the world has
		ever seen.

				MALCOLM
		So what?

	Hammonnd picks up a thick file folder from the night table near
	to him and open it on his lap.  Inside, there are memos,
	charts, maps and photographs.

				HAMMOND
		I've been putting this together for
		over a year.
			(MORE)
		I have personal suggestions for your
		entire team, phone numbers, contact
		people.  They won't believe you about
		what they're going to see, so don't
		bother trying to convince them.  Just
		use my checkbook to get them there.
		I'll fund your expedition through my
		personal accounts, as such money and
		equipment as you need, but only if
		you leave immediately.  If we
		hesitate, all will be lost.

				MALCOLM
		John . . .

				HAMMOND
		You'll need an animal behaviorist,
		someone with unimpeachable
		credentials.  I believe you already
		know Sarah Harding.  She's got
		theories about parenting and
		nurturing among hunter/scavengers I
		bet she'd be dying to prove on a
		scale like this.  If you convince her
		to go, it'll be a major coup.  When
		she publishes, the scientific
		community must take it seriously.

	Malcolm just shakes his head, flipping through the file sadly.

				HAMMOND
		Your documentation, you should use
		forensic photographic methods,
		Hasselbladt still cameras, high
		definition video.  When the trick
		photography analysts take your
		evidence apart, make it impossible
		for them to say there was enhancement
		or computer graphic imaging.  Oh,
		this is very important -- avoid the
		island interior at all costs.  Stick
		to the outer rim.  Everything you
		need to know can be found there.
		Vindication lies on the outer rim.

	Malcolm gently closes the file and pushes it back to Hammond.

				MALCOLM
		I'm not going, John.

				HAMMOND
			(fatigue returning)
		Ian, you are my last chance to give
		something of real value to the world.
		I can't walk so far and leave no
		footprints; die and leave nothing
		with my name on it.  I will not  be
		known only for my failures.  And you
		will not allow yourself to go down in
		history as a lunatic.  You're too
		smart.  You'e too proud.  Dr.
		Malcolm.  Please.  This is a chance
		at redemption.  For both of us.
		There's no time to equivocate, we
		must seize it now, before --

	He stops, staring over Malcom's shoulder.  Malcom turns.
	PETER LUDLOW, still in his overcoat, is standing in the
	doorway to the bedroom.  He looks back and forth from Hammond
	to Malcolm suspiciously.

				LUDLOW
		Hello, Uncle John.  Dr. Malcolm.

	Malcolm doesn't answer.  He seems to know Ludlow, and dislikes
	him.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Did I interrupt something?

	Malcolm turns back to Hammond.

				MALCOLM
		Find someone else.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HAMMOND'S APARTMENT/FOYER - NIGHT

	In the foyer, LUDLOW hands MALCOLM his coat, just a trifle
	rudely, and shepherds him to the door.

				LUDLOW
		So, you two were just, uh, telling
		old campfire stories, were you?

				MALCOLM
		Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a
		second that you and I don't know the
		truth.  You can convince Time
		magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer
		of whatever you want, but I was 
		there.

				LUDLOW
		You signed a non-disclosure agreement
		before you went to the island that
		expressly forbade you from discussing
		anything you saw.  You violated that
		agreement.

				MALCOLM
		You cost me my livelihood.  That on
		which I relied to support my
		children.

				LUDLOW
		If your university felt you were
		causing it embarrassment by selling
		wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly
		see how I am to--

				MALCOLM
		I didn't tell anything, I told the
		truth.

				LUDLOW
		You version of it.

				MALCOLM
		There are no versions of the truth!
		This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's
		my life.

				LUDLOW
		We made a generous compensatory offer
		for your injuries.

				MALCOLM
		It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen
		never--

				LUDLOW
		InGen is my livelihood, Dr.
		Malcolm, and I will jealously defend
		its interests.  People will know what
		I want them to know when I want them
		to know it.

	Ludlow tosses something to Malcolm, hard.  It sails across the
	foyer, upright, and Malcolm reaches out and catches it with
	one hand.  It's his cane.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Don't forget that.

	Malcolm stares at him for a long moment.  Finally, he turns
	and walks away.

	But he does not out of the apartment.  Instead, he
	walks directly past Ludlow, crosses the living room, and steps
	back into Hammond's bedroom, closing the door behind him with
	a determined CLICK.

	INT. HAMMOND'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	HAMMOND looks up, hopeful, as MALCOLM comes back into the room
	and walks over to his bed.  He reaches down --

	-- and picks up the file folder.

				MALCOLM
		Do you have a satellite phone?

							CUT TO:

	INT. MOMBASSA BAR - DAY

	ROLAND TEMBO, late sixties, skin like leather and the diamond
	hard look of a cobra, sits at a table in the middle of an
	African cafe/bar in Mombassa.

	It's daytime and the place is half full, mostly with locals,
	but there are a few obnoxious TOURISTS too, Americans on
	safari who somehow found the local handout.

	They're a noisy bunch, but Roland tunes them out, calmly
	eating his lunch and drinking a beer while he reads a book,
	eyeglasses hanging low on his nose.

	Roland suddenly stops reading and furrows his brow.  He looks
	up.  He SNIFFS the air once, then smiles and calls out a
	person's name.

				ROLAND
		Ajay?

	He turns around.  AJAY (AH-jay) SIDHU, a wiry East Indian in
	his late forties, is standing behind him, caught trying to
	sneak up.

				AJAY
			(delighted)
		How did you know?

				ROLAND
			(taps his nose)
		That cheap aftershave I send you
		every Christmas, you actually wear
		it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit
		down, what brings you to Mombassa?

				AJAY
		You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the
		last time you answered your phone?

				ROLAND
		Last time I plugged it in, I suppose.
		Why?

	Behind them, the group of TOURISTS, all men, laughs loudly.
	One of them, the MOST OBNOXIOUS TOURISTS, berates the WAITRESS.

				AJAY
		I got a call from a gentleman who's
		going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts.
		If he's to be believed, it's a most,
		uh, unique expedition.  And very
		well-funded.

				ROLAND
		Well, I'm a very well-funded old son
		of a bitch.  You go.

	The Most Obnoxious Tourist bellows for the Waitress.  His
	buddies LAUGHS.  Roland throws a glance, annoyed.

				AJAY
		But alone?  We always had great
		success together, you and I.

				ROLAND
		Just a little bit too much, I
		think.

				AJAY
		How do you mean?

				ROLAND
		A true hunter doesn't mind if the
		animal wins.  If it escapes.  But
		there weren't enough escapes from you
		and me, Ajay.  I've decided to spend
		a bit less time in the company of
		death.  Maybe I just feel too close
		to it my--

	The Waitress comes to the Tourists' table and the Most
	Obnoxious Tourist actually paws her ass.  Roland is out of his
	chair in a second.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
			(to Ajay)
		Excuse me.

	Romand walks over to the Tourists' table, says something to
	the Waitress in the local dialect, and she walks away, behind
	him.  He stares down at the Most Obnoxious Tourist.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		You, sir -- are no gentleman.

				TOURIST
		Is that supposed to be an insult?

				ROLAND
		I can think of none greater.

	The Tourist looks at his Buddies and laughs.

				TOURIST
		Buzz off, you silly old bastard.

				ROLAND
		What do I have to do to pick a fight
		with you, bring your mother into it?

				TOURIST
		Are you kidding?  I could take you
		with one arm tied down.

				ROLAND
		Really?

	IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR,

	the Waiter finishes tying a man's wrist to his belt in the
	back of his pants with a napkin.  He pulls the knot tight and
	the man turns around.

	It's Roland, with his arm tied down.  The Tourist stands
	across from him.

				TOURIST
		I mean my arm.

	POW!  Roland punches him square in the jaw.  The Tourist
	reels, stunned.  Enraged, he lunges at Roland, swinging with
	both arms.

	Roland bobs, neatly ducking the punches, waits for the Tourist
	to turn around, and POPS him thrice in the face.  The Tourist
	spins and goes down to the floor, face first.  A cloud of
	sawdust and a loud CHEER from the locals rise up in the bar.

	BACK AT HIS TABLE,

	Roland drops the napkin on the table and sits back down with
	Ajay.  In the background, the Tourist's Buddies hurriedly
	carry their fallen cohort out of the bar.

				ROLAND
		Sorry.  We were saying?

				AJAY
		You broke that idiot's jaw for no
		reason other than your boredom.  Tell
		the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even
		interested in knowing this
		expedition's quarry?

				ROLAND
		Ajay.  Go on up to my ranch, take a
		look around the trophy room, and tell
		me what kind of quarry you think
		could possibly be of any interest
		to me.

	Ajay just smiles.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. AFRICAN SAVANNAH - NIGHT

	The African savannah appears in shades of fluorescent green,
	seen through night-vision goggles.  An ANIMAL YELP comes from
	the left and the green vista sweeps abruptly toward it.  The
	world blurs momentarily, then comes into focus on a field of
	long grass.

	The grass ripples in a complex pattern as animals move
	stealthily through it.  One animal head pops up above the
	grass for a split-second, teeth bared, a white stripe between
	its eyes.  SARAH HARDING pulls the goggles away from her face.

				SARAH
		Hyenas.  Ace Face is the striped
		snout.

	Sarah is thirty, with a compact, athletic body built for the
	outdoors.  She loos through the goggles again, sweeping ahead
	of the hyenas to their prey.

	It's a herd of African buffalo, standing belly-deep in the
	grass, agitated, bellowing and stamping their feet.

	Sarah turns to MAKENA, her African assistant.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		They'll try to take down a calf.
		Come on.

				MAKENA
		Closer?

	Sarah scurries up and over a rock face.  Makena follows.
	Closer now, they watch as the hyenas rush the herd, running
	through it, trying to break it up.

				MAKENA (cont'd)
		You know, we could see everything
		from up on the edge of that cliff.

				SARAH
		No way.

				MAKENA
		But the view would --

				SARAH
		No cliffs.
			(into a pocket recorder)
		F1 headed sough, F2 and F5 flanking,
		twenty yards.  F3 center.  F6
		circling wide east.  Can't see F7.

	While she talks, breathless, fascinated by the drama before
	her, Sarah continues to creep closer and closer to the action.
	Makena follows, with growing unease.

				MAKENA
		Sarah.

				SARAH
		F8 circling north.  F1 straight
		through, disrupting.  Herd moving,
		stamping.  There's F7.  Straight
		through.  F8 angling through from the
		north.

	She's practically on top of the animals now.

				MAKENA
		Dr. Harding.

	Makena has a hold of Sarah's sweatshirt and is tugging her
	back, at least trying to slow down her progress as Sarah,
	wide-eyed with fascination, creeps even closer.

	Suddenly there is a tremendous BELLOWING and the grass right
	in front of them rips apart, trampled under the feet of the
	hyenas as they cluster around a fallen buffalo calf.  They
	yelp and jump, their muzzles bloody.

	The adults move aside, making room as the hyena pups come
	forward, squealing to get at the kill.  Sarah's eyes shine
	with excitement and she moves even closer, whispering into the
	tape recorder.

				SARAH
		Brooding behavior in evidence at the
		kill site, pups are ushered forward
		and adults help them eat, pulling
		flesh away from the carcass and--

	A telephone rings.

	Sarah stops in mid-sentence, unsure if she heard what she
	thought she heard.  It rings again, the unmistakable CHIRPING
	of a cellular phone.  Sarah and Makena both move at once,
	pawing at a backpack.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			(a frantic whisper)
		I thought you turned it off!

	Two hyenas look inquisitively in the direction of the phone.
	Sarah comes up with it and jabs at a button in irritation.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		Yes?!

	Someone speaks on the other end.  Sarah rolls her eyes.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		Ian.  This better be important.

	Sarah doesn't say anything for a long moment, just listens as
	the voice on the other end talks.  And talks.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		When?

							CUT TO:

	INT. MOBILE FIELD SYSTEMS - DAY

	Ian Malcolm's leg, badly scarred, is bared and draped over the
	end of a bench.  Two sandbags are fastened to his ankle and
	MALCOLM is lifting them, painfully rehabbing his injury while
	talking on a satellite phone.

				MALCOLM
		We leave in twenty-four hours.  Five
		member team.

	Behind them, the SPARKS of a acetylene torch fly as WORKMEN
	make modifications on several vehicles, including a dark-green
	Mercedes Benz AAV (all-activity vehicle).  The hood of the AAV
	is up and the V-6 engine has been pulled out; a new, smaller
	engine is lowered in its place.  To one side are two long
	trailers, connected by an accordion-like passageway, like on a
	subway car, allowing one to be towed behind the other.

				MALCOLM
		Eddie Carr's handling all our
		equipment and he'll be there to
		maintain it.  He's designing special
		field trailers now, top of the line
		mobile research units.

	EDDIE CARR, fortyish, is barking out orders to the Workmen.

				EDDIE
		No, no, look at the plans, Henry,
		you can't place that strut laterally,
		it has to be crosswise, LOOK AT THE
		PLANS!

	From the ceiling, a large metal age CRASHES down, landing
	next to them on the floor with a deafening CLANG.  They leap
	back and look up.  A WORKMAN waves from a scaffolding.

				WORKMAN
		Sorry, Eddie!  Specs say it can't
		deform at 12,000 PSI, we had to test
		it

	Eddie bends down to inspect the cage, which is rectangular,
	constructed of inch-thick titanium-alloy bars.  Malcolm hangs
	up the phone and walks up, joining him.

				MALCOLM
		Any damage?

				EDDIE
		Minimal.

				MALCOLM
		"Minimal" is too much.   It has to be
		light, it has to be strong --

				EDDIE
		Light and strong, light and strong,
		sure, why not, it's only impossible.
		God save me from academics.

				MALCOLM
		You are an academic.

				EDDIE
		Former academic.  Now I actually make
		things.  I don't just talk.

				MALCOLM
		You think I'm all talk, Eddie?

				EDDIE
			(doesn't look at him)
		It doesn't matter what I think.

				MALCOLM
		Is there anything we've forgotten?
		Anything at all?

	Behind them, someone CLEARS THEIR THROAT.  Eddie and Malcolm
	turn around.  KELLY MALCOLM, an African-American girl around
	twelve years old, stands in the doorway to the garage, a
	duffel bag slung over one shoulder.  She looks at Malcolm and
	breaks into a wide grin.

				KELLY
		Hi, Dad.

				MALCOLM
		Kelly!  What are you doing here?

	She drops the bag on the floor, and wraps her arms around him
	in a warm embrace.  He responds stiffly.

				KELLY
		Vacation.  I'm all yours.  You didn't
		forget, did you?

	She pulls back and looks at him.

				KELLY (cont'd)
		Did you?

							CUT TO:

	INT. EDDIE'S OFFICE - DAY

	KELLY is slumped in a chair in Eddie's office next to the
	construction floor.  Outside the glass windows work on the
	vehicles continues unabated.  MALCOLM hangs up the phone.

				MALCOLM
		Okay, Karen is expecting you in half
		an hour.  You only have to stay with
		her one night, she'll put you on a
		bus in the morning and your mother
		will be at the station when you get
		there.

				KELLY
		I don't even know this woman.

				MALCOLM
		Well, I do, and she's fantastic.
		She'll take you to the museum, maybe
		to a movie if you play your cards
		right.  You're going to have a
		fantastic time.

				KELLY
		Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you
		going?

				MALCOLM
		I can't tell you.  But I'll be back
		within a week.

				KELLY
		My vacation is over in a week.

				MALCOLM
		I'll make it up to you this summer.
		I promise.

				KELLY
		I'm your daughter all the time, you
		know.  Not just when it's convenient.

				MALCOLM
		Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you
		to say that?

				KELLY
		No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own
		once in a while.

	From the construction floor, EDDIE calls out.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
		Dr. Malcolm!

	Malcolm looks at her, trying to make peace.  Quickly.

				MALCOLM
		Is that kid still bothering you?

				KELLY
		Which one?

				MALCOLM
		You know, at the bus stop.  With the
		hair?

				KELLY
		That was about a year ago.

				MALCOLM
		Well, is he?

				KELLY
		No.  Richard talked to his parents.

				MALCOLM
		That Richard.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
		Ian, come here a minute!

				KELLY
			(to Malcolm)
		I could come with you.

				MALCOLM
		Out of the question.  You'd miss the
		gymnastics trials.  You've been
		training for that for a year.

				KELLY
		I don't care about the trials, I
		want to be with you.  I could be your
		research assistant, like I was in
		Austin.

				MALCOLM
		This is nothing like Austin.  Forget
		about it.

				KELLY
		You like to have kids, you just
		don't want to be with them, do you?

	He looks at her, hurt.  Eddie calls out a third time,
	impatient now.  Grateful for the escape, Malcolm gets up and
	heads for the door.  He pauses guiltily.

				MALCOLM
		I'm not like you wan me to be.  I've
		what I can be.

	He leaves.

	INT. MAIN FLOOR - DAY

	While MALCOLM and EDDIE argue over something in the
	background, KELLY circles around the trailers and looks up at
	the windows.  They're all made of tempered glass, fine wire
	mesh inside it.  She looks around, to see if anybody's
	watching.  They're not, so she quickly slips inside the front
	trailer.

	INT. TRAILER - DAY

	Inside, the trailer is a miracle of planning and design.  It's
	divided into sections, for different laboratory functions.
	The main area is a biological lab, with specimen trays,
	dissecting pans, and microscopes that connect to video
	monitors.

	Next to it there's an extensive computer section, a bank of
	processors, and a communications section.  All the lab
	equipment is miniaturized and built into small tables that
	slides into the walls.  Everything is bolted down.

	She notices a large map on the wall.  Off the coat of Costa
	Rica, there is an area that has been circled in heavy black
	ink.

	Kelly puts a finger on the map, crossing westward, through the
	Pacific Ocean.  Thegre are dozen s of islands out here, but in
	the highlighted region, there is a semi-circle of five.
	Matanceros.  Muerte.  Tacano.  Pena.  And Sorna.  Underneath
	the whole island chain, there is a bold legend.

	"The Five Deaths," it says.

	Slowly, an ocean barge starts to chug its way across the
	face of the map, leaving a wake that rolls the printed letters
	of those three ominous words.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. OPEN SEA - DAY

	The map dissolves slowly away as the barge SPALASEHS through
	five foot ocean swells in the open sea.  The barge is crammed
	with equipment, the AAV, trailers, a jeep, and the members of
	Malcolm's team.

	ON THE BOAT,

	MALCOLM stands in the bow, riding the choppy seas.  Next to
	him, DR. JUTTSON, fortyish, holds onto the railing,
	seasick.  He SHOUTS over the DRONE of the boat's engines.

				JUTTISON
			(as the waves pound the
			 boat)
		Couldn't -- we just -- airlift --
		into the -- island?

				MALCOLM
		Dr. Harding insisted we go by sea!
		Helicopters are too disruptive.
		These aren't piles of bones you'll be
		studying this time, Dr. Juttson, they
		live, they breathe, and they react!

	Juttson looks at him skeptically --

	-- and throws up.

	AT THE BACK OF THE BOAT,

	NICK VAN OWEN, a good-looking American in his late
	twenties, is sitting amid a pile of video cameras and other
	photographic equipment, playing with a Game Bow.  SARAH
	HARDING, dressed in field gear, sits down next to him.

				SARAH
		So what's your story, Nick?

				NICK
		I was a cameraman for Nightline for
		six years, been freelance since '91.
		Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.

				SARAH
		That must be interesting.  What drew
		you there?

				NICK
		Women.  'Bout eighty percent female
		in Greenpeace.

				SARAH
		Very noble of you.
			(of the noisy Game Boy)
		You don't think you're bringing that
		thing onto the island, do you?

	Nick grins and shuts it off.

				NICK
		Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the
		woolly mammoths.

				SARAH
		You think this is all a joke?

				NICK
		Oh, please.  How am I supposed to
		keep a straight face when --
			(gestures to the
			 black-clad Malcolm)
		-- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm
		going to Skull Island?

				SARAH
			(not amused)
		Ian's a very good friend of mine.

				NICK
		He doesn't need a friend, he needs a
		shrink.

				SARAH
		I believe in him.

	But her face says even she has her doubts.

				NICK
		Come on, there's only one reason any
		of us are here.  His check cleared.

	She looks at him.

				SARAH
		Drop the cynical pose.  You can't
		pull it off while playing Donkey
		Kong.

	The boat's CAPTAIN, a Costa Rican, points ahead and SHOUTS to
	them.

				CAPTAIN
		There it is!

	They all turn and look out over the bow.  Up ahead, shear,
	reddish-gray cliffs of volcanic rock rise dramatically out of
	the fog-heavy ocean.

				CAPTAIN (cont'd)
		Isla Sorna!

	The boat ROARS ahead, plowing into a heavy wreath of fog.  The
	mist swirls and encircles it.

	EXT. ISLAND FIORD - DAY

	A narrow inlet cuts through the steep cliffs, leading to the
	island interior.  The barge bursts through the fog at the
	mouth of the fiord and heads deeper into the island.

	EXT. LAGOON - DAY

	Lush green plants drip everywhere in this verdant lagoon.
	Sulfurous yellow steam issues from the ground, bleaching the
	nearby foliage white.  In the distance one can hear the cries
	of JUNGLE BIRDS.

	The boat is now beached and the CREW flips the tarps off the
	AAV, the jeep, and the trailers.  The trucks back down a
	narrow ramp and onto the soft clay shore at the edge of the
	lagoon.  There is a large three-toad animal imprint in the
	clay at the water's edge, and the AAV backs right over it,
	swapping its track for the animal's.

	MALCOLM is at the edge of the water with the CAPTAIN.

				MALCOLM
		Be back in three days, but keep the
		satellite phone on and your radio
		tuned to the frequency I specified in
		case we need you sooner.

				CAPTAIN
		Don't worry.  I've lived around here
		all my life, these islands are
		completely --

	In the distance, they hear the faint, strange ROAR of a very
	large animal.  The Captain looks at Malcolm, eyes wide.

				CAPTAIN (cont'd)
		-- safe.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. GRASSY PLAIN - DAY

	The jeep tows the double trailer to the edge of a grassy plain
	just beyond the lagoon, overlooking the interior of the
	island.  The noon sun is high overhead; below, the valley
	shimmers in midday heat.

	EDDIE connects a flexible cable to the jeep's power winch and
	flicks it on.  The cable turns slowly in the sunlight.  Moving
	along the length of it, we see the cable leads to a pile of
	aluminum, some kind of strut assembly painted a camouflage
	color.

	As the winch pulls the cable tight, the jumble of thin struts
	begins to move, slowly rising into the air.  The emerging
	structure climbs, spidery, struts unfolding, fifteen feet into
	the air.  The light house at the top (the cage that was
	tested back at Eddie's workshop) is now just beneath the
	lowest branches of the nearby trees, which almost conceal it
	from view.

	NICK lights a cigarette and carelessly tosses the match on the
	ground.  Malcolm notices.

				MALCOLM
		Listen.  I know you all have probably
		concluded that I'm out of my mind.

	Is it our imagination, or did the trees behind Malcolm just
	sway slightly?

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		That's all right, for now.  But just
		humor me and be careful.

	No, it's not our imagination, there they go again.  Whole
	trees shivering and swaying from left to right and back
	again.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		Even if you think I'm harmless and
		deluded, I promise --

	Now the trees CREAKS and GROAN as they sway.  Everyone has seen
	it, and now Malcolm turns around too.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		-- this place is for real.

							CUT TO:

	INT. DOUBLE TRAILERS - DAY

	It's quiet inside the trailers that serve as their command
	post/living quarters.  The books are lined up neatly on the
	shelves.  The computers sit, booted up and awaiting data
	input.

	All the way in the back, past the spare tires and life
	preservers and canned food and bottled water, up in one
	storage bin all the way on top, there's a RUSTLING SOUND.

	A plastic student ID card pops out in the cracks under the
	bin's door.  A photograph in the lower right hand corner of
	the card is visible -- it's Kelly, Malcolm's twelve-year-old
	daughter.

	The card wriggles against the lock and, with a soft CLICK, the
	door pops open.  KELLY herself tumbles out, wrapped in several
	blankets and carrying a mason jar half full of a yellowish
	liquid.  We can guess.

	She leaps to her feet, blinks the light out of her eyes, and
	bolts to the back of the trailer as fast as she possibly can.
	She races through a narrow door and SLAMS it shut.

	A sign on the door says "RESTROOM."  Inside, a SIGH of relief
	is heard.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. JUNGLE TRAIL - DAY

	Along a stream bed, the jungle trees still shiver.  NICK loads
	a three quarter inch tape into his heavy video camera and
	chews anxiously on a piece of gum.  SARAH and DR. JUTTSON are
	beside him as the group nervously follows the GROANING forest
	trees to their right.

	At the rear, EDDIE and MALCOLM walk side by side.  Eddie is
	carrying a heavy silver rifle, an aluminum canister hanging
	beneath the barrel.  He shows it to Malcolm, his voice low and
	urgent.

				EDDIE
		Lindstradt air rifle.  Fires a
		subsonic Fluger impact-delivery dart.

	He cracks open the cartridge bank, revealing a row of plastic
	containers filled with straw-colored liquid.  Each is tipped
	with a three inch needle and carries a bright yellow warning
	tag -- "EXTREME DANGER!  LETHAL TOXICITY!"

				EDDIE (cont'd)
		I loaded the enhanced venom of Conus
		purpurascens, the South Sea cone
		shell.  Most powerful neurotoxin in
		the world.  Acts within a
		two-thousandth of a second.  Faster
		than the nerve-conduction velocity.
		The animal's down before it feels the
		prick of the dart.

	From their right, the shaking trees seen closer now.  By
	walking down the stream bed, the humans are tracking right
	along with the animals as they move in the foliage.

				MALCOLM
			(to Eddie)
		Is there an antidote?

				EDDIE
		Like if you shoot yourself in the
		foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be
		dead  before you realized you'd
		accidentally pulled the trigger.

	Ahead of them, thick foliage blocks the path of the dried up
	stream bed to the height of about fifteen feet.  But around
	them, the CRASHING sounds get louder and closer, the swaying
	trees shiver right beside them.  Eddie raises the rifle in
	defense as the trees right at the edge of the stream bed sway
	and part.  Above the foliage, they see the sudden
	movement --

	-- of a row of STEGOSAUR fins.  The spade-shaped fins run
	along a ridge down the middle of the animal's back, about
	three feet tall each.  The group freezes, amazed, and as the
	stegosaur continues on, they get a good look at it through a
	break in the foliage.

	It's a large dinosaur with a small head, a thick neck, and a
	huge lumbering body.

	A double row of plates runs along the crest of its back, and
	it has a dragging trail with long spikes in it.

	The gum drops out of Nick's mouth, FLOPS onto his shirt, and
	sticks there.

				NICK
		Oh --

				JUTTSON
		-- my --

				EDDIE
		-- God!

				SARAH
		It's beautiful!

	A second stegosaur, a baby about a quarter the size of the
	first animal, breaks through the foliage, following the adult.

	While the group is reaching to that, the earth vibrates and
	a third stego, by far the biggest of the three, walks out of
	the foliage right behind them, crossing within ten feet.

	Apparently unconcerned about these little creatures in their
	environment, the stegos continue on across the stream bed.

	Sarah raises a still camera and shoots pictures.  Her shutter
	is muted, so that a muffled CLICK is all that's audible.

	Juttson raises a pocket recorder to his lips and whispers into
	it breathlessly.

				JUTTSON
		Stegosaurus, family Stegosauridae,
		infraorder Stegosauria, suborder
		Thyreophora.  Length, adult male,
		estimate twenty-five to thirty feet.

	His breathy words turn into almost helpless laughter, of all
	things, as he can't contain his astonishment.  Eddie covers
	his mouth, trying to keep him quiet.

				SARAH
			(to Juttsn)
		That was a pair bond!  A family
		group, even, long after that infant
		was nestbound!

				JUTTSON
		I want to see the nesting ground!

	Nick turns to Malcolm, eyes like saucers, and makes a futile,
	wordless, boy-was-I-wrong-on-this-one gesture.  Malcolm
	smiles, leans over, and TAPS softly on Nick's video camera.
	Nick raises it to his shoulder and flicks it on as the group
	continues on into the bush after the animals.

	IN THE BUSH,

	the baby wanders away from the group and ambles over near
	where Sarah crouches in the bushes.  Sarah raises her camera
	again and silently SNAPS a picture.  She WHISPERS to Juttson,
	who is beside her.

				SARAH
		Lone nest -- not colonial.  I don't
		see an egg clutch...

	She gestures and Juttson peers through a pair of field
	glasses.

				JUTTSON
			(whispering back)
		The empty shells are crushed and
		trampled.  The young stay in the
		birth environment, that's conclusive!

				SARAH
		Not without a shot of the nest.

	She sees an opportunity.  As the baby heads back to its
	parents, Sarah scoots right along with it, moving behind it,
	using its body as a shield to block her from the view of the
	other two.

	Nick and Eddie's faces whiten in alarm.  Nick reaches out to
	stop her, but he barely gets hold of the sole of her boot
	before she pulls away from him and duckwalks out into the
	clearing.

	IN THE CLEARING,

	Sarah slinks along behind the baby stego as it walks back,
	toward the nest, chewing the branches it carries in its south.
	She raises up sightly, squeezing off pictures of the herd,
	ever better as she gets closer.

	BACK AT THE HILL,

	the others can only watch her, aghast.

				NICK
		She's gutty.

				MALCOLM
		She's nuts.

	IN THE CLEARING,

	Sarah keeps moving closer.  The baby passes a small grouping
	of rocks and Sarah ducks behind them.  She's now in a perfect
	position to photograph the nest, and she squeezes off picture
	after picture from this ideal vantage point.

	She shoots the last picture on the roll --

	-- and the camera's autowinder WHIRS to life.  Sarah looks
	down in horror as the camera's motor WHINES loudly in her
	hands.

	Th noise startles the animals.  The male turns toward her
	the plates on its back bristling.  Sarah gets to her feet and
	starts to move away, slowly.

	The male turns away from her and swings its tail, spikes
	extended.  It WHIZZES through the air, right at her, but Sarah
	leaps back at the last second --

	-- and the tail's spikes THUD into the dirt where she was.

	Sarah CRUNCHES to the ground and the three stegosaurs dart
	away, disappearing into the bush, moving surprisingly quickly
	for animals their size.

	The others run to Sarah, help her to her feet, and pull her
	back, against a massive tree trunk.  But the tree trunk lifts
	right up off the ground.

	It's no tree, it's a DINOSAUR'S LEG, a massive one, six feet
	across, God knows how many feet high.  The Group gasps and
	looks up as a MAKENCHIASAURUS, an enormous saurupod over a
	hundred feet from nose to tail,  lumbers away from them.

	The Group stares in wonder as the mamenchiasaur stops and
	HONKS furtively, its long neck stretched out above them.

	Now a second mamenchiasaur neck cranes out of the
	surrounding forest trees and wraps around the first.  The
	first mamenchiasaur THUNDERS around in a semi-circle, getting
	into position behind the second.

	Nick swings his video camera straight up and the group
	suddenly finds itself in the middle of a mamenchiasaur mating.

	The mighty tails swing and SNAP around them as the two animals
	come together, and trees start snapping and falling, CRASHING
	to the jungle floor.

	The group panics and bolts for cover toward the only place
	where the trees are not falling -- which is directly underneath
	the animals!

	Amid HONKS and BLEATS, the swinging tails continue to deforest
	the jungle around them.

	The noise and chaos is deafening, drowning out the LAUGHTER
	and SCREAMS of the fascinated and terrified group.

	There is a momentary lull and the group dashes out from
	underneath the animals, disappearing into the thick forest.

	A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY,

	the Group collapses to the ground, breathless, chests heaving
	with wild, frightened laughter.  Sarah goes to Malcolm and
	throws her arms around him, exhilarated.

				SARAH
		Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so
		glad!

				JUTTSON
			(out of breath)
		Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you
		an apology.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. JUNGLE TRAIL - DAY

	Suddenly, the Gathereres are taking their expedition a lot more
	seriously.  They march quickly back to base camp, their energy
	and excitement palpable.  NICK strikes a match and raises it
	to a cigarette with a shaking hand, but SARAH leans in and
	blows it out.

				SARAH
		No more smoking.  We leave no scent
		of any kind.  No hair tonics, no
		cologne, seal all our food in plastic
		bags.  We will observe and document,
		but we will not interact.

				MALCOLM
		That's a scientific impossibility,
		you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty
		principle.  Whatever you study, you
		also change.

	Nick ejects the used videotape from his camera and pulls out a
	sharpie, to label it.

				NICK
		What should I call this?  "Jurassic
		Pork?"

	Eddie, next to him, laughs.

				SARAH
			(still to Malcolm)
		And let's forget about the high hide.
		We can't do this kind of work up in a
		tower, we need to be out in the
		field, as close to the animals as
		possible.

				JUTTSON
		I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in
		a family group, but there's never
		been anything in the fossil record to
		prove the carnivores did.

				SARAH
		Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas,
		jackals, nearly all species of
		predator birds --

				JUTTSON
		That doesn't say a thing about T-rex,
		they could have been rogues.  Robert
		Burke certainly thinks they were.

				SARAH
		We've got to see one to find out.
		Is there any --

				MALCOLM
		No way.

				NICK
		Oh, my God.

				SARAH
		-- way we could safely --

				NICK
		Oh, no!

	He takes off, running as fast as he can, down the trail,
	toward base camp.  They look ahead, in the direction Nick is
	running.  A plume of black smoke is rising up over the trees.

				EDDIE
		Fire!

							CUT TO:

	EXT. BASE CAMP - DAY

	NICK bursts out of the trees and races toward the thick plume
	of smoke.  In the middle of the base camp, someone has neatly
	built a campfire surrounded by stones.  Flames burn in the
	middle.

	Nick races over to it and stomps it out as the OTHERS emerge
	from the trees behind him.

				MALCOLM
		A campfire?!

	Nick grabs a jug of water, but Sarah steps in.

				SARAH
		No!  Water mixes the smoke billow,
		use dirt!

	They start to kick and rake dirt onto the fire with their
	hands and feet.  Eddie and Dr. Juttson jump in and help out.

				MALCOLM
		Who the hell started a campfire?!

				VOICE (o.s.)
		It was just to make lunch.

	Malcolm turns toward the source of the voice.  KELLY stands in
	the doorway of the trailer, sheepish.

				KELLY (cont'd)
			I wanted it ready when you got back.

	The whole group stares, stunned, none more so than Malcolm
	himself.

				MALCOLM
		Oh ... man.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. BASE CAMP - LATER

	Later, and base camp is a blur of activity.  SARAH, JUTTSON,
	NICK, and EDDIE are hard at work, burying the remains of the
	fire, sealing their food in plastic bags, loading camera
	equipment, packing up specimen containers and other
	information-gathering equipment.

	MALCOLM, meanwhile, is lecturing Kelly.

				MALCOLM
		You know you were putting yourself in
		a potentially dangerous situation,
		but you didn't bother to find out
		how dangerous before you leapt in.
		You don't have the faintest idea
		what's going on on this island!

				SARAH
			(loading a backpack)
		What do you want to do, Ian, lock her
		up for curiosity?  Where do you think
		she gets it?

				JUTTSON
			(to Nick)
		Do you have chromium tapes?  The
		others fog in high-

				NICK
		-humidity, I know.
			(waving a tape)
		Highest lead density on the market.

				EDDIE
			(to Malcolm)
		We've got a lot of heavy marching
		ahead of us.  I'm not carrying 
		anybody.

				KELLY
		I can keep up.

				MALCOLM
		You're going home.  I'm sending a
		radio call for the boats.  We'll all
		go down to the lagoon and wait for
		them.

				SARAH
		Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a
		high school vice-principal.

				MALCOLM
		I'm her father.

				KELLY
		Sure, now.

	Nick leans over and whispers to Eddie, gesturing to Malcolm
	and Kelly.

				NICK
		Do you see any family resemblance
		here?

				MALCOLM
		You can't stay, Kelly, that's it.
		It's too dangerous.

				SARAH
		If it's so dangerous, why'd you bring
		any of us?

				KELLY
		You're wrong, Dad.  I do know
		what's going on on this island.

				MALCOLM
		How could you possibly?

				KELLY
		Because you said so.  Maybe nobody
		else believed you, but I always
		did.

	He looks at her, touched.  Nick mutters to Eddie again.

				NICK
		The kid scores with cheap sentiment.

				SARAH
		Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've
		made two invasive landings in one
		day.  That'll have to go in any paper
		I write, and it will leave room for
		people to say our findings were
		contaminated.  You know the academic
		world as well as I do, once they
		smell blood in the water, you're
		dead.  Our presence has got to be one
		hundred percent antiseptic.  That
		means if we bend a blade of grass, we
		bend it right back the way it-

	A low sound has been rising while she speaks, and now it comes
	BOOMING over the jungle around them, a THUNDEROUS racket that
	shakes the very ground beneath them.  Suddenly, three C-130
	military cargo planes THUNDER overhead and ROAR toward the
	island interior, flying very low.  The planes are enormous,
	fat-assed creatures, their rear cargo doors hanging open.

	AT A RIDGE,

	the members of the gatherer expedition hit the dirt and peer
	over a ledge, watching as the airplanes bank and circle over a
	specific spot.

	Eddie raises a pair of field glasses.

	DOWN BELOW,

	huge metal equipment containers are shoved out the back of the
	cargo bays.  They SNAP off trees like matchsticks, CRUSH flat
	anything foolish enough to exist where they want to land.

	Now MEN pour out the rear of the planes, their low-altitude
	parachutes billowing open behind them.

	UP ON THE RIDGE,

	Nick looks at Sarah.

				NICK
		You were saying something about
		antiseptic?

							CUT TO:

	EXT. HUNTERS' CAMP - DAY

	Metal container doors CLANG to the ground, jeep engines ROAR
	to life in a cloud of thick black diesel smoke, blue laser
	barriers SIZZLE and BURN through foliage as this group of
	HUNTERS establishes a perimeter around their new camp.

	PETER LUDLOW, dressed in brand new Banana Republic safari
	wear, steps into the center of the camp and surveys the
	surroundings.  He turns to DR. ROBERT BURKE, a ragged,
	pony-tailed man in wire-rimmed glasses.

				LUDLOW
		Welcome to your dream come true, Dr.
		Burke.

	Burke has a detailed set of satellite recon photographs that
	he spreads out on the hood of a jeep.

				BURKE
		I believe the large herbivores forage
		in open plains, like bison, which
		would explain the great variety of
		heat dots we're reading in the
		flatlands around this waterhole.
		Right -- here.

				LUDLOW
		Then that's where we're going.

	Burke flips open a manifest that he will carry with him at all
	times.  Inside, there are dozens of sketches of various kinds
	underneath.  As each vehicle ROARS out of the equipment
	container, Burke slips a waterproof eight by ten card with an
	icon of the various dinosaurs on the island into a slot in the
	dashboard.

				BURKE
			(calling them off)
		Hadrosaurus!  Carinthosaurus!
		Maiasaurus!

	As the procession goes on, Ludlow turns to DIETER STARK, the
	man we saw welding earlier.

				LUDLOW
		This is as good a place as any for
		base camp.  First priority is the
		laser barriers, I want them all up
		and running in thirty minutes.  Half
		an hour, understand?

	Dieter nods and turns to some of the HUNTERS, who number about
	twenty in all, that are working nearby.  But someone steps in
	front of Dieter, cutting him off.  It's ROLAND TEMBO, the
	hunter from the bar in Mombassa.

				ROLAND
		Cancel that, Dieter.

				LUDLOW
		What?  Why?

	Roland points to a stream running nearby.

				ROLAND
		Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do
		you want to set up base camp or an
		all-you-can-eat people bar?

				LUDLOW
			(thinks)
		You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new
		spot.  And remember, we're after
		herbivores only -- no unnecessary
		risks.

	Dieter SIGHS and goes to work.  Roland puts an arm around
	Ludlow and pulls him aside.

				ROLAND
		Peter, if you want me to run your
		little camping trip, there are two
		conditions.  First -- I'm in
		charge, and when I'm not around,
		Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the
		checks, tell us we're doing a good
		job, and open your case of scotch
		when we have a good day.  Second
		condition -- my fee.  You can keep
		it.  All I want in exchange for my
		services is the right to hunt one of
		the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck
		only.  Why and how are my business.
		If you don't  like either of those
		conditions, you're on your own.  Go
		ahead and set up your camp right
		here, or in a swamp, or in the middle
		of a rex nest, for all I care.  But
		I've been on too many safaris with
		rich dentists to listen to any more
		suicidal ideas.  Okay?

				LUDLOW
			(what else can he say?)
		Okay.

				ROLAND
		Good lad.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. JUNGLE

	The jungle foliage shivers, quakes, and finally falls as the
	Hunters' convoy ROARS into the hart of the jungle.  DIETER
	STARK stands in the front of the lead vehicle, the
	"speedbird," waving the convoy forward, his Driver (CARTER) at
	the wheel beside him.

	LUDLOW is in the back seat of the speedbird next to DR. BURKE.
	ROLAND and AJAY, his tracker, are in the second jeep.  They
	look up as the brakelights on the speedbird flash and the car
	stops, forcing the rest of the convoy to halt as well.

	In the front, the speedbird flashes its lights at something in
	front of it.  Dieter climbs out, plainly irritated.  He walks
	around the front of the car and sees --

	-- four PACHYCEPHALOSAURS eating grass in the middle of the
	jungle trail.  They're about five feet tall, thick, heavy-set
	animals whose distinctive feature is an enormous skull casing,
	a tall, impressive crown that rises on the tops of their
	heads.  Dieter doesn't seem impressed.  He looks back at
	Ludlow, who look at Dr. Burke.

	Burke stands up in his seat, a look of wonder on his face.

				BURKE
		Pachycephalosaurus!

				LUDLOW
		Carnivore?

				BURKE
			(enchanted)
		Huh?  No!  No, herbivore, late
		Cretaceous.  Very unusual plant
		eater, see that distinctive domed
		skull?  That's nine inches of solid
		bone.

				LUDLOW
			(who cares?)
		Just get them out of the way, Dieter.

				DIETER
		COME ON, MOVE IT!!

	The pachys look up at him sluggishly, still eating, like cows
	chewing their cuds.  As unimpressive with him as he is with
	them, they go back to their grass.

				DIETER (cont'd)
		Oh, for God's --

	He slings his rifle off his  shoulder and aims it at the
	closest animal.  Behind him, Roland has climbed out of the
	second jeep.

				ROLAND
		Dieter.  This is a round-up, not a
		war.  Use your powers of persuasion.

	Dieter gestures to the speedbird to pull ahead, which it does,
	slowly, toward the animals.  The pachys look up, alert, but do
	not move.  Dieter walks toward them.

				DIETER
		Come on, come on, don't have all
		day!

				BURKE
			(going on to no one in
			 particular)
		See, the pachy's neck attaches at the
		bottom of its skull instead of the
		back of its head, as with reptiles.

	The speedbird draws closer.  The first pachy stares at it
	intently.  The lead vehicle gets closer, closer --

	-- and BANGS into the pachy, knocking it back a few feet, out
	of the way.

				BURKE (cont'd)
		So when it lowers its head, its neck
		lines up directly with its
		backbone --

	BEHIND DIETER,

	Ajay is staring at something on the ground at his feet.  He
	takes a few steps further into the foliage, then turns back
	toward Roland.

				AJAY
		Roland.

	UP AT THE FRONT,

	the pachys turn and hop away.  Dieter turns and heads back to
	the speedbird.  As he reaches for the door, a VOICE calls
	"look out!" from behind him.  Dieter spins around, just in
	time to see --

	-- the first pachy in full charge.  It SLAMS headfirst into
	the speedbird, SMASHING the headlights and denting the grill.

				BURKE
			(concluding his lecture)
		Which is perfect for absorbing
		impact.

	Dieter turns and runs around to the front of the car.  The
	pachy has backed up  for another run and is now CHARGING RIGHT
	AT HIM.

	Dieter retreats, quickly, and rips open the passenger door to
	protect himself.

	SLAM!  The pachy clobbers the door, sending Dieter flying
	against the car, knocking the wind out of him.

	In the other jeeps, the rest of the HUNTERS stand up or lean
	out the window for a better look, laughing.

	POW!!  The pachy head-butts the tire next to Dieter.  It
	bounces off, tumbles to the ground, and rolls to its feet as
	Dieter gets to his knees and crawls toward the back of the
	speedbird.

	But the pachy is quicker and lunges at Dieter again.  He's
	forced to hit the dirt and crawls quickly underneath the
	speedbird, just as the animal SLAMS into the rear of the
	vehicle.

	Now the other three animals join the jun.  Ludlow and the
	Driver have to cover their heads as the animals lunge at the
	car again and again, SMASHING the steel-meshed windows and
	MANGLING the quarter panels.  The rest of the group watches,
	vastly amused.

	A FEW STEPS INTO THE JUNGLE,

	Ajay and Roland are staring at something on the ground -- an
	animal footprint, three-toed, enormous.

				AJAY
		It matches the pictures.

				ROLAND
		It certainly does.

	Roland gets up and goes back to his vehicle, ignoring the
	pachy demolition derby that continues up at the speedbird.
	Roland opens a case in the back of the jeep, revealing --

	-- his gun.  It's an antique elephant gun, a double barreled
	.600 Nitro Express.  Nearly a hundred years old, it's still in
	immaculate condition, its rosewood stock buttery smooth,
	bisons delicately engraved along its silver breach.

	The barrels are twenty-four inches long, topped with an ivory
	bead foresight at the business end.  Roland scoops up the gun,
	breaks the breach, and pulls two rounds of ammunition from his
	shirt pocket.

	Four inches long and three-quarters of an inch in diameter,
	these are the largest full metal jacket cartridges ever made.
	He slips one into each barrel and heads back into the bush.

	Roland pauses before he goes, as if noticing the animals
	trashing the speedbird for the first time.

				ROLAND
		HEY!

	The pachys all freeze, staring at him.  Roland waves one hand,
	HISSES sharply between his teeth --

	-- and the pachys scatter, back into the jungle.  Takes care
	of that problem.  Roland turns and heads back into the jungle,
	calling out over his shoulder to Ludlow.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		Don't worry about us.  We'll catch
		up.

				LUDLOW
		Where do you think you're going?!

				ROLAND
		To collect my fee.

	And with that he disappears into the foliage.

	The Driver of the Speedbird drops it into gear and the
	battered car GROANS forward.  As it moves ahead, it reveals
	DIETER, lying underneath it, ego bruised worse than body.

	IN THE JUNGLE,

	Ajay takes a step into the bush, but at a ninety degree
	angle away from the direction in which the animals tracks
	lead.

				ROLAND
		Ajay.

	Ajay turns.  Roland points in the direction in which the
	footprints lead.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		I'm no tracker, but even I can read
		this spoor.

				AJAY
		Do you wish to go where the animal
		has been, or where the animal is?

	Roland smiles.  Ajay sets off in his direction and Roland
	follows.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. ISLAND RIDGE - DAY

	Seen from a ridge above them, the hunters' convoy continues to
	plow through the jungle.  But how the hunters themselves are
	being tracked, followed by the GATHERERS.  They scurry along
	as fast as they can, trying to keep pace with the moving
	vehicle below.

				EDDIE
		Why didn't you tell us about these
		guys, Ian?!

				MALCOLM
		Because I didn't know!  I don't have
		the faintest idea what they're doing
		here.

				NICK
			(angry)
		Ruining everything, that's what
		they're doing.  You could choke on
		the diesel smoke already!

				SARAH
		Ian, nothing we observe will be valid
		if we're trailing along in the wake
		of an army.

	Kelly has a pair of binoculars and is studying the vehicles as
	they move below.

				KELLY
		"InGen."  What's InGen?

				MALCOLM
		Where does it say that?

				KELLY
		On the side of that one truck.

	Malcolm takes the binoculars and stares down there himself.

				JUTTSON
		InGen is a genetics corporation,
		isn't it?

				NICK
			(to Malcolm)
		Is that who we're really working
		for?!  Gene splicers?!

				MALCOLM
		No!  We're an independently funded
		expedition.

				SARAH
		Funded by whom?

				MALCOLM
		John Hammond.

				JUTTSON
		But he's the head of InGen!

				NICK
		You gotta be kidding.
			(to Malcolm)
		You dragged me out of Greenpeace to
		be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't
		get anybody else?

				KELLY
		Yeah, what have you done, Dad?

				SARAH
		We'd better keep moving, or we'll
		lose them.

	The group moves on ahead, but Malcolm lingers, angry, staring
	through the binoculars.

				MALCOLM
		What are you doing to me, John?

							CUT TO:

	EXT. THE CAVES - DAY

	AJAY and ROLAND make their way through the foliage and come
	into a small clearing, where a cluster of caves is carved into
	the rock.  Ajay freezes, gesturing ahead, to the cave on the
	far left.

	Roland pulls up a handful of grass and releases it on the
	breeze.  It floats back between his legs.  That's good.

	He proceeds toward the cave, carefully, Ajay behind him.  They
	can see nothing beyond the yawning mouth of the cave, only a
	black interior.

	Roland pauses, looking down.  On the ground to his right he
	sees the partially eastern leg of a creature.  It's old,
	crawling with white maggots and flies.

	Roland continues on.  Closer to the cave, he now passes the
	skull of a large animal, some of the flesh and green skin
	still adhering to the bone.  It, too, is covered with flies.

	Still he continues on.  A short rise leads into the cave, and
	they edge up it.  From inside the cave, they can hear an odd
	SQUEAKING sound, very high-pitched.

	Crawling now, Roland and Ajay scale a four-foot circular
	rampart of dried mud, and peer into --

	-- the tyrannosaur nest.  It's flattered inside, about ten
	feet in diameter, completely encircled by earthen walls.

	A BABY TYRANNOSAUR, about four and a half feet long, is in the
	center of the nest.  It has a large head, very large eyes, and
	its body is covered with a fluffy red down, which gives it a
	scraggly appearance.

	It SQUEAKS repeatedly, tearing awkwardly at the remains of a
	chunk of animal flesh, biting decisively with tiny, sharp
	teeth.

	The cave itself is a foul boneyard.  ANIMAL CARCASSES litter
	the edges, flies BUZZ in the captive air.  Roland raises a
	bandana to his nose to cover the stench.  He  turns to Ajay and
	WHISPERS.

				ROLAND
		It's the rex nest.

	Ajay nods.  The baby tyrannosaur hears the whisper and looks
	up, cocking its head in curiosity.

				AJAY
		Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck
		to return?

				ROLAND
			(shakes his head no)
		If the nest is upwind, so are we.
		When he comes back, he'll know we're
		here before we have a chance.  The
		truck --

	In the nest below, the baby SQUEAKS angrily at the intruders.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		-- is to get him to come where we
		want him.

	The baby SQUEAKS again, indignant.  Roland turns and looks
	down at it.  Thinking.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. RIDGE - DUSK

	As the sun glows bright orange on the horizon, NICK raises a
	pair of binoculars to his eyes and peers down at the vista
	below the ridge.

	In the lenses of the binoculars, we can clearly see a mixed
	herd of midsized herbivores -- HARDOSAURS, PACHYCEPHALOSAURS,
	and CALLIMIMUSES -- racing across the plain below.
	
	MALCOLM, also staring through binoculars, lies on the ridge
	beside him.  SARAH is several feet behind them, her back
	pressed against a tree, unwilling to go to the lip of the
	ridge.

	THROUGH NICK'S BINOCULARS

	We see a shaky point of view of the herd running.  The
	binoculars whip to the right --

	-- revealing a jeep chasing the herd  Not just one jeep, in
	fact, but a whole FLEET OF HUNTER PURSUIT VEHICLES!

	There are two herding jeeps, one motorcycle, as speedier
	mini-jeep, and, further behind, a container truck and a
	wrangler's pickup truck.

	Although there's a great deal of commotion below, up here it's
	almost eerily silent.

	ON THE RIDGE,

	Nick lowers the binoculars, angry.  When he raises them again,
	the sun FLARES off the lens --

	EXT. THE PLAIN - DUSK

	-- and when the brilliant flare clears, we're right down in
	the middle of the roundup.  Engines ROAR, wheels spin and dig
	in the dirt, men SHOUT and radios SQUAWK as the hunter
	vehicles pursue the fleeting herd they're flushed.

	The HUNTER SHOUT and SHRIEK with glee, incredulous and
	thrilled by the spectacular animals they're pursuing.

				HUNTER
		LOOK AT THESE THINGS!

				HUNTER 2
		THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL, MAN, THEY'RE
		BEAUTIFUL!!!

	One of the pursuit vehicles (a "snagger"), pulls ahead of the
	others.  DIETER STARK stands in the passenger seat, holding a
	long pole with a noose dangling from the end of it.

	He swings the pole out over the side of the jeep and SHOUTS to
	the driver.

				DIETER
		FASTER!

	The Driver hits the gas and the snagger leaps forward, gaining
	on the herd.  Aware of the danger behind them, the herd veers
	to the right, toward the cover of thick jungle --

	-- but the motorcycle ROARS in from the right side, cutting
	them off, herding them back out into the open.

	BACK IN THE CONTAINER TRUCK,

	PETER LUDLOW stands in a "conning tower," a command post in
	the heaviest pursuit vehicle.  He BARKS into a walkie-talkie.

				LUDLOW
		Alive, Dieter, and uninjured!

	BACK ON THE SNAGGER,

	the Driver can barely keep up with the twists and feints
	thrown by the herd ahead of him.  Dieter CURSES and throws the
	lasso pole into the back of the jeep.  Ludlow's voice
	continues over the radio in Dieter's jeep.

				LUDLOW (o.s.)
		Those are very expensive animals!
		Can you hear me?!

				DIETER
			(to the Driver)
		Turn that off!

	The Driver SNAPS off the radio as Dieter grabs a long-barreled
	rifle from the back of the vehicle.

	THE MOTORCYCLE

	guns it again, forcing the herd back into the middle of the 
	plain.  From the trees to the left, two heads on enormous
	necks rise up in alarm.  Two APATOSAURS are startled from the
	bush and lumber out across the middle of the plain.

	The herd doesn't even break stride, but keeps running,
	scampering after the giants and stampeding right between their
	massive legs.

	One smaller pachycephalosaur bolts loose, but the motorcycle
	cuts it off and herds it back into the middle, which now takes
	the motorcycle right through the rising and falling legs of
	the apotosaurs.

	The bike chases the pachy out the other side, and as the
	apatosaurs disappear into the distance, the cycle isolates the
	juvenile.

	Another truck, a "scissor rig," spots the isolated animal.
	High in the back of the truck, a HUNTER mans a tranquilizer
	cannon, drawing a bead on the pachy as the cycle runs it down.

	He FIRES and the tranquilizer dart hits the animal in the
	neck.  Its pace slows and another HUNTER from the truck tosses
	a lasso around its neck.

	They crank a winch, reeling in the animal.

	As the truck gain on it, two six-foot padded arms with what
	look like heavy airbags on the insides open up on the front of
	the truck.

	As the animal is pulled in, the scissors close with a
	hydraulic WHIR, trapping the animal between its airbags.

	Now a pick-up rig ROARS up and drops its back gate.  The
	scissor rig rolls forward, depositing the squirming pachy in
	this dino-contaiment vehicle.

	Two HUNTERS throw levers on the side of the scissor bars and
	the scissor rig backs away, leaving the animal, still pinched
	between the bars, imprisoned in the back of the pick-up rig.

	The Hunters quickly fit new scissor bars onto the scissor rig
	and it takes off, back into the hunt.

	BACK ON THE SNAGGER,

	Dieter, rifle in hand, drops down into the passenger seat,
	whips a harness over himself and CLICKS it into place.  He
	jabs his thumb into a flashing red button in the dashboard.

	Immediately, a motor underneath the seat HUMS to life and the
	seat itself telescopes, extending a good four feet out to

	Dieter raises the gun, picks a CARINTHOSAUR, a red-crested
	herbivore, from the rear of the fleeting herd, and takes aim.

	BANG!!

	The carinthosaur staggers as a tranquilizer dart sticks in
	its left hindquarter.

	UP ON THE RIDGE,

	there is utter quiet.  Nick and the others stare wordlessly at
	the spectacle below.

	DOWN ON THE PLAIN,

	the snagger SHUDDERS to a halt in the dirt, kicking up a huge
	cloud of dust and dirt.

	The motorcycle spins to a stop beside it, its DRIVER pushing
	his mask up to reveal his sweat and dirt-streaked face.

	The wrangler truck backs up and drops its rear door, which
	CLANGS heavily to the ground.

	FOUR WRANGLERS carrying wire noose poles and chains race down
	the ramp and out of the truck.

	Dieter jumps off the snagger.  He puts down his tranquilizer
	gun, picks up a long steel rod, and walks forward slowly.
	Ahead of him, the carinthosaur is still on its feet.

	The sedated animal staggers, fighting to retain its balance
	while it is surrounded by the wary Wranglers.

				DIETER
		Easy -- easy -- not too close!
		Full extension!

	The Wranglers adjust their poles, extending them another three
	feet, which allows them to stay further from the reeling, ten
	foot tall animal.

				DIETER (cont'd)
		Now!

	Almost as one, the Wranglers flip their noose over the
	stunned animal's neck.  It thrashes, but the Wranglers hold
	their poles tightly, surrounding and immobilizing it.

	UP ON THE RIDGE,

	Nick turns away.  He can't watch.

	DOWN ON THE PLAIN,

	a bolero-type device, a rope with a round weight at either
	end, whips around the carinthosaur's legs.  The animal THUDS
	to the dirt with a SNORT of a defeat.

	Ludlow steps up next to Dieter and both of them stare down at
	the helpless animal.  Ludlow's breathing heavily, eyes
	glowing.

	The animal is still thrashing, pumping its legs crazily.
	Dieter turns a knob on the side of the steel rod he's holding
	and thrusts it into the defenseless animal's neck.

	A blue arc of electricity CRACKS and dances over the
	carinthosaur's body.  The animal convulses in pain, a
	horrible, high-pitched SQUEALING rips the air.

	DR. BURKE, their paleontologist, hurries forward with a
	syringe.

	He draws a certain amount of tranquilizer from a bottle and
	injects it into the animal's thigh.

	CARTER, Dieter's Driver, steps up with a can of spray paint
	and quickly tags the animal with an ID number in day-glo
	orange.

	Dieter pulls the card with an icon of a carinthosaur from the
	dashboard of the jeep and marks a black X over the drawing of
	the animal.

				DIETER
		Next case.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. RIDGE - NIGHT

	Night has fallen over the island.  The hunters have
	established base camp in an area they have trampled and
	cleared just below the ridge.  Blue laser fences encircle the
	perimeter.  Inside, half a dozen tents are set up around a
	central campfire.

	The vehicles are all parked at one end, away from the tents.
	At the other end, there is a row of at least a dozen "capture
	containers," cages that hold the imprisoned dinosaurs they
	have already rounded up.

	SARAH, MALCOLM, and NICK stand at the edge of the ridge above,
	looking down at the scene.  Sarah stands a bit further back
	from the others, not wanting to get too close to the edge.
	VOICES waft up to them, raucous, LAUGHING, some even SINGING.

	DR. JUTTSON has a pair of night-vision binoculars trained on
	the cages.

				JUTTSON
		Carinthosaurus -- compsognathus --
		triceratops -- pachycephalosaurus --
		or small scavengers only.

	Malcolm, also with binoculars, furrows his brow, seeing
	something below.

	THROUGH MALCOLM'S BINOCULARS,

	he sees PETER LUDLOW, standing in the middle of the camp,
	pointing, giving orders.

	ON THE RIDGE,

	Malcolm drops the binoculars.

				MALCOLM
		Ludlow.  That's why Hammond was in
		such a hurry for me to get here.  He
		knew they were coming.

	He gives the binoculars to Sarah, who moves forward gingerly.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		You okay?

				SARAH
			(irritated)
		Heights, I can't help it.  Put your
		arm here, will you?

	She puts his arm around her waits, to steady her while she is
	close to the cliff edge.

				JUTTSON
		What do they want?

				MALCOLM
		They want their money back.  To
		InGen, this island is nothing more
		than a bed investment.

				JUTTSON
		We should get back to base camp.
		Eddie's waiting for us.

				MALCOLM
		I can't believe Peter Ludlow's
		running all this.

				SARAH
		He isn't.  Check out the guy walking
		past the fire.

	She hands the binoculars to Malcolm.

	THROUGH THE BINOCULARS,

	Malcolm sees ROLAND, who's walking with AJAY, weapons and
	equipment slung over their shoulders.

				SARAH (o.s.)
		I've seen him before.  In Brazil.  He
		and that guy with him were
		spearhunting jaguars.  Said it was
		immoral to go after them any other
		way.  He's not just a hunter, he's a
		philosopher.  Kind of guy who beats
		you up with your own argument.

	BACK ON THE RIDGE,

				SARAH (cont'd)
		He's the one in charge.

				MALCOLM
		Well, if that's true -- the man in
		charge just left camp.

	Nick, who has been quietly fuming next to them, now steps
	forward.

				NICK
		Then this is our chance.

				MALCOLM
		Our chance to do what?

				NICK
		I don't know these guys, but I know
		'em.  I've seen 'em on Japanese
		whalers, French barges trying to dump
		barrels of nuclear waste in the North
		Atlantic.  They're all the same.
		They spray us with water cannon when
		we try to stop 'em, sink our boats,
		and then call us crazy.

	He rummages through his pack, coming up with various tools.  A
	hunting knife.  A bolt cutter.

				NICK (cont'd)
		Nobody has to come with me.  I've
		done this before.

				SARAH
		Why, Nick.  You are a tree-hugger.

	He looks at her, hurt.

				NICK
		There' no reason for name calling.

				MALCOLM
		Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back
		to camp right away.  Leave the other
		car for us and we'll meet you there
		in an hour or so.

				KELLY
		What are you guys gonna do?

				MALCOLM
			(signs)
		Exactly what John Hammond wanted us
		to do.

							CUT TO:

	INT. TENT - HUNTER'S CAMP - NIGHT

	In the hunters' supply tent, a case of twelve-year-old scotch
	sits open amid crate after crate of weapons and ammunition.
	PETER LUDLOW reaches in and pulls a bottle out.

	EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

	In the jungle, LUDLOW approaches a small clearing.  ROLAND is
	bent over a small stake in the ground, chaining something to
	it.  As Ludlow approaches and walks around him, he sees what
	protest.  Roland looks up.

				ROLAND
		Offering a little incentive.

	Ludlow laughs and shakes his head.  He takes a drink and
	offers Roland one.  Roland accepts.  Ludlow notices Roland's
	gun leaning against a tree.

				LUDLOW
		What kind of gun is that?

				ROLAND
		My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made
		in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to
		him after he took down his last
		elephant.  8700 foot pound striking
		force.

				LUDLOW
		How close do you have to be?

				ROLAND
		Forty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume
		it'll take a slug in the brain case
		to bring him down.

				LUDLOW
		Why not just use a scope and a poison
		dart and snipe him from a hill?

	Roland just looks at him.

				ROLAND
		Or a laser beam from a satellite?

	Ludlow leans down, close to the baby rex, and examines it
	while it thrashes on its chain.  Its mouth has been bound shut
	with a leather strap.

				LUDLOW
		You rally think this'll draw the
		parent?

				ROLAND
		I once saw a bull elephant die
		charging a jeep.  All the jeep had
		done was startle the bull's calves.
		I saw a lioness carry wounded prey
		four and a half miles, all the way
		back to its den, just to teach its
		cubs how to finish off a kill.

				LUDLOW
		Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.

				ROLAND
		Rex won't be any different.  It'll
		come.

				LUDLOW
		You're kidding yourself.  An adult
		T-rex cares about one thing --
		filling its own belly.  It acts the
		way people wish they could, that's
		why everyone's fascinated by it.  If
		people had the chance to see one
		dinosaur and one only, ninety-nine
		percent would --

	He stops, an idea on his face.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Wait.  Why not?  Sedatives...
		growth inhibitors...

				ROLAND
		What?

				LUDLOW
		I hadn't planned on bringing
		carnivores back because of the
		liability risk, but I only thought of
		adults, it never occurred to me --
			(close to the animal)
		You are a billion dollar idea, my
		little f-

	CRACK!  The tyrannosaur, even with its jaws clamped shut,
	lunges at Ludlow's face, head-butting him right across the
	bridge of the nose.  Ludlow staggers back, WAITING in pain,
	clutching his bleeding face.

	Roland laughs.  Ludlow, like an enraged child, snatches up
	Roland's gun and brings the butt down viciously on the rex's
	leg.  The bone breaks with a dry SNAP and the animal HOWLS in
	pain.

	Roland lunges and throws Ludlow to the ground, but the damage
	is done.

				ROLAND
		What the hell you do that for?!

	As his pain eases, Ludlow feels a bit foolish, but he attempts
	to cover.

				LUDLOW
		Had to.  To keep him still for the
		trip.

				ROLAND
		You've broken its leg!

				LUDLOW
		We've got to transport it seven
		thousand miles.  Would you prefer it
		bit off the leg of a crew member?

	He gets up, brushes himself off, and heads back to the camp,
	trying to salvage his dignity.  Roland watches him go.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. EDGE OF HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT

	At the edge of the hunters' camp, NICK, SARAH, and MALCOLM
	scramble down a hillside and stop at the edge of the laser
	barriers.  There are three beams, each about two feet apart,
	the tallest almost six feet off the ground.

	Nick reaches the edge and crouches.  Sarah, helped by Malcolm,
	steps up onto his back and jumps over the top, landing with a
	CRUNCH.  Nick is next, given a boost by Malcolm, who is then
	left alone on the other side.

	He backs up a few steps, jogs right at the lasers, then
	springs off his good leg --

	-- and does the Fosburry Flop right over the top.  He lands
	with a THUD, to the silent admiration of the other two.

	FURTHER IN THE CAMP,

	the three of them creep along, hiding behind a stack of fuel
	barrels.  They lean around the edge for a look.  They're
	directly behind the row of vehicle.

	They move, into the open, covering the ground between them and
	the jeeps.  Reaching them, Nick hits the dirt and wriggles
	under the first one.  Malcolm and Sarah stand lookout.

	UNDER THE JEEP,

	Nick pulls the bolt cutter from his back pocket.  He squirms
	along until he finds the jeep's fuel line --

	-- and he snips it.  He ducks out of the way just as the
	stream of fuel begins to pour into the dirt.

	MALCOLM AND SARAH

	move slowly down the line, standing watch as Nick crawls out
	from under the first jeep and proceeds to the second.  They
	hear another SNIP, then keep moving, to cover him as he moves
	to the third.

	From in the distance, Malcolm hears a sound, a faint,
	high-pitched SCREECHING.  He turns and looks to that
	direction.

	EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT

	It's the baby T-rex, still SCREENING.  Up in a nearby tree,
	ROLAND and AJAY have spread some broken branches crosswise to
	form a high hide of their own about ten feet off the ground.

	They wait.

	Roland raises his binoculars.  The light of the camp spills
	all the way out here, illuminating some of the jungle.  He
	scans it, searching for any sign of movement.

	EXT. HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT

	Back in the camp, Sarah, Malcolm, and Nick have finished with
	all of the vehicles except the badly battered one, which is
	parked some distance away, undergoing repairs.  The motor pool
	area is now a soggy lake of spilled gasoline.

	The saboteurs walk casually across the camp, unnoticed in the
	drunken revelry.  They pass several tents, the shadows of the
	partiers visible as they move inside.

	They continue across the camp and arrive at the other side --

	-- to face the caged animals.  The carinthosaur that was
	tranquilized earlier stands there dully, eyes heavy and
	glassy, still under the effects.  They pass a stegosaur, its
	row of fine bristling.

	And finally they reach the largest cage, which houses a
	triceratops the size of a pickup truck, Nick pulls out his
	trusty bolt cutters.  He looks at them, a glint in his eye.

				NICK
		Hang on.  We may encounter some
		turbulence.

	INT. HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT

	In one of the hunter tents, PETER LUDLOW leans over the
	satellite recon pictures of the island, planning the next
	day's assault with DIETER and DR. BURKE, their paleontologist.
	There are small wooden dinosaur models scattered around the
	photos, indicating where certain species can be found.

				BURKE
		If you're really interested in
		infants, we'll have better luck at
		the seaside, because the sands offer
		a cushioning surface where the egg
		clutches can -- can --

	He trails off.  A low RUMBLING sound can be heard outside, and
	the little wooden dinosaurs start shaking on the board.

	They look at each other.  The RUMBLING gets louder.  Outside,
	someone SHOUTS; on the board, the little dinosaurs start
	hopping and bouncing from the vibrations, the SHOUTS outside
	turn to SCREAMS, they turn and look at the back of the tent --

	-- and the triceratops bursts right through the canvas!

	EXT. CAMP - NIGHT

	HUNTERS go flying as the tent-covered triceratops, its horns
	tearing through the canvas, RUMBLES across the camp.  Men
	SHOUT in alarm, the triceratops BELLOWS in anger and
	confusion, chaos reigns.

	In the crush of PEOPLE running every which way, MALCOLM and
	SARAH are swept off in one direction while NICK is buffeted
	in another.  They SHOUT, but cannot be heard over the frey.

	The triceratops, blinded by the canvas shroud, stomps right
	through the fire in the middle of the camp AND THE TENT BURSTS
	INTO FLAME.

	Now really upset, the animal panics and lashes out in all
	directions, blasting through tents, demolishing and/or setting
	ablaze anything that gets in its way.  Its considerable
	hindquarters SLAM into a parked jeep, sending it rolling
	across the camp.

	The jeep flattens the largest tent and SLAMS down on its side.
	Its broken gas line SPRAYS gas over the ground, the gas hits
	one of the dozens of small blazes the triceratops has left in
	its wake, and the flame shoots up the ribbon of gas.

	The jeep explodes.

	OUT IN THE JUNGLE CLEARING,

	Roland and Ajay, up in the tree, leap to their feet as a
	fireball rises up from the camp in the distance.

				ROLAND
		What in God's -- !

	BACK IN THE CAMP,

	the rest of the newly-freed animals now storm through the
	camp.  The blue laser barriers bounce crazily and go out as
	the sending units are trampled underfoot by the fleeing
	animals.

	AT THE RIDGE OF CAMP,

	Nick takes advantage of the downed lasers to slip part the
	bordere of the camp and disappear into the jungle in one
	direction, while Malcolm and Sarah vanish in the other.

	The burning tent, which was the equipment tent, now detonates
	in a series of smaller EXPLOSIONS.

	Dieter and several others are knocked to the ground by the
	series of concessive blasts.  He drags himself up onto all
	fours, charred and bruised.  A burning tire rolls slowly past
	him, spinning to a stop --

	-- at ROLAND's feet.  Dieter looks up at him.

				ROLAND
		Last time I leave you in charge.

	OUT IN THE JUNGLE,

	Nick breaks out into the jungle clearing, the same one where
	Ajay and Roland had their blind.  He sees the baby tyrannosaur
	chained to the stake.

				NICK
		Sick bastards.

	He goes to the animal, which now BLEATS in pain, its broken
	leg hanging at an odd angle.  With one strong tug, Nick pulls
	the stake out of the ground.

	BACK IN THE CAMP,

	Roland surveys the destruction.  The fire has spread and
	several tents are now tongues of flame flapping in the air,
	the animals are gone or going, and their personnel are
	scattered and terrified.  PETER LUDLOW, breathless, face
	smeared with dirt, and smoke, staggers up to Roland.

				LUDLOW
		What in Christ's name is going on?!

				ROLAND
		Isn't it obvious?

	He holds up the sniped padlock from one of the animal cages.

				NICK (cont'd)
		We're not alone on this island.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

	MALCOLM and SARAH race back up onto the ridge trail, where the
	green AAV is parked.  NICK bursts around from the other side
	of the car.

				SARAH
		Nick, thank God, we didn't know
		if --

	Malcolm opens the rear door.

				NICK
		Wait, don't ---

	With a piercing SHRIEK, the BABY TYRANNOSAUR, now in the back
	of the AAV, flings itself at the open doorway, jaws SNAPPING
	just short of Malcolm's nose.

				MALCOLM
		HOLY SHIT!!

	He SLAMS the door.

	DOWN IN THE HUNTERS' CAMP,

	Roland hears the commotion up on the ridge and looks up.

				ROLAND
		Do we have anyone up there?

	BACK UP ON THE RIDGE,

	Malcolm is confronting Nick.

				MALCOLM
		?!

 NICK 		It has a broken leg!

 MALCOLM 		So do it a favor and put it out of
		its misery!

 NICK 		No!  Get in the car before they hear 
		us!

	He runs around and leaps in the driver's seat.  Sarah slips
	into the passenger seat, quickly, leaving Malcolm no choice
	but the rear.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT 
	The AAV SLAPS through the jungle foliage.  From inside the
	car, we can hear the baby tyrannosaur SCREAMING in anger.

 INT. AAV - NIGHT 
	The baby writhes on the base seat next to Malcolm, who has
	flattened himself against the door, as far away from the
	animal as possible.

 SARAH 		Ian, close the window, it's going to
		wake every predator in the jungle!

	Malcolm leans over the enraged animal and cranks up its
	window.  The tyrannosaur SLASHES with one of its powerful hind
	legs, ripping the flesh of his forearm.  He SHOUTS in pain.

	Outside, the listening jungle whizzes by.

 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	Up in the high hide, EDDIE, DR. JUTTSON, and KELLY are
	standing watch, scanning the jungle for any sign of their
	returning comrades.

	Juttson yanks the night-vision binoculars away from his face
	as he spots the AAV, pulling up to the base camp a couple
	hundred yards away.

 JUTTSON 		There they are!

	They all turn and look, but Eddie furrows his brow, watching
	them pull the wounded animal from the back seat.

 EDDIE 		What is that they have with them?

 EXT. CAMP - NIGHT 
	SARAH and NICK carry the SCREECHING baby tyrannosaur in their
	arms, headed for the trailer.  MALCOLM, holding his bleeding
	arm, isn't far behind.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	SARAH and NICK bring the SCREAMING infant to the metal dining
	table and hold it down.  MALCOLM is right behind them.

 MALCOLM 		This is exceedingly unwise.

	Sarah turns away from a drawer of medical supplies, holding a
	small syringe.  Her shirt is streaked with blood from the
	baby's injured leg.

 SARAH 		Too late to worry about that!  Hold
		him together, Nick!

	Nick tightens his grip on the animal and Sarah makes an
	injection into its thigh, over its loudly voiced objections.

 MALCOLM 		Just do whatever you have to do and
		get it out of here as quickly as
		possible.

	Sarah picks up a small ultrasound transducer and runs it over
	the animal's leg.  A green and white skeletal image appears on
	a monitor next to the table.

 SARAH 		Okay, there's the metatarsals --
		tibia, fibula -- there it is!  See
		it?  That's a fracture, just above
		the epiphysis.

	They peer closely at the monitor.

 NICK 		That little black line?

 SARAH 		That little black line means death
		for this infant.  The fibula won't
		heal straight, so the ankle joint
		can't pivot when he stands on his
		hind feet.  The baby won't be able to
		run, and probably can't even walk.
		It'll be crippled, and a predator
		will pick it off before it gets more
		than a few weeks old.

 MALCOLM 		Can you set up?

 SARAH 			(thinking)
		It has to be temporary, something
		that'll break apart and fall off as
		the animal grows...

 MALCOLM 		Think fast, Sarah.

	The tyrannosaur, still in pain, SHRIEKS again.

 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	Through their binoculars, the rest of the group watches the
	trailer carefully.  Even inside, the animal's SCREECHES are
	clearly audible.  Kelly is getting scared.

 KELLY 		What are they doing?  Why don't
		they hurry?!

 EDDIE 		Give me the radio.

	From the trailer, the baby lets out a long, plaintive
 SHRIEK -- 
	One by one, Eddie, Kelly, and Juttson turn around and stare
	into the night jungle.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	NICK holds the animal while SARAH fits an aluminum foil cuff
	around its injured leg and paints it with a coating of resin.
	MALCOLM, at the window, stares out anxiously.  The animal
	thrashes again.

 NICK 		Give it more morphine!

 SARAH 		We'll kill it with too much, we'll
		put it into respiratory arrest!  I'm
		almost done.  Damn it, I need
		another adhesive, something pliable I
		can --

	Her eyes fall on Nick.  She holds out her hand, urgently.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		Spit!

	He spits his bubblegum into the palm of her hand.  The baby
	rex CRIES OUT again.

 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	From the swaying jungle, there is another answering ROAR.

	And this one's closer.

	In the high hide, the rest of the group stares, trembling.  In
	the distance, a flock of birds SHRIEKS and takes flight as the
	tops of some trees move, a whole section of forest suddenly
	coming alive, as if brushed by wind.

	But it's not the wind.

	They hear noises, THUDS in the jungle.  And then another
	section of forest trembles.  Closer.  Another flock of birds
	bursts out of the treetops and swarms past the high hide.

 KELLY 		What is it?

	Dr. Juttson puts an arm around Kelly, instinctively pulling
	her closer to him.  Eddie WHISPERS urgently into the
	walkie-talkie.

 EDDIE 		Sarah, come in!

 JUTTSON 		It's moving.  Fast.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	There is a radio box mounted on the far wall of the trailer.
	The speaker BUZZES urgently with Eddie's VOICE.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
		Sarah, Malcolm, can you hear me?!

	On the table, Sarah is frantically molding Nick's bubblegum
	into place on the makeshift splint.  But the baby rex,
	regaining its strength, is thrashing again.

 SARAH 		Hold it down, Nick!

 NICK 		I'm trying!

				EDDIE (o.s.)
			(from the radio)
		Is anybody there?!

	Malcolm moves to answer the radio, but Sarah SHOUTS to him.

 SARAH 		Ian, get the bottle of amoxicillin
		and fill a syringe!  Quick injection
		of antibiotics and I can get it out
		of here!

	Forsaking the radio, Malcolm moves to the medicine drawer and
	comes up with what she wants.  Working fast, he draws twenty
	cc's of the pink liquid.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
			(still from the radio, now
			 desperate)
 SARAH OR IAN, ANSWER ME! 
	They ignore him as Sarah grabs the syringe and makes the
	injection.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
 WHATEVER YOU BROUGHT INTO THE TRAILER, GET IT OUT NOW! 
 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	Eddie has given up on whispering as he clutches the radio
	desperately.

 EDDIE WE ESTIMATE TWO LARGE ADULTS HEADED IN YOUR DIRECTION! I REPEAT -- 
 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	Nick, Sarah, and Malcolm spin around at hearing that terrible
	piece of information.

 MALCOLM 		Oh, Christ.

	He bolts over to the wall speaker and hits the button.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		Let me talk to Kelly, is she--

	A deafening ROAR sound from just outside the trailer,
	followed immediately by a CRASHING sound.  They whirl and look
	to the window, just in time to see --

	--  the AAV tumbling by, rolling on its side!

	There is another ROAR, and the baby, on the table, ROARS in
	response.  Outside the window, the head of a full-grown
	TYRANNOSAURUS REX lowers and peers inside.

	Malcolm, Sarah, and Nick all freeze in absolute terror.

	The rex outside GURGLES, making material cooing noises.  The
	baby rex, calm for the first time, GURGLES back.

	But across the trailer, in the opposite window, ANOTHER T-REX
 HEAD SUDDENLY APPEARS. 
	This one ROARS, deeply, a roar so low and loud it rattles
	anything in the trailer that isn't tied down.

 NICK 		What do they want?!

 MALCOLM 		What do you think they want?!

 SARAH 		That's impossible, they can't have
		the sensory equipment to track it all
		the way here!

 MALCOLM 		Current evidence seems to be to the
		contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT
 TO THEM! 
	Nick, hands shaking, grabs the shoulder video camera he used
	earlier.  He whips out the cassette that's in there, hurls it
	into an open duffel bag with half a dozen others, SLAMS a
	fresh cassette in, and flicks the "ON" switch.

	Sarah and Malcolm, meanwhile, hurry to the other end of the
	trailer, carrying the baby rex.  Outside, the two adult rexes
	stay with them, walking in the same direction, watching them
	through the window.

 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	Seen from outside, the light inside the trailers clearly
	illuminates Sarah and Malcolm as they carry the bay rex.  The
	adult rexes tower over the trailer, twice as tall and nearly
	as long.  They walk slowly alongside it, hunched over,
	watching their infant.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	At the door to the trailer, Sarah un-muzzles the frantic baby.

 SARAH 		Ready?

	Malcolm reaches for the door handle.

 NICK 		Wait!

	He dives down on the floor under them, pointing the video
	camera up at the door, getting the best shot.  Malcolm takes a
	breath, turns the knob, and throws open the door.

	Outside, the enormous rex heads pause for a moment, staring,
	surprised.

	Although terrified, Sarah actually starts to sing.

 SARAH 			(softly)
		Born free, as free as the wind blows.
		As free as the grass grows --

 MALCOLM 		Are you insane?!

 SARAH 		I swear to God, it works with lions
		sometimes!  There we are -- your baby
		is free --

	The baby, excited, wriggles free of them and lands on the
	ground outside.  Not wasting a second, Malcolm SLAMS the door
	shut.

	The three of them freeze, not daring to breath.  Outside, they
	can hear the SNUFFLING and COOING of the animals as they
	inspect their young --

	-- and then the soft THUD of their footsteps, growing fainter
	as they move away.

	From the wall, EDDIE'S VOICE comes over the radio, relieved.

 EDDIE 		They're going back into the jungle.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	EDDIE, JUTTSON, and KELLY sag back against the railings of the
	high hide.

 EDDIE 		Thank God.  Thank God.

	MALCOLM'S VOICE comes over the radio.

				MALCOLM (o.s.)
		Kelly?  Are you all right?

	She takes the radio, her voice shaky.

 KELLY 		Uh huh.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	MALCOLM is at the radio.

 MALCOLM 		Wait there.  I'll come up in a
		minute.  Don't move, understand?

				KELLY (o.s.)
		I understand.

	Malcolm slump against the wall of the trailer.  SARAH and
	NICK sit on the floor leaning against the opposite wall,
	completely drained.  Sarah pulls out her pocket recorder and
	speaks shakily into it.

 SARAH 		Note to Dr. Juttson -- Tyrannosaurus
		rex does nurture its young.

	They laugh weakly.

 NICK 		There's, uh -- there's an unwritten
		rule when a news crew is in a war
		zone.  You stop the van every two
		miles and decide whether or not to go
		on.  Whether or not you feel lucky.
		One "no" from anybody in the group
		and you turn around right there, no
		question asked, nobody embarrassed.
			(pause)
		Well?  Do we go on?
	Immediately:

 SARAH 		No.

 MALCOLM 		No.

 NICK 		No way.

	They all laugh.

 MALCOLM 		All right.  I'm satisfied with the
		evidence we have right now.
		I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will
		too.
			(to Sarah)
		Do you have enough to publish?

 SARAH 		They will come after me.  But I can
		collect some stool samples, for DNA
		with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest
		of you to back me up, it should stand
		when we get back.

 MALCOLM 			(getting up)
		Then the only thing left to do is
		make sure we do get back.  I'll
		call the mainland on the satellite
		phone and have them send the boat
		right now.  This expedition is over.

	He goes to the desk and picks up the heavy gray satellite
	phone that's resting in a battery pack.  The front panel
	lights up, a brilliant green.

	But from the wall speaker, the radio CRACKLES and EDDIE'S
	VOICE breaks through, soft and empty.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
		Oh, God.  I am so sorry.

	Malcolm and Sarah look at the speaker box.

 MALCOLM 		What the hell is he sorry f-

	A low RATTLE sneaks into the trailer.  Malcolm, Sarah, and
	Nick takes a step forward from the walls, looking around.  The
	RATTLE gets louder, the trailer shakes and vibrates,
	everything in it starts to BANG against the walls --

	-- and something huge SMASHES into the side of the trailer.

	They're all thrown against the far wall, there is an
	earsplitting CRACK of electricity, the entire trailer rocks
	and sparks a brilliant blue, and then everything goes black.

	The satellite phone flies out of Malcolm's hands and SMACKS
	against the wall.  It lands on the floor, its number pad still
	glowing green.

	Nick crawls over and looks out one of the windows.  Outside,
	the flank of one of the tyrannosaurs wipes past the window,
	revealing the second tyrannosaur, charging straight at the
	trailer!

 NICK HANG ON TO SOMETHING! 
	They hurl themselves at the nearest solid object and hang on
	for dear life.  The charging rex SLAM into the side of the
	trailer, which rocks up on one side, BANGS back  down, and is
	quickly RAMMED again by the furious animal.  This time the
	entire trailer rolls over, completely upside down.

	Sarah, Nick, and Malcolm let go of their precarious handholds
	and drop onto the ceiling.  The tables, chairs, lab equipment,
	everything that's bolted down clings to the floor above them;
	everything that isn't RAINS DOWN ON THEM.

	But the rexes aren't done.  The trailer JOLTS INTO MOTION,
	sliding forwards.

 SEEN FROM OUTSIDE, 
	the upside down trailer, which is the rear of the two
	trailers, slides along the muddy ground, pushing up earth in
	front of it.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
 SARAH 		They're pushing us!

	Malcolm, frantic, crawls up to a window to get a look outside.
	He looks down and sees a T-rex footprint in the earth outside
	as they move past it.

	He cranks his head to get a look at the direction in which
	they are being pushed.  His eyes widen at something he sees
	outside the window.

 MALCOLM 		Oh, God.

 SARAH 		What?!

 MALCOLM 		They're pushing us over the cliff.

	Sure enough, out the back window, we see a few more feet of
	muddy earth, and then nothing but inky black.  The three of
	them look at each other for a moment --

	-- and then crawl like hell toward the other end of the
	trailer.  The opposite end reaches the edge of the cliff and
	starts up to tip ever-so-slightly downward.  They reach the
	accordion-like connector and Malcolm crawls into it.

 THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD OF THE FRONT TRAILER, 
	which is right-side-up, Malcolm can see the two rexes hard at
	it, pushing the front end of the trailer.

 IN THE REAR TRAILER, 
	Nick has a pretty good grip at the top of the trailer, but
	Sarah can only cling to an air vent in the ceiling as stuff
	starts to roll and tumble past her, headed downhill.

	The angle increases, the trailer dips, and now stuff starts to
	freefall, right past her, some SMASHING her in the head.

	Malcolm, still in the connecting tube, grabs hold.  Sarah,
	starting to be pulled downward, paws at the refrigerator,
	getting a g rip on the handle.  The door, held by a safety
	latch, doesn't open.

	Below Sarah, debris falls to the rear window of the trailer.
	Through the CRACKING glass, we can see the surf, CRASHING five
	hundred feet below.

	The refrigerator bolts suddenly CRUNCH free of the wall.  The
	box strains on its power cord.

	Still clinging to the handle, Sarah swings wildly as it starts
	to come loose, swaying above her.

	The safety latch on the door gives, it swings open, and a
	shower of food BANGS off of her as gravity empties the
	contents.

	Sarah loses her grip and plummets through the now-vertical
	trailer.  She SCREAMS, covers her head, and SMASHES into the
	rear window.  The glass spiderwebs, but does not break.

 FIVE HUNDRED FEET BELOW, 
	an enormous wave POUNDS the rocky shore.  Above, Sarah is a
	tiny figure, sprawled out on the glass, held invisibly by the
	breaking window.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
	Nick SHOUTS to her.

 NICK SARAH! DON'T MOVE! 
	Sarah, stunned by the fall, blinks a few times, regaining her
	senses.  She looks down, at the crashing surf so far below.
	For a person with a fear of heights, this is a real drag.  As
	she stares, the rocks seem to move even farther away from her.
	She blanches; the world spins around her.

 SARAH 		OH... GOD ... please...

	Her breath fogs the cracked glass.  Slowly, she tries to get
	up, caaaaaarefully pulling herself up to her hands and knees.

	But as she puts pressures on her hands, the glass CRACKS even
	more, tiny spiderwebs shooting out around her fingers.  The
	whole glass panel sags, bowing out around the bottom of the
	trailer.

 UP ABOVE HER, 
	Malcolm looks down and sees the satellite phone precariously
	balanced on one leg of the kitchen table, its number pad still
	glowing green.  Nick is closest to it.

 MALCOLM 		Nick!  Grab the phone!

 SARAH 
	looks to her right, at a metal grating that runs along the
	wall of the trailer.  She shifts her weight, leaning on one
	hand to reach for the grating with the other.

 NICK 
	reaches for the satellite phone, its antenna just six inches
	from his outstretched fingers.

 SARAH 
	leans toward the metal grating, all hairline cracks shoot out
	around her pivot hand, shaking through the glass.  The
	splintered glass spread like a disease, it reaches the edge
	of the frame --

	-- and her hand CRACKS right through the glass.  She GASPS and
	pulls her hand out, but now she knees SMASH through the
	glass.

 NICK 
	has two fingers on the phone, but suddenly the whole trailer
	shudders and the heavy phone tips off the table leg and falls.

 NICK SARAH LOOK OUT! 
 SARAH 
	lunges for the metal grating and clings to it just as the
	heavy phone whizzes past her head and SMASHES into the glass,
	opening up a huge hole in the center of the back window.

 UNDERNEATH THE TRAILER, 
	glass, food, lab equipment, and the precious satellite phone
	fall out the broken window and SMASH on the rocks far below.

 IN THE CLEANING, 
	the trailers are split, like an L, the rear trailer hanging
	straight down, the forward one resting on the edge of the
	cliff.  Satisfied with their work, the T-rexes turn and lumber
	back into the jungle.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
	Sarah climbs carefully up the metal grating.  Above her, Nick
	lowers himself as far as he can, reaching for her.

 ON THE CLIFFSIDE, 
	we realize the hanging trailer halted its descent because one
	corner of it is wedged in the branches of a tree that grows
	out from the muddy cliff.

	But now those branches SPLINTER.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
	Malcolm sees the bellows, the connector between the trailers,
	stretch as the lower trailer JERKS and dips lower.

 BELOW HIM, 
	Sarah mountain-climbs through the trailer's kitchen,
	inadvertently kicking the faucet on as she struggles for
	purchase.

 OUTSIDE, 
	the tree branch SNAPS and the trailer jerks, stretching down
	again.  The bellows expands to its full length, stretching
	like a Slinky.

 INSIDE, 
	Nick knows he has to hurry.  He climbs down, bouncing off the
	built-in furniture, moving ever closer to Sarah.

	But Sarah slips and loses her grip, dropping a few feet.  She
	gabs hold of the sink, the flowing water spraying her face.

 EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT 
	EDDIE CARR is in the driver's seat of the jeep, racing through
	the jungle as fast as he can.

 EDDIE 		Hang on -- hang on --

	The foliage SMACKS the windshield, then clears suddenly,
	revealing the endangered trailers on the cliffside ahead of
	him.  The jeep bounces through the deep footprints left by the
	rex and SKIDS to a halt.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	Sarah loses her grip on the sink and falls, SMASHING into the
	frame of the half-broken rear window again.

 OUTSIDE, 
	Eddie bolts out of the car and runs to the front trailer.  He
	SHOUTS in through the broken front window.

 EDDIE HEY! HELLO?! 
 IN THE REAR TRAILER, 
	The three look up from their precarious positions.

 MALCOLM WE'RE IN HERE! GET SOME ROPE! 
 OUTSIDE, 
	Eddie turns and run back to the jeep.  He grabs a coil of
	rope, secures one end around a tree, and hurries back to the
	trailer.

 IN THE REAR TRAILER, 
	Eddie dashes over the mess in the front trailer and crawls out
	into the extended connector.  He peers over the edge, down
	into the second trailer, and tosses the rope.

 EDDIE 		Catch!

	The rope falls through the center of the trailer, its end
	dangling all the way out the smashed rear window.  But the
	trailer SHUDDERS, starting to move again.

 SARAH 		We're sliding!

 EDDIE 		Climbs up if you can!

 OUTSIDE, 
	Eddie runs out of the trailer in time to see the wheels
	dragging forward through the mud as the weight of the dangling
	trailer pulls the whole thing toward the edge of the cliff.

	He runs for the jeep and grabs hold of the power winch on the
	front grill.

	Behind him, the trailer rolls closer to the edge of the cliff.

	Eddie races back to the trailer, pulling out a length of cable
	behind him.  He runs up to the still-moving trailer, dives for
	its towing hook, the cable goes taut --

	-- and he falls short.  Just by six inches, but he's out of
	cable.

 EDDIE 		Damn it!

 INSIDE THE TRAILER, 
	Nick and Sarah are now together, clinging to the rope near the
	bottom of the trailer as it shifts around them.  Malcolm is
	further up, also clinging to the rope.

 OUTSIDE, 
	dirt and rocks pile up around the wheels and spill over the
	edge of the cliff.

	Eddie, back at the jeep, reels out more winch cable.  He turns
	and races back to the trailer just as gravity starts to LIFT
 THE FRONT END OFF THE GROUND! 
	Eddie dives again, and this time the cable hook CLICKS
	securely into the trailer's towing hook.  The trailer lurches
	toward the edge of the cliff and stops.

	But the jeep is jerked forward by the sudden pressure.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
	Malcolm clings to the rope in the middle of the trailer while
	Nick and Sarah try to struggle up it, but a sudden dig knocks
	them back, and their hands slide down the line.  SCREAMING,
	they slide through the trailer and their feet SMASH through
	the remains of the rear window.

	Regaining hold of the rope at the very end, the two of them
	now find themselves hanging out of the rear end of the trailer,
	dangling over the rocky shore below.

 IN THE JEEP, 
	Eddie hits the gas and the tires slosh in the mud, trying to
	get a grip.  The jeep pulls just enough to lower the front
	trailer back to earth.  But the tires spin, fighting to hold
	it there.

 ON THE CLIFFSIDE 
	Sarah and Nick dangle, desperate.

 IN THE JEEP 
	Eddie CHUNKS the shifter into four wheel drive and GUNS the
	engine.  As the motor ROARS, the sound is topped by another
	ROAR, in the distance.

	And this one's not a machine.  But Eddie doesn't hear it.  He
	GUNS the engine again.  There is another ROAR from the jungle.

	Eddie hears this one.  He darts a look at the side view
	mirror.  In it, he sees one of the TYRANNOSAURS bolt out of
	the jungle behind him.

	He GASPS and looks at the other side view.  In it, he sees the
	OTHER REX racing toward him.

	The tyrannosaurs STOMP forward to confront the ROARING jeep.
	The first rex bends over, CHOMPS down on the rear tire, and
	lifts the car to its teeth.

	But the spinning tire LINGS in the rex's mouth, burning it.
	Surprised by the fight in this foe, the rex loses its grip and
	the jeep BANGS back down onto the ground.

	Eddie, horrified, dives down under the steering wheel, to get
	away.  The gas pedal pops up --

	-- which makes the trailer pitch over the side of the cliff.

	But the rex STOMPS down on the jeep to prevent its escape.
	The trailers stop.

	Now the rexes lean down, over the jeep, and focus on Eddie,
	who still covers under the steering wheel.  The first rex
	SNAPS at him, hitting the steering column with it, leaving Eddie fully
	exposed.

	He SCREAMS and the second rex lashes in, seizing him in its
	teeth and tossing him out of the car.

	Eddie pops up into the air between the two rexes, both their
	heads flash at him at the same time, and in a split-second, he
	disappears between their teeth.

	Now completely ignored, the jeep rolls freely forward and the
	trailers drop over the edge of the cliff.

 INSIDE THE TRAILER, 
	Nick, Sarah and Malcolm cling to each other and the rope as
	the trailers fall around them.  The windows flash by as the
	trailers plummet, equipment BANGS and SCRAPES them, but they
	hold on to the rope, still tied to the tree, for dear life.

 ON THE CLIFFSIDE, 
	the trailers slide the rest of the way, exposing the three,
	who pop out the space where the front windshield was.
	Dangling from the rope, they look up and see the jeep, which
	is now rolling to the edge of the cliff.

	It falls, past them, and the whole mess EXPLODES on the rocks
	below.  Finally, it is silent, except for the sound of the
	surf.

 EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT 
	It's quiet up here too, the rexes nowhere to be seen.  At the
	cliff, a hand appears from over the edge.  Then another.
	SARAH pulls herself up, back onto solid ground, then comes
	NICK, then both of them reach over and help MALCOLM up over
	the edge.

	They collapse there, in the mud, completely exhausted.

 MALCOLM 			(softly)
		Eddie?

	He looks at the other two.  They glance around, then drop
	their heads.  Sarah hears a SOUND in the distance.

 SARAH 		Oh, God.  Now what?

	From the edge of the jungle, a cris-cross of flashlight beams
	moves toward them.  But rather than the three or four that
	would signify their own group, there are nearly twenty of
	them.

	The HUNTERS, PETER LUDLOW is in the lead, ROLAND and AJAY
	with him.  DIETER is there too, shepherding KELLY and DR.
	JUTTSON along in front of him.

	Malcolm sees Kelly, they call out to each other, and race
	together.  Malcolm falls to his knees and hugs her as tightly
	as he possibly can.

 MALCOLM 		Are you all right?!  Anything broken?

 KELLY 		I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I
		thought you, are you okay?!

 MALCOLM 		I'm fine... I'm fine...

	Roland looks around, at the mess that was their base camp.

 ROLAND 			(mostly to himself)
		That's what you think.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. RUINED BASE CAMP - NIGHT 
	In the ruins of the first team's base camp, the survivors of
	the night's two separate catastrophes stand face to face, in a
	heated argument.

	MALCOLM sits off to the side, still holding Kelly in his arms,
	just looking down at the ground and shaking his head.  There's
	something about his posture of defeat that is far more ominous
	than any of the hot tempers that are flaring.  LUDLOW rants to
	SARAH while DIETER looms menacingly over NICK.

 LUDLOW 		Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go
		to jail just for being here, did
		you know that?

 SARAH 		Don't start a legal argument with me,
		this island isn't your property, and
		neither are these animals!

	DR. JUTTSON has encountered DR. BURKE.

 JUTTSON 		What are you doing here, Burke?
		There's no TV cameras, what's the
		point?

 BURKE 		Dr. Juttson, you exist outside the
		classroom.  I am amazed.

	Dieter continues to get in Nick's face.

 NICK 		Are you looking for a problem?

 JUTTSON 			(an urgent whisper)
		Everyone, keep your voices down!

 ROLAND 		Back off, Dieter.

 JUTTSON 		Listen to me, by moving the baby
		rex into our camp, we changed the
		adults' perceived territory!

 LUDLOW 		Their what?

 SARAH 			(she understands)
		Oh, God.

 JUTTSON 		That's why they persisted in
		destroying the trailers, they now
		feel they have to defend this entire
		area!  We're not safe here.

 LUDLOW 			(of Sarah and Nick)
		Thanks to you people.

 SARAH 		Hey, we came here to observe, you
		came here to strip-mine the place!
		It's a looter mentality, all you care
		about is what you can take.

 ROLAND 		None of that matters.  Our
		communications equipment's been
		destroyed.  If your radio and
		satellite phone were in those
		trailers that went off the cliff, and
		I'm guessing by the look on his
		face --

	He points at Malcolm, who is still off to the side, sitting in
	stunned silence.  Malcolm looks up and nods, slowly.  The
	grimness of their situation sinks in.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		We are stuck here, ladies and
		gentlemen.  And we're stuck together.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT 
	Back in the hunters' now-demolished camp, members of the two
	groups combine their diminished supplies.  They have half a
	dozen large plastic containers of water, thirty-seven
	containers of food, ranging from Ziploc bags to aluminum tins,
	a variety of weapons, mot of them borne on the hips or
	shoulders of the HUNTER team, the charred and scraggly
	remnants of several pieces of now-useless electrical
	equipment, a flare gun and several flares, somebody's tattered
	paperback ("Crime and Punishment"), a box of Hershey bars, and
	a cartoon of Marlboros.

	ROLAND supervises the assembling of the resources, which are
	displayed in front of him.  LUDLOW, NICK, SARAH, JUTTSON, and
	MALCOLM, who is still holding KELLY close to him, are with
	him.  They hold their discussion in quiet tones.

 ROLAND 		If we can't stay in the rex's
		territory, we have to move tonight.

 SARAH 		Move where?  Our boat's not coming
		for two days, your airlift is waiting
		for an order you have no way to
		send --

	Ludlow refers to the charred and trampled satellite
	photographs of the island, which are still mostly legible.

 LUDLOW 		There's a communication center, here,
		in the old worker village.  Hammond
		put in some kind of renewable power
		source replenishing.  It may still
		work.  If we could get there, we
		could send a radio call for the
		airlift.

 NICK 		How far is the village?

 LUDLOW 		I said if we could get there.

 NICK 		Well, how far is it?

 LUDLOW 		A day's walk, maybe more.  That's not
		the problem.

 ROLAND 		What is?

 LUDLOW 		The velociraptors.

	Malcolm looks up sharply.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Our infrareds show their nesting
		sites are concentrated in the island
		interior.  That's why we planned on
		keeping to the outer rim.

	Malcolm shepherds Kelly away from the conversation and mutters
	something to her quietly in the background.

 DIETER 		What are velociraptors?

 JUTTSON 		Carnivores.  Pack hunters.  About six
		feet long, three or four hundred
		pounds, and very, very fast.

	Dieter brandishes his weapon.

 DIETER 		I think we can handle ourselves
		against them.

	Malcolm rejoins the conversation, alone.  He keeps his voice
	low.

 MALCOLM 		No.  I'm quite certain you can't.

 ROLAND 		Look, we have two choices.  We can
		hike back down to the lagoon, where
		we can sit for two days, in the open,
		next to a heavily used water source
		while we're waiting for your boat to
		arrive, or we can head for the
		village, where we might find some
		shelter and we can call for help.

 MALCOLM 		We'd never make it past the raptors.
		Trust me, I have some experience in
		this matter.

	Roland looks at him.

 ROLAND 		That may be.  But you weren't with
		me at the time.

	Malcolm just shakes his head, then turns and walks back to
	Kelly.  Roland turns to the others.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		Load up.  Let's get this moveable
		feast underway.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. ISLAND - NIGHT 
	The SURVIVORS set forth, marching through the jungle in a
	column.  Two HUNTERS strap on small shoulder-mounted
	servo-flashlights.  Wires run from the lights end in
	sensor pads which they stick to the skin of their necks.  Thus
	attached, when the hunters turn their heads, the servo-lights
	turn with them, illuminating whatever direction they look in.

	MALCOLM screws the barrel into the Lindstradt rifle and slings
	it over his shoulder as he marches, limping heavily.  He looks
	down at KELLY, who is marching alongside him.  His face shows
	the deepest of regret.  He shakes his head, cursing himself.

 MALCOLM 		Damn it.

	He looks away as Kelly looks up at him, questioning.  ROLAND
	falls into step with Malcolm and notices his limp.

 ROLAND 		You all right?

	Malcolm looks at him, then looks away without answering.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		Wrong question?

 MALCOLM 		You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?

 ROLAND 		What's that?

 MALCOLM 		A statistical phenomenon.  Says
		everything in the world goes in
		streaks.  It's real, you see it
		everywhere -- in weather, in river
		flooding, in baseball, in blackjack,
		in stock markets.  Once things go
		bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad
		things cluster.  They go to hell
		together.

 ROLAND 		Feeling a bit blue, are we?

	Malcolm glances at Kelly, who has taken a slightly faster pace
	and is a few steps ahead of them now.

 MALCOLM 		Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.

 ROLAND 		Why did you come here?

 MALCOLM 		So that others would know about this
		place?

 ROLAND 		Why should they?

 MALCOLM 		Because it exists.

 ROLAND 		It'll still exit if they go on not
		knowing, won't it?

 MALCOLM 		Yes.  And people will live in the
		absence of truth.

 ROLAND 		So the truth is more important to you
		than your life?

 MALCOLM 			(lowers is voice)
		I don't care about my life.  But if
		I'd ever thought for a second that
		she would be in danger --

	Roland follows his gaze forward, to Kelly, who's about ten
	yards ahead now.

 ROLAND 		She yours?

 AHEAD OF THEM, 
	Kelly can hear their voices, faint, but clear.  They are not
	as far away as they think they are.

				MALCOLM (o.s.)
		I'm afraid so.  I don't know what the
		hell I'm doing with kids.  I never
		should have had her.

	Kelly's face shows she heard that part.

 BEHIND HER, 
	Malcolm, unaware, continues with Roland.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		Why are you here?

 ROLAND 		Somewhere on this island, there
		exits the greatest predator that
		ever lived.  And the second greatest
		predator must take him down.

 MALCOLM 		But why?

 ROLAND 		You remember that guy, about twenty
		years ago, I forget his name, but he
		climbed Everest without any oxygen,
		came down almost dead.  And they
		asked him, "why did you go up there
		to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I
		went up there to live."

 MALCOLM 			(nods)
		It's called self-testing.  But in
		your case, it sounds more like
		self-destruction.  A uniquely human
		characteristic.  In fact, human
		beings destroy things so well that I
		sometimes think that's our function.
		Maybe every few sons, some animal
		comes along that kills off the rest
		of the world, clears the decks, and
		lets evolution proceed to his next
		phase.  Maybe death and destruction
		are our job, maybe we're supposed
		to destroy ourselves and every other
		living thing that-

	Every person on the trail within earshot has stopped and is
	staring at Malcolm, shaken by his words.  Roland grabs Malcolm
	by the shirt collar and pulls him close, GROWLING in his ear.

 ROLAND 		Tell you what.  You can see whatever
		you want to, to me, but you will not
		spew any more nihilist rants at
		anyone else in the group.  I'm
		fighting panic, and you push the
		wrong buttons.  Understand?

	Malcolm just blinks.  This guy's in charge.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. JUNGLE - DAWN 
	As a purple dawn dissolves the night sky, the SURVIVORS
	stagger on, exhausted.  Some are starting to tire, and there
	are spaces in the column.  MALCOLM's limp seems to be getting
	worse.  NICK reaches out, to take Malcolm's pack, but Malcolm
	swats his hand away.

	KELLY, still ahead of him, falls into step with SARAH.

 KELLY 		I don't think -- my dad doesn't
		think we're going to make it.

	Sarah looks at her.

 SARAH 		Your dad is wrong.  About a lot more
		than he knows.

	She puts an arm around her.  Kelly looks up at her, grateful.
	The long march continues.

 UP AT THE FRONT, 
	NICK catches up to ROLAND.

 NICK 		I think you should call a break.

 ROLAND 		Another half hour.

 NICK 		Some of them won't make another half
		hour.  We didn't come this far to
		start dropping in the middle of the
		jungle.  If you don't call it, I
		will.

	Roland looks at him, steely, then SHOUTS to the group.

 ROLAND FIVE MINUTES BREAK! 
	Immediately, the marchers drop where they stood, absolutely
	drained.

 AT THE REAR OF THE GROUP, 
	DRS. BURKE and JUTTSON are bickering.

 JUTTSON 		I can't believe you're still angry
		about that.

 BURKE 		You know, it's very easy to criticize
		the first person who studies
		something.

 JUTTSON 		No, it's easy to criticize sloppy
		research and hasty conclusions.

 NEARBY, 
	MALCOLM checks Nick's bag of videotapes, making sure they're
	still dry and undamaged.  Sarah comes up, watching him.

 SARAH 		You know, even if we do get those
		tapes back, people are going to say
		it's just another hoax.  Ian
		Malcolm's alien autopsy.

 MALCOLM 		Maybe.  Maybe not.

 SARAH 		Ian, they will misplace our evidence,
		shoot holes in our testimony, and say
		some special effects genius created
		the animals.  The only way people
		will ever believe that dinosaurs
		exist is if you dump a T-rex in the
		middle of times Square.

	He doesn't look at her.  She sits down beside her.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		There's something more important that
		you should be thinking about instead.

 BEHIND THEM, 
	Dr. Burke, furious, has stalked away from Juttson and sits
	down on a rock.  H does a double take, noticing something
	behind the rock.  He leans over and picks it up.

	It's an oval shape about eight inches long, with a pebbled
	exterior.  A dinosaur egg.

	Burke's face lights up, fascinated, and he carefully pieces
	the egg in a satchel he wears over one shoulder.

 AT THE REAR OF THE GROUP, 
	DIETER STARK pulls a wad of toilet paper from his pack, drops
	the pack on the ground, and turns to the Hunter nearest him --
	CARTER, his driver, who has his back turned.

 DIETER 		Wait here for me, would ya Carter?

	He steps off the path, into the jungle.  But as we come around
	the front of Carter, we see he's wearing a Walkman, the
	headphone BLARING tinnily in his ears.

	And he didn't hear a word.

 EXT. THICK OF THE JUNGLE - DAY 
	Only a few feet off the path, it's primary forest, the growth
	so thick that almost all sunlight is obscured.  DIETER claws
	forward until he finds a suitable spot to relieve himself.

	He clears away a bunch of leaves and debris and raises his
	hand to his belt buckle.  He freezes, hearing something we
	didn't.  He glances around, head darting, alert to any danger.

	Nothing there.  Just a few distant ANIMAL CALLS--

	-- and s SCURRYING around to his left.

	Dieter snaps his head in that direction.  At first, he sees
	nothing, but as he moves closer, gun extended in front of him,
	he sees a small dinosaur, a COMPSOGRATHUS, the same
	chicken-sized animal Cathy saw on the beach so long ago.

 DIETER 		It's not polite to --

	He pulls the steel rod out of a loop in his belt and touches
	it to the compy's back.  The blue bolt of electricity CRACKS
	and dances over the compy's body and it convulses in pain.

				DIETER (cont'd)
		-- sneak up on people.

	The wounded compsognathus scurries back into the jungle,
	whimpering.  Dieter clambers through the foliage ten or twelve
	paces, pushes aside two large palm fronds, and steps out
	into --

	-- more jungle.  He stops, puzzled, not sure if he went back
	or forward.

	He looks behind him.  He pauses, recalculating the path he
	took coming into the jungle, MUTTERING to himself, gesturing
	with his hands, retracing his steps.

	He adjusts his angle slightly to the right and heads off in
	that direction.  But after five or six hard-fought steps, he
	stops again.  Still nothing but jungle.

 DIETER HEY! CARTER! YELL OR SOMETHING, I GOT TURNED AROUND IN HERE! 
 ON THE TRAIL, 
	Dieter's cries are faint, but audible.  The only Marchers hear
	enough to hear him is CARTER, but the Walkman is blaring in
	his ears.

				DIETER (o.s.)
		...Carter... me?...

 IN THE JUNGLE, 
	Dieter hears that SCURRYING sound again, this time from his
	right.  He adjusts his angle again and SCRAPES through the
	foliage, moving faster and faster.

	Panicking, he ties to run, but the roots rise high out of the
	ground in the jungle, and he trips on one and falls flat on
	his face.

	He looks up.  The SCURRYING sound comes again, this time ten
	times louder than before, like a hundred feet coming at him.

	Dieter GASPS as something rushes in at him.

	He whirls to his right.  Whatever it is rushes in from that
	side as well.  And the left.  And behind him.  Dieter
	scrambles up into a sitting position --

	-- and laughs.  He is surrounded by at least forty compys now,
	the same as the one he wounded.

	For a long moment, they just stare at him.  Slowly, he brings
	his gun around, to point it at them.

 DIETER 		Easy -- wait -- one more sec-

	As one, the compys SHRIEK and hurl themselves forward,
	covering Dieter's body.  Their teeth and claws FLASH as they
	each try to grab a scrap of his flesh, tearing savagely.

	Dieter SCREAMS and flails, waving his arms and legs wildly.
	Some of the tiny animals lose their grip and sail off,
	SMASHING into trees or the ground.  But dozens of others hang
	on, and Dieter falls over backwards, now lying on his back on
	the ground.

	Hysterical, he fights like hell to get to his feet, SCREAMING,
	shaking, swatting the compys loose.  He spins, and that tactic
	seems to work, as the compys themselves begin to panic and
	drop off of him.  But he also loses his grip on his weapon,
	which goes flying, landing in the thick foliage five or six
	feet from him.

	Losing the attack, the compys turn and dart away en masse,
	stopping ten yards away from him.

	But they turn and regroup, facing him in a line, hopping up
	and down, CHIRPING and SHRIEKING.

	Dieter bounds into the foliage, looking for his gun.  But the
	compys follow him in and he's forced to flee, abandoning his
	lost weapon.

	Ten feet on, he stops, knowing he's screwed without the gun.
	He turns to face the pursuing compys.

	They stop.

	Dieter charges them, SHOUTING, waving his arms.

	The compys turn and run.  Dieter stops.

	The compys stop.  They stare back at him.  There is a moment
	of quiet, then they start to hop again, CHIRPING and
 SQUEALING. 
	Dieter, tired of this game, turns and runs away.

	The compys follow.

 EXT. JUNGLE - DAY 
	From the front of the convoy, ROLAND SHOUTS out.

 ROLAND 		Break's over, move on!

	The exhausted marchers drag themselves back to their feet and
	start to march again.  At the rear of the group, someone taps
	Carter, who is still listening to his music.  Carter gets up,
	hoists his backpack, and marches away.

	Behind him, Dieter's pack is left, forgotten, on the jungle
	trail.

 EXT. DEEP IN THE JUNGLE - DAY 
	DIETER stumbles along, exhausted.  He reaches the edge of a
	stream that runs under the foliage, and his feet slip on the
	stones.  He falls, into the rocky stream.

	Behind him, the army of compys pours over the little hill he
	just crested.  They disappear for a moment, down an incline --

	-- And then swarm over his body.  In a frenzy of splashing,
	Dieter shrugs them off and crawls away, through the stream.
	He gets to his feet but falls again, this time over a log.  A
	geyser of water splashes up in the air behind the log as
	Dieter drops out of sight.

	The compys leap over the log and disappear from view too,
	throwing up their own splashes of water.  SCREECHING,
	CHIRPING, and the sound of TEARING flesh mixes with Dieter's
 SCREAMS. 
	Now, as more compys leap over the log and splash into the
	water below, the geysers that shoot up into our field of view
	are pink.

	And then they're a deep, deep red.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. JUNGLE - DAY 
	The group has stopped again.  Near the rear, SARAH, NICK,
	MALCOLM, LUDLOW, and ROLAND are in a tense conversation with
 CARTER. 
 ROLAND 		How long ago was this?

 CARTER 		Seven, eight minutes.

	Roland looks at them, thinking.  Finally:

 ROLAND 		Then he's dead.  Nobody tells the
		little girl.  Last thing we need is
		screaming hysterics.

	He turns and heads back to the front of the column.

 SARAH 		We have to send someone to look for
		him!

 ROLAND 		You go if you like, but we're not
		waiting for you.  MOVE IT OUT!!

	They look at each other, appalled, but the column starts to
	move.  Numbed, shocked, but left with no choice, they move on,
	one by one.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. ISLAND RIDGE - DUSK 
	The column of MARCHERS has finally reached the island ridge,
	where they are silhouetted against the setting sun.  They're
	taking a break, sprawled out on rocks or over the ground.

	MALCOLM sits next to KELLY, who's sitting on a log.

 MALCOLM 		You okay?

	She doesn't look at him, just gets up and walks away, going to
	sit over next to SARAH.

	Malcolm watches, pained, but Sarah puts an arm around her and
	makes a "she's okay" gesture to Malcolm.

 AT THE RIDGE, 
	ROLAND steps up to the very edge and peers into the island
	interior.  From his vantage point, he's able to see all the
	way to the far side of the island, a rim of herd black cliff,
	miles away.  Between here and the cliffs there is nothing but
	gently undulating jungle.

	He refers to one of the satellite recon photos.

 ROLAND 		Looks like the worker village is down
		in there, about a mile and a half
		northeast from the base of these
		cliffs.

	MALCOLM is next to him.

 MALCOLM 		There must be a game trail, some kind
		of path that goes down there.

	Roland looks around at the exhausted MARCHERS.

 ROLAND 		They'll have to rest before we look
		for it.  Eat.  Sleep.  Two hours.
		Then we hit it.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT 
	The group has made camp in the jungle.  The mood is somber,
	most of the MARCHERS asleep already.  Three or four tents have
	been put up.

 IN ONE TENT, 
	KELLY sits quietly in a corner, her eyes wide, knees hugged up
	to his chest.  SARAH comes in.

 SARAH 		There you are.  Your dad's looking
		for you.

 KELLY 		I doubt that.

	Sarah takes off her outer shirt and hangs it over a bar to dry
	the broad red smear across its front.

 SARAH 		Oh, come on.  Go talk to him.

 KELLY 		Why?  He likes to be alone.  I can
		stay with you.

 IN THE CAMPSITE, 
	all is still.  The nocturnal jungle HOOTS and BUZZES around
	the sleeping marchers.

	In his tent, ROLAND abruptly sits up.  As if he heard
	something.  He looks out the open flap.  In the middle of the
	campsite, he sees AJAY stop in his tracks, head cocked.

	Roland gets up and goes outside, joining Ajay in the middle of
	the camp.

 ROLAND 		You hear something?

 AJAY 		No.  I feel something.

	Roland looks at him.  This isn't so good.  He looks out at the
	shifting jungle.  He notices a thin plume of smoke rising up
	over the trees just barely outside the edge of camp.

 ROLAND 		Oh, no.

 IN SARAH'S TENT, 
	Kelly and Sarah have laid down on top of sleeping bags, trying
	to get a few minutes' rest.  Sarah's shirt hangs over them,
	swaying in the gentle breeze coming through the open flap.

	As the shirt dangles there, swinging softly from side to side,
	we notice the broad red smear across the front.  Oh, that's
	right -- it's blood.

	The baby T-rex's blood.

 AT THE RIDGE OF CAMP, 
	the thin plume of smoke leads down to a tiny cooking fire
	that's been lit by DR. BURKE.

	He's set a small frying pan on top of it, and now he CRACKS
	the dinosaur egg he picked up earlier into the pan.

	Roland and Ajay run up behind him.

 ROLAND 			(hisses)
 ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?! 
	Burke leaps out of the way as Roland kicks dirt on the fire.

 BMBB! 
	Roland, Ajay, and Burke all freeze.  What was that?

 IN SARAH'S TENT, 
	Sarah and Kelly sit up.  They felt it too.

 BMBB! 
 AT THE COCKING FIRE, 
 ROLAND 		Get my weapon.

	Ajay turns and trots away a few steps, then stops cold,
	staring down at the ground.

 BMBB! 
	A recent rain has all left puddles scattered around the camp, and
	impact tremors now create ripples in the puddles -- concentric
	circles spreading to the outer edges.

 BMBB! 
 IN SARAH'S TENT, 
	Sarah and Kelly are frantically sealing up any opened food
	into Ziploc bags.

 BMBB! 
	Now they leap into Sarah's sleeping bag, to seal themselves,
	and draw the zipper up, all the way around.

	Outside, the silhouette of the rex's head passes by the tent.
	Sarah works faster, her fingers struggling to close the last
	few inches, but --

	-- the rex head pokes through the flap of the tent.  It
	sniffs, SNORTING the air in and out.  It looks around the
	tent.

	It sniffs Sarah's hanging shirt, the one that is stained with
	the blood of the baby tyrannosaur.  The adult tyrannosaur
	GURGLES again, COOING and cocking its head curiously.

	In the sleeping bag, Sarah and Kelly's eyes are barely
	visible, wide in panic.  The rex sniffs and nudges the bag,
	trying to figure out what this thing is.

	It rolls the bag over once, decides it's uninteresting, and
	then rises, straights up --

	-- taking the whole tent with it!  The stakes pop out of the
	ground as the tent rises high up into the air and flutters
	away, leaving the sleeping bag fully exposed on the ground
	beneath it.

 IN THE CAMPSITE, 
	the SECOND TYRANNOSAUR now steps out of the jungle, joining
	the first.  Panic hits the camp as the sleeping HUNTERS wake
	up.  Many of them start to run.

	Roland scrambles toward his tent, where he can see his weapon
	lying near the open flap.  As he draws close, an enormous
	T-rex foot stomps down on the tent, driving the rifle deep
	into the mud.

	Roland, weaponless, stands frozen, watching as the panicked
	Hunters flee in all directions.

 ROLAND FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, DON'T RUN! 
	But they ignore him, sweeping him up in the wave of flushed
	prey that pours across the campsite.  Some toss random and
	ill-aimed GUNSHOTS back at the rexes.

 ACROSS THE CAMPSITE, 
	NICK bursts out of the crowd, sees Kelly and Sarah struggling
	to get out of the sleeping bag, and grabs each by an arm.  He
	rips them to their feet and sweeps them off ahead of him, into
	the jungle.

 IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CROWD, 
	MALCOLM, blinking back sleep, stands a good head above the
	rest of the panicking crowd.  Frantically, he scans the group.

 MALCOLM KELLY? KEEEEELLLY?! 
	But he can't see her.

 AT THE EDGE OF CAMP, 
	the two rexes join forces, herding the fleeing Hunters into a
	narrow ravine.

 UP ON A ROCK RACE, 
	Roland scrambles up a steep rock face.  No way in hell he's
	going down  that ravine.  He sees Malcolm, still in the middle
	of the camp, start to head for the ravine.

 ROLAND MALCOLM! OVER HERE! 
	Malcolm runs over and hurls himself at the rock face,
	scrambling to climb up the smooth, steep boulders.

	Behind him, one of the rexes spots him and lunges across the
	camp toward him.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
 FASTER!! 
	Malcolm gives it everything he's got, clawing his way up the
	rock face --

	-- and rex draws closer and pounces at his legs --

	-- and Roland reaches down, grabs Malcolm by the hair and
	pulls him up, out of the rex's grasp.

	The rex falls short, but he's close enough that we can hear
	his teeth SNAP together, closing around nothing but air.  It
	turns, sees easier prey in the fleeing Hunters, and takes off
	after them.

	Malcolm lands on top of the rock ledge with a CRUNCH.  Roland
	unceremoniously dumps a fistful of hair in his lap.

 IN THE RAVINE, 
	Kelly, in the middle of the fleeing crowd with Sarah and Nick,
	hears her father screaming her name and looks up.  Malcolm and
	Roland are on the rock ridge above them, keeping pace.

 MALCOLM 			(shouting)
 KELLY, UP HERE! 
	But Kelly continues to flee, as the rexes are in the ravine
	now, and drawing closer to the group.

	Some Hunters try to leap up and scale the rocks, but the
	ravine is deepening, there's no way out.  One rex grabs hold
	of a Hunter in its teeth and hurls him against the rock face.

	The second rex picks up another Hunter and snaps its massive
	head left and right quickly, to break its victim's neck.  The
	Hunter goes flying forward and crashes into --

	-- CARTER, Dieter's driver, who stumbles and falls.  The rest
	of the fleeing humans run around or over him, but when the
	rex lifts its foot, we see Carter is actually stuck to the
	bottom of it --

	-- and when the animal takes its next step it CRUSHES him into
	the earth.

 UP ON TH ROCK FACE, 
	Malcolm is frantic.

 MALCOLM 		I gotta get down there!

 DOWN IN THE RAVINE, 
	it's obvious no one is going to outrun the rexes, and Nick
	knows it.  He bursts ahead of Sarah and Kelly and spots
	something off to his left.

	It's a waterfall, apparently right in front of a sheer rock
	face.  But there's something about the way the water is
	falling that tells him something.

 NICK SARAH KELLY COME HERE! 
	He grabs each of them and hauls them forward, running straight
	at the waterfall.  Apparently, he intends to jump right into
	the rock, and he's dragging them along with him.

 SARAH WHAT ARE YOU- 
 NICK JUMP! 
	The three of them spring right at the waterfall and disappear
	THROUGH the water.

	DR. BURKE, fleeing along with everyone else, is watching as
	they vanish.

 BEHIND THE WATERFALL, 
	there is a small recess, which is what Nick had hoped for.
	It's small, only four or five feet deep, but it's just enough
	for him, Sarah, and Kelly to cover behind the flowing water.
	Breathless, terrified, they can hear the mayhem outside.

 NICK 		Shhhh... shhhh...

	With an enormous SPLASH, something bursts through the
	cascading water and crashes into them.

	Dr. Burke.

 BURKE 		Get out of the way!

	He pulls his way up against the far wall, as far away from the
	water as he can.

	FOOOOM!  Now another shape bursts through the watery curtain.

	A Tyrannosaur head.  Burke gave away the hiding spot.

	The four SCREAM as the rex's jaws SNAP left and right,
	searching for them, falling just inches short.  They squeeze
	as far back against the wall as they can get.

	The rex can't quite get its head all the way through the
	opening --

	-- so it uses its tongue.  A long, dark blue shape slithers
	out of its mouth and touches the humans, trying to wrap around
	them, to pull them out of the cave.

	Burke, blind with panic, forces himself even further into the
	cave, which pushes Kelly further out.

 SARAH STOP IT YOU'RE PUSHED HER OUT STOP IT! 
	But Burke doesn't listen, throwing elbows to make room for
	himself.  His movements dislodge a portion of muddy earth, and
	a flurry of enormous cockroaches, eight or nine inches long
	each, pour out of the wall and swarm over his face and neck.

	Burke SCREAMS and instinctively leaps away, toward the flowing
	water.

	And that's all the leverage the rex needs.  It curls its
	tongue, wrapping Burke up in it and pulling him between its
	teeth.  SCREAMING hideously, he is dragged out, through the
	waterfall, and disappears.

	Sarah, Nick, and Kelly stare in horror as the white screen of
	water turn pink.

 UP ON THE ROCK FACE, 
	Malcolm and Roland see the rex walk away from the waterfall
	with Burke, leaving the hiding place unmolested.  Malcolm is
	nearly hysterical.

 ROLAND 		She's okay!  They'll stay in there,
		she's okay!

 IN A JUNGLE CLEARING, 
	routed Hunters emerge from the gully at the edge of he
	jungle.  Ahead of them, there is a large open plain covered by
	long "elephant" grass.

	AJAY, running along with them, stops abruptly at the edge of
	the grass, SHOUTING to the others.

 AWAY NO! DON'T GO INTO THE LONG GRASS! 
	Not in the frenzy, they ignore him.  Behind Ajay, the enormous
	shadows of the two pursuing tyrannosaurs stop as well, holding
	up at the edge of the jungle.

	Ajay, torn between a sense of responsibility and his better
	judgement, opts for the former and races into the grass after
	the other Hunters, waving his arms.

 UP ABOVE THEM, 
	Roland and Malcolm come out onto a rocky ledge that has a view
	of the plain below.  Roland can see the Hunters leaving trails
	as they plow through the grass.

 ROLAND 		Elephant grass!

 ON THE PLAIN, 
	the groups of Hunters wades into the middle of the long grass.
	One of them stops and turns, looking back at the jungle trees.

 HUNTER 		They gave up!  They're not chasing
		us!

	There are CHEERS, SIGHS OF relief.  In the distance, AJAY'S
	VOICE can be heard, faintly calling to them to come back.  Up
	on the rock in the distance, they can see Roland, waving his
	arms madly.

	But in the giddiness of their escape, they pay it no mind.
	They continue plowing into the high grass, anything to get
	further away from the tyrannosaurs.

 ABOUT FIFTY YARDS AWAY, 
	the tops of three animal heads rise up slowly, backlit by
	the full moon.  In the distance, the heads can seethe Hunter
	party.  The heads descend, back into the grass.

 BACK WITH THE HUNTERS, 
	they continue forward, oblivious.  Now behind them, four
	more heads rise up in the grass.  As then descend.

	On all sides of the Hunters, the grass ripples as animals move
	forward toward them, undetected, inexorable as torpedoes.

	And these torpedoes are on target.  One Hunter is suddenly
	dragged down, yanked silently below the surface of the tall
	grass.

	In his place, a long, lizard-like tail rises up as the animal
	drops its head to make the kill.

	Behind him, two more Hunters are taken down, and two more
	animal tails rise up in their place.  A Hunter ahead hears the
	RUSTLING and turns.  His face turns white as, behind him --

	-- a VELOCIRAPTOR springs out of the grass.

	Velociraptor runs upright on its powerfully muscled hind legs,
	the second tow of each foot bearing an extra-large curved
	claw, carried in a retracted position, with which it slashes
	on attack.

	Like now.  This raptor SNARLS and SLAMS into the body of the
	Hunter, taking him down.  A feeding frenzy ensues.  The
	Hunters run in all directions, but are pulled down and vanish
	into the twitching long grass.

	Another raptor enters from the right, leaps high into the air,
	past the full moon, SLAMS into the chest of more human prey,
	and takes him down, into the grass.

	Behind them, Ajay's face falls, defeated.  He looks around,
	realizing he too is now stranded in the middle of the long
	grass.

	Around him, four torpedo trails head straight for him.

	Ajay simply closes his eyes.

 UP ON THE ROCK, 
	Roland turns away from the carnage, pained.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. RUINED CAMPSITE - NIGHT 
	SARAH, MALCOLM, KELLY, NICK, ROLAND, DR. JUTTSON, and PETER
	LUDLOW stand in the ruins of their campsite, their ranks
	decimated, spirits shattered.

	Roland is at the hole in the ground where his tent once was.
	He has pulled his .800 Nitro Express from the mud and more or
	less cleaned it, now he's checking the loads.

	Kelly, nearly catatonic with fear, clings to Sarah, and it
	doesn't look as if she'll ever let go.  Malcolm, who is on his
	knees picking through the wreckage of a tent, looks over at
	them, but Sarah waves him off -- "she's okay."

	Roland appears, standing over the group.  He looks at Malcolm,
	who has found the Lindstradt rifle, intact.

 ROLAND 		How many rounds did you find for that
		weapon?

 MALCOLM 		Four, counting the one in the
		chamber.

 ROLAND 		Don't let it out of your hands again.
			(to Sara, but looking at
			 Kelly)
		Can the kid walk?

 SARAH 		Ask her.

 ROLAND 		Can the kid walk?

 KELLY 		I can.  I can walk.

	While he addresses the group, Roland straps on one of the
	servo-lights, the shoulder-mounted flashlights that follow
	your gaze.

 ROLAND 		We're going to find a path down into
		the interior of the island.  Load up
		whatever you think you need, and I
		mean need.  If you can't carry it
		indefinitely, don't bring it.  We'll
		hit the worker village in a couple
		hours and be out of here before dawn.

 AT THE EDGE OF CAMP, 
	Roland bends over one of the three-toed footprints left by the
	rex.  Behind him, the rest of the group is packing up,
	slinging the remnants of their equipment over their shoulders.

	Roland bends over and SNIFFS the footprint.  It's filled with
	a liquid of some kind.

	He takes his canteen, dumps the remaining water into the
	ground, and plunges the canteen into the footprint, filling
	it.  Ludlow hovers over his shoulder.

 LUDLOW 		What is that?

 ROLAND 		Piss.

	Ludlow doesn't ask.

 NOW AT THE FIRE, 
	Roland stares down at the ashes of the cooking fire that led
	to such disaster.  He grabs a handful of the ash and shoves it
	in his pants pocket.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. VALLEY OF DEATH - NIGHT 
	ROLAND and LUDLOW (who, along with Sarah and Malcolm, is also
	wearing a servo-light now) maneuver down a rugged hillside and
	come out in a flattened area.  Ludlow GASPS, looking ahead in
	wonderment.  MALCOLM breaks through the hillside's foliage a
	moment later.  He too stares in amazement.

	SARAH and KELLY come next, then NICK, then JUTTSON.  One by
	one, they all stop and stare.

 SARAH 		God help us.

	They're standing in a flat, sandy area lined with boulders at
	the sides.  The flat area stretches fifty yards from side to
	side and as far as they can see ahead.  But that's not what
	amazes them so.

	Everywhere, the sand is dotted with dinosaur skeletons.  Some
	are huge, apatosaurs, sixty feet from head to tail tip.
	Others are smaller, herbivores of many different kinds.  The
	more intact skeletons lie on their sides, their ribcages arcs
	of pale bone.  but just as many have been ripped apart, bits
	of carcass tossed in every direction.

 NICK 		I do not feel lucky.

 ROLAND 		Keep moving.

	They march on, tiny figures moving among the mountainous
	skeletons by the light of the full moon.  Roland notices one
	carcass in particular, a recent kill.  It's an enormous
	HADROSAUR with fresh bites taken out of it.

	He bends down, studying the soft earth around it for
	footprints.

 FURTHER ON, 
	Malcolm looks up, noticing the bony shapes around them, which
	fall in heavy shadows like cell bars, seem to be changing.

	He turns, and his servo-light shines on the bones.  But
	they're not bones any more at all, they're pipes, the animal
	graveyard now given over to the lifeless skeletons of manmade
	objects -- twisted, rotting machinery.

 LUDLOW 		We made it!

	They hurry over a small rise --

 EXT. WORKER VILLAGE - NIGHT 
	-- and find themselves at the edge of what was once Isla
	Sorna's worker village.  The size of a football field, the
	town is divided by a main street that's dotted on both sides
	by stores, residences, cafes, a gas station.  All the way at
	the far end is a large, blocky, four-story building.

	But the town is a mess.  The hurricane that hit here must have
	been ferocious, for everywhere things are smashed, broken,
	upended.  And the jungle has stepped into the breath, growing
	up, around, and over everything.  Huge root systems snake
	through the street, making it almost impassable.

 MALCOLM 		The jungle.  It's always ready to
		return.

	Roland catches up and looks at Ludlow.

 ROLAND 		Where's the power and radio setup?

 LUDLOW 		Operations building.  Far end of the
		street.

	A light rain falls as they start down the street, carefully,
	silently, Roland and Malcolm with their weapons at the ready.

	They pass the skeleton of a fallen water tower.  An empty gas
	station, its vine-snarled pumps now useless.  The only sound
	is the low mechanical HUM of the servo-lights as they follow
	the group's gazes obediently.

	Every few feet, the group encounters strange, grayish lumps
	that lies in random places in the middle of the street.
	Malcolm, curious, stops and taps one of them.  It's a rock-hard.
	Nick looks over his shoulder.

 NICK 		Lava?

 MALCOLM 		No.

 NICK 		What are they?

 MALCOLM 		I don't know.

	Finally, they reach the operation building, at the far end of
	the town.

 LUDLOW 		The radio rig is inside.  It runs
		directly from the geothermal
		generator, so power shouldn't be a
		problem.

 ROLAND 		Good.

	He pulls out his canteen.  Ludlow watches as he screws the top
	off, moves toward the building, and starts splashing the
	contents on the outside of it.

	The rest of the group just stares at him.

 MALCOLM 		What's he got in there?

 LUDLOW 		Piss.

 SARAH 		What?

 LUDLOW 		Don't ask me.  The guy's completely
		out to lunch.

 NICK 		What in God's name would he want
		with-

	Roland rejoins them.

 ROLAND 		Tyrannosaur urine.  I don't want
		anything to do with it, and neither
		does any other animal on this island.
		This building is now demarcated as
		the rex's territory.  As long as you 
		stay in that building, you'll all be
		safe until the helicopter comes.

	He drops his pack, swings his gun off his shoulder, and checks
	the load.  Dr. Juttson looks fearful.

 JUTTSON 		Where are you going?

 ROLAND 		After the rex.  I saw a fresh kill
		back in the valley with tyrannosaur
		tracks all around it.  If I'm not
		back in time, don't wait for me.

 SARAH 		You've got to be kidding.

 ROLAND 		Runs against my nature to hole up in
		a cave and wait.

 LUDLOW 		Do you think the rex might have the
		infant with it?

 ROLAND 		Possible.

	Ludlow takes off his hat and turns to Nick.

 LUDLOW 		You know how to work a radio, don't
		you?

 SARAH 		You're going too?

 LUDLOW 		I lost everything I came after on
		this trip, but one T-rex in one theme
		park could single-handedly bail
		InGen out of Chapter 11.

	He takes a slip of paper from the brim of his hat and hands it
	to Nick.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		This is the broadcast frequency.  ID
		yourself as "Harvest Leader."  You
		know what to tell 'em.

 MALCOLM 		You gentlemen feel you have to do
		this now?

 ROLAND 		Now's the perfect time.  The animal
		just fed, so it won't stalk us for
		food.  Predators don't hurt when
		they're not hungry.

	Ludlow double checks the clip on his semi-automatic rifle --

 NICK 		No.

	-- and SMACKS it back into the belly of the gun.

				NICK (cont'd)
		Only humans do.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT 
	The console of a sophisticated radio set-up glows brightly,
	all green, red, and yellow.  NICK tunes the dial to a specific
	frequency.  The radio WHINES and HISSES tuning in.

 NICK 			(into microphone)
		CQ, CQ.  This is InGen Operation
		Harvest Leader to Harvest Base.  Come
		in, please.

	The remaining SURVIVORS, minus Ludlow and Roland, shine their
	flashlights around the dusty, vine-hung interior of the
	communications room.  On the wall a row of chrome letters says
	"We Make The Future,"  but the words are obscured by a tangle
	of vines.  Mushrooms and fungi sprout from the carpet.

	On one wall, there is a mural of what the completed Jurassic
	Park would have looked like.  Big hotels, Ford Explorers with
	tourists leaning out the windows taking pictures, big crowds
	at the fences around the animal exhibits.  But none of it came
	true, and now even the mural is runny and dust-covered.

	There is a pause, filed only with radio static.  Sarah looks
	at Nick tensely, waiting.  Finally, a VOICE comes over the
	radio, clean as can be.

				VOICE (o.s.)
		Go ahead, Harvest Leader.

	They all breath a sign of relief.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	With Roland and Ludlow gone on the hunt and the rest of the
	group inside the operations building, main street stands
	deserted and silent.

	Nearly deserted, anyway.  Moonlight shadows lengthen at one
	end of the street --

	-- and FIVE VELOCIRAPTORS STROLL INTO TOWN.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. VALLEY OF DEATH - NIGHT 
	ROLAND AND LUDLOW are back in the valley of death, standing
	amid the giant skeletons of long-dead animals.  Roland bends
	down, checking the carcass of the freshly-chewed HADROSAUR he
	saw earlier.

	A set of giant three-toed rex tracks leads away from the
	carcass, down the stream bed.  Roland follows them.  Ludlow
	follows Roland.

	As they near a bend in the stream, Roland looks down, at the
	surface of the water.  A pattern of ripples moves toward them,
	washing over their ankles.  Roland follows the ripples with
	his eyes.  From up head, around the bend, he can hear the
	sound of an animal eating and drinking.  A very large animal.

	He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a  pinch of the ashes
	from the cooking fire that he scooped up earlier and releases
	that on the wind.  They float there for a second, suspended,
	then blow back at him.

 LUDLOW 		We're downwind.  Good.

	Roland darts a contemptuous look at him.  He puts a finger to
	his lips, gesturing for silence, then steps up, onto the
	shore.  Ludlow follows.

	They creep forward, toward the sounds.  They round the bend
	and Roland hits his belly, edging up over a small rise.

	Over the rise, he sees the TYRANNOSAUR, about a hundred yards
	ahead.  It's stooped over the stream bed, drinking.  Like a
	bird, it dips its head in the water and then straightens up,
	to let the water fall down its throat.  A dozen COMPYS are at
	the water as well, drinking.

	Roland gently FLICKS the safety on his gun to "off."

	Ludlow edges toward the cover of a low-hanging branch.  As he
	puts his weight on one knee, it presses down hard on the
	middle of a small stick, which CRACKS in half.  Roland turns,
	eyes blazing.

	Out in the open, the tyrannosaur snaps its head sharply as
	well, staring in the direction of the sound.  But since
	Roland's own head is turned, he doesn't see the dinosaur's
	reaction.  Roland holds a warning finger out to Ludlow.

	Roland turns his head back.  The tyrannosaur is gone.

 FURTHER ON, 
	the trail of three-toed tyrannosaur footprints stops abruptly.
	Roland stops too, gesturing for Ludlow to freeze behind him.
	Roland glances both ways, looking for any sign of the track.

	To the right, the ground gives way to hard black volcanic rock.
	A short distance behind them, the rock is solid, a massive,
	green, pebbled boulder ten feet high.  Roland frowns and
	WHISPERS in Ludlow's ear again.

 ROLAND 		We took to the rock.

 LUDLOW 		Why?

	In front of Roland, a palm frond sways gently in the night
	breeze.  Roland's eyes widen.  He pulls out another pinch of
	campfire ash and releases it on the wind.

	This time, the ash blows off, straight away from him.

 ROLAND 		Wind shift.

	They freeze, terrified.  Behind them, the enormous green
	pebbled boulder --

	-- opens an eye.

	That's no boulder, that's the MALE TYRANNOSAUR, standing
	rock-solid still, its natural camouflage blending into the
	surrounding foliage perfectly.  Very slowly and almost
	silently, the rex brings its head all the way around until it
	is staring directly down at them from about ten feet away.

	Roland and Ludlow stand frozen, their back to the rex,
	unaware of its presence.

	Until it exhales.  The soft SNORT of its breath isn't quite
	audible, but it brushes the hair on the backs of their necks
	ever so slightly.

	Their hearts drop into their stomachs.  Ludlow speaks, his
	voice a queasy HISS.

 LUDLOW 		It's... behind... us.

 ROLAND 			(the very softest whisper)
		It's just fed.  It won't attack unless
		it's threatened.  Don't move.

	As the rex silently cocks its head, sizing up the danger from
	these intruders, it breathes again.  A few strands of Ludlow's
	hair flap in the exhalation.  He closes his eyes, near tears.

	He can't take it.  His eyes dart, glancing down at the weapon
	he holds in his hands.  Unfortunately, it's extended in front
	of him, away from the rex.

	He risks another HISS.

 LUDLOW 		If I don't move, I can't shoot it.

 ROLAND 		Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.

	Behind them, the rex appears satisfied.  It starts to swing
	its massive head around, back toward the jungle.  It lifts one
	great leg and takes a step into the trees.

	Roland signs and closes his eyes, relieved.

	But Ludlow seizes the opportunity.  He whips his weapon around
	and drops to one knee.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
 NO! 
	The rex is infinitely quicker.  Ludlow just has time to
	squeeze off a short burst of semi-automatic gunfire when the
	animal whirls, takes one elegant step forward, and POUNCES.

	Ludlow's bullets rip harmlessly through the foliage between
	the rex's legs as its big head snaps forward and comes down,
	jaws wide.  They close around Ludlow's body, lift his straight
	up into the air, and toss him once, readjusting their grip so
	it is firmly around his midsection.

	The whole combination of movements takes but half a second.
	By the time Roland turns around, the animal has pivoted and
	darted back into the jungle, carrying Ludlow, still SCREAMING
	and writhing in its mouth.

	Roland raises his gun, to draw a bead on the animal, but
	through the shivering trees, he can only see that the
	tyrannosaur is gone.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT 
	MALCOLM SARAH, NICK, KELLY, and DR. JUTTSON wait nervously in
	the communications room.  An empty can of Dr. Pepper sitting
	on one of the countertops begins to RATTLE.  They look over at
	it, confused, as the lightweight aluminum can CHATTERS on the
	formica counter.

	Other objects in the lab begin to rattle too.  Glass jars
	CLANK against one another, books start to drop off the
	shelves, a stool shudders across the floor.

 KELLY 		What's going on?!

	Above them, the rotting wooden roof of the building starts to
	actually tear away, chunks of moldy timber flying up into
	the night.  They look up, a deafening ROAR fills the room --

	-- and a helicopter's searchlight floods in!

	As the chopper dips lower, looking for a place to land, the
	violent prop wash rips away huge chunks of the roof over their
	heads.

 INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT 
	Up above the operations building, the helicopter circles.  The
	roof of the building is all arches and rotten timber,
	impossible to land open.

	Below, the PILOTS see the SURVIVORS through the torn roof of
	the building.  They wave frantically, their flashlight beams
	piercing the night sky.

 PILOT 		There they are!

	The Co-Pilot scans the street below, but it's choked with
	overturned cars and fallen trees.

 CO-PILOT 		No LZ in the street, too much debris!

 PILOT 		Check the other buildings!

	The Co-Pilot nods and they peel off, swooping over the rest of
	the village.

	At the far end of the street, the Co-Pilot brings the
	searchlight to bear on the large, flat roof of a three story
	building.

	The Pilot gives him a thumbs-up.

 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	MALCOLM, SARAH, KELLY, NICK and finally DR. JUTTSON run out
	the front of the operations building.  At the end of the
	street, they can see the helicopter as it descends slowly over
	the building, to land on its roof.

 MALCOLM 		There it is!

	Happily, the group double-times it down the street, headed for
	the chopper.  Again, those strange rock formations are
	everywhere.  Some seem to be on the sides of buildings, as if
	they once dripped there and then turned to stone.

	This time Sarah pauses at one that is dripping over to the side
	of a car like solidified lava.  Her face falls as a thought
	occurs to her.

 SARAH 		Ian.  It's guano.

 MALCOLM 		What?

 SARAH 		These formations.  They're dried --

 MALCOLM 		Birdshit?

	A VELOCIRAPTORS jumps onto a fallen tree trunk behind them.

	They don't see it.

 NICK 		Who cares?  Let's go!

	Unaware of the raptor's presence, they resume their trot
	toward the helicopter.  Behind them, the raptor crouches and
	SNARLS, but the sound is lost under the WHINE of the
	helicopter's engines.  It springs, covering the distance
	between them quickly.

	The animal SLAMS into JUTTSON, the last person in the group,
	and takes him down.  Juttson is thrown forward, into the
	others, who fall like dominoes.

	Juttson SCREAMS, his voice an unnatural, high-pitched SQUEAL,
	as the raptor flips him over and lowers its jaws into him.

	Sarah looks up, panicked.  Her eyes widen at the sight of a
	SECOND RAPTOR, this one running straight at hr at top speed.
	She buries her face in the dirt, covering her head with her
	hands --

	-- and the raptor's foot SLAMS into the ground between her
	legs as it bounds over her and dives onto Juttson, joining the
	first raptor in the kill.

	Panicked, the group scatters in all directions.  Kelly jumps
	up and scrambles into the middle of the street, where she hits
	the dirt and crawls under a fallen shed in the middle of the
	road.

	Malcolm rolls over to the space where Kelly was, but she's
	gone now.  He looks around frantically.

 MALCOLM 		Kelly?!  KELLY?!

	Sarah rolls onto her feet and sprints toward the building
	nearest her.

	Behind her, a THIRD RAPTOR gives chase, bounding after her
	with horrifying speed.  Sarah runs flat-out, but her speed is
	nothing compared to the raptor's, and it gains on her rapidly.

	The walls of a structure of some kind close in around Sarah,
	and as she leaps across a leather seat and SLAMS a door behind
	her, we realize she's crawled into the back seat of an
	abandoned car.

	But the car door is thin protection against the charging
	raptor, which SLAMS into the window, head first.  The window
	spinderwebs, but does not yield.  The raptor crumples to the
	ground.

	Sarah looks up, through a three inch hole in the middle of the
	web.  The raptor leaps back to its feet and plunges its nose
	into the tiny hole, thrashing, widening it.

	Sarah SCREAMS and the animal forces its entire head through
	the hole, SNAPPING its jaws just short of her face.

	She hurls herself over the seat and into the front as the
	animal penetrates even further into the car, but its torso
	will not fit through the window opening.  It pulls away.

	In the front seat, Sarah gets some very bad news.

	There's no windshield.

	The raptor springs up onto the hood, its claws CLATTERING on
	the sheet metal, and tosses its body through the opening --

	-- just as Sarah hurls herself out the door.  While the raptor
	struggles to right itself in the front seat, Sarah runs to the
	nearest building, ducks inside, and SLAMS the heavy wooden
	door.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 
	MALCOLM races between the idled gas pumps and into the gas
	station building, closing the door behind him.  A moment
	later, a raptor bounds after him, SLAMMING into the door.

	Meeting resistance, it bounces off, notices the plate glass
	window next to the door, and pounces at that.  The window
	SHATTERS and the raptor clings to the ledge, staring inside,
	its tail hanging out.

	Just as it gets inside, Malcolm opens the door and comes back
	out, keeping the place of wall between them.  He pulls the
	Lindstradt rifle off his back and tries to take aim --

	-- but the raptor whirls and springs, forcing him back inside,
	through the door again.

	Willing to play along, the raptor turns and jumps through the
	window again.

 INT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 
	Balancing on the window frame, the raptor HISSES and crouches,
	ready to spring at Malcolm.

	Malcolm takes cover behind the door, which is hanging open
	between them.  He raises the rifle.

	Th raptor springs into the door, BLASTING it off its hinges,
	knocking Malcolm right through a window behind him.

	But the door SMACKS up against the wall, covering the window,
	preventing the raptor from following Malcolm out that way.

	For the moment.

 EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 
	Malcolm flies through the window and CRUNCHES to the ground.
	He GROANS  in agony and rolls off his bad leg, which is twisted
	unnaturally beneath him, and claws in the mud for the gun.

	ROUGH HANDS reach down, grab him by the shirt, and haul him to
	his feet.  It's NICK.  He drags Malcolm away, but in the
	commotion Nick's duffel slips off his shoulder and lands in
	the street, spilling some of the precious videotapes.

	Malcolm scoops them up.

 NICK 		Come on!

 MALCOLM 		Where's Kelly?

 NICK 		She's with Sarah!

	They race off, down the street.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. KILN HOUSE - NIGHT 
	High above SARAH, we see she is standing alone in a three
	story kiln house, a windowless shed used for firing pottery
	and other construction projects.  Catwalks lined with heavy
	chains hang above her, and onto the floor below, she turns in
	circles, wondering what to do now.

	From outside the kiln house, she hears SCRATCHING, digging
	sounds.  From the other side of the door comes an animal
	SNORT, and a small puff of dust and dirt billows up through
	the crack along the ground.

 ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR, 
	the claws of one of the raptors dig furiously, trying to
	tunnel underneath.

 INSIDE, 
	Sarah runs to the opposite wall, falls to her knees, and
	starts digging a tunnel of her own, clawing frantically at the
	ganging tools always and CLANKS as it tears at the earth below
	it.

	Sarah digs faster.  So does the raptor.

	With about eight inches of space under the wall, Sarah grabs
	hold of the bottom of one of the plans and pries it up as
	hard as she can.  It snaps off with a loud CRACK.

	At the door, the raptor stops digging.  It's silent for a
	moment.

	Sarah has a good foot and a half of space under her wall now.
	She starts to lower her body into it --

 -- JUST AS THE RAPTOR'S CLAWS FLASH THROUGH FROM THE OTHER SIDE! 
	Sarah falls back, SCREAMING, leaps to her feet, and jumps up,
	grabbing hold of one of the catwalks above.  She starts to
	climb, up, anywhere up, as the RAPTOR now squirms and thrashes
	its way inside, coming in through her hole.

	Sarah climbs, hauling herself up, leaping from one catwalk to
	another.

	The raptor leaps up onto a catwalk as well and follows her.

 EXT. KILM HOUSE - NIGHT 
	A window in the slanted roof of the kiln house EXPLODES in a
	shower of glass as SARAH kicks through it and climbs outside.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	Nick drags a badly limping MALCOLM down the main street.  They
	can see helicopter at the far end, engine ROARING and
	searchlight playing over them as they draw closer.  They
	approach a rusted, abandoned pickup in the middle of the
	street --

	-- and a RAPTOR leaps on top of it.  Its claws CLACK on the
	roof as it goes into its pre-attack crouch.

	They don't stick around to negotiate.  Nick hauls Malcolm off
	into the nearest building.

 INT. WORKER HOTEL - NIGHT 
	NICK and MALCOLM hurry inside and SLAM the door behind them.
	They're standing in the lobby of a hotel of some kind,
	probably used for overnight guests and day workers who had to
	spend the night.  The room and staircase wind around a large,
	open-aired central area four stories tall.  They SHOUT at each
	other, frantic.

 MALCOLM 		We can't stay in here!

 NICK 		We're sure as hell not going back out
		there"

 MALCOLM 		This is single-wall construction!
		It's just a shack!

 NICK 		It'll hold!

 MALCOLM 		For sixty seconds, maybe!  Look at
		this!
			(RAPS on the door with his
			 knuckles)
		You could-

	With a CRASH, the wood SPRINTERS around the lock and the door
	swings open violently.  Malcolm is thrown aside, landing hard
	on the floor.

	A VELOCIRAPTOR stands HISSING in the doorway.  Nick throws his
	weight against the door.  SLAMMING it hard against the raptor.

	Malcolm rolls over and paws the gun off his back.

	SLAM!  The raptor charges the door again, this time BLASTING
	it off its hinges, knocking Nick to the floor beneath it.  The
	raptor turns and SNARLS at Malcolm.

	Malcolm swings the gun around --

	-- the raptor lunges at him --

	-- Malcolm's finger closes on the trigger --

	-- and the raptor lands on top of him.

	The weight of the animal CRUSHES him into the floor, but the
	gun barrel now stands between them.  The raptor CHOMPS down
	hard on the barrel, its teeth GRINDING on the metal, and SNAPS
	its head, to tear it from Malcolm's hands.

	Malcolm pulls the trigger.

	The raptor's eyes pop wide as the dart SLAMS into the back of
	its throat.  It makes a GURGLING sound, then convulses
	violently and rolls off of Malcolm, yanking the gun from his
	hands as it falls and dies.

	Nick scrambles out from under the door.  Malcolm tries to
	wrench the gun from the raptor's clenched jaws, but it won't
	budge.

 NICK 			(helping him out)
		Head for the roof!

 MALCOLM 		I have to find Kelly!

 NICK 		I think she's with Sarah!

 MALCOLM DAMN IT, BE SURE!! 
 CUT TO: 
 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	KELLY remains huddled under the fallen shed, trembling with
	fear.  She holds her breath and freezes, as just outside, only
	two feet from where she's hiding --

	-- a RAPTOR'S FEET pick their way past her, down the middle of
	the street.

	Kelly closes her eyes and suppresses a scream.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT 
	NICK and MALCOLM burst onto the roof of the now-burning
	hotel and SLAM the door behind them.  The helicopter is now
	only three rooftops away.  They turn and head for it, Nick in
	the lead, but there's an eight foot gap between the buildings.

 MALCOLM 		It's too wide!

	Nick looks around, desperate.  A fallen power pole leans
	against the building they're standing on, its lines gone
	slack.

 NICK 		Help me push this!

	Malcolm understands.  He and Nick throw a shoulder into the
	pole and give it a mighty push, tipping it over in the other
	direction.  One good hard shove and it falls to the far
	building, THUDDING against it solidly.

	Its power lines are not taut, a lifeline from this rooftop to
	the next.  Nick grabs hold and starts to pull himself across
	the gap, hand over hand.

	Behind them, the door of the building SPLINTERS and CRASHES
	open as a raptor throws all its weight into it.  Malcolm leaps
	onto the power line without hesitation and starts pulling
	himself across.

	But even with the door wide open, the raptor on the other side
	hesitates.  It SNARLS and backs away, refusing to come out
	onto the roof.

 ON THE OTHER ROOFTOP, 
	Malcolm lands next to Nick on the second rooftop.  They look
	back at the frightened animal, which takes tow steps out onto
	the roof, SNARLS, and backs into the doorway again.

 NICK 		It's afraid to come onto the roof!

	Malcolm looks around, at the rooftop.  Strange bits of scrap
	and debris seem to have been arranged there, in an odd,
	concentric pattern.

 MALCOLM 		Something's wrong.

 NICK 		Look!  Sarah!

	He points to the roof of the kilm house, in the distance.
	Malcolm turns, and sees SARAH crawling across the tile.  His
	face turns white.

 MALCOLM SHE'S ALONE!! 
 CUT TO: 
 EXT. KILM HOUSE ROOF - NIGHT 
	SARAH has problems.  Still on top of the kilm house, she
	reaches the edge and pushes off the roof, leaping to the roof
	of the next building.

	She lands at the peak of the intersection of the two sides of
	sloping roof.  As she pulls herself up --

	-- a RAPTOR appears on the rooftop behind her.  In full
	stride, it leaps, sails over her, and lands on the roof
	ahead of her.

	Sarah swings to her left and starts to crawl down the slope,
	away from the raptor.  Suddenly the roof board under her
	SPRINTERS and CRACKS under her weight.  The whole section
	pulls up and starts to slide off the roof.  Sarah, clinging to
	it, rides the roof  planks down, away from the raptor.

	She looks over her shoulder, down --

	-- and sees ANOTHER RAPTOR, waiting for her on the roof of the
	building below.

	Sarah quickly rolls off the sliding section of roof, which
	keeps sliding, falling.  The raptor below jumps up, just in
	time to get WHACKED in the head by the falling roof section.

	Sarah tries to cling to the Spanish tile roof, fingers and
	nails slipping on the slick ceramic surface.  She slides all
	the way to the edge, grabs hold of the gutter, and dangles
	there, suspended above one raptor and trapped below another.

	The raptor above works its way down.  The one below leaps up,
	at her dangling legs.  She has left them in time with its
	jumps, to avoid losing her feet.  This can't go on for long.

	Desperate, she pulls one of the Spanish tiles up from the roof
	and hurls it at the raptor below.  It hits the animal in the
	head, for all the good that does.

	But Sarah keeps on, pulling and throwing more tiles.  She
	edges to the right, toward a fresh supply.

	The raptor above edges even closer, claws CLICKING on the
	slick roof.

	Something interesting is happening.  As Sarah pulls the loose
	tiles free, the ones above slide down, to take their place.
	Sarah sees this and pulls more free, knocking them out of the
	way as fast as she can.

	Suddenly an avalanche of loose tiles breaks loose and the
	footing underneath the raptor above disintegrates.  The
	animal's feet flail and grasp, it slides towards the edge amid
	the tumbling tiles.

	Sarah, seeing it coming, swings in close to the building,
	hugging it as closely as she can.  The raptor falls off the
	roof, right past her --

	-- and CRUNCHES into the raptor below.  Both animals SNARK and
	attack one another.

	Now Sarah, her grip exhausted, falls too, landing right next
	to the enraged animals.  They fight and roll, RIGHT OVER HER.
	She GROANS and hugs the wood below her, the raptors continue
	to thrash and bite, they roll back, toward her, she rolls out
	of their way --

	-- and plunges through a hole in the roof.

 INT. LAB - NIGHT 
	Sarah falls through the roof of a deserted laboratory and
	lands in the tray of an old-fashioned hanging fluorescent
	light fixture.

	One end of the fixture's support SNAPS, it drops at a 45
	degree angle, Sarah slides out the other end and CRASHES
	through a window.

 EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
	Sarah lands in the mud in the street below.

 CUT TO: 
EXT. BETWEEN TWO BUILDING - NIGHT 
	With a THUD, MALCOLM lands in the mud between two other
	building, one of which he has just climbed off of.  Panicked,
	he leaps to his feet and starts to SHOUT.

 MALCOLM 		Kelly!  KELLY!

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	SARAH sprints down the main street as fast as she can, toward
	the building on which sits the helicopter.  Above her, she can
	see NICK has now reached the helicopter and is waving to her.

	Sarah reaches the fallen water tower, which is next to the
	helicopter building, and starts to climb it.

 ELSEWHERE IN THE STREET, 
	KELLY is still covering underneath the fallen shed.  In the
	distance, she can see the helicopter.  But she is trembling
	with fear, unable to move.

	The whole shed suddenly RATTLES as something heavy hits it
	outside.  Kelly's mouth drops open to scream, but her terror
	is so complex that no sound comes out.  She raises her hands
	in self-defense, whatever's outside ROARS with effort, the
	entire shed is suddenly RIPPED right up off of her, and she
	looks up --

	-- into her father's eyes.

 KELLY 		Dad!

 MALCOLM 		Come on!

	He grabs her by the hand and they take off down the street.

 ON THE ROOFTOP, 
	Sarah emerges at the top of the water tower structure and
	leaps onto the roof, into Nick's arms.

 NICK 		Where's Kelly?

 SARAH 		Where's Ian?

	Eyes wide with panic, they both turn and look down at the
	street below, where they see KELLY and MALCOLM, racing at top
	speed down the middle of the street --

 -- WITH A VELOCIRAPTOR CHASING THEM. 
 DOWN IN THE STREET, 
	Malcolm and Kelly have a twenty yard advantage on the animal.
	They're pretty fast, but it's faster.

	Above them, Nick and Sarah are at the edge of the roof,
	SHOUTING and urging them on.  They push it, faster.

	They reach the base of the fallen water tower, the jumble of
	struts and metal poles that Sarah climbed.

 MALCOLM CLIMB! 
	Kelly leaps ahead of him and grabs hold of one of the poles,
	pulling herself neatly up to her feet and reaching for the
	next one.

	Malcolm stretches and makes the same effort, but for him it's
	much harder.

	Below them, the raptor springs and SLAMS into the struts,
	shaking the whole structure.  It pulls itself up.

	Higher up, Kelly climbs fast, hands gliding over the poles.
	She breaks out into the open, where a long, narrow pole runs
	on a slight incline up to the roof.  She scampers across it,
	running the balance beam.

	She reaches the other side, on a ledge below the roofline, and
	looks back.  Malcolm is at the other end, hesitating, drained,
	breathing hard.

 KELLY DAD, COME ON! 
	Below him, the raptor closes in.  Malcolm sets out across the
	beam, his legs shaking.  He places his feet carefully, he
	doesn't have nearly the balance Kelly did.

	The raptor draws closer.

				KELLY (cont'd)
 FASTER! 
	Malcolm slips.

	One foot twists right off the bar and he spins, arms flailing,
	trying to regain his tenuous balance.

	But he overcompensates and his whole body, wrenches out from
	under him.  He falls, the bar SMACKS him hard in the chest,
	knocking the wind out of him, and he drops, flipping right off
	the bar and bouncing painfully through the maze of bars below.

	He drops right past the pursuing velociraptor, CRUNCHING to
	a halt in a nest of bars ten feet off the ground, probably
	cracking a rib.  Kelly SCREAMS from above him.

				KELLY (cont'd)
 DAD! 
	She stares down in horror at her father.  Wrenched in among
	the bars, Malcolm is helpless as the animal crouches only six
	feet above him now, with an open attack route.

	The animal SNARKS and goes into its pre-attack crouch.

	Up above, Kelly wipes the palms of her hands on her jeans
	and leaps out into space, grabbing hold of one of the bars.

	The raptor springs.

	Kelly spins around, over the top of the bar, and, at the very
	peak of her trajectory, she lets go.

	The raptor sails through down from above, feet first, SLAMMING
	both of them squarely into the raptor's side, sending it
	hurtling into space.

	She lands hard and awkwardly, CLANGING into the spidery
	scaffolding next to Malcolm as the raptor SMASHES to the
	ground below.  But Kelly manages to hold on.

 KELLY GET UP! 
	She grabs hold of Malcolm and pulls him to his feet.

 ON THE ROOF, 
	Kelly and Malcolm appear over the roofline.  The PILOTS SHOUTS
	from inside.

 PILOT LET'S GO LET'S GO LET'S GO!! 
	Malcolm and Kelly scramble toward the helicopter.  But at the
	opposite side of the roof, a RAPTOR claws its way over the
	edge as well.

	Malcolm sees it and they lunge for the helicopter, but the
	animal is far faster.  It's only ten feet away, then five,
	they're surely done for this time, when --

 -- KA-BOOM! 
	There comes the loudest single gunshot anyone has ever heard,
	and the raptor flies off its feet and lands ten feet across
	the roof, dead.  They look up, to the source of the
	gunshot.

	It's ROLAND, standing at the edge of the roof, holding his
	smoking .600 Nitro Express.

	But there's no time for celebration, as suddenly the
	helicopter's left skid CRACKS right through the surface of the
	roof.

 PILOT HURRY! THE ROOF'S GIVING WAY! 
	The skid dips even further, ripping right through the
	thatch-and-wood construction.  Kelly, who had one foot in the
	helicopter, loses her balance --

	-- as the roof caves in beneath her.

 MALCOLM KELLY! 
	She falls,  SCREAMING, through the hole and down, into the
	building below.

 ONE FLOOR DOWN, 
	Kelly lands with a CRUNCH on the floor immediately below the
	roof, about nine feet down.  But her landing is cushioned by
	an inordinate amount of straw and leaves that have been
	arranged there.  She lifts one hand, and a yellowy, viscous
	substance drips off of it.

	It's yolk.  She looks around, noticing half a dozen large,
	oblong shapes.  Eggs.

	Above her, Malcolm is scrambling, climbing down to her through
	the wreckage of the CREAKING, crumbling roof.

 MALCOLM 		Kelly!  I'm coming!

	Kelly climbs to her knees, but behind her, a large, dark shape
	is moving.  Rising.  Unfolding, in a way.

 IT'S A PTERANODON. 
	Yep, flying dinosaur.  The enormous animal raises its head, a
	brilliant blue crest extending two feet behind its long,
	saber-like beak.  It SQUAWKS at Kelly in fury.  She can only
	stare, spellbound.

	Malcolm reaches her and grabs hold as the angry animal unfurls
	its massive twenty-two foot wingspread.

 ON THE ROOF, 
	the helicopter lurches as it sinks further into the crumbling
	roof, and now the skids are getting tangled in the debris.
	Roland races over to the hole, climbs in a few feet, and
	starts kicking at it, making it larger.

 ROLAND 		Give me a ladder!

 IN THE PTERANODON NEST, 
	Malcolm tries to haul Kelly back up the way he came, but a
	SECOND PTERANODON now appears from the depths of the building,
	SCREECHING in fury at these invaders who have landed in the
	middle of their clutch of eggs.

	An emergency rescue ladder drops through the hole in the roof.
	Malcolm grabs Kelly with one arm and the ladder with the other
	and they start to climb out of the nest.

 ON THE ROOF, 
	Malcolm and Kelly climb the ladder and are pulled into the
	belly of the chopper just as two enormous beaks break
	through the surface of the roof around them.

	The pteranodons are emerging.

 MALCOLM GO GO GO GO GOG GO! 
	The helicopter lurches up a few feet, but it yanked to an
	abrupt stop.  The engines WHINE, the chopper just hovers
	there.

 PILOT 		We're snagged on something!

	They loos down. BOTH PTERANODONS have come out through the
	hole in the roof and are clinging to the skids of the
	helicopter.  They flap their gigantic wings in unison, and
	drag the helicopter off, into the air, away from the nest --

	-- and let go.  Freed, the helicopter gains altitude quickly.

 IN THE HELICOPTER, 
	the PILOTS gape as the pteranodons coast along, right next to
	the helicopter.

 PILOT 		Hang on!  If I tip it hard, I can cut
		'em with the rotors!

 SARAH 		NO!  Don't!  They're not attacking!

	They look out the windows, where, indeed, the magnificent
	animals are merely accompanying them, flying escort as the
	chopper gains altitude.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		They're protecting their nest.
		That's all.  That's all they're
		doing.

	Kelly, completely drained, sits between Sarah and Malcolm,
	each of whom has a protective arm around her.  She sags
	against her father's chest, nothing left.

	He holds her tight and WHISPERS in her ear.

 MALCOLM 		Thank you.  Kelly, thank God.  Thank
		God for you...

 IN THE NIGHT SKY, 
	over the island, the helicopter steadily gains altitude.  A
	hundred feet.  Three hundred.  A thousand.

	As the helicopter is clearly leaving the island, the
	pteranodons now peel off, their job done.  One of them banks
	sharply, right in front of the moon.  The moonlight
	silhouettes it, shining right through its membranous wings,
	lighting it up like a Halloween skeleton.

	Below, the tiny green island melts away into the vastness of
	the wine-dark sea.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. TYRANNOSAUR NEST - NIGHT 
	Elsewhere in the forest, it's not such a happy story.  PETER
	LUDLOW, still alive, drops through the air and CRUNCHES to the
	muddy ground.  Dizzy, bleeding, the breath knocked out of him,
	he opens his eyes and sees a sloping bank of dried mud.

	From behind him, he hears a CHIRPING sound.  He turns.

	He's in the tyrannosaur nest.

	The BABY TYRANNOSAUR faces him, still with a strange
	aluminum-foil cast on its leg.  The baby SQUEAKS with
	excitement as it toddles toward him.

	Ludlow scrambles to his feet, unsure what to do.  Both ADULT
	TYRANNOSAURS stand outside the nest, staring down at him.

	The baby runs toward Ludlow, so he turns and runs away.

	But in an instant, the male brings its head down, knocking
	Ludlow to the ground.  Then it raises its head again.
	Watching.  Waiting.

	Ludlow gets up again and tries to run, but now the female rex
	strikes, knocking him over again.

	Ludlow tries to crawl away, on all fours.  The male bends down
	and closes its jaws around one of his legs, holding it
	tightly.  Ludlow SCREAMS --

	-- and the rex bits down decisively.  The bone breaks with a
	dry SNAP.  Ludlow HOWLS in pain, unable to move, and the baby
	toddles forward eagerly.  Ludlow can only stare as it leaps
	up, onto his chest, and opens its jaws wide.

	Peter Ludlow SCREAMS.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. CEMETERY - DAY 
	Snow falls in a gray midwinter sky.  In a cemetery, a group of
	fifty MOURNERS is grouped around a gravesite next to a coffin
	that is festooned with cascades of flowers.  On a table, there
	is an array of framed photographs --

	-- of JOHN HAMMOND.  A MINISTER reads from the Bible while the
	Mourners wipe away tears.  IAN MALCOLM stands a respectful
	distance from the group, KELLY right beside him.  Malcolm's
	face is blank, tired, his sunburn out of place with the white
	winter setting around him.

	At gravesite, a Young Woman turns, looking back over her
	shoulder.  About sixteen, she's lovely, with long blonde hair
	and an honest, open face.  She notices Malcolm, recognizes
	him.

	She nudges a Young Man next to her, about thirteen years old.
	The Young Man turns and breaks into a smile just as welcoming.

	As the ceremony breaks up, they walk over to him.

 MALCOLM 		Hello, Lex.  Tim.

	LEX stands on her tiptoes and kisses Malcolm on the cheek.
	TIM extends a hand and Malcolm shakes it.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		This is Kelly.  My daughter.

	They nod their hellos.

 LEX 		I'm glad you came, Dr. Malcolm

 MALCOLM 		I'm sorry about your grandfather.

 TIM 		Thank you.

 LEX 		We were going to call you, in a few
		days.  Tim and I have been thinking,
		and we've decided we want people to
		know about the island.  About what we
		all saw.

 TIM 		We think it's something our
		grandfather would want us to do.

 MALCOLM 			(pause)
		Why?

 LEX 		Because it's true.

	Malcolm looks at her for a long moment.

 MALCOLM 		I know, Lex.  But even if we're the
		only ones who ever know, it'll still
		be true.  You see, I've decided
		that if the world found out about
		what your grandfather created, it
		wouldn't be around for very long.

 LEX 		But -- it was real.  You can't let
		people go on saying it's not.

 MALCOLM 		That's the thing about reality.

	He looks down at Kelly.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		Even when people stop believing in
		it, it doesn't go away.

	Kelly smiles and takes his hand, her slender fingers
	interlocking with his.

 EXT. JUNGLE - DAY 
	Back on Isla Sorna, we float over the deserted worker village,
	moving lightly, as in a dream.

 MALCOLM (V.O.) 		Do you feel the cold wind blowing on
		your face?  That's real.

	We sweep low, landing on the roof the helicopter took off
	from, the nest below now careful rebuilt with straw and
	scrap, a dozen unblemished eggs in the middle of it.

 MALCOLM (V.O.) 		Do you see the four of us, standing
		here together, alive?  That's real.

	A PTERANODON land gently on the nest.  Ever so carefully, it
	positions itself over the eggs, lowers itself to roosting
	position, and folds its giant wings around its body.

 MALCOLM (V.O.) 		And maybe that's still that matters.

	The animal raises its head, opens its beak, and SQUAWKS
	approvingly up at the heavens.

 FADE OUT
