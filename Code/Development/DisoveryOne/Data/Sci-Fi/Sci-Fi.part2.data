CUBE
 

 
  


 

 

 -------------------------------------------------------------------- At first we see an eye. Closed and slowly it opens up and looks around. Later we get a full view of a man lying on the floor in a strange-looking room. 4 walls, 1 ceiling, 1 floor. 6 sides just like a cube. There is a kind of door on each side. Each door has a handle. On the walls are weird-looking pictures. They doesn't seem to look like anything seen before. The man stands up in the middle of the room. The camera pans around him. Then he makes some sounds and opens a door in one of the walls. As he looks in to the open door, he sees a new room like the one he is located in, but the light in the new room is blue. He turns around and the door closes by itself. Then he opens the door in in the floor. Under that door, there's a new room excatly like the first, but in this room the light is red. The door closes. He opens a new door in one of the walls. The light in there is red. He looks back and then crawls into the new room. As he lands on the floor in the new room it makes a loud sound, and then the door closes behind him. He takes one step, and then there is a loud sound. The man stands still. Slowly he begins to bleed, and slowly his body begins to fall apart. As the last parts of his body hits the floor, we see a sort of trelliswork. First it moves to the floor, and afterwards it is being folded up. -------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------- TITLE AND INTRO -------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------- A man lies on the floor. A door is open beside him. Slowly we see a hand trying to find something to hold on to. A man crawls up from the hole. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Hey... -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin closes the door in the floor. He sits down beside the man lying on the floor and tries to wake him. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Hey... -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin stands up and opens a door in one of the walls. He looks into a new room. Red light. He closes the door again. The man from before is now awake. We hear a sound from one of the other doors in the walls. Quentin stands beside the door preparing to attack whatever that comes out from there. As someone looks out, Quentin grabs her by the neck, throws her to the floor and tries to beat her, until he realises that it is a lady. The lady screams, and sits down in a corner of the room. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN I'm sorry... It's alright, I'm not gonna hurt you. HOLLOWAY What do you want? QUENTIN I thought you were... HOLLOWAY What? QUENTIN I don't know... -------------------------------------------------------------------- We hear a loud sound and everybody in the room looks around. As the sound stops, someone screams for help. Quentin opens a door real fast. As the camera switches to a new angle, we see a girl in a red room screaming for help. When she sees Quentin she walks towards him. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN STOP! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin crawls into the room. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN What, what? QUENTIN It's ok, come here. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin helps Leaven into the room where the others are located. Holloway helps Leaven out, but not good enough, because Leaven falls and drops her glasses. Leaven sits up against a wall and Quentin comes towards her. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN It's ok, calm down, evrything's gonna be fine. HOLLOWAY What was in there? QUENTIN Just give me a minute to figure things out. HOOLOWAY Why are you afraid of that room? QUENTIN Just give me a minute I said. -------------------------------------------------------------------- The door in the ceiling is being opened. We see an old man. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN How many people are in this thing? Listen! We can't go climbing around in here. HOLLOWAY Why not? QUENTIN There's traps. HOLLOWAY What do you mean, traps? QUENTIN Ubitraps. I looked into a room down there and something almost cut my head off! -------------------------------------------------------------------- The old man crawls down to the others, while Quentin talks about the traps. Leaven breathes heavily. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY Holy God, holy, holy God! -------------------------------------------------------------------- The old man sits down and begins to untie his shoe. Leaven suddenly hugs Quentin. Holloway sits down beneath Worth. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY Are you alright? Mister? Worth? -------------------------------------------------------------------- Holloway gets the attention from Worth. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Alright? WORTH I hit my head? HOLLOWAY Let me take a look at that. It's ok, I'm a doctor, it doesn't look bad. -------------------------------------------------------------------- The old man stands up. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN What the hell are you doing? -------------------------------------------------------------------- The old man opens a door and now looks into a blue room. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Hey old man? -------------------------------------------------------------------- The old man, Rennes, throws his boot into the room. An incinerator quickly burns the boot. Rennes pulls the boot back and then the door closes. Rennes drops the boot on the floor. -------------------------------------------------------------------- RENNES Motiondetectors integrated in the walls. Tough to spot. LEAVEN Oh God, oh God, oh God. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Rennes is on his way to open a new door. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Wait a second! Let's all just relax for a minute. Does anybody remember how they got here? -------------------------------------------------------------------- Long, nervebreaking silence. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY Perogies! I was eating dinner. Perogies, cheese and potato. I ran out of sour cream and then I went to the fridge and then I... I don't know... QUENTIN You... Leaven? LEAVEN I... I just went to bed and then QUENTIN What about you? WORTH I just woke up here. HOLLOWAY Middle of the night. It's like Chile. They always come in the middle of the night. LEAVEN Who? HOLLOWAY Only the government can build something this ugly. QUENTIN Oh, it ain't government. HOLLOWAY Then what is it. QUENTIN I don't know. HOLLOWAY Aliens! QUENTIN Please, we're spooked anough as it is. Let's rule out aliens from now on and concentrate on what we know. LEAVEN My mom's gonna freak... QUENTIN Rennes... LEAVEN Just won't be there... QUENTIN What do you think Rennes? RENNES We don't solve the act, sitting still. I'm moving at this straight line, till I get to the end. QUENTIN Alright, I attend to agree. LEAVEN Shouldn't we wait here? To see if anybody comes. WORTH No one is gonna come. QUENTIN There's a way in here, so there's gotta be a way out. We can avoid the traps using the boot. Holloway is it. What do you think? For an exit? HOLLOWAY Ok. QUENTIN It can't be that simple. RENNES It ain't gonna be that simple. Take a look around. Take a good long look around, see it. Coz, I got a feeling it's looking at us. LEAVEN I just wanna wake up... -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven blinks with her eyes several times. Quentin sits down beneath her. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Leaven, we can do this. We just have to stay calm, and work together as a team. There's gotta be a lot of people looking for us on the outside. I'm a cop, alright? LEAVEN You're a cop? QUENTIN Yeah... I'm gonna get you out of here, I promise, but you gotta be with me on this one... -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven nods. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN Ok. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Rennes opens a new door, waiting for Quentin to give "signal" -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Boot it! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Rennes throws the boot, nothing happens. -------------------------------------------------------------------- RENNES Clean. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Through several times of boot-throwing we see other rooms, with other colors on the walls. On the way to a new green room, Leaven notice some numbers in the passage between two rooms. A loud sound is to hear. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY That one sounded closer. RENNES It's mechanical. Seems to come at regular intervals. QUENTIN Maybe it's the ventilationsystem? RENNES No bets... HOLLOWAY No kidding, I'm boiling -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven looks at the numbers again: 566 472 737. Above these numbers are some others: 476 804 539. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN What is it, serial numbers? HOLLOWAY Room numbers, they're different in each room. WORTH Oh great, so there's only 566 million 400.000 rooms in this thing. HOLLOWAY There'd better not be! We have about three days without food and water before we're too weak to move. LEAVEN They have to feed us, don't they? QUENTIN Holloway! HOLLOWAY Oh, we have heat, stress, physical exhaustion i.e. dehydration, headaches, dizziness, disorientation, confusement. Mental process. The body eventual begins to break down it's own tissue. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Rennes rips a button of Holloway's shirt. -------------------------------------------------------------------- RENNES Suck on it... Keeps the saliva flowing. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Again the boot lands in a new room. This time, it's red. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN What? RENNES The air seems dry in there. HOLLOWAY Trapped? RENNES Molecular chemical sensor. QUENTIN Why the hell didn't the boot set it off. RENNES The boot's not alive. It detects hydrogen-sulfide extruded from the skin. QUENTIN How come, you know so much about sensors, Renz? RENNES Rennes... Not Renz! It's french! QUENTIN Fine, you're french. I'm asking how... -------------------------------------------------------------------- Rennes opens a new door and throws the boot. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Rennes... Sensorexpert... With the right age... I don't believe it... -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin laughs. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN This guy is The Wren... HOLLOWAY The what? QUENTIN The Wren. The bird of Attica. through the coop on six major prisons. RENNES Seven! HOLLOWAY You're kidding right? LEAVEN You can get us out? RENNES Maybe. HOLLOWAY An escapeartist! RENNES Yes, I'm Harry "fucking" Houdini. The only reason I dragged you so far, is cause I need your boots. If you're not smarting up I'm gone like that. No more talking... No more guessing. Don't even think about something which is not right in front of ya. That's the real challenge, you gotta save yourselves from yourselves. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Rennes jumps into the new room. We hear a click. -------------------------------------------------------------------- RENNES Merde. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Rennes gets acid in the face. He screams, and the door closes. In the other room, the door begins to open. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Get him out! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Rennes' head is partly dissolved. He screams quietly, because he has blood in his mouth. The others scream too. They lay him in a corner. After a little while they look to him again. He's dead, most of his head his been dissolved. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN So it was electrochemical or whatever, right? And he missed it. The Wren... That's great, that's fucking great. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin turns the corpse of Rennes around with a foot. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Alright... It's time to reassess this place. HOLLOWAY I've been over it again and again, why would they throw innocent people in here? Are we being punished? LEAVEN I've never done anything to deserve this! QUENTIN Forget about all that! You can't see the big picture from in here. So don't try. Keep your head down. Keep it simple. Just look, look at what's in front of you. WORTH That's what he said. QUENTIN Start with us. We got an escapeartist and a cop. There's gotta be a reason for that. You're a doctor Holloway. That gives you a function, a reason, right? HOLLOWAY No, it just makes me go: "Why me, and not one of the ten million other doctors out there"! QUENTIN Leaven. What are you? LEAVEN Nothing, I jst go to school, hang out with my friends. QUENTIN What else? LEAVEN There is nothing else. My parents are these people I live with them... I'm boring. HOLLOWAY I think we have to ask the big questions: What does it want? What is it thinking? WORTH One down, four to go. QUENTIN Why don't you tell us what your purpose is Worth! WORTH I've wondered that myself. I'm just a guy, I work in an officebuilding, doing officebulding stuff. I wasn't actually bursting joie de vivre before I got here. Life just sucks in general. HOLLOWAY I can't stand that attitude. LEAVEN Because, he's right. QUENTIN What´s your purpose Quentin? QUENTIN Kids.. Three of them... I haven't made my piece yet. I'm getting out of here no matter what. That's where my strength comes from. You people find yours wherever you got it. For Christ's sake. What do you live for? Don't you have a wife or a girlfriend or something? WORTH Nope, I got a pretty nice collection of pornography HOLLOWAY Nice, nice. I ain't got anyone either, but I'm not giving up. I'm pissed off. The came into our homes. They stripped us bare. They took my rings. They took my... my amethyst. I wanna know who's responsible. QUENTIN Leaven, your glasses? You don't need them? LEAVEN Only for reading. QUENTIN Well, they took off her jewelry, but they must have put these on you. If nothing is random... why are they here. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin opens a door in the wall. We see three numbers: 582 434 865. On the other side there's the numbers: 149 413 568. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Leaven, what do you read in school? Math? HOLLOWAY What can they mean? -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven takes the glasses and begins to study the numbers. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN 149? -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven opens a new door. The numbers we see are: 645 372 xxx -649 -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN Primenumbers. I can't believe I didn't see it before. QUENTIN See what? LEAVEN It seems like if any of these numbers of prime, then the room is trapped. Ok, 645... 645, that's not prime. 372... no. 649... Wait, 11 x 59, it's not prime either. So that room is safe. QUENTIN Wait, wait, wait. How can you make that decision based on one primenumbertrap? LEAVEN I'm not. The incinerator thing was prime: 083. The molecularchemical thing had 137, the acidroom had 149. HOLLOWAY You'd remembered all that in your head? LEAVEN I have a facility for it. QUENTIN Leaven, you beautiful brain... Boot it. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Holloway throws the boot. Nothing happens. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Ok, out of the way. LEAVEN Brains before beauty. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven jumps into the room............... Nothing happens...... -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN SAFE! Primenumbers! Primenumbers! Primenumbers! Primenumbers! -------------------------------------------------------------------- The camera pans around for some time. First we see the numbers: 656 778 462, then we see Leaven thinking. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN How long have we been in here QUENTIN Nine or ten hours. -------------------------------------------------------------------- We see a door closing. Then we see Leaven rubbing her eyes. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY How do you know? QUENTIN 5 'o clock stubble. the last thing I remember was shaving. LEAVEN I guess I missed breakfeast... or lunch... or whatever QUENTIN Now don't worry. I'll be home in time for dinner. LEAVEN If we get out, I'l make you dinner. QUENTIN You got a date. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin opens a door and Leaven looks at the numbers inside. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Doing good. HOLLOWAY I need to smoke! I could smoke a butt of a sidewalk. QUENTIN Holloway... Just real yourself in a bit. Come on. Were moving along, things are looking up. HOLLOWAY Ok. You're right, I quitted smoking years ago. I just need to be occupied. QUENTIN Talk to me. Have a conversation. What kind of doctor are you anyway? HOLLOWAY Uh, you know, the free kinda... Er, come on help me. Tell me about your rugrats. QUENTIN Ok. We have three boys. Nine, seven and five. HOLLOWAY Oh, good God. Poor woman. There's no way I'd survived that. QUENTIN She didn't either................. She's not dead, we're just separated. HOLLOWAY I'm sorry, I can't just shoot the breeze. LEAVEN These numbers aren't prime. QUENTIN Ok. Clear. HOLLOWAY Excuse me, sorry. QUENTIN You could try and help me out here buddy. WORTH No, I couldn't -------------------------------------------------------------------- The group crawls into the new room. Shortly afterwards they are in a green room, with everyone looking down in a new room. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN This one is trapped too. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin closes the door. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY We have to backtrack? -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin looks up. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Not yet. LEAVEN Oh, no. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Everyone looks up on the door. the Quentin looks at Leaven. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN Read them to me. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin takes of his shirt. Leaven is ready to hold it. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY What are you? His coatrack? Oh please. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin begins to crawls up to the door. As he wants to open the door, he says: -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN It's stuck! -------------------------------------------------------------------- As Quentin opens the door, a guy falls down and almost hits Leaven. Quentin jumps down and the new guy stands up. -------------------------------------------------------------------- KAZAN This room is green. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Kazan begins to knock his head into the wall. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Holloway. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Holloway now looks at Kazan. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY Hi there. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Holloway puts a hand on Kazan's forehead. -------------------------------------------------------------------- KAZAN This room is green. HOLLOWAY Yes it is. KAZAN I wanna go back to the blue room. QUENTIN Is it shock or what? HOLLOWAY I think he's mentally handicapped. KAZAN I like the blue room. QUENTIN Jesus Christ! LEAVEN He almost broke my neck. HOLLOWAY Hey there, are you all alone? Do you wanna hold my hand, honey? KAZAN Butter first, then honey, Kazan. Butter first then honey. LEAVEN How did he survive? KAZAN I wanna go back to the blue room. HOLLOWAY There's lots of blue rooms. We'll find another one to you real soon. LEAVEN This is just way too bizarre. HOLLOWAY Will you just worry about your own numbers... -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven looks molested. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY Go on, I'll look after him. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven points at the ceiling. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN Safe, obviously. Since he almost fell on my head. HOLLOWAY Shall we go for a walk? Kazan, do you wanna go for a walk? -------------------------------------------------------------------- As Quentin begins to crawl up to the door. Kazan gets terrified. He hits himself with the one hand on his head. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY Erm' Quentin. Let's not make him do the climbing thing right away. QUENTIN Holloway! KAZAN Holloway. -------------------------------------------------------------------- The screen fades and next time we see something is in a new room where Kazan opens a new door. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY Could they have taken us all the way to New Mexico? QUENTIN What are you talking about Holloway? HOLLOWAY I'm talking about: "Where do you hide something this big?" It has at least got to fill something. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Holloway stands walks over to Quentin and stands beside him. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY I'm sorry to shake your foundations Quentin, but you have no idea where your tax-dollars go. QUENTIN Free clinic doctors? HOLLOWAY Only the military industrial complex can afford to build something this size. QUENTIN Holloway, what's the military industrial complex? Have you ever been there? I'm tellin' you, it's not that complex. HOLLOWAY And how would you know from where you are. QUENTIN What do you think these establishments is? It's just guys like me. Their desks are bigger, but their jobs aren't. They don't conspide, they... buy boats. No, this place is... Remember Scaramanga? The bad guy in "The Man With The Golden Gun". It's some rich psyco's entertainment. HOLLOWAY Is that what you think? LEAVEN Clear! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Holloway crawls into the passage. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY Ok, you're a cop. Single bullet theory. Right on. -------------------------------------------------------------------- As Holloway lands in the new room, she starts to lose her breath. It seems like she's being choken. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN Gas! QUENTIN Holloway! Get back here. -------------------------------------------------------------------- But Holloway stays where she is. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY It's ok. I just swallowed my button. LEAVEN I hate this! I hate this! QUENTIN Your boy's having a conniption sitting there. -------------------------------------------------------------------- A door is being opened. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN It's like crème without coffee. WORTH She needs a break. QUENTIN She can do it. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Holloway crawls into Kazan and makes him touch her hair. And then back to the other room. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH They don't look prime to me. QUENTIN Is that your two bits worth, Worth? WORTH Of course it's what is worth. QUENTIN Well? LEAVEN Well, he's right. Not prime. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin jumps into the new room. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN STOP! In front of you!!! -------------------------------------------------------------------- A lot of wires or whatever is being shot down from the ceiling and the slowly surrounds Quentin, rotates and Quentin just jumps away before he gets split up into several pieces. But it wasn't without pain. Quentin gets cut on one of his legs. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY What is it? -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin gets back into the room. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN SHUT UP!!! -------------------------------------------------------------------- The door closes. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN I don't know what happened. it wasn't prime. HOLLOWAY Quentin, hold still! QUENTIN Somebody stop that rackets! HOLLOWAY Worth. QUENTIN Leave the boots. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth joins Kazan to make him shut up. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN And shut the fucking door! -------------------------------------------------------------------- The door closes. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN I had a feeling about that fucking guy. He knew about that trap. LEAVEN But these numbers aren't prime. QUENTIN Then your numbersystem failed, but he knew. HOLLOWAY Knew what? How could he know? QUENTIN You're the paranoid, think about it. His only function so far is to kick us when we're down. HOLLOWAY So, he has a bad attitude. So you think that makes him spy. QUENTIN Trust me on this, it's my job to read people like an x-ray. -------------------------------------------------------------------- The door opens and Worth comes in with Kazan. Worth holds him for his eyes. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH He doesn't like red rooms. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth makes Kazan, sit by himself. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH So what happened? QUENTIN Pmfh, you saw what happened! HOLLOWAY Quentin! LEAVEN I guess the numbers are more complicated than I thought. WORTH Maybe they mean nothing at all. LEAVEN No, it means they're more involved, the works for us up to now have just been bad, I just need more time with them. HOLLOWAY We need to rest anyway. QUENTIN Well that's handy, like if there was nothing fucking else we could do. -------------------------------------------------------------------- The camera fades. Next time we see Leaven writing some numbers on a piece of metal. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY Are they telling you anything? LEAVEN They're not Tarot-cards. Do you have any idea on how many variables I have to consider before I can decide from numbers this size!?!? They don't reveal themselves right away! QUENTIN They're like people. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Kazan pulls down his pants to pee. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN Oh, gross. HOLLOWAY Erm, not here honey, over in the corner. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Everybody looks at him. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY Well, he's just peeing! QUENTIN Jesus Christ! LEAVEN Excellent! Now it totally reeks in here! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth laughs. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN And you find this all pretty funny, don't you? -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin goes really close to Worth. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN What's your fucking problem Worth? Even Holloway's holding up better than you. Get over there and help her with him. That's your job, babysitter! WORTH Jawohl, Kommandant! QUENTIN Somebody has to taka responsibility around here. WORTH And that somebody has to be you. QUENTIN Not all of us have a luxury of playing nihilists. WORTH Not all of us are conceded enough to play hero. QUENTIN It's the will to live, everybody's got it Worth, even you, especially you hiding behind that cynical front. WORTH The will to live. That's the warm, coasy feeling deep inside. Thanks partner, I'm a new man. QUENTIN Arh, poor Worth: "Nobody loves me". If that's the chip on your shoulders, then why did you lug it all this way? Why didn't you just lie down and die! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin opens the door to the trap from before. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Do it. Show us you have some backbone and jump into the sushimachine. Be a man. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Everybody's waiting for Worth to answer. Finally Worth stands up. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Thought so. WORTH Fuck you Quentin. I don't wanna die, I'm just being realistic. Do you think they just builded this thing so we could just walk out of it? QUENTIN Do you think they would lay clues, if there wasn't a way out. WORTH You think we matter, we don't QUENTIN Put us out of your misery so we can get on and get out of here. WORTH Oh, you're not getting out. QUENTIN Yes, we are! WORTH There is no way outta here!!! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Long and nervebreaking silence. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Got ya. HOLLOWAY How... Do you know? QUENTIN Answer the question Worth. HOLLOWAY Oh, God! QUENTIN Who are you? WORTH I am the poison. I designed the outer shell. HOLLOWAY What? WORTH The shell, the sarcophagus. LEAVEN You builded this thing? WORTH Not this part, the exterior. I don't know anything about the numbers or anything else in here. I was contracted to draw plans for a hollow shell. A cube. LEAVEN A cube! Why didn't you tell us? HOLLOWAY For Gods sake, Worth. You knew what it was. WORTH No QUENTIN Worth! You're lying. WORTH Not first. HOLLOWAY Who's beyond it? WORTH I don't know. QUENTIN Who hired you? WORTH I didn't ask. I never even left my office. I talked on the phone to some other guys like me. Specialists working on small details. Nobody knew what it was. Nobody cared. QUENTIN Bullshit! You knew from square one. Look at him, he's up to his eyeballs in this thing. HOLLOWAY No Quentin. That's how they stay hidden. You keep everyone separated so the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. The brain never comes out in the open. QUENTIN Whose brain? HOLLOWAY It's all the same machine right. Pentagon. Multinational coorporations. The police! If you do one little job. You build a widget in Saskatoon. The next thing you know, it's two miles under the desert, the essential component of a deathmachine. I was right! All along my whole life I knew it. I told you Quentin. Nobody's ever call me paranoid again. We gotta get out of here and blow the lid of this thing. WORTH Holloway, you don't get it. HOLLOWAY Then tell me, please, I need to know. WORTH It's maybe hard for you to understand, but there's no conspiracy. Nobody is in charge. It's a headless blunder operating under the illusion of a masterplan. Can you grasp that? Big brother is not watching you. QUENTIN What kind of fucking explanation is that? WORTH It's the best you´re gonna get. I looked and the only explanation I can come to is that there is nobody up there. QUENTIN Somebody had to say yes to this thing. WORTH What thing? Only we know what it is. QUENTIN We have no idea, what it is. WORTH We know more than anybody else. I mean somebody might have known sometime, before they got fired or voted out or sold it. But if this place ever had a purpose, then it got miscommunicated or lost in the shuffle. This is an accident, a forgotten propetual, public, worksproject. Do you think anybody wants to ask questions? All they want is a clear conscience and a fat paycheck. I mean, I lead on my desk for months. This was a great job! QUENTIN Why put people in it? WORTH Because it's here. you have to use it or admit it's pointless. QUENTIN But it is pointless! WORTH Quentin... That's my point. HOLLOWAY What have we come to? It's so much worse than I thought. WORTH Not really, just more pathetic. QUENTIN You make me sick, Worth! WORTH I make me sick too. We´re both part of the system. I drew a box - you walk a beat. It's like you said Quentin is: Keep your head down, keep it simple, just look at what's in fron of you! I mean nobody wants to see the big picture. Life's too complicated. I mean, let's face it. The reason we're here is it's out of control. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin turns around. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY Is that how we're ruining the world? LEAVEN Daah! Have you been on glue all of your life. I felt guilty for ruining the world since I was like... seven. God! If you need someone to blame, throw a rock. WORTH Now I feel better. HOLLOWAY That's why you stayed with us. To confess. WORTH Still looking for someone to bust, Quentin? -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin turns around again and begins to beat Worth. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY Quentin, Quentin, STOP IT! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven grabs Quentin's arm. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN We need him. QUENTIN What for? HOLLOWAY Have you gone absolutely mad? He's the only one who knows nything about the place. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth falls to the ground. Quentin walks away. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN Worth... WORTH Hi... LEAVEN So there's this outer shell. WORTH Yeah. LEAVEN And it's a cube, like this? WORTH I assume so. LEAVEN Are there any doors? WORTH There's one door. LEAVEN Where? WORTH Wherever the doorguy put it. Six guesses and it's sealed from the outside. LEAVEN What are the dimensions of the outer shell? WORTH 434 feetsquare. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven starts to take steps inside the room until she gets to Kazan. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN May I? HOLLOWAY Come on. Side over. LEAVEN 14 by 14 by 14. WORTH The inner cube cannot be flushed by the shell. There is a space. LEAVEN One cube? WORTH I don't know. It makes sense. LEAVEN Well, the biggest the cube then can be is... 26 rooms heigh, 26 rooms across, so... 17.576 rooms. HOLLOWAY 17.576 rooms? Oh, God that makes me queasy. LEAVEN Descartes... -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven opens a new door and puts on her glasses. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN Leaven, you are a genius! QUENTIN What? -------------------------------------------------------------------- We see three numbers: 517 478 565 -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN Cartesian co-ordinates, of course, coded Cartesian co-ordinates. They are uses in geometry to plot points on a three-dimensional graph. QUENTIN In English. Slower. LEAVEN Bonjour, these numbers are markers, a grid-referance, like altitude and longitude on a map. The numbers tell us where we are inside the cube. QUENTIN Then where are we? LEAVEN It works! Ok, all I have to do now is add the numbers together. The X co-ordinate is 19, Y is 26 rooms. So that places us... seven rooms from the edge. QUENTIN Alright, let's go. WORTH Just out of curuiosity. I mean don't hit me again or anything. But what are you gonna do when you get there? QUENTIN Maybe we can get the door open. WORTH Wrong. HOLLOWAY What we need to do is figure out how we get around the traps. QUENTIN I'm dealing with that Holloway. I'm looking for practical solutions here. HOLLOWAY Well, you haven't found any yet! QUENTIN We cut the risk with the numbers and the boot. Worth will go in first. HOLLOWAY No he won't Quentin, we take turns! QUENTIN Relax. -------------------------------------------------------------------- The camera fades. The first we see is someone nervous playing with his/hers button. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Is there room for two in there? -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin crawls in to Leaven. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QIENTIN What's the matter? LEAVEN These co-ordinates: 14, 27, 14. QUENTIN What about them? LEAVEN Well, they don't make sense. Assuming the cube is 26 rooms across, there can't be a co-ordinate larger than 26. If that was right, then we would be outside the cube. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven looks up, and looks around. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN No, not outside the cube. QUENTIN I guess that means we're not having dinner. -------------------------------------------------------------------- The camera fades. First we see the group opening the door in the floor. -------------------------------------------------------------------- KAZAN Trap, trap, trap. TRAP! -------------------------------------------------------------------- We see a blue room. Just after Kazan says trap the last time. A lot of spears come out from the walls until the room is filled with spears. In the end the spears go back again. -------------------------------------------------------------------- KAZAN TRAP! -------------------------------------------------------------------- The spears come again, and goes away in the end. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN (Whispers) It's soundactivated. BOOOH! -------------------------------------------------------------------- The spears come, and goes away. They close the door. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Lovely. LEAVEN How come the sound of the door-opening didn't set it off? QUENTIN Must be reat to ignore it. HOLLOWAY So that's it. The edge is surrounded by traps. LEAVEN Well, I guess we have to backtrack and try somewhere else. QUENTIN Who knows how many detours we'll have to take. I say we cross the bitch. HOLLOWAY Right. QUENTIN How many boots do we have left Holloway? -------------------------------------------------------------------- They look at Kazan's feet. Just one boot left. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Get it off him. We know how it works, we just have to be quiet. WORTH Pretty fucking quiet. QUENTIN I'm glad you're on sight Worth, because you're up. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Kazan makes a sound. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN And he's not coming. HOLLOWAY Of course he is. QUENTIN No way! HOLLOWAY You're not leaving him behind. QUENTIN He's unpredictable. When we get to the edge we can come back for him, but he will get somebody killed here. Am I right? HOLLOWAY Shame on you. Will you look at yourselves. What have you turned into? They may have taken our lives away, but we're still human beings. That's all we've got left. LEAVEN We'll come back for him. HOLLOWAY That's a lie and you know it. WORTH He'll be quiet. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin opens the door and puts Worth down there. He hangs in the ceiling by himself now with a boot in his mouth. He crawls down the wall. Meanwhile we hear something nearby. As it's no longer is to hear. Worth opens a door, nothing happens, and crawls in. Leaven is up next. Afterwards Holloway. Next is Kazan. As Leaven is in Worth and Holloway stands on the floor. Kazan crawls in the ceiling and afterwards he crawls the wrong way. Holloway goes to get him. Suddenly his pants are stuck in the handle on the floor. Holloway tries to unloose it. Next up is Quentin. Now all is in except Quentin. He is on his way. In the floor the door is opening. So Quentin hurries up and aren't safe as the handle stops turning. He waits to be speared. Nothing happens. -------------------------------------------------------------------- KAZAN Hah! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Now the spears come again, Quentin just makes it into the passage. Now we are in a red room. Quentin grabs Kazan and almost beats him. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN You fucking fuck! HOLLOWAY That's enough! QUENTIN He's a trap! HOLLOWAY Let him go right now! QUENTIN Law of the jungle Holloway. He's a danger in the pack! HOLLOWAY Let him go you nazi! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin lets go of Kazan. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN What did you call me? HOLLOWAY Quentin! You let that innocent boy go. QUENTIN You listen to me woman. Every day I mop up after your bleeding heart. The only reason why you exist is because I keep you! I know your type. No kids, no man to fuck you. So you go around outraged sticking your nose up in other peoples assholes, sniffing their business! You missed your boat Holloway. You are all dry up inside there aren't you? That's your fucking problem. -------------------------------------------------------------------- The others look shocked. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN How dare you say that to her? You don't know her Quentin. None ouf us know eachother here. QUENTIN Oh, I do. LEAVEN No you don't! HOLLOWAY No wonder your wife left you. All that bottled-up anger. And a thing for young girls. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin slaps Holloway in the face. He looks insulted. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY God help you Quentin. Did you smack your kids around too? LEAVEN Is anybody besides me interested in what's on the other side of that door? QUENTIN Open it. WORTH Door number six, not door number one, door number two. QUENTIN Open the fucking thing. HOLLOWAY ("singing") Sunshine. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth opens the door. Now we see something completely black. Only with a little light from rooms below and on the other sides. It's the edge, the shell. -------------------------------------------------------------------- KAZAN Nighttime. WORTH My old friend the shell. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth crawls into the passage. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH It's there. Morning! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Now we hear a gigantic echo. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Hang on to me. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin crawls in and Worth crawls into the room again. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Can't see shit. Nothing to hang on to. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin crawls back. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN We have to try something. We gotta see if the door's over there. Someone has to swing over there and take a look. We make a rope of our clothes. Take it off. I'll tie it onto myself. LEAVEN Yeah, you're gonna go. You weigh like 500 pounds it'll snap in two seconds. I'm the lightest. QUENTIN Forget it. HOLLOWAY I'll go. QUENTIN I'm going Holloway. HOLLOWAY She's right Quentin, you're too heavy. I'm the lightest after Leaven. Anyways it's my turn. -------------------------------------------------------------------- As Quentin ties the clothes, Holloway and Worth talks together. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY How long did you know people we're put in here. WORTH A couple of months. HOLLOWAY That's not long , if you consider your whole life. WORTH I am. HOLLOWAY You opened my eyes Worth, that´s something. WORTH David. HOLLOWAY Helen. WORTH And such a Helen. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Holloway begins to crawl outside the room. She's almost crying. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN That's as far as you go. HOLLOWAY There's nothing down here. Hold tight. I'll try swinging over there. Place yourself I'm gonna try again. Ok, one more time. WORTH Hurry, you're getting heavy. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Third time Holloway tries to swing over to the shell there's a big crash. The others now drops the grip of the rope. Quentin just reaches the end of the rope, as Holloway is falling. The others graps Quentins feet as he is almost out fo the room too. -------------------------------------------------------------------- HOLLOWAY What the hell is going on? QUENTIN Get up here now! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Holloway crawls up. In the end Quentin can reach her arm. First Quentin smiles, Holloway smiles too. But then Quentin looks someway different. Holloway knows what is going to happen. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH Quentin... LEAVEN Do you got her? WORTH What's going on? LEAVEN Is she Ok? -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin drops Holloway and crawls back into the room. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN She... slipped. KAZAN Holloway. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven sits down i a corner. Quentin walks over to her. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH Sssh! Come on Kazan. Kazan will you please stop doing that! QUENTIN Leaven, you gotta be strong sweetheart. LEAVEN Don't even talk to me. QUENTIN We gotta get down to the bottom. It'll be easier to get on to shell from there. It's a long fucking way with only one boot. But we gotta do it, before we get too weak. You gotta keep cracking the numbers Leaven. LEAVEN I can't think anymore. QUENTIN Sure you can. It's your gift. LEAVEN It's not a gift, it's just a brain. WORTH Let her sleep for a while. We haven't slept for fucking hours. QUENTIN Ok, one hour. WORTH How the fuck are you gonna know how long an hour is? QUENTIN An hour is as long as I say. -------------------------------------------------------------------- The group go to sleep. In the background weird music is to hear. After a little while, we see someone taking the boot away from Worth. Then we see a hand holding Leaven for the mouth. Then Quentin is bending towards Leaven and afterwards we see him carry Leaven. The next we see is a door closing. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN What are you doing? QUENTIN We have to make it down to the bottom. There'll be quiet there and you can concentrate. LEAVEN Do you just wanna leave them? QUENTIN They're traps! We are the key. I get us down there. You think us out. Believe in me. Try to see what I see, how my mind works. THRASH! When I look into someone's head like a fucking x-ray. I looked through the walls. I dreamed him at his desk, designing everything. He can't let you solve the puzzle. There is a purpose. We are the purpose. The cube is us. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin begins to touch Leaven. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN Quentin... QUENTIN We fit like numbers. A man and a woman. Two halves of the equation. I take you down. The perfect key. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin goes further and tries to touch her breasts. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN I'll slip you on the lock. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven runs away. Quentin stands up. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Leaven... It's time to go down. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin tries to catch her. Meanwhile a door is being opened. Worth comes jumping hitting Quentin to the floor. Kazan enters the room too. The door closes. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Get away from her. Leaven, they're fucking spy's. Him, the retard. Holloway had outside information about my family. She went too far. LEAVEN You dropped her. WORTH Just go Quentin LEAVEN Give us the boot, you pig! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin turns around and suddenly hits Worth with the boot. Then he walks towards Leaven. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN You don't want the boot. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Then Quentin again hits Worth several times. Afterwards he opens the door in the floor. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN You wanna come with us Worth? Down the hatch. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin throws Worth down the hole in the floor. As Worth hits the floor, he starts laughing. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN What the fuck's with him? -------------------------------------------------------------------- The others crawl down to Worth. He lies on the door, on the handle. As the camera switches angle, we see a corpse with the face down. Quentin turns the corpse with his foot. It's Rennes. Quentin drops the boot. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN How does he...? WORTH (laughing) It's The Wren, the old Renster. QUENTIN How could...? WORTH (laughing) We've been going in circles QUENTIN That can't be. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin grabs Leaven and opens a door. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Where are we? LEAVEN I don't know. QUENTIN Where are we??? LEAVEN You figure it out! You haven't done anything. All you do is freak out! YOU MURDERER! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven starts crying. Worth stands up and laughs. Quentin sits down. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN You were right Worth. There is no outta here. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin starts crying. Kazan comes and touches his hair. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN (crying) Get away from me. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth stands up. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH Wasn't Rennes killed in that room? -------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth opens the door to were Rennes was killed. There's nothing. All we see is black. It's the edge, the shell. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH How come there's nothing out there. QUENTIN You see an edge. WORTH We were not at the edge before. Where's the room that killed Rennes? QUENTIN Fuck off! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin throws the boot after Worth, but the boot does not him it's being thrown out of the room. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH Oh, that was good. QUENTIN What difference does it make? We're dead anyways. WORTH HEY! Listen to what I'm saying! There was a room there before! We haven't been moving in circles, the rooms have! LEAVEN Of course. QUENTIN The rooms? WORTH That explains the thunder, the shaking. We've been shifting the whole time. LEAVEN It's the only logical explanation. I'm such an idiot. WORTH What are you on to Leaven. LEAVEN Give me a minute. The numbers are markers point on a map, right? WORTH Right. LEAVEN And how do you map a point that keeps moving? WORTH Permutations. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven nods. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Permu... what? LEAVEN Permutations. A list of all the co-ordinates the room passes through. Like a map that that tells you where the room starts, how many times it moves and where it moves to. QUENTIN The numbers tell you all that? LEAVEN I don't know. I've only been looking at one point on the map, which is probably the startingposition. All I saw, was how the cube looked like before it started to move. QUENTIN Ok, so it's moving. How do we get out? LEAVEN 27. I know where the exit is. QUENTIN Where? LEAVEN Stay away from me. WORTH Back off, Quentin! QUENTIN I just wanna know, don't you wanna know? LEAVEN You remember that room we passed through before, the one with the co-ordinate larger than 26? WORTH What about it? LEAVEN That co-ordinate placed the room outside the cube. WORTH A bridge? LEAVEN Right, but only in it's original position. QUENTIN What are you talking about? LEAVEN Look, the room starts off as a bridge, then it moves it's way through the maze, which is where we ran into it, but at some point it must return to it's original position. WORTH So the bridge is just a bridge... LEAVEN ... in a short period of time. This thing is like a giant combinationlock, when the rooms are in their startingposition ht elock is open. But when they move out of the linement the lock closes. WORTH Well the size of us... It must take days to complete a full cycle. QUENTIN So when does it open? -------------------------------------------------------------------- Now we see Leaven doing some math again. Quentin crawls towards her. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN Don't! We find it's original co-ordinates by adding the numbers, the permutations is found by subtracting the numbers. It's it. The room moves to 0, 1 and -1 on the x-axis, 2, 5 and -7 on y, and 1, -1 and 0 on z. QUENTIN And what does that mean. LEAVEN You suck in math? Ok, I need the roomnumbers around as a referencepoint. WORTH 666... 897... 466... QUENTIN 567... 898... ok? LEAVEN Yes! QUENTIN And 545... Did you get that? WORTH 656... 778... 462... LEAVEN That's enough. X is 17, y is 25 and z is 14. Which means this room makes two more moves before returning to it's original position. WORTH Do we have time? LEAVEN Maybe... QUENTIN Then let's go. WORTH Can you work out the traps in the system? QUENTIN Fuck the traps, let's get to the bridge. WORTH Well you threw out our last boot, you fucking idiot. LEAVEN Technically I can identify the traps. WORTH Technically? LEAVEN First I thought they were identified by primenumbers, but they're not. They're identified by a number that are the power of a prime. QUENTIN Ok, so? WORTH Can you calculate that? LEAVEN The numbers are huge. QUENTIN But you can, right? You can? LEAVEN I have to calculate to numbers of factors in each set. Maybe if I had a computer... QUENTIN You don't need a computer. LEAVEN Yes, I do. QUENTIN Figure it out! LEAVEN Yes, I do! QUENTIN I'm not dying in a fucking ratmaze. LEAVEN Look! No one in the whole world could do it mentally! Look at the number: 567898545. There's no way I can factor that. I can't even start on 567. It's astronomical! KAZAN Two... Astronomical. WORTH What did you say? KAZAN Astronomical. WORTH Before that... KAZAN Factors... LEAVEN How many factors Kazan? Of 567? KAZAN Two... QUENTIN What are you fucking kidding? LEAVEN How many factors does 30 have? KAZAN Three... LEAVEN And seven? KAZAN One... Gumdrop. LEAVEN I don't have any gumdrops. KAZAN Gumdrop! WORTH Kazan, I'll give you a whole box of gumdrops for each answer. KAZAN Gumdrops come in bags. WORTH You want 'em in bags, you got 'em in bags. KAZAN I don't like the red ones. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth opens a door and tells the numbers to Kazan. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH 8-9-8. KAZAN Two... WORTH 5-4-5. KAZAN Two... LEAVEN He's giving us the factors. KAZAN Astronomical. QUENTIN You're telling me Tell-A-Son boy is a genius. LEAVEN By those numbers the room should be safe. QUENTIN There's only one way to find out. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin takes Worth and throws him into the room. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN Don't! WORTH Safe. QUENTIN Kazan, my man! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin tries to make Kazan give him the factors. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN What's the numbers boy? Right here! Look here! Make him do it. LEAVEN Kazan, we gonna do some numbers, ok? We like to do numbers, right? KAZAN Primenumbers. LEAVEN That's right. Can you tell me the factors of 656? KAZAN Two... LEAVEN 779... KAZAN Two... LEAVEN 462... KAZAN Three... LEAVEN Clear. QUENTIN Move. Come on let's go. You too Worth. Move your scuddy ass Worth, I'm not through with you yet. Leaven open up that door, and get Einstein working on the numbers. -------------------------------------------------------------------- As Quentin has his head in the room, Worth closes the door and tries to choke Quentin. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN Oh, Jesus! WORTH Go! Hurry! QUENTIN Leaven. LEAVEN 563... Come on Kazan... 563... QUENTIN You fuckheads, you're dead! KAZAN Two... LEAVEN Clear... -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin gets his head out, and Worth closes the door. Next we see the number 384. -------------------------------------------------------------------- KAZAN One.. LEAVEN Trapped! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth enters the room and closes the door. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH Check the floor. LEAVEN Is he dead? WORTH Not quite. QUENTIN Not even close, Worth! When I'm finish I'll throw you in a fucking trap on the way out of here. -------------------------------------------------------------------- On the other side of the door, we see Quentin opening the door. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Where is he? Come here! I said come here riiight.......... -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin falls down in the room under the floor. We see Worth hanging down there. Afterwards Leaven and Kazan help Worth up from there. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH Got ya. That way. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Now we see the number 805 -------------------------------------------------------------------- KAZAN Two... LEAVEN Clear. KAZAN Four... LEAVEN Clear. -------------------------------------------------------------------- The next door they open lead them to the edge again. This time there's much more light out there. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH Oh. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven puts her head outside the room, and quickly takes it back. A room is passing by. When they open the door again, there's a room there. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH I guess that proves out theory. The numbers. -------------------------------------------------------------------- We see two numbers: 206 911 xxx -------------------------------------------------------------------- KAZAN Four, two, three. LEAVEN Clear. -------------------------------------------------------------------- They enter the new room, except Kazan, the room they just came from moves away. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN/WORTH KAZAN!!! -------------------------------------------------------------------- In the background we hear Kazan screaming. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN Listen. He hasn't moved far. WORTH I'm gonna find him. What do you think? LEAVEN You don't have a lot of lives left. -------------------------------------------------------------------- We see Kazan in a red room. He's terrified. Then we see Worth entering a blue room, then we see Leaven step on a piece of glass, the one from her glasses. Then we see Worth in the ceiling of the red room with Kazan. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH Kazan? KAZAN I didn't move. WORTH Yeah, good. Erm, you have to climb up here, ok? KAZAN I don't like that. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven opens a door and studies the numbers. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN 14... 26... 14... WORTH GET BACK HERE RIGHT NOW!!! WORTH Five bags of gumdrops? KAZAN 27 bags total. WORTH 27 bags, deal. LEAVEN Come here Worth, this room's next move takes it to the bridge. WORTH We're coming. LEAVEN Over here. Move it. We don't have much time come on. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth and Kazan crawls in to Leaven's room. Leaven closes the door. They just make it, before the room moves. As we see the group again, they lie down. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN Worth... WORTH Eaoh, it' better be it. LEAVEN It should be. WORTH Where? -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven opens a door, there's nothing behind it. She closes it again. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH Ooh, arh. LEAVEN Give me a minute. Be patient. So guess what, this was the room we started in. I was right, we should never have moved in the first place. -------------------------------------------------------------------- The room starts to shake, it's moving. As it stops, Leaven opens the door. We see a red room. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH The bridge. KAZAN Red... LEAVEN Kazan. KAZAN 38079 LEAVEN Clear!!! -------------------------------------------------------------------- They enter the red room. Leaven closes the door. Kazan opens a new door. We see daylight. Worth sits down. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN Worth??? WORTH Go ahead. LEAVEN What are you doing. You can't quit now. It's not your fault!!! WORTH I have nothing to live for out there. LEAVEN Was is out there. WORTH Boundless human stupidity. -------------------------------------------------------------------- In the background we hear a door opening. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAVEN I can live with that. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven says some strange sounds, she rises. Behind her we see Quentin with a door handle. Quentin has stabbed Leaven in the back. He drops her to the floor. He's covered with blood. Kazan closes the door to the daily life. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH Nooo! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth hits Quentin quite hard. But just after Quentin does the same to Worth. -------------------------------------------------------------------- WORTH Kazan get out to the door! -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin stabs Worth with the handle. Worth falls to the ground. Quentin tries to reach Kazan. -------------------------------------------------------------------- QUENTIN Red, Kazan. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Kazan opens the door. Meanwhile the room starts to move. As Kazan is outside the room, Quentin grabs his t-shirt. As he is just halfway out he can't move anymore. Worth holds Quentins leg. Quentin gets split up in two parts. Afterwards we see the room move. There's blood on the inner cube. In the room again we see Worth crawl towards Leaven. Halfway he stops moving he dies. The last we see of the movie is Kazan looking at the inner cube, before he turns around and disappears into the bright, white light. --------------------------------------------------------------------

                              DARK CITY

                                 by
                             Alex Proyas







                            REVISED DRAFT
                         November 29th, 1992





     DARKNESS

     A LOW RUMBLE increases in volume.


     FADE UP:

     A BLACK-GLOVED HAND wraps around a bulky electrical lever,
     thrusts FORWARD.

     SNAP!  -  Electricity arcs through darkness.

     O.S. sound of MACHINERY turning ON.

     TITLES OVER

     MONTAGE OF CLOCKS starting  -  various.  Second hands turn  -
     TICKING gets louder.


     INT.  BATHROOM  -  NIGHT

     SHADOWS DANCE.  A bare bulb swings from the ceiling revealing:
     clothes on a chair, puddles of water on the floor...

     SLEEPING EYES in and out of darkness.  The eyes open.
     Confusion.

     WIDEN ANGLE ON JONATHAN WHITE  -  a man in his early thirties,
     dark featured.

     He sits up.  Water splashes.  He's in a tub of long cold water.
     His neck aches like he's been sleeping forever.

     He looks down into the murky water around him.  A feint
     movement beneath the surface, something swimming  -  A SMALL
     DARK SHAPE.  Startled, he leaps from the bath.

     ANGLE  -  THE SWINGING LIGHT BULB.  The man's hand reaches up,
     stops the light-bulb mid swing.

     He steps to a circular window.  The glass is cracked, covered
     in grime.  He wipes it, this only smears the dirt.

     It's dark out there.


     EXT.  BUILDING  -  NIGHT

     ANGLE ON WHITE  -  from outside the window, through blurry
     glass.

     A RAPID FLYING P.O.V. PULLS BACK in silence.  The window is a
     SPECK on the side of a vast grey tower.

     BACK IN THE BATHROOM

     White shivers, cold.  He stares down at the puddle he drips on
     the floor.  He looks at his feet and legs, covered with
     numerous SMALL BITES.  He dries the bloody wounds with a towel.

     He picks up the clothes lying on the chair, puts them on.
     Loose trousers with braces, a plain shirt, leathers shoes with
     HOLES in both soles.  In his trouser pocket he finds a key  -
     a room number on a plastic tag.

     He hears splashing in the bath-tub.  He steps over, looks into
     the murky water.  Suddenly a SMALL SILVER FISH leaps from the
     water, lands at his feet, panting heavily and flapping about.

     He leans down, picks the fish up, throws it back into the
     water.

     Like a blind man, he feels the walls, comes to a door in the
     shadows.  He hears something on the other side, hesitates, hand
     inches from the doorknob.  He leans down.

     TIGHT ON HIS EYE

     Blinking through the key-hole.

     P.O.V. OF AN EMPTY ROOM  -  A glimpse of motion  -  the door
     across the room (leading to a corridor?) is shutting.


     INT.  HOTEL ROOM  -  NIGHT

     WHITE pushes the door open, steps into the adjoining room.

     No sign of life.  Cheap decorations.  He walks around
     cautiously.  Turns lights on.  Then reconsiders.  Turns them off
     again.  Disturbed, he studies his features in a wall mirror.

     ANGLE ON OPEN BATHROOM DOOR  -  the fish has jumped from the tub
     again and is flapping on the floor.

     White steps back into the bathroom.  He picks up the fish again,
     doesn't know what to do with it, so he puts it in his pocket.

     BACK IN THE OTHER ROOM

     He searches through things.  A grey overcoat in the closet.  He
     goes through the pockets, finds a WALLET.  No I.D., just a
     laundry bill, some money and a postcard from a sea-side town.

     ANGLE ON A REVOLVER on the bed-side table.  He picks it up, his
     grip tightens on the handle, his finger applies pressure to the
     trigger and...

     BANG!

     The gun goes off.  A BULLET RICOCHETS wildly around the room,
     bounces off the metal bed-head, smashes a vase, embeds itself
     in the wall.

     Startled, he holds the gun away from him like it might go off
     again.  He examines it carefully now.  Opens the chamber.

     TIGHT ON THE GUN  -  Five bullets left.

     He turns the chamber carefully, shuts it, puts the gun in the
     inside pocket of the coat.

     He moves to the bed.  A RIPPED PHOTOGRAPH on the rug.  A
     fragment of a woman's face, her left eye.  He lifts the
     fragment up.  There's handwriting on the back, part of a note:

               ...MEANS THE MOST TO ME.  LOVE YOU
               FOREVER.  -  E...

     The rest is missing.

     He sits on the edge of the bed.  As he does this, he notices
     something else on the floor.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  follows a dark stain on the floorboards, to a
     woman's bare foot behind the bed.  He stands abruptly, fumbles
     across the bed to stare into a dark corner of the room.

     In the shadows he can make out a woman's naked BODY lying in a
     pool of blood.  Her eyes stare lifeless.

     White stumbles back in horror, throws his hands across his
     mouth.


     INT.  HOTEL CORRIDOR  -  NIGHT

     White stumbles from the room, leans against a wall for support.

     Lights flicker.

     At the end of the corridor, elevator doors open.  Light and
     musak flood out.


     INT.  LOBBY  -  NIGHT

     White staggers from the elevator, moves past a deserted front
     desk.  A VOICE from the back room:

                         HOTEL MANAGER O.S.
               Hey, you! You gotta message.

     White stops, looks uncertainly towards a bead curtain.

                         WHITE
               What?

                         MANAGER O.S.
               Message in d'box!  You deaf?

     White sees several nooks for messages and keys in front of him.
     Reaching across the desk, he glances through the bead curtain
     into the manager's office.  TELEVISION SOUNDS O.S.

     HIS P.O.V.

     Hard to see  -  the man sits in the chair, lit by the glow of
     the T.V. set.  White grabs the note, looks at it.  A PHONE
     NUMBER, also his room number, and what appears to be his name:
     JONATHAN WHITE.  That's all.  White thrusts the message in his
     pocket.

                         MANAGER O.S.
               Got my money?

                         WHITE
               What?  I...  How long have I been
               here?

                         MANAGER O.S.
               Jeez, too damn long if you ask me!
               What about the two weeks y'owe me...

     Totally confused, White turns to leave, sees something.  Stops.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  A painting on a wall (cheap print variety)  -
     waves on a beach.  A breeze rustles the pages of a calender,
     pinned beside the picture.
   
     TIGHT ON WHITE  -  MOVE IN on his ear.  O.S. SOUND  -  surf
     crashes on shore.  A WOMAN'S VOICE WHISPERS:

                         VOICE O.S.
               What is your name...  What is your
               name...

     He backs away from the painting, looks about the lobby in panic
     -  sees a sign:  TOILETS.  A painted hand points the way.

                         MANAGER O.S.
               Hey!

                         WHITE (without turning)
               I'll be back later.

                         MANAGER O.S.
               Yeah.  Well, y'better be.
          
     CAMERA REVEALS A FIGURE  -  watching from a shadowy corner of
     the lobby.

     As White runs out, the MYSTERY MAN picks up a pay-phone, dials.
     Whispers into the receiver in a foreign language.


     INT.  CORRIDOR  -  NIGHT

     White pushes shakily through a red door, runs down a corridor.
     Pipes steam and drip water.  He rounds a corner, slips, nearly
     falls.


     INT.  MEN'S ROOM  -  NIGHT

     Puddles on the floor, stains on the walls.

     White bursts through the door and into a cubicle.  He bends
     over a toilet bowl and VOMITS.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     He looks up, wipes his mouth on his sleeve.  A breeze tugs at
     his stringy hair.  A tiny ventilation grill above the cistern
     looks out at the street.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  OUTSIDE

     Sheets of newspaper blow past.  A full moon, surrounded by
     blood red clouds, hangs above empty streets.


     INT.  CINEMA  -  NIGHT

     A WATCH  -  on a hairy wrist.  Seconds tick past.  Soft
     flickering light.  VOICES O.S.

     ANGLE ON FRANK BUMSTEAD  -  police inspector.  He looks down at
     the watch.  Time to leave.  He STANDS, heads for an illuminated
     exit sign.

     Images flicker on a SCREEN.  The inspector rushes to the door,
     runs into an USHER, who gasps.

                         BUMSTEAD (to usher)
               Gesundheit!

     Bumstead quickly moves off.


     INT.  CINEMA LOBBY

     The INSPECTOR makes a call, licks the tip of a pencil,
     scribbles in a notebook.  Behind thick glass, he argues
     soundlessly into a phone.

     BIG IN FOREGROUND  -  a popcorn machine rattles noisily.

     INSIDE THE BOOTH

     The inspector is upset, face strained.  A MALE VOICE chatters
     quickly through the receiver.

                         BUMSTEAD (cuts in)
               ...but you told me the meeting was
               ten-thirty.

     A burst of chatter.

                         BUMSTEAD
               I know, sir, but I can't make it at
               nine-thirty...  It's  -  um  -  well,
               inconvenient...

     A stream of chatter stops him.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Yes, sir...  I understand...  Yes...
               But, I've done fine so far without an
               assistant...

     The inspector tries to interject as the VOICE cuts in again...

                         BUMSTEAD
               But...  But I...  I...
                    (defeated)
               Nine-thirty.  Yes.


     INT.  MEN'S ROOM

     We are underwater.  WHITE's FACE swims into view.  Bubbles spew
     from the mouth,  the eyes stare in horror.

     ANGLE ON MEN'S ROOM

     White washes his face in a sink.  He looks up, wipes his face
     dry with his coat.  He turns towards the door to leave.

     There are TWO  -  identical.  He cannot remember which he came
     through.  Takes a guess, opens one and steps into darkness.

     He realizes he's picked the wrong door, tries to go back but
     the door CLICKS behind him:  locked.


     INT.  CONCRETE TUNNEL

     Pitch black.  Trickling water.  A distant voice over a P.A.
     system recites names, followed by numbers.  A LIGHT, far away.
     White walks towards it.

     He steps into a bare concrete area, a public phone hangs on a
     blank wall.  He pulls a coin from his pocket, puts it in the
     slot, dials the number on his message.  Ringing  -  no answer.

     Suddenly White feels cold.

                         VOICE O.S.
               There you are.

     Startled, White drops the phone and turns.  A figure moves
     forward out of darkness:

     ANGLE ON THE MYSTERY MAN from the hotel lobby.  The stranger
     wears a long black coat, dark glasses, and has extremely pale
     skin.  He is completely bald.  He studies White carefully.

     White glances about nervously  -  walks back up the corridor,
     his eyes pinned to the man.

                         MYSTERY MAN
               You are lost, yes?

     White retreats faster.

     A FLASH OF STEEL  -  a dagger appears by the stranger's side,
     gripped in a black leather glove.  He moves forward, a grin on
     his pale face.

     White stops, backs against the wall.

                         MYSTERY MAN
               Co-operate.  Do not make this
               difficult.

     White panics  -  he's cornered.  He remembers the revolver.  He
     pulls it from his coat and LEVELS it at the stranger, his hand
     shakes terribly.

     ON THE STRANGER continuing to advance.  Something about his
     eyes makes White immobile, unable to think clearly.

                         MYSTERY MAN
               You will not shoot, yes.  There is a
               place in your mind, a corner of
               darkness...

     THE GUN FIRES again and again.  Red splashes appear on the man.
     His shoulder.  His leg.  His neck.  He walks forward, with
     spastic jerks as bullets RIP into him.

     A final shot POINT BLANK into the stranger's forehead.  A
     stream of black liquid spouts from the hole.

     Blue smoke clears.  The man stands motionless, his mouth hangs
     open.  Then his eyes roll up, and he collapses to the ground.


     INT.  MORGUE  -  NIGHT

     CLICKING of new leather shoes, walking, striking tiles.
     INSPECTOR BUMSTEAD strides down a silent corridor.  He reaches
     into his pocket, removes a SURGICAL MASK, places it over his
     nose and mouth.

     WIDER ANGLE

     Bumstead steps up to a bald man with a moustache standing at
     the end of the corridor.  The man, who is dressed identically
     to the inspector, is his superior:  CHIEF-INSPECTOR STROMBOLI.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Good evening, sir.

                         STROMBOLI
               Yes.  This way.

     STROMBOLI leads the inspector into a tiled room containing
     several COVERED BODIES.  The two men are greeted by a cheerful-
     looking MORTICIAN.

                         MORTICIAN
               Welcome, gentlemen.  Youíre early.
               Here for the examination, right?

     Stromboli nods, then ignores the mortician and walks along the
     row of corpses.  Bumstead follows.

                         STROMBOLI
               The handiwork of an extremely sick
               individual.

     He throws back covers to reveal horrible mutilations.

                         STROMBOLI
               Youíve read the reports.  Not much to
               go on.  We know nothing about him,
               except that he likes to cut them...
               Always the same type of blade.
               Forensics match in each case...
               Anyway, it's all in the reports, read
               them for yourself.

     STROMBOLI shakes his head, turns away from the final body,
     looks at the inspector.

                         STROMBOLI
               Why are you wearing that thing on
               your face?

                         BUMSTEAD
               Germs, sir.  These places are full of
               them.

                         STROMBOLI
               I see.
                    (continues)
               One thingís for sure, heís ambitious.
               Youíll be a busy man from now on.

                         MORTICIAN
               You can say that again.

     Stromboli looks annoyed at the smiling man.  The Mortician
     becomes serious and goes back to his work.

                         BUMSTEAD
               What about Thompson, sir?  Wasnít
               this his case?

                         STROMBOLI
               Thompson suffered a kind of severe
               delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway
               he isnít with us any longer.  The
               case is yours.  Go through his files.
               Take what you need.
                    (less business-like)
               By the way, howís your mother?

                         BUMSTEAD
               Sheís getting better, thanks.  She...

                         STROMBOLI (cuts in)
               Very good...

     The chief-inspector turns, paces to the door briskly.

                         STROMBOLI
               Letís go, Bumstead.  So much to do
               and so little time.


     EXT.  BUILDING  -  NIGHT

     A large faded BILLBOARD advertisement on a building facade.  A
     portrait of a smiling woman clutching a product called, "LUMP-
     O"  -  a cereal box carton.

     THE CAMERA MOVES IN STEADILY, rises upwards, CLOSER on the
     womanís face, finally enters a hole at the centre of her
     PAINTED IRIS.


     INT.  STAIR-WELL

     A raftered room on the other side of the billboard.  CAMERA
     TILTS TO a convoluted staircase  -  at the base, the SHADOW OF
     A MAN runs.

     FEET pace rapidly.  TILT UP TO REVEAL  -  WHITE.

     CAMERA FOLLOWS as he tries to lose himself from possible
     pursuers.  He steps through a low archway into a back alley,
     rounds a corner.

     A DEAD-END.  White stops, looks around, then up.  Heís breathing
     heavily, trying to catch his breath.  He starts to shake.

     ABOVE, the walls stretch into darkness.  An OPENING way up
     there  -  he can see stars.  Something dark crosses the gap of
     sky.  A RUSHING NOISE in the distance.  Wind starts to pick up.

     Trash is being kicked up.  A sheet of NEWSPAPER wraps around
     Whiteís leg.  He tries to kick it away repeatedly but it wonít
     come off.  He bends down, grabs it to throw it away, but
     something grabs his eye.

     He stares at the page for a moment  -  then his LEGS SLIP from
     under him and he falls to the ground.  He holds his head like
     itís going to explode.  A whimper deep in his throat.  His body
     is trembling violently.

     PUSH IN TIGHT on the paper on the ground.  A front-page
     headline:  MAN-HUNT CONTINUES FOR SERIAL KILLER!

     White looks up  -  terrified.  The RUSHING NOISE O.S. again.

     HIS P.O.V.

     ON THE WALL facing him, a DOOR has appeared where moments
     before there was nothing.  The door creaks open to reveal
     ANOTHER DOOR WITHIN.  This one extends outwards on the end of a
     lengthening wooden shaft.

     White, stands quickly, thrusts the newspaper into a pocket.
     Tries to side-step the ADVANCING DOOR but itís too late, he can
     only open it and step through, to avoid getting pinned to the
     wall.


     INT.  HOTEL LOBBY  -  NIGHT

     HAND-HELD P.O.V. THROUGH the swaying beads hanging in the back-
     room doorway.  TWO FIGURES peer into the room.

                         FIGURE 1
               We are looking for Jonathan White.

     THE HOTEL MANAGER looks up, moves forward into light:  a squat,
     hunch-backed man with glasses.  He steps through the beads,
     glares at the intruders.

                         MANAGER
               What for?

     ON THE MEN  -  an uncanny resemblance to the one who tried to
     kill White.  Black coats, glasses, pale skin.  Creepy.

     A BLACK GLOVED HAND flashes forward, grips the managerís face
     and doesnít let go.  The manager struggles, gulps for air.
     Heís pushed back heavily against the wall.

                         MAN 1
               Which room is he in?

     The leather glove SQUEEZES, blood trickles from the managerís
     ears, through the fingers.


     INT.  ROOM 43

     ANOTHER (VERY SHORT) FIGURE is searching the room.  He hears
     NOISES O.S. in the corridor, runs to the door, presses against
     the wall.

     ON THE MAN  -  FREDRICK  -  a stunted body, an oversized head,
     thick limbs.  The rest of his features lost in shadow.

     The door swings open, a shaft of light floods the dark room.

     ON THE TWO MYSTERY MEN as they step in and look around.  They
     search the room, knock stuff over.  One of the men kicks at the
     womanís corpse in the corner.  Behind him, Fredrick, still
     hiding near the door, slips into the corridor unnoticed.


     EXT.  FLYING P.O.V.  -  NIGHT

     A FLYING PERSPECTIVE past buildings.  An INSECT-LIKE BUZZING
     O.S.  Way down BELOW, in a canyon of silent buildings, a LONE
     FIGURE walks.


     EXT.  DOWN ON THE STREET

     A breeze pulls at WHITEís hair and coat.  He takes out the
     wallet  -  a few dollars.

     HIS P.O.V. AS HE WALKS

     The city is DEAD.  Empty.  Desolate.  Buildings hang down out
     of black.  Day-time was never invented.

     As he puts the wallet back in his pocket, a BUSINESS CARD he
     hadnít noticed, flutters to the ground.  He stops, picks it up.
     In simple print:  DOCTOR D.P. SCHREBER M.D., a phone number.
     Scribbled handwriting on the back says:  Thursday 0930.

     ON WHITE  -  he glances across the street.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  A cafe.  A broken NEON FISH buzzes above the
     doorway.


     INT.  CHINESE CAFE

     He walks up rickety stairs, into a small room with five or six
     tables.  Empty.  Dirty.  He sits and waits.

     A CLOCK ticks on the wall  -  midnight.  White coughs, for
     attention.

     A NOISE from a doorway.  A SHADOW moves towards him, dragging
     one foot as it walks.  A SMALL ASIAN WOMAN appears and limps to
     his table.  She speaks very quickly IN CHINESE.  He does not
     understand.

     She points to a chalk board on the wall  -  a list of dishes
     also in Chinese, only one in English  -  the last one.  At the
     bottom.  In small print.  "NOODLES".

                         WHITE (nods)
               The noodles.  Iíll have some noodles.

     The old woman rips a YELLOW TICKET from a pad, gives it to
     White.  A number on it.  She points her crooked finger again
     at a SPEAKER BOX above a small serving window in the wall.  A
     greenish fluoro pulses from the room within.

                         WOMAN
               We call.

     She leaves again.

     White looks about the empty room.  Insects are zapped on an
     illuminated DEVICE hanging on the wall.  An old air-conditioner
     RATTLES noisily.

     NOISES from the kitchen  -  voices argue in Chinese, a baby
     cries.  Then SILENCE.

     White removes the newspaper from his coat and spreads it on the
     table.

     He overcomes his fear, starts to read the article.  Leans
     forward, hands trembling.  Without realising, he holds the
     paper OVER A CANDLE burning on the table.  The paper CATCHES
     FIRE, is engulfed.  He drops the flaming page on the table.  Now
     the table-cloth starts to burn.

     White is frantic.  On a nearby table he finds a pitcher of
     water, and dumps this on the flames.  It kills the fire but
     leaves a black hole in the table-cloth.  The paper is ash.

     He moves to another table pretending nothing happened, fans the
     smoke away.


     INT.  POLICE STATION  -  NIGHT

     BUMSTEAD is moving quickly.  He suddenly trips and falls to the
     floor.  He curses under his breath, then looks up.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A door  -  THOMPSON:  DETECTIVE/INSPECTOR on the frosted glass.
     Bumstead stands, pushes into the office.

     INSIDE
 
     A total mess  -  paperwork everywhere, dozens of used coffee
     cups, rotting food in greasy paper bags.  Bumstead shakes his
     head.

                         BUMSTEAD
               A real shame...

     He starts to look around.

     TIGHT ON FILING CABINET  -  a drawer is pulled open.
     Thompsonís files are also a mess.  Bumstead continues to shake
     his head.  He reaches for a file.  A loud SNAP!

                         BUMSTEAD (screams)
               YAAAAAAAAAH!

     He recoils.  A mousetrap has snapped over his fingers.  He
     pulls it off his hand, throws it to the floor, cursing.


     INT.  CHINESE CAFE

     White is still waiting for his food.

     He leans down to scratch an itchy ankle, lifts his trouser leg
     to examine the bites  -  worse, inflamed.  He uses a napkin to
     wipe at the pus.

     AERIAL PERSPECTIVE OF A FLY  -  circling the room, looking down
     on White.

     ON THE FLY  -  It lands on a plate of half eaten food on
     another table.  The creature is some kind of SURVEILLANCE
     DEVICE  -  half insect/half machine.  Itís spying on him.  MOVE
     IN TIGHT as inbuilt camera lenses focus in its head.  It shits
     on the food behind it.

     White is oblivious to this.  Heís finished examining his leg,
     is sitting quietly.  He yawns.  His head nods forward briefly.

     A NOISE.  White looks up.

     A TRAP-DOOR has opened in the ceiling.  Two feet in black
     leather shoes descend from the hole.  A sea breeze blows
     through the room.  The SOUND OF SURF, SEAGULLS CRYING.

     ON Whiteís nose twitching.  He can smell the ocean.

     The WALLPAPER COMES ALIVE  -  like a seething tangle of worms.

     One by one, THREE MEN in black coats lower into the room,
     floating on air.  They pull out knifes, step forward.

     ON WHITE rigid with terror.

     ON THE MEN  -  though their faces cannot be seen clearly in the
     gloom, they too resemble the MAN who confronted White earlier.
     They walk towards him slowly, holding knifes above their heads.
     Ready to attack.  They lean over him, pause dramatically.

                         MAN 1
               Donít fall asleep.
                    (chuckles softly)
               Might never wake, yes.

     This Man turns to the others.  They all smile, then turn back
     to White.

                         MEN (in unison)
               Fifty-six.

     ANOTHER VOICE has been speaking softly  -  now it is louder.
     Repeating:

                         VOICE
               Fifty-six...  Fifty-six...

     ANGLE  -  a chair falls to the floor.

     White leaps up from the table, terrified, disoriented.  Just a
     DREAM  -  he had dozed.

     WIDEN ANGLE  -  The place is still empty.  White glances to the
     serving window.  A DISH waits for him, framed in the glowing
     fluoro square.  He gets it.  A bowl of soupy liquid with
     noodles.  He sits down.

     He is about to start eating  -  realizes he has a fork instead
     of a spoon.  Picking up the bowl again, he heads to the
     kitchen.


     INT.  CORRIDOR

     He takes a door beneath a set of wooden stairs and finds
     himself in another corridor.  He looks about, unsure which
     direction to go in.


     INT.  SERIES OF ROOMS  -  LATER

     White is lost, still holding the soup.

     He moves through a number of RUSTED METAL DOORS that open and
     shut automatically.  Each reveals another room or corridor.
     Deserted spaces long forgotten  -  dusty, crumbling.

     He feels the fish moving about in his pocket, pulls it out and
     looks at it.

     White holds the dying fish in one hand, the bowl of cold soup
     in the other.  Disgusted, he puts the fish into the bowl.


     INT.  CORRIDOR

     A TICKING SOUND O.S.

     White stops.  Looks up.  A large clock suspended from the
     rafters.  A tug at his coat.

     Standing beside him is FREDRICK  -  the little man from Whiteís
     hotel room.

                         FREDRICK (stutters)
               Where have you been?  The doctorís
               been worried about you.

                         WHITE
               What?  Who are you?

     Fredrick looks nervously down the corridor.

                         FREDRICK
               Címon, letís go!  We donít have any
               time.

     The little man grabs Whiteís sleeve, starts to pull him along.

                         WHITE
               Hold it a minute.  Letís start at the
               beginning, huh?

     ANGLE ON  -  the top of a set of stairs in front of them.  Two
     dark figures appear.

     Fredrick looks up at them in horror.

                         FRERICK
               Shit!
                    (looks at White)
               Quick!  Run!

     Both men run like crazy, White awkwardly holding the bowl of
     soup.  They come to a junction, each takes a separate corridor.
     Fredrick finds some stairs, climbs two at a time.

     White climbs INTO FRAME, looks around, finds another corridor.
     The little man is nowhere to be seen.  White reaches another
     junction  -  several corridors branch off.             

     HIS P.O.V. PANNING AROUND                   

     Each passageway completely deserted.        

                         WHITE
               Shit.                                       

     He keeps running.


     INT.  HOTEL LOBBY

     A PHOTO FLASH  -  illuminates the dead body of the hotel manager,
     slumped in his own blood.

     Bumstead leans INTO FRAME, examines the corpse.  He notices
     several stab wounds in the manís abdomen.  Various cops search
     the room.

     One cop walks up to the Inspector.

                         COP
               We got another one upstairs

                         BUMSTEAD (deadpan)
               Great.


     INT.  ROOM  -  NIGHT

     A SMALL ROOM with arched windows that look over the city.
     Fredrick is pulling a notebook and pen from under an upturned
     table.

     He scrawls rapidly, screws the message into a tight tube, then
     puts it into a METAL CYLINDER he finds beneath the table also.

     He glances out a window, notices A FIGURE standing beneath a
     street-lamp below, looking up at him.  Startled, Fredrick darts
     back into shadow, goes to a wall covered in about a dozen
     vertical PIPES running up into the ceiling.

     TIGHT ON ONE OF THE PIPES  -  he opens a small hatch and puts
     the metal cylinder in it.  The cylinder is snatched from his
     hand, sucked into the pipe with a rush of air.

     WIDER

     Fredrick steps back, a sigh of relief.  A shadow falls across
     his back.  He turns.  He screams.

     INT./EXT.  VARIOUS

     TIGHT  -  rushing along lengths of rusted pipe, at blinding
     speed.  The cylinder races around corners.  It clanks and
     grinds.  HURTLES up the side of a building.  THEN PLUMMETS
     underground.  Rushes through darkness.


     EXT.  BRIDGE  -  NIGHT

     THE CAMERA MOVES along a bridge-like structure.  An enclosed
     corridor supported by rotting wooden pylons.  Under the bridge,
     pipes spew sewage into stagnant water.

     ANGLE ON WHITE WALKING  -  seen through a series of illuminated,
     dirty, windows.  He occasionally glances into the bowl he holds
     before him.

     INSIDE

     TIGHT ON the fish swimming weakly in the soup.

     ANGLE ON WHITE  -  He stops, looks up at O.S. SOUND of
     clattering metal.  A pipe runs the length of the corridor  -
     the invisible clanging cylinder races away, into darkness.

     Then the silence is shattered by a piercing series of SCREAMS
     somewhere in the building.  White hurriedly moves towards the
     source.

     ANOTHER CORRIDOR

     White rounds a corner, stops, notices a small rectangular HOLE
     in a wall.  ANOTHER SCREAM, weaker now  -  He runs to the hole
     in the wall and looks through.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A small, very ordered ROOM.  A fake fireplace bathes the room
     in a warm glow.

     White cranes his neck forward, stretches his head through the
     hole.  He can see into an adjoining room to his right  -  two
     dark figures stand over a man on the floor lying in a pool of
     dark crimson.  The man looks up  -  itís Fredrick  -  just as
     both dark figures stab him repeatedly with bloody daggers.  He
     doesnít scream this time, just gags on blood running from his
     mouth.

     Suddenly a sliding door SLAMS onto the back of Whiteís neck,
     traps his head in the hole.  He struggles, tries to free
     himself.  Drops the bowl of soup.  It shatters on the hard
     floor, makes a mess.

     INSIDE THE BATHROOM  -  The killers look up at the smashing
     noise.

     BACK IN THE CORRIDOR  -  White pulls with all his strength.
     The door gives and he stumbles backwards.  He is about to run
     away but glances at the floor.

     The fish is flapping about  -  still alive.


     EXT.  STREET

     White darts from a doorway, trips and falls.  He sprawls at the
     base of sweeping stone steps.  He looks at a building towering
     above him.  Chiselled in the facade, above the entrance:
     LIBRARY.


     INT.  POLICE STATION

     A series of ply-wood SILHOUETTES race through frame.  Stop
     suddenly, mechanically.  LOUD GUNSHOTS.  Chunks of ply-wood
     blast away violently.

     BUMSTEAD is practising his marksmanship.

     A HAND  -  on his shoulder.  He whips around, startled.

     ON MISS CRENSHAW  -  a young, stiff-looking woman.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Dammit!

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Sorry, sir.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Donít ever sneak up on me like that!
               Who are you?

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Patricia Crenshaw.

     She puts out her hand.

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Iím your new assistant.

                         BUMSTEAD
               I didnít requisition a secretary.

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               The Chief-Inspector thought you might
               need a hand.

                         BUMSTEAD (uncertain)
               Oh.

     He takes her hand tentatively.  They shake.

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Iíve taken the liberty and had
               Inspector Thompsonís office searched,
               as I believe you instructed.  All
               clear now, sir.  They found several
               more traps and things were filed
               under pretty strange categories...
               Poor man.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Good.

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               You wonít regret this, sir.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Fine.

     Bumstead moves off.


     INT.  LIBRARY

     White steps into a vast, empty room, stops beneath a big sign
     saying, SILENCE in formal letters.  The place seems abandoned,
     then he notices a hint of movement.  Cigarette smoke snakes
     into the air, a light, across the expanse of polished floor.

     He walks up to an elderly female LIBRARIAN sitting behind a
     desk, smoking, reading.  White looks somewhat distraught still.

                         WHITE
               Keep newspapers here, birth
               certificates, records of deaths, that
               kind of thing?

     The librarian looks up from her book.

                         LIBRARIAN
               Which would you like first?

                         WHITE
               Okay.  Newspapers.

     She takes her glasses off.  Her eyes are TINY, like pin-heads.
     She studies White.

                         LIBRARIAN
               Are you alright?

     He looks around  -  restrained panic.

                         WHITE (looks at the woman)
               Sure.  Iím fine.

                         LIBRARIAN (nods)
               Mmm-hmm.  Stairs at the end of the
               hall.  Third floor.  Turn left.
               Section C-7.  Row 35, near the
               toilets.

     She replaces her glasses, watches White rush away.

                         LIBRARIAN
               Donít mention it...

     She blows her nose into a handkerchief.  The snort ECHOES
     LOUDLY.


     INT.  LIBRARY CORRIDOR

     White rushes down a dark hall lined with bronze statues.  He
     finds section C then walks between towering rows stacked with
     old volumes.  Comes to number 7.

     He follows an arrow past row after row  -  finally finds Row 34
     but then it skips straight to letters again, A, B, C, etc.

     No Row 35.

     He stops and looks around  -  sure enough a door displays a
     small sign:  TOILETS.

     White is sweating profusely.  He now sits on a chair, takes off
     his shoes, rubs his feet.  He pulls a book from a shelf behind
     him, looks about, opens the book and tears several pages out,
     folds them, stuffs them into his shoes to plug up the holes.

     He gets up, tries to backtrack, comes across an elaborate
     diagram of the library interior.  An arrow points to a section
     near a wing labelled:  MAPS.  Near the arrow it says:  YOU ARE
     HERE.

     He keeps walking.

     He finds the door to the maps wing but the door is locked, a
     sign is nailed to it:  WE ARE REMODELLING.  WE APOLOGIZE FOR ANY
     INCONVENIENCE.

     White, annoyed now, tries to force his way in.  Puts his
     shoulder to the door, pushes several times.  It CRUMBLES under
     his weight  -  rotten.

     He finds himself in a DUSTY ROOM.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A narrow room, filled with rows of bookshelves with stacks of
     old newspapers.

     TIGHT ON WHITE  -  he steps forward, pulls a folded newspaper
     off the shelf.  The instant he picks it up, it crumbles to dust
     in his hands.  He picks up another, and another, each in turn
     breaking apart and dissolving to nothingness.


     INT.  DARK CHAMBER  -  NIGHT

     TWO SILHOUETTED FIGURES face each other across a polished black
     table.  They speak in a foreign language.  A phone rings.
     Figure 1 picks up the receiver and listens attentively.

     Figure 2 is involved with various metal shapes he is trying to
     lock together.  A complex puzzle.  He gets impatient with the
     puzzle, dashes it to the floor.

     Figure 1, on the phone, hangs up and writes something.  Hands
     the note to Figure 2, who in turn drops it into A CHUTE.

     CONTROL ROOM

     The note falls from a slot in the wall before Figure 3 (in
     shadow yet again).  He reads from the note over a silver
     microphone, still in the unfamiliar tongue.

     TIGHT ON A SPEAKER  -  his distorted voice.  A final mysterious
     person  -  Figure 4  -  listens to the announcement.  He takes
     a stick and moves a small cut-out figure of a man across a
     board, away from a large grouping of similar cut-outs.  The
     board resembles a planning table in a war-room.

     A HIGH ANGLE as the CAMERA PULL BACKS on the grouping of cut
     out figures.  More and more of them.  Ten.  Twenty.  A hundred.
     A sinister army.


     INT.  INTERSECTING STREET  -  NIGHT

     White is in a phone booth.  He removes the note from his
     pocket, dials.  No answer again.  He dials the OPERATOR.  A
     muffled voice over the line.

                         WHITE
               Iím trying to reach nine zero eight
               triple two.  I canít get through...
                    (beat)
               What?!...
                    (angry)
               Shit!

     He reaches into his pocket, pulls out a coin, puts it into the
     slot.  Heís sweating again.  He wipes his brow with a trembling
     hand.

                         WHITE
               It is?...  Which area is that number
               listed in?...  Is that near the
               ocean?...  The ocean...  Never mind.
               Have a Jonathan White listed?...
               WHITE.  Seventeen?  All Johns?  I
               see...  Never mind.

     He hangs up, then removes the business card he found in his
     wallet.  He is about to dial but decides otherwise.  He steps
     into the street.

     A HIGH ANGLE

     White walks between tall buildings, towards a narrow street
     that branches off into two separate routes.  He stops.  He
     canít decide which branch to take  -  he steps to the left,
     then steps back, takes a few steps to the right, reconsiders
     again...


     INT.  POLICE STATION/BUMSTEADíS OFFICE  -  NIGHT

     TRACK ALONG  -  piles of towering files bursting at the seams
     with paperwork  -  TO FIND Bumstead hunched over notes,
     photographs and files.  His eyes are rimmed with red.  He
     doesnít seem to be getting anywhere.

                         CRENSHAW O.S.
               Coffee?

     He looks up.  The secretary stands in the doorway with another
     big pile of paperwork.

                         BUMSTEAD
               What?  I donít drink coffee.  A cup
               of tea would be good.  Milk and no
               sugar.

     Crenshaw puts the paperwork down on Bumsteadís already
     overcrowded desk.

                         CRENSHAW
               Making progress?

     He looks at her like she just slapped him.

                         BUMSTEAD
               These are the investigations of a
               madman.  He has fabricated an entire
               bizarre paranoid delusion with no
               internal logic whatever.
                    (without looking up)
               This is a mess.  A horrible mess.
                    (looks at her now)
               Itís the second time now.

     Miss Crenshaw looks concerned.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Look at this!

     He holds up a sheet of white paper  -  a report.  The woman
     steps over and looks at it.

                         BUMSTEAD
               You typed this report?

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?

                         BUMSTEAD
               Wrong?  Look at this!

     The woman bends down, adjusts her glasses, examines it.

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               It seems fine.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Fine?  Look here!

     His finger points at the bottom of the page  -  a tiny,
     INSIGNIFICANT ink smudge.

                         BUMSTEAD
               How can I submit this?

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Iím sorry...

                         BUMSTEAD
               Do you wash your hands before you
               type things?

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Why, yes.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Well be more careful, please.

     An embarrassed beat, then:

     RI-I-I-ING!

     Bumstead reaches for the phone but Crenshaw is on it first.

                         CRENSHAW
               Inspector Bumsteadís office...
               Yes...  Yes...

     She cups the receiver with her hand, looks at Bumstead.

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Yes, sir.  The Chief-Inspector said
               he would see you now.


     INT.  POLICE STATION HALL-WAY

     TRACKING SHOT towards a door:  CHIEF-INSPECTOR on the frosted
     glass.  A hand reaches INTO FRAME, knocks twice.

                         STROMBOLI O.S.
               Enter!

     INSIDE

     Bumstead steps into the office  -  finds STROMBOLI wandering
     about the room, distracted, searching for something...

                         STROMBOLI
               What is it?

     He pulls the waste-basket up and empties the contents onto his
     desk, sorts through it.

                         BUMSTEAD
               A formality.  I need to speak with
               Thompson.  Officially I need your
               written permission.

     Stromboli is looking through his desk drawers now.

                         STROMBOLI
               Why do you want to speak to him?

                         BUMSTEAD
               A hunch.  He might be able to...

                         STROMBOLI (from under desk)
               Bumstead, donít be so paranoid.
               Leave him alone  -  heís a sad case.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Itís extremely important to my
               investigation...

                         STROMBOLI
               Iíll be the judge of that.  Anything
               else?

                         BUMSTEAD
               Actually, I was wondering, sir, if
               you could let me have a few uniforms,
               to follow up for me...

                         STROMBOLI O.S. (pokes head above desk)
               Absolutely not.  Up to my ears in
               cases right now  -  canít spare
               anyone.

     Stromboli becomes distracted again  -  stands up, looks behind
     pictures hanging off the walls.  A big sign suspended above his
     desk says, SO MUCH TO DO AND SO LITTLE TIME  -  his motto.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Lost something?

                         STROMBOLI
               What makes you think that!  If you
               would learn to concentrate on facts,
               not get so side-tracked  -  you might
               get things done faster, Bumstead...

     The door clicks shut.  Stromboli looks up  -  the inspector has
     gone.


     EXT.  PLAZA  -  NIGHT

     White walks under stone archways.

     Across an empty plaza is a sign above a door:   DRUGS OPEN 24
     HOURS and in smaller print, recently added beneath:   SHAVE &
     HAIRCUT $5.00.


     INT.  DRUG STORE  -  NIGHT

     White walks between bare, dusty shelves.  Only one shelf
     carries products  -  BOX AFTER BOX OF "LUMP-O".  He moves up to
     a small counter.  A man with thick glasses, dressed like a
     BARBER, is seated there.

                         WHITE
               I need something to keep me awake.

                         BARBER
               Looks like you need a haircut to me.

                         WHITE
               Thanks.  Just some pills.

                         BARBER
               Only two bucks.  Shave as well...

                         WHITE (annoyed now)
               Your sign says you sell drugs  -
               well, Iím here to buy some.  Okay?

                         BARBER
               Relax.  Sure!

     He waves dramatically to a shelf above his head, with several
     bottles of all sorts of different coloured capsules.

                         BARBER
               Tell you what  -  let me cut yer
               hair, give ya watcha need half price.
               Canít argue at that!

                         WHITE (evenly)
               I donít want a haircut.

     LATER

     CAMERA TRACKS OFF a clock on a wall  -  REVEALS WHITE in a
     barber chair.  The BARBER gleefully works on WHITEís hair.  A
     thin OLD GUY in a moth-eaten suit steps from behind a curtain,
     smiles, playing a violin.  Heís passionate but bad.

                         BARBER (talks fast)
               Cut hair when I was in the navy,
               yíknow  -  havenít lost the touch.
               Bet youíre happy ëbout that.  Huh!

                         WHITE
               Sell maps?

                         BARBER
               What of?

                         WHITE
               The city.  I need to get to the
               ocean.

                         BARBER
               Nope.  No maps.  Ocean, huh?  On
               vacation?

     White doesnít answer.  The old guy with the violin moves back
     and forth behind White, smiling as he plays.

                         BARBER
               Grandpa thought customers might like
               some mood music.

                         WHITE (unconvinced)
               Nice...

                         BARBER
               You still look familiar.  Itís
               driving me nuts!  Sure I donít know
               ya from somewhere?

                         WHITE (nervous now)
               Not me.

     Barber looks out the front window as his hands busily trim
     hair.

                         BARBER
               Mnunn.  Cold lately.
                    (lathers up Whiteís
                    face)
               That night, couple weeks ago.  That
               was real cold.  Remember that?

                         WHITE
               Not really...

                         BARBER
               Yeah, Iím like that.  Senility says
               the wife.  But she sure canít
               complain.  Heh.  The erector set still
               works good.
                    (points to head)
               And this ainít no fucking rug!
               Gíhead.  Feel it!  All mine!

     Grandpa laughs and plays louder.

                         GRANDPA
               Yes! Feeeeel it!

     PUSH IN ON WHITE  -  he smiles weakly.


     INT.  DETAIL  -  NIGHT

     A HAND scrawls cryptic diagrams into a notebook.

     PULL OUT TO REVEAL

     DOCTOR SCHREBER at his desk.  Heís bearded, with thick lensed
     glasses.  He puts the phone down, sits quietly at his desk,
     staring into space, lost in thought.

     A LOUD RATTLING NOISE FILLS THE ROOM.  Schreber looks up.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A rusted pipe runs across the ceiling and down one wall.  He
     steps across to the pipe on the wall, leans down, looks into an
     open hatch at its base.

     Without warning, out of the hatch pops the metal cylinder FROM
     SEVERAL SCENES PREVIOUS and bounces off the doctor's head.

     He curses, picks it up, opens it.  He plucks out the note and
     reads FREDRICKís SCRAWLED MESSAGE:

               DOCTOR, I DID AS YOU ASKED.  BUT
               THINK I MADE STUPID MISTAKE.  HOPE
               THINGS DONíT GET BACK TO YOU.  SORRY.
               -  FREDRICK.

     Schreber looks up  -  then PUNCHES HIS FIST into the desk
     angrily.


     INT.  EMPTY BUILDING

     A P.O.V. MOVES DOWN halls made of wood slatting  -  the floors,
     walls and ceilings are bare boards.  FOOTSTEPS O.S.

     TIGHT ON  -  a manís shadow as it descends a wooden staircase.

     REVEAL WHITE  -  He rummages in a paper bag as he walks.  Pulls
     out two capsules, swallows them.  Now he pulls out a pack of
     "LUMP-O", rips it open, eats ravenously.


     EXT.  STREET  -  NIGHT

     White steps out into a street, turns a corner, drops the empty
     packet of cereal.  Now he sees TWO FIGURES APPROACH.  He hides
     behind a wall before he is seen.  Suddenly a deafening RINGING
     startles him.  He looks across a plaza.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  A CHURCH.  A bell-tower, black against the sky.

     White stares up into the night.


     INT. CHURCH - NIGHT

     White walks in, sits on A PEW, towards the back of the room,
     glances over his shoulder.  He tries to blend in with the SMALL
     GATHERING OF PEOPLE sitting silently around him.

     A PRIEST  -  appears at the altar, cloaked in a blood-red robe,
     followed by two altar boys also in red.  They move past a
     statue of an insect-like creature, walk in circles chanting
     softly, stop and stare at the congregation through eye-slits in
     their hoods.  The priest begins his sermon.

                         PRIEST
               Beware!  The night is deadly.  There
               is a criminal among us.

     White looks forward.

     TIGHT ON the priestís hand  -  It rises, points, moves over the
     heads of the congregation, accusingly.  Suddenly the red finger
     jabs towards an OLD WOMAN in the front row.

                         PRIEST
               It could be she!  The innocent across
               the street!

     All the congregation turn and stare at the woman.  Sheís
     terrified.

     The hand moves slowly now, across to a BEAUTIFUL JAPANESE WOMAN
     several rows back.

                         PRIEST
               Or the temptress next door!

     The priest pauses dramatically then:

                         PRIEST
               Or mister nervy stranger at the back!

     Suddenly the finger is pointing at White. All the faces turn,
     stare suspiciously at White.

     ANGLE ON WHITE  -  frozen with fright.  Fortunately his face is
     obscured by shadow and the priest lowers his hand, continues
     the sermon.  The people look away.

                         PRIEST
               You are thinking it could be anyone?
               And youíre right!  Why, it could even
               be Mother!

     White goes to leave.  As he stands he notices the DOORS of the
     church open  -  two figures step in and move into the candle-
     light.

     MYSTERY MEN  -  Whiteís bizarre pursuers.  They look around.

     White ducks down, crawls between pews, startling several of the
     congregation.  He motions to them to keep quiet.  He runs into
     the legs of the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN the priest pointed out.  She is
     startled momentarily but looks down at him, smiles.

                         PRIEST (continues sermon)
               Evil stalks our streets.  It seeks to
               hide in our hearts.  Have you not
               evil within you now?

     White sees a nearby CONFESSION BOX.  Staying low, he runs,
     almost knocks over a large illuminated candle-holder, darts
     inside.  The girl watches him.

     A GAUNT-FACED WOMAN stands.  Hysterical.  She looks at the
     priest.

                         GAUNT WOMAN
               He took my little boy!  Iíll rip out
               his eyes!

     INSIDE  -  White breaths relief.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  carved on the dark stained wood in front of him
     is a crucified insect.  A voice surprises him.  Another PRIEST,
     OLDER.

                         OLDER PRIEST
               You have sinned?

                         WHITE
               NO.  Ah...

     White watches the two Mystery Men walk past, through the ornate
     wooden grill in front of his face.

                         PRIEST
               I am listening.

                         WHITE (lying)
               Thereís a...  woman.  I don't know
               but I think I, ahh...

                         PRIEST
               You fornicated?

     The Mystery Men look towards the box for a moment, towards
     White, but keep walking.

                         WHITE
               No.  I, ah...

                         PRIEST
               You seem restless.

     The Mystery Men seem to have gone.  White takes out the gun,
     keeping it hidden from the priest.  Opens the chamber.

     TIGHT ON THE GUN  -  Only ONE BULLET left.

                         WHITE
               Someoneís after me.

                         PRIEST
               Then we must call the police.

                         WHITE
               No.  I mean...  that isnít necessary.

     The silhouette on the other side of the box leans forward.

                         PRIEST
               I see.  Then who is after you?  What
               sins have you committed?

                         WHITE
               Just let me sit here for a moment?
               Iíll go soon, and stop bothering you.

     The priest suddenly stares incredulously at White.  His eyes
     widen in horror.

                         PRIEST
               Youíre the murderer?
                    (starts to yell)
               Yes!  That must be it!  Donít kill
               me!

     White lunges, grabs his collar with one hand, slaps the other
     over his mouth.  The old man stares at him, trembling
     uncontrollably.

                         WHITE
               Shut up!  Listen.  Walk out quietly.
                    (holds up gun)
               Understand?

     The priest nods stupidly.  White pushes him out of the
     confession box, grabs his coat from behind, puts the gun to his
     back.  Together they head for the doors.  Still no sign of the
     Mystery Men.

                         PRIEST
               Donít kill me!

                         WHITE
               Shut up!

                         PRIEST
               Please...

     White loses his temper, grabs the priest, shakes him violently.

                         WHITE (not so quietly)
               Iím not going to kill you, okay!

     Faces turn.

     The priest kicks White in the leg, bites his hand.  While White
     is wincing in pain, the priest breaks away.

                         PRIEST (shouting/pointing)
               CRIMINAL!

     People start to scream and run.  The GAUNT WOMAN points at
     White.

                         GAUNT WOMAN (screams insanely)
               Itís him!  Rip out his eyes!

     Frightened, White holds the gun out.  Everyone panics,
     scatters.  People run for the exit.  Religious statues topple
     and smash.  The gaunt woman is pushed screaming to the floor,
     trampled by the crowd.

     Amidst the chaos, the two MYSTERY MEN appear across the room,
     see White, head towards him.  He turns and runs.

     A STAIRCASE

     White climbs narrow stairs rapidly.


     INT.  BELL TOWER

     White stops, nowhere left to go, just a long drop to the street
     through a series of arched windows.  A low, raftered room,
     three huge black BELLS.

     Suddenly a groan of gears in the ceiling and the bells start to
     swing, build momentum.

     CLANG!  CLA-A-A-ANG!  A cacophony of noise.

     White puts his hands over his ears in pain, then turns to the
     stairs.

     HIS P.O.V.

     Through the swinging bells  -  the MYSTERY MEN climb the last
     few steps on the other end of the dark room.  They advance
     slowly, clutching daggers.

     White raises his gun.  Aims.  Difficult to find his target  -
     the approaching MEN are obscured by the bells.

     White steps sideways, never taking his eyes off the Men.  They
     follow him slowly, pivoting about the bells in the centre of
     the tower, pursuers and pursued remaining a semi-circle apart.

                         WHITE (shouts)
               What do you want?  Tell me!

     The Men stop.  So does White.  They separate, now approaching
     him from OPPOSITE sides, moving around the bells.

     White doesnít know who to point the gun at  -  he swings back
     and forth, one to the other, faster and faster, as the Men
     approach.

     He lets them get uncomfortably close, then swings to his right,
     thrusts the gun to one Manís forehead.  FIRES.  The Man steps
     back, spouting liquid from the bullet hole, hits a low railing,
     FALLS into the shaft at the centre of the tower.

     The second Man SWINGS his dagger at White.

     White falls backwards, dropping his gun clumsily.  The Man
     advances, smiling  -  kicks the gun across the wooden floor.

     White, clutching at straws, lifts his foot, kicks down hard on
     a loose floorboard.  The board flies up, pivoting against
     Whiteís heel, catches the Mystery Man with a CRACK under the
     chin.

     White runs at the off-balance Man, head-butts him in the
     stomach.  The Man recoils, canít stop, steps off backwards into
     space, PLUMMETS INTO DARKNESS towards the street below.

     White relieved, turns, dusts himself, picks up his gun.  Looks
     down at the floor.  Broken glass and capsules everywhere  -  he
     dropped the bottle of pills during the scuffle.  Starts to pick
     them up.

     Behind him SOMETHING is rising.

     The shadowy Mystery Man is LEVITATING HIMSELF back up to the
     bell-tower.  He lands behind White, approaches, lifting his
     dagger, closer and closer.

     White glances around.

     The Man lunges, pushing White towards the shaft beneath the
     swinging bells.  White FALLS, dangles over dark space, the Man
     stands above him.

                         MYSTERY MAN (shouts)
               Do not make us hurt you...

     The bells are swinging very close to the Man.

                         MYSTERY MAN
               It will be inconvenient, yes...

     Suddenly, to Whiteís amazement, the shiny black rim of a bell
     clips the Manís head.  SLAMS it against a low wooden beam in
     the ceiling.  A splash of black liquid.  The Man slumps to the
     ground, his head crushed beyond recognition.

     White pulls himself up  -  stands over the Manís body, trying
     to decide what to do.  A MOVEMENT catches his eye.

     TIGHT ON the collapsed Manís ear  -  something moves inside.  A
     BLACK INSECT, half-dead, crawls out of his crushed head.

     White revolted, SQUASHES the insect under his shoe.


     EXT./INT.  VARIOUS  -  MONTAGE

     RAPID MOVE ACROSS MYSTERY MEN screaming.  Faces contort with
     pain.  INTERCUT WITH:

     Electricity ARCING between electrodes.

     A building against the sky.  The windows EXPLODE.  Glass blows
     out, raining down on the street.

     A concrete wall SPLITS OPEN.  Slime oozes through the crack.

     An old man, walks on a deserted street, looks up at the sky.
     One of the lenses of his spectacles CRACKS without warning.
     A chair falls over in a dark room.

     A woman under a hair-dryer gossips on a phone.  Suddenly the
     phone emits a high-pitched shriek.  Her ear spouts blood and
     she screams.

     A small transistor radio emits a high frequency and short
     circuits with a spark.


     EXT.  BUILDING

     TIGHT ON  -  a wristwatch spinning backwards rapidly  -
     completely haywire.

     INSPECTOR BUMSTEAD stands on a street corner staring blankly at
     his watch.  Taps it several times, annoyed, then looks up at a
     THREE STOREY BUILDING.  He holds a piece of paper in his other
     hand  -  on it a number rapidly scrawled:  23.

     HIS P.O.V.

     The dilapidated building  -  arched windows only on the topmost
     floor.  A faded number on the facade  -  also 23.  The windows
     light up continuously with rapid bursts of white light.

     INSIDE

     The inspector climbs a staircase, enters a dark room.

     TWO FIGURES move about.  Bumstead glances at a UNIFORMED MAN,
     standing beside a fake fire, who acknowledges his arrival.

     To the side, A POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER flashes something swinging
     back and forth, hanging from the ceiling.  It looks like...
     Fredrick.  Dead.  His arms and legs missing.  A pool of blood
     beneath the mutilated torso.

     Bumstead looks at the cop.

                         BUMSTEAD
               How long have you been here?

                         COP
               Maybe ten minutes...
                    (looks at his watch)
               Thatís strange.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Spinning backwards?

     The cop is shaking his watch, tapping it with his finger.  He
     looks up.  Bumstead indicates his own watch.

                         COP
               Yours too?

     Bumstead nods.  He removes a notebook from his pocket, walks
     about the room, glances at objects, makes notes.

     Bumstead steps over to a small RECTANGULAR HOLE in the wall.
     He examines it carefully, then bends down and puts his head
     through.  On the other side is a corridor snaking off into
     darkness.  Just beneath the hole, is a broken dish and a
     puddle.  Lying half in the puddle is the business card of
     Doctor D.P. Schreber M.D.

     Without removing his head from the hole he shouts to the nearby
     cop.

                         BUMSTEAD
               I want prints over here...

     Suddenly the door has caught Bumsteadís head in it.  He
     struggles.  The cop and the photographer run over to help.


     EXT.  BUILDING  -  NIGHT

     MOVE IN ON a doorway.  Above it a small illuminated red sign:

     DOCTOR D.P. SCHREBER M.D.

     REVERSE ANGLE ON WHITE

     He stands on the street, under the sign, rummaging in his
     wallet, obviously looking for the business card he doesnít have
     anymore.


     INT.  WAITING ROOM

     A white room, bare.  Dirt stains the walls near the air-vents.
     A NURSE is typing behind her desk.

     A THUMPING fills the room.  The nurse stands, removes her shoe
     and hits a pipe running along the wall several times.  The
     noise stops.

     The front door creaks open and White enters.  She watches him
     step into the room.

                         WHITE
               I want to see the doctor.  It's
               important.

                         NURSE
               What time was your appointment?

                         WHITE (angry)
               Look!  Tell him I'm here.  Now.

     He's leaning across her desk threateningly.

                         NURSE (scared/standing)
               Yes, certainly...  Who should I say?

                         WHITE
               No idea.  Just get him...

     Suddenly a door opens and DOCTOR SCHREBER, clutching a file of
     papers, steps out.  He freezes, stares at White.  The papers
     fall from his hands to the floor.


     INT.  DARK CHAMBER  -  NIGHT

     A group of DARK SILHOUETTES file into a concrete room.

     The MYSTERY MEN have gathered.  Like the Men who pursue White,
     they wear coats, leather gloves, dark glasses, and have near
     white skin.

     One MAN points to diagrams on a chalk board and speaks in the
     peculiar foreign tongue.

     TIGHT ON THE DIAGRAM  -  a path through the city.  A circle
     marks the point where the red line ends  -  a cathedral.  The
     Man goes into broken English  -  a guttural accent.

                         MAN 1
               It has failed.

     ANOTHER MAN stands at the rear of the room.

                         MAN 2
               This is becoming dangerous, yes!

     YET ANOTHER MAN starts to tremble violently, seized with some
     kind of convulsion.  He froths at the mouth and throws his head
     about.  A TALLER MAN standing beside him opens a silver box,
     removes a small WRITHING WORM.  He places this on the tip of
     the trembling Man's tongue, who swallows it and calms down.

                         MAN 3
               Let's get this over with.

     ANOTHER MAN rises suddenly, pushes forcefully to the front of
     the group.

                         MAN 5
               What about the dance-steps!  This is
               my responsibility, we must resolve
               this issue, yes?

     THE MEN turn to face him.  He is out of line.  He becomes
     irritated, as if to say something further, then pulls himself
     short, sits down.

                         MAN 5
               Sorry.

                         MAN 3
               The situation has changed.
                    (pacing the room)
               This one is in possession of
               knowledge...

                         MAN 1 (cuts in)
               ...to avoid influence, yes.

                         MAN 4
               A freak!

                         MAN 1
               Impossible!

     RUMBLING NOISE O.S. attracts everyone's attention.  They all
     look to a round portal high on a wall.  The noise is louder.
     several figures on stilts run past outside the opening  -  then
     the noise subsides.  The MYSTERY MEN go back to more important
     things.

                         MAN 3
               It gets interesting, yes.

                         MAN 2
               Stop this!  It has gone too far!
               Tell Mister Black!

     Man 2 stares blankly into space, he makes a peculiar clicking
     noise with his mouth, his eyes roll upwards.


     INT.  DOCTOR'S OFFICE

     THE CAMERA GLIDES down a corridor, towards a door  -  a sign
     says, DOCTOR IS:  IN.

     INSIDE

     White sits in a leather chair across from an ornate wooden
     desk.  THE DOCTOR paces up and down in front of glass jars
     containing preserved specimens.  He stops, looks at White.

                         SCHREBER
               You remember nothing?  Who you are?
               What you've done?

                         WHITE
               You know something about me?

                         SCHREBER
               Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't
               it?
                    (smiles)
               Is there nothing you remember?  Not
               even a detail?   You must try.

                         WHITE
               You think I haven't been trying!
                    (calms himself)
               It's like there was never anything
               there.
                    (pauses)
               Just water.

                         SCHREBER
               Water?

                         WHITE
               Waves...  A beach.  A woman
               whispering.  That's all.
                    (looks up, yawns)
               I need to stay awake.  Do you have
               any pills?

     The doctor walks to a glass cabinet and removes a bottle, takes
     out two green capsules.  Hands them to White.  Sits behind the
     desk again.

                         SCHREBER
               What does she say?  The woman.

                         WHITE
               Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just
               like a broken record.  Only thing is,
               I can't answer.  I've no idea what my
               name is.

                         SCHREBER
               Your name is John White.

                         WHITE
               That's what people keep telling me.

     Te doctor walks to a small sink in the corner, returns, hands
     White a glass of water.  White swallows the pills.

                         SCHREBER  (indicates pills)
               And what's this about?  Why?

     White stands up, starts to pace nervously.

                         SCHREBER
               Bad dreams?

                         WHITE
               Yes.

                         SCHREBER
               Tell me about them...

                         WHITE (interrupts)
               Yeah well, why don't I ask some
               questions for a change.

                         SCHREBER
               If you like.

                         WHITE
               You're supposed to be my doctor,
               right?

                         SCHREBER
               That's right.  I am your doctor.

     White is very agitated now, his voice is getting edgy.

                         WHITE
               Known me for long?

                        SCHREBER
               Well...

                         WHITE (cuts in)
               Am I a killer?

                         SCHREBER
               I cannot say...  You don't know the
               answer to that?

                         WHITE
               I told you, I can't remember a thing!

     White reaches across abruptly, GRABS the doctor.

                         WHITE  (angry now  -  shouting)
               Look, you know something about me,
               out with it!  Let's end this
               bullshit!  I want answers!

     The doctor is obviously scared.

                         SCHREBER
               We won't get anywhere like this.
               Please.  Let's take things in easy
               steps...


     INT.  BUMSTEAD'S APARTMENT/KITCHEN  -  NIGHT

     TIGHT ON DRAWING PINS  -  Being pushed into a map.  A seeming
     random pattern across the terrain of the city.  Each pin is
     labelled:  VICTIM 1, VICTIM 2,...  etc.

     WIDER ON BUMSTEAD

     He's tired, like he hasn't slept.  He's looking at the map
     stuck to a wall.  There's several neat piles of folders on the
     kitchen table in front of him.  The kitchen itself is
     incredibly neat  -  everything completely organized.

     Bumstead shakes his head slowly, turns away from the board.
     Picks up a cup of hot tea, pours milk into it from a small jar.

     TIGHT ON THE TEA CUP  -  Cream SWIRLS into a rapidly dissolving
     spiral.  Bumstead looks up.  Puts down the cup hurriedly, turns
     back to the map.

     With a thick pen he traces a line between each point marking
     the location of the victims.  He steps back to examine his
     handiwork.

     A SPIRAL  -  moving outwards.  Beyond the last victim it
     becomes a dotted line, following the same trajectory but with a
     big question mark beside it.

     Bumstead glances over to a blackboard with a list of names and
     addresses on it.  He holds up the doctor's card and stares at
     it.  He turns it over, notices an address on the back.


     INT.  DOCTOR SCHREBER'S OFFICE  -  NIGHT

     SCHREBER is showing WHITE a series of CHARTS.  The doctor seems
     nervous about White's potential for further violence.

                         SCHREBER
               Put simply...  a penetration of the
               left parieto-occipital area of the
               cranium...  complicated by
               inflammation that resulted in
               adhesions of the brain to the
               meninges.  Without going into
               detail...  the formation of scar
               tissue altered the configuration of
               the lateral ventricles, producing
               incipient atrophy of the medulla...

                         WHITE (cuts in)
               Look.  It was a simple question.  Can
               someone kill and not remember it?

                         SCHREBER (smiles)
               I'm sorry.  I get carried away
               sometimes.  Possible?  I'm...  ah,
               afraid so.

                         WHITE
               Did she drown?  The woman you told me
               about?

                         SCHREBER
               Not exactly.  She was found in a
               canal, disembowelled.  Throat cut.
               Blood drained.  The body wrapped in a
               bed-sheet.

     White shakes his head, looking blankly at the doctor.

                         WHITE
               Horrible...

                         SCHREBER
               You remember nothing, eh?
                    (shakes his head)
               Let me show you something.

     Schreber turns, points to DOUBLE-DOORS.  He walks towards
     these.  White follows.

                         SCHREBER
               Formation of memories is the most
               important of brain functions.

     THE DOORS ARE OPENED

     They step into a room of living animal experiments.

                         SCHREBER
               We are little more than a sum of
               memories.  From them we reference who
               we are, where we're going.  Without a
               past we are nothing.  This is why you
               are so interesting.

                         WHITE
               I'm nothing then.

                         SCHREBER
               Anything but, my friend.

     The two men look down on a monkey with the top of its head
     missing, squirming in a mechanical device that restricts its
     movements.

                         SCHREBER
               It feels no pain.

     White turns and starts to pace away.  Schreber reluctantly
     follows.

                         WHITE
               Can I get my life back?

                         SCHREBER
               Maybe.

     Schreber points dramatically at a wooden structure containing
     two rats.

                         SCHREBER
               We know of two kinds of memory.
               Firstly, declarative memory.

     The rats perform various activities involving mazes and
     geometric symbols.  Schreber turns to look at White, eyebrow
     raised.

                         SCHREBER
               And then there is procedural memory.

     TIGHT ON HIS SLENDER FINGER  -  pointing to a machine also run
     by rats.  The object is to make it through a guillotine device.
     One rat is successful, the other is chopped neatly in two.

                         SCHREBER
               Follow?

     White nods.

                         SCHREBER
               Research on simple animals can be...
               useful.  To show us where memory
               storing systems are located, for
               example.  I am building an experiment
               with hamsters next.
                    (looks at nearby cage
                    of hamsters)
               Cute little things.

     Schreber puts a hand on White's shoulder.

                         SCHREBER
               Listen to me talk!  You must be
               hungry.

     White nods again, extremely troubled.


     INT.  HALL-WAY (DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE)

     Schreber's office is an annex of his living quarters  -  a
     maze-like series of rooms and halls.  White is led down a dark
     hall by Schreber, clutching a candle.

                         SCHREBER
               Whole damn wing lost power.  Wiring's
               old.  Keep meaning to get it fixed.
               Here we are.

     They've stopped outside a flaking door.


     INT.  KITCHEN

     A small eat-in kitchen.  Dirty and run-down.  White, sits at a
     bench, as Schreber removes items from the refrigerator.  The
     doctor holds up a large FROZEN fish.

                         SCHREBER
               Ah.  Beautiful!  Head and all!  Just
               how I like 'em!

     ANGLE ON FRYING PAN ON STOVE  -  The fish lands in it and starts
     to sizzle furiously.

     ANGLE ON WHITE

                         WHITE
               I'm sorry.  About before.

                         SCHREBER
               I don't blame you for getting angry.
               You are in a frustrating situation.
               You must be patient though.  Trust me
               completely.  I'm here to help.

     A set of swinging doors on the other side of the room open
     slightly and THE NURSE looks in.

                         NURSE (to Schreber)
               I have to talk to you.

                         SCHREBER
               It can't wait?

     She shakes her head, with a serious expression, then darts out
     again.

                         SCHREBER  (to White)
               Excuse me.  Ah, make yourself at
               home.

     He leaves.

     Alone, White looks around the bleak room.  He takes off his
     coat and sits down again.  He removes the FISH.  The eye opens.
     The creature looks up at him.  It breaths painfully.

                         WHITE
               Still kicking, huh?

     He puts it back in his pocket.

     The OTHER fish is spattering oil everywhere.  Smoke starts to
     fill the room.  White, steps over and looks at the frying pan.
     The fish is turning black.  He turns the heat down.

     He notices a SMALL HOLE in the wall.  At eye height.  He steps
     across, looks through.

     TIGHT ON WHITE'S eye through the hole.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A dark room.  Shadows on the wall.  Something wet, some kind of
     ANIMAL, moving in the darkness.  He can hear breathing and
     whispering voices.

     White's eyes start to blur, he rubs them.

                         SCHREBER O.S.
               How are things in here?

     White spins, like he's caught doing something wrong.  The
     Doctor walks across to the stove, prods the frying fish with a
     fork.

                         SCHREBER
               Ah, nearly done.  So tell me about
               your dreams.  I'm very interested.

     White is having a hard time focusing.

                         WHITE
               Just the typical fabrications of a
               distorted mind.  You know, chased by
               mysterious men in black, that kind of
               thing...

     WHITE'S P.O.V.  -  ANGLE ON Schreber with his back turned, at
     the stove.  THE IMAGE is blurring.

                         SCHREBER
               Ah, our friends in black...  they are
               not just a figment of your
               imagination you know, in fact none of
               what you are experiencing is anything
               but real.

     Smoke rises thickly around the doctor.

                         SCHREBER
               I know everything about you.  You
               have no choice but to trust me.

     Flames are shooting up around Schreber from the frying pan.
     His arms catch fire, and he suddenly spins around clutching
     flaming daggers in both hands, his whole body engulfed in fire,
     his face charred, black flesh hanging off his skull.

                         SCHREBER
               Scarey, isn't it?

     White startles awake.

     Schreber stands at the stove looking at White.  Everything is
     normal.

                         SCHREBER
               Are you feeling alright?

     White stands awkwardly, pulls his coat on.

                         SCHREBER
               What are you doing?

                         WHITE
               I have to go...

                         SCHREBER
               You can't go yet.  We've got so much
               to talk about...

     Suddenly White feels feint  -  leans against the wall to steady
     himself.

                         SCHREBER
               You're tired.  You need to lie down.

     ON WHITE  -  swaying.

                         WHITE
               Those pills...

     HIS P.O.V.

     The scene is distorted  -  like looking through water.  Things
     start SPINNING.

                         SCHREBER (echoic)
               Yes.  A little something to help you
               relax.  Harmless...

     A tile floor RISES rapidly TOWARDS CAMERA.

                                              CUT TO:

     GREY LIMBO

     Objects float underwater.  They rise upwards amidst bubbles,
     break the surface.  A storm at sea  -  dismembered BODY PARTS
     float all the way to the horizon.

     TWO FOETUSES in separate jars are talking to each other through
     the glass.

                         FOETUS 1
               This is madness.  If we're caught...

                         FOETUS 2
               Shut-up.  Help me with these
               straps...


     INT.  EXAMINATION ROOM

     WHITE wakes strapped to an exantination table.  SCHREBER and the
     NURSE loom above him.  The nurse hands Schreber a long, chrome
     SYRINGE.  The doctor moves towards White.

                         SCHREBER (holds syringe up)
               Now you must relax, Anton.

     A DOOR-BELL RINGS O.S. The nurse makes for the door.

                         SCHREBER
               Leave it!

     He's tapping the side of the syringe, squirting out air
     bubbles.  THE DOOR-BELL RINGS again  -  very insistent.
     Schreber looks at the nurse, annoyed.

                         SCHREBER
               Damn!  Whoever it is  -  get rid of
               them!

     She heads to the door  -  turns back.

                         NURSE
               Keys.

     Schreber puts the syringe down, fumbles in his pocket, pulls
     out a huge collection of KEYS on a ring, walks to the nurse,
     hands them to her.

     White manages to wriggle a hand free from the leather strap
     holding him.  The nurse leaves, the doctor shuts the door,
     locks it.  He steps over to White.

                         SCHREBER
               I'm sorry I had to put you through
               this, Anton.
                    (lowers syringe to
                    White's forehead)
               There will be some pain, but things
               will be easier this way.

     White lashes out, PUNCHES the doctor in the face.  His glasses
     go flying, and he falls to the floor, blinded, scrambling for
     the spectacles.

     A convenient scalpel cuts White from his remaining bonds.  He
     undoes the last strap around his ankles as the doctor replaces
     his glasses and leaps at him trying to drive the syringe INTO
     WHITE'S FOREHEAD.

     The struggle continues  -  each man tries to turn the syringe
     on the other.  White pushes the doctor, who falls backwards.
     Schreber leaps onto him, both fall against a tray of medical
     instruments.

     A loud THUMPING on the examination room door.  White is grabbed
     from behind, pinned down with the syringe INCHES from his face.

     A CRASH O.S.  Splintering wood.  The door bursts open.

     A ROTUND SILHOUETTE  -  is revealed, clutching a police
     special, flashing a badge.  A squeaky, over-excited, voice:

                         BUMSTEAD
               Hold it!

     Schreber and White FREEZE in mid-struggle, look at the
     inspector.  Behind him, the nurse appears in the hallway.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Police.  Nobody move.

                         SCHREBER
               He tried to kill me!

                         BUMSTEAD
               Shut up!  Everybody stay calm...

     Bumstead steps into the light, shoves his gun in White's face,
     handcuffs him.  Bumstead searches White, finds the revolver,
     takes this.  Also takes his wallet.  He glances at the doctor,
     who hides the syringe behind his back.

                         BUMSTEAD (to Doctor)
               You Schreber?

     Schreber nods blankly.

     Bumstead runs his hand over White's side pocket  -  feels
     something.

                         BUMSTEAD
               What's that?

     White says nothing.  The inspector opens the pocket and looks
     in.

                         BUMSTEAD (disgusted)
               A fish, huh?


     EXT.  CITY STREETS  -  NIGHT

     An old-fashioned BLACK SEDAN drives over a rusty suspension
     bridge.  Stone gargoyles look down at the lone vehicle.  It's
     been raining.  Streets are empty.

     INSIDE THE CAR

     WHITE and the INSPECTOR drive silently.  Bumstead has appointed
     his un-marked police vehicle with all the comforts of home.
     Hot thermos.  Note pad holder, complete with light.  Coat
     hanger.  Gun rack.  A system for everything.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Dammit!
                    (glances at his
                    watch)
               I'm curious?  How many so far?

     He shakes his watch, puts it to his ear.

                         WHITE (confused)
               What?  I...

                         BUMSTEAD (counts on fingers)
               Let's see, there's the little guy
               with no arms or legs.  And the young
               boy?

                         WHITE (disturbed)
               Young boy?

     CLOSE ON WHITE  -  frightened now.

                         BUMSTEAD
               The six year old.  Sure, you
               remember.

     Bumstead pulls something from under the dashboard.  A SANDWICH,
     carefully wrapped and prepared.  After glancing at his watch
     again, he bites into it.

                         BUMSTEAD (chewing)
               Y'know, the kid you left in the meat
               packing plant, cut into pieces.
               Packed into brown paper parcels,
               wrapped in twine, that kind of thing.

     No answer.

                         BUMSTEAD
               You sure have demonstrated a great
               deal of...  imagination.  The baby
               was the best though.  Several cops
               lost their lunch over that one.  Head
               twisted off, spine pulled out,
               yeech...

                         WHITE (cuts in)
               Stop it.  You're making me sick...

                         BUMSTEAD
               We count seven so far.  Anyone we
               missed?

     RADIO CRACKLE O.S.  -  A tinny voice cuts in.

                         VOICE
               Inspector Bumstead...  Inspector...

     Bumstead picks up a microphone, speaks into it.

                         BUMSTEAD
               What is it, Crenshaw?

                         CRENSHAW
               Just reminding you...  your eight pee
               em...

                         BUMSTEAD
               Dammit.
                    (looks at watch)
               Very efficient, as usual, Crenshaw.
               Remind me to give you my watch.  It
               needs fixing.

                         CRENSHAW
               Yes sir.

     Bumstead replaces the microphone under the dashboard, takes a
     SHARP CORNER as he finishes off the sandwich.

                         WHITE
               Where are we going?

                         BUMSTEAD
               Shut-up.

     Burastead pulls out a small brush, cleans the fallen crumbs from
     his trousers, keeping a hand on the wheel.

     White is silent  -  his wounds continue to bother him.  He
     leans down to scratch through his trousers.

                         WHITE (quietly)
               Shit!

                         BUMSTEAD
               Gesundheit!

                         WHITE (looks up)
               I didn't sneeze.


     EXT.  HOSPITAL ENTRANCE  -  NIGHT

     The INSPECTOR's car pulls up and stops.

     INSIDE THE CAR

                         WHITE
               What are we doing here?

     Bumstead grabs a bunch of flowers off the back seat.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Get out.


     INT.  HOSPITAL  -  NIGHT

     BUMSTEAD pushes the handcuffed WHITE through a swinging metal
     door.  They enter a sterile air-conditioned room.  An
     effeminate MALE NURSE sits behind a glassed-in counter.
     Directly opposite is a small WAITING ROOM through a glass
     panelled door.  Bumstead pushes White into this room.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Wait here.

     The inspector shuts the door behind him.  White looks about the
     blank room, takes a seat.  He can see Bumstead, through the
     glass panel in the door, walk up to the male nurse opposite.

     OUT IN THE CORRIDOR

     The inspector talks to the male nurse through a tiny opening in
     the window.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Bumstead.  I'm here to see my mother.

     BACK TO WHITE

     He cannot hear anything of what Bumstead is saying.  He sees
     him take out his wallet and show his badge.  The male nurse is
     concerned, looks over towards White, then opens a drawer, hands
     Bumstead a KEY.  The inspector steps back to the waiting room
     door and LOCKS IT from the outside.  He looks at White for a
     moment, then walks away, along the corridor.


     INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM

     Bumstead enters darkness  -  pneumatic MACHINE NOISE fills the
     gloom.  He walks quietly to his mother, encased in a metallic
     contraption, something like an iron lung.

                         BUMSTEAD (whisper)
               Brought you these.

     He places flowers on the bedside table.  His mother just stares
     expressionless into space, in a coma.  He sits on a metal
     chair, looks at the woman.  Her life-sustaining machines hiss
     and breathe.


     INT.  POLICE STATION

     A FINGER presses down on the sticky surface of a page.  It
     pulls away revealing an inky finger-print.

     WIDER

     White is standing in a bare room, in front of a finger-printing
     machine.  He's alone.  A blast of electrical FEED-BACK.  White
     looks up at a speaker mounted to the wall.

                         MECHANICAL VOICE  (through speaker)
               Move  -  forward.

     White follows a painted line on the floor, stands against a
     wall, in front of an old-fashioned camera.  A slot opens in the
     wall behind him, mechanical arms spring forward, restrain him,
     one arm holds a sign with a number in front of him.  A flash
     goes off, the click of a shutter.

                         MECHANICAL VOICE
               Left  -  profile.

     A claw lowers from the ceiling, grips White's head, turns it
     abruptly  -  the camera fires.

                         MECHANICAL VOICE
               Right  -  profile.

     The claw turns his head the other way.  The camera fires again.

                         MECHANICAL VOICE
               Move  -  forward.

     Across the room A BUZZER SOUNDS, a red light flashes above a
     door.  White is released by the mechanical hands, walks over,
     opens the door and steps into darkness.

     LIGHTS COME ON  -  extremely bright.  A room for line-ups  -
     markings on the white wall behind White indicate varying
     heights, a darkened window faces him.  He is obviously to be
     identified by an unseen person.

     A buzzer sounds again, a light indicates another door.

                         VOICE
               Move  -  forward.

     White moves into another room.  A chair faces a large wheel
     painted in a black and white spiral.  He sits down  -  the
     wheel turns, faster and faster.

                         VOICE
               Watch  -  the  - wheel.

     The wheel stops after several seconds.

                         VOICE
               Move  -  forward.

     The next room is full of scientific equipment.

                         VOICE
               Stand  -  behind  -  the  -  screen.

     White sees a metal-frame X-ray machine  -  he steps across to
     it.  The screen lights up, filling the room with a green glow.
     We can see the shape of his skeleton.  Where his pocket would
     be, is the tiny skeleton of the fish.

                         VOICE
               Move  -  forward.

     The next room is empty.

                         VOICE
               Face  -  the  - wall.

     White turns.  As soon as he has done this hears a door open
     behind him.  FOOTSTEPS approach.  Blows rain down on him, fists,
     boots, clubs.  He slides to the floor.  The lights go out.


     INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM

     LIGHTS come on again.  White is dazed  -  in a chair, a bright
     light in his face blinds him.

                         VOICE
               What's your name?

                         WHITE  (squints into light)
               I don't remember.

                         VOICE
               Oh, no?

     White shakes his head slowly and looks at the floor.  The light
     is angled away, pointed down towards A TABLE.  White can see
     now.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A featureless room.  STROMBOLI stands over him, behind him is
     BUMSTEAD and two shadowy guards.  Bumstead picks up an
     envelope, removes a SERIES OF PHOTOS, hands these to Stromboli.

                         STROMBOLI
               John...

     He throws the first shot down on the table in front of White.
     A black and white police photo of a murder victim.

                         STROMBOLI
               ...Murderer.

     Another photo goes down.  Another victim.  Another and another.
     Each more grisly than the last.

                         STROMBOLI
               You'll sign a confession?

     White nods.  He's looks utterly lost.

     Bumstead steps across to a small speaker box on the wall near
     the only door, presses a button.

                         BUMSTEAD (into speaker)
               Okay.

     TWO GUARDS immediately step through the door, GRAB White by his
     arms.  They carry him off.


     INT.  PRISON CELL

     White is woken by a UNIFORMED GUARD shining a light in his
     eyes.

                         GUARD
               Visitor.


     INT.  VISITING ROOM

     White is led into an empty pale green room with a glass barrier
     down the middle.  The guard tells him to sit and wait.

     The door on the other side of the barrier opens with a squeak  -
     DOCTOR SCHREBER steps in, looking frightened.

                         WHITE  (to guard)
               Keep him away:  He's insane.

     The guard just smiles, looks at the doctor knowingly.

                         SCHREBER
               Please, stay calm.

                         WHITE  (to guard)
               This man wants to kill me.

     The guard remains indifferent.

                         SCHREBER  (to guard)
               Just one of his many delusions  -
               it's nothing.
                    (a whisper to White)
               Shut up!  Listen, damn you!  This is
               a fortunate coincidence  -  we won't
               get another chance like this.  Listen
               to me.

                         WHITE  (turns to Doctor)
               What do you want?

                         SCHREBER
               You're innocent...
                    (still a whisper)
               You didn't kill anyone.

                         WHITE  (sarcastic)
               What am I doing in here then?

                         SCHREBER
               Listen to what I have to say.  Decide
               for yourself.

     AN ADJOINING ROOM

     The dark silhouettes of BUMSTEAD and ANOTHER COP watch from
     behind a two-way mirror.

                         BUMSTEAD
               What's he doing here?

                         COP
               Says he is the man's doctor...
                    (taps side of his
                    head)
               You know...

                         BUMSTEAD
               I know it's his doctor...
                    (into intercom)
               I need the file on..
                    (reads clip-board)
               Daniel Paul Schreber M.D.

                         MISS CRENSHAW'S VOICE O.S.
               Schreber.  Yes.  Isn't that his
               doctor?

                         BUMSTEAD (evenly)
               Yes.
                    (beat)
               And it's SCHREBER  -  with an 'h'.

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Yes.  An "h".

     The inspector looks up from the speaker.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  THROUGH THE MIRROR, White seems to have calmed
     down.

     BACK IN THE VISITING ROOM

                         SCHREBER
               The men in black  -  they're the
               killers.

     White stands abruptly, pushes himself against the glass.

                         WHITE
               You're a liar!

                         SCHREBER
               No, it's the truth.

                         WHITE
               So you're telling me the truth this
               time?  Is that it!

     The doctor removes a SMALL SYRINGE from his black bag, places
     it on the table in front of the glass, blocks it from the
     guard's view.

                         SCHREBER
               If you would only take this, inject
               it in your brain, everything would be
               much clearer.

                         WHITE
               Not that again...

                         SCHREBER
               Everyone get's one  -  very much like
               this...
                    (points to syringe)
               But this one's special.  It will help
               you understand, everything...

                         WHITE (cuts in)
               I'm not injecting anything into my
               brain.

                         SCHREBER
               Anton  -  I mean, John, there
               has been an experiment, a dangerous
               experiment.  I arranged it.  It was a
               lie from the beginning.  It almost
               worked, but things did not go as they
               should have.  You have been left  -
               blank.

     Schreber waves frantically at the air surrounding him.

                         SCHREBER
               You can change this, all this.
                    (points at syringe
                    again)
               But you must take it.

     White stares blankly at him for a moment, then:

                         WHITE
               You've been working too hard.

                         SCHREBER
               Please!  Don't be foolish!  Time is
               short.  Let me show you something.
               Look at this syringe.

                         WHITE
               Why?

                         SCHREBER
               Don't ask stupid questions.  Look at
               it.

     White reluctantly does this.

                         SCHREBER
               Concentrate.  Imagine the syringe
               rising.  Picture it floating above the
               table.

     TIGHT ON WHITE

                         SCHREBER
               Do it!

     WHITE'S P.O.V.

     The syringe starts to vibrate, actually RISES INTO THE AIR  -
     floats stationary between White and Schreber.

                         WHITE
               It's a trick.

                         SCHREBER
               No it isn't.  You are doing it!  Now
               raise it over the glass and...

     Suddenly the syringe spins towards the doctor, IMPALES itself
     in his shoulder.  He yelps, grabs it.

                         WHITE
               Oh, sorry...

     The doctor pulls out the syringe, is about to say more when a
     BUZZER SOUNDS.

                         MECHANICAL VOICE
               Your  -  time  -  is  -  up.

     Schreber looks to where the voice came from  -  a speaker above
     their heads.

                         SCHREBER (looks at White)
               I gave you your chance, now it's too
               late.  They'll learn you are here
               soon.  It's all over.


     INT.  POLICE STATION CORRIDOR

     DOCTOR SCHREBER paces towards the exit.  BUMSTEAD steps in
     front of him.  The doctor is startled.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Doctor!  What brings you here?

                         SCHREBER
               Just visiting my patient.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Really?  And how is his state of
               mind?

                         SCHREBER
               He's seriously disturbed...

     The doctor is nervous, glancing about.

                         BUMSTEAD
               You seem a little edgy.  Everything
               okay?

                         SCHREBER
               Yes, of course.  Everything's fine...

     He tries to push past.  Bumstead grabs his arm.

                         BUMSTEAD
               To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've
               run into each other like this.  Maybe
               you can help me tidy some loose ends.

                         SCHREBER
               Loose ends?

     SCHREBER looks like a trapped animal, when:

                         VOICE O.S.
               Bumstead!

     Bumasead turns to look down the corridor.  He sees STROMBOLI
     peaking out of his office door.

                         STROMBOLI
               I need to speak to you.  Immediately.

     The door shuts again.  Bumstead turns back.  The doctor is GONE
     -  the corridor empty.


     INT.  HOLDING CELL

     White is staring through a glass door at A COP.  A KETTLE
     WHISTLES O.S.  The cop gets up and moves off.

     White looks up.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A small WINDOW, high up on the wall.  Impossible to get to,
     even if his hands weren't cuffed.  Nothing he can do  -  he
     looks at a clock on a wall.

     PUSH IN on the clock  -  TICKING GETS LOUDER.


     INT.  POLICE STATION

     BUMSTEAD enters STROMBOLI'S office.  A nervous CHIEF-INSPECTOR
     is flanked by TWO STRANGE-LOOKING MEN in ill-fitting brown
     suits.

                         STROMBOLI
               Bumstead, these...  er, gentlemen are
               here to collect White.

     Bumstead suspiciously eyes the two men, beside STROMBOLI'S
     desk.

                         BUMSTEAD  (to men)
               Who are you?

                         STROMBOLI (even more nervous)
               Please, Bumstead.  Co-operate  -
               it's easier.

                         BUMSTEAD
               This is highly irregular.  I have a
               right to know.

                         MAN 1
               We are from a mental asylum.

     He notices that this man's moustache is LOP-SIDED.  The other
     man wears spectacles WITH NO LENSES in the frames, clutches an
     un-lit pipe in his teeth.

                         STROMBOLI
               Yes.  That's right.  He's ill  -  he
               needs expert help.

                         BUMSTEAD
               I see...

                         MAN 1
               Yes, Inspector.  Has he been
               displaying any strange...  behaviour?

                         BUMSTEAD
               He's been a little angel...

                         STROMBOLI
               If you could show them to the holding
               cell now.

     SLOW MOVE IN on Bumstead's face.

     IN THE CORRIDOR

     Bumstead and the MYSTERY MEN walk towards the holding cell.
     Bumstead glances up through the glass in the door before he
     enters.  IT'S EMPTY.

     He fumbles furiously for the key in his pocket  -  BURSTS into
     the room.  White is gone.  But where?  Bumstead throws a look
     back TO THE FRONT DESK.

                         MAN 1
               Where is he?

     The cop is just returning, holding a cup of coffee.  He looks
     at the inspector, sees the room is empty.  A nervous twitch
     knocks the cup from the cop's hands.

     TIGHT ON THE CUP  -  smashing on the floor.


     INT.  SUBWAY STATION  -  NIGHT

     Underground.  CONSTANT NOISE O.S. of trains arriving and
     departing but none are seen.

     CAMERA MOVES PAST broken tiles on a wall to REVEAL:  WHITE  -
     sitting amidst rubbish on the ground, looking around, confused,
     groggy from sleep.  He looks down at his hands, unsuccessfully
     tries to free them from the cuffs.

     MOVE IN TIGHT ON WHITE

     He starts to cry.  He puts his head in his hands, his body
     spasms with each sob.

     SEVERAL ANGLES of the empty corridors of the subway.  White's
     crying is heard  -  echoic.

     BACK ON WHITE  -  A small feminine HAND touches his head.

     Startled, he throws himself back, like he's about to be
     attacked.

     THE BEAUTIFUL JAPANESE WOMAN from the church looks down at him.


     INT.  POLICE STATION

     BUMSTEAD and the COP are getting grilled by STROMBOLI.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Yes, sir.  I'm sorry...  But I don't
               understand how it was possible.  The
               only window was twenty feet up a
               vertical wall, he was cuffed...

                         STROMBOLI
                    (shouts at cringing
                    COP)
               How could you have been so stupid?
 
                         COP
               I'm sorry, sir.

                         STROMBOLI
               Alright, get out.

     Bumstead gets up and leaves.

                         STROMBOLI
               You stay.

     The cop hustles out, shuts the door.

                         STROMBOLI
               Bumstead, you're starting to annoy
               me.  This case is very important to
               me.  Just a little warning:  I've got
               my eye on you inspector, remember
               that.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Yes, sir.

     He leaves.


     INT.  APARTMENT BUILDING

     White, awkwardly trying to hide his cuffed hands in his coat,
     follows the JAPANESE WOMAN up a flight of dark stairs.  she
     keeps looking back at him, smiling but SAYS NOTHING.


     INT.  APARTMENT

     White and the woman step into a run-down apartment.  She points
     to a couch.  White looks uncomfortable.  She smiles again, then
     turns on the radio.  MUSIC.

     She steps into an adjoining bedroom, leaving White alone.  He
     gets up and starts to tune the radio.  A babble of fragments of
     voices and music, then:  A NEWS REPORT...

                         NEWS READER O.S.
               ...earlier this evening it was
               reported a man fitting his
               description had been apprehended.

     White listens nervously.

                         NEWS READER O.S.
               ...and now for a message from LUMP-O
               food products...

     Across the room he can see the woman's bedroom door ajar.  He
     crosses to the doorway and looks in.  The woman stands naked
     against a deep red wall, her back turned.  She has an elaborate
     TATTOO on her back  -  looks like an INSECT.  She puts on a
     dressing gown and TURNS SUDDENLY.

     White steps back before she notices him, he goes back to the
     couch.

     She steps from the doorway holding a BAR OF SOAP in her hand.
     She sits down beside White and takes his hands, gently
     lathering soap around the handcuffs, continuing to smile at
     him.  White looks down.

     His hands seem to have SHRUNK  -  they poke out of his sleeves
     like tiny children's limbs.  The cuffs effortlessly slip off.

     White looks at the woman, then back at his hands  -  NOTHING
     STRANGE, they are normal size, but somehow the cuffs have been
     removed.  He looks at the woman again, grateful.  He can't help
     smiling.

     HIS P.O.V.

     Her eyes.  Her lips.  Her neck.  She leans forward, goes OUT OF
     FOCUS.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     She touches her tongue to his lips.  Kisses his face.  She
     pushes him back on the couch and pulls her dressing gown open.
     White does not respond  -  seems uncertain.  She sits upright,
     astride his body, unbuckles his belt, opens his shirt, caresses
     his chest.  She stops, her face in shadow.

     Slowly, White lifts his hands to her breasts, touches them.
     She starts to breath deeply.

     OUT OF FOCUS  -  their bodies entangle, begin to move
     rhythmically.  The CAMERA TRACKS SIDEWAYS, REVEALS a microphone
     behind a chair, leads us to a mirror on a wall.  On the other
     side of the one-way glass a reel-to-reel tape recorder is
     picking up the SOUNDS OF HEAVY BREATHING.

     OUTSIDE

     The building the lovers are in SLOWLY RISES into the air, past
     taller buildings and floats out over the city.  Its shadow
     moves past empty plazas and across faces of grey towers.

     INSIDE

     White sleeps, as buildings move past outside the window.  He
     opens his eyes, FORCES himself awake.  Looks across the dark
     room.

     The JAPANESE WOMAN stands naked at the window, clutching a
     large red megaphone.  IN PERFECT ENGLISH she shouts down at the
     streets drifting past.

                         JAPANESE WOMAN
               He's up here!  He raped me!  Hurry!
               Before he kills again!

     OUTSIDE

     MYSTERY MEN stand on roof-tops, watching the building drift
     past.

     BACK IN THE ROOM

     White runs to the window, GRABS the woman.  As they struggle,
     the building is landing softly in another part of the city.

     LONG SHADOWS move towards the entrance...

     WHITE WAKES UP AGAIN  -  finds he is still on the couch.  NO
     SIGN of the woman.  Then he notices her standing by the window
     (minus megaphone).  The wind pulls at her black hair.  A
     distant SIREN O.S.

     He gets up, walks over, stands beside her, looks out at the
     dark city.  She ignores him, goes back to the couch, turns on a
     table-lamp, puts her hands before the lit bulb, casts animal
     shadows on the wall.

     White watches her.  He walks across and sits next to her.  She
     points to herself.

                         WOMAN  (a whisper)
               Sachiko.

     He nods slowly, looks at her.  She waits for him to respond
     with his name.  He shrugs, remains silent.  Then he puts his
     hands in the light, makes his own animal shadow.

                         WHITE
               That's me.  I'm a shadow.

     She smiles at the shadows.

                         WHITE
               Do I look like a murderer to you?

     She just keeps smiling, not understanding.  Kisses him. He
     notices an old phone on a corner table, removes the note again
     and rings the same number.  This time, after several rings the
     call is answered.

                         WOMAN'S VOICE O.S.
               Yes?...  Who is this?...  Who's
               there?...

     White remains silent.  Sachiko stands and leaves the room.

                         WOMAN'S VOICE O.S.
               John?  Is that you?

                         WHITE
               Who is this?  What do you know about
               me?

     In the darkness of a doorway Sachiko hesitates momentarily.
     She slides a hand into White's coat, removes the wallet.  She
     takes out some cash, puts the wallet back, then she MOVES OFF.


     EXT.  STREET  -  NIGHT

     BUMSTEAD pulls up in his car.  Across the street is DOCTOR
     SCHREBER'S surgery.

     He is about to get out of the car, when the SURGERY DOOR OPENS
     and A FIGURE steps into the street.  Bumstead watches the
     shadowy man for a moment.  Then gets out and FOLLOWS, assuming
     it is Schreber.

     ALLEYWAY

     Bumstead follows inconspicuously.  Without warning, the figure
     stops and TURNS.  Bumstead backs into a doorway to hide.  He
     gets a glimpse of the gaunt features of a MYSTERY MAN in the
     dim light of the alley.

     When Bumstead steps into the alley again there is no sign of
     the Man  -  like he disappeared into thin air.  A SHADOW
     crosses the wall beside Bumstead.  He spins, looking around
     behind him.  Then he looks up into the air.

     HIS P.O.V.

     The shadow of a LEVITATING FIGURE crosses the face of a
     building.


     INT.  APARTMENT BUILDING PASSAGEWAY  -  NIGHT

     SOUND OF A WOMAN SOBBING O.S.  A wet dog sits in a corner
     gnawing a bone.  A crackly voice recites a list of names from a
     small speaker-box mounted to a wall.  A TREMBLING FINGER
     presses a door buzzer.

     SACHIKO, opens the door and looks out.

     ANGLE ON  -  A STRANGE WOMAN in the dark corridor adjusting her
     hair nervously.  She pushes past the Japanese woman, into the
     room.

     INSIDE

                         WOMAN
               John.

     WHITE stands inside the room, looking at the woman,
     expressionless. The woman suddenly leaps forward, grabs him,
     kisses him passionately.

     White tries to push her away, but she takes his hand, pulls it
     inside her dress, makes him touch her breasts.  He pushes
     harder, she trips on a chair, falls to the floor.  She starts
     to cry.


     EXT.  APARTMENT BUILDING FACADE

     The CAMERA MOVES past flaking bricks  -  to a window.  Behind
     the glass WHITE and SACHIKO sit across from the WOMAN who
     attacked White.  She is talking, though nothing can be heard,
     drying her eyes with a handkerchief.

     INSIDE

     The strange woman looks at White intently between sobs.

                         WOMAN
               Please believe me.  It's me, John.
               Your WIFE.  I wouldn't lie to you.
               You told me I could come and see you
               -  now you want to just send me away
               again...

     White looks AT THE FLOOR.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  a crack in the floorboards  -  movement
     underneath.

                         WHITE
               I thought it would make more sense.
               I'm getting the pieces, but when I
               put it together it feels like...
               Like you're telling me about somebody
               else's life...

                         WIFE
               It's the truth...  I need you.  I
               know you're innocent.

                         WHITE
               How do you know I'm innocent?

                         WIFE
               Of course you are.  You couldn't do
               those terrible things.  Come home with
               me  -  maybe things will make sense
               then...

                         WHITE
               I can't do that.  It's dangerous.
               What about my parents?  Do you know
               where I can find them?

                         WIFE
               They're dead, John.

     He stands and walks to the window  -  looks out at the city.

                         WIFE
               You have an uncle.  You were very
               close.

     She fumbles in her handbag, pulls out a notebook, scribbles
     something on a piece of paper, hands it to White.

                         WIFE
               This is where he lives. I'm sure he
               would like to see you.

                         WHITE (taking paper)
               Thanks.

                         WIFE (looks at him for a beat)
               Don't you want me?   My body?
               Remember how my skin feels?  Touch
               it.  I...

     She notices Sachiko  -  becomes self-conscious.  Sachiko
     silently stands and leaves the room.  The wife puts her face in
     her hands, overcome with tears.

                         WHITE
               What's your name?

                         WIFE  (looks up  -  still sobbing)
               Elizabeth.

     White removes the torn fragment of the photograph he has in his
     wallet, holds the black and white eye up to her face  -  it
     matches.

                         WHITE  (thoughtful)
               Yes...

     In the darkness of a doorway Sachiko watches the couple.  She
     MOVES OFF.

                         ELIZABETH
               I want to help...

                         WHITE
               Alright.  Here...

     He pulls the postcard from his wallet, holds it up so the woman
     can see it.

                         WHITE
               Know this place?

     She looks at the card.

                         ELIZABETH  (stops crying)
               Of course.  Your home town  -  where
               you grew up...

     White stands abruptly, startling the woman.  He glares down at
     her intensely.

                         WHITE
               How do I get there?  Tell me.

                         WIFE
               That's easy.  You...

     She trails off into silence.  Her hand, about to point in a
     certain direction, freezes in mid-air.

                         ELIZABETH
               ...strange, I forgot.

     White sits back down quietly.

                         WHITE
               Yes.  Very strange.


     INT.  BATHROOM

     Sachiko locks the door behind her and steps to the middle of
     the room, lifts a small round rug off the tiled floor.

     Underneath is a TRAP-DOOR.  Opening it, she climbs down a
     hole.

     UNDER THE FLOOR

     In the semi-darkness she moves to a WOODEN BOX.  She cranks a
     small metal handle on the box which makes the lid open.  Music
     plays softly.

     She looks into the yawning black mouth of the box.  A WORM-LIKE
     apparition threads its way out of the hole, wraps about her
     thigh.  She breaths deeply, shuts her eyes.


     INT.  TENEMENT BUILDING CORRIDOR

     LOW ANGLE TRACKING SHOT  -  feet walk along a tattered rug,
     approach a door.  Bumstead's shoes, shiny as always.


     INT.  TENEMENT ROOM

     A KNOCK ON THE DOOR startles a huddled man in a blanket,
     sitting before a small t.v. set.  This is THOMPSON  -  the
     detective with mental problems.  He's unshaven, haunted.

     Clutching a shotgun, he steps to the door, peeks through a spy-
     hole.

     HIS P.O.V.

     Bumstead, back turned, glancing at his watch.

     Thompson backs away, points his gun at the figure through the
     door.

                         THOMPSON
               Go away!

                         BUMSTEAD O.S.
               Open up, Thompson.  It's me...

     Thompson puts his eye to the door again.

                         THOMPSON
               Bumstead?

     THROUGH THE SPY-HOLE LENS the inspector turns, looks at us, his
     face DISTORTED, fish-like.  Thompson undoes four locks, opens
     the door a crack, but leaves it chained.

                         THOMPSON
               Can't let you in...  sorry.

                         BUMSTEAD
               I'm on the serial killer case, need
               to talk.

                         THOMPSON
               Not that.  Anything else.

     Thompson wipes at the sweat on his forehead.

                         BUMSTEAD
               You don't look so well...  C'mon, let
               me in Thompson.

     Thompson stares at Bumstead, then silently unchains the door
     and lets him through.

                         THOMPSON
               I can't talk about that.  As long as
               you understand, that's all.

     The room is very dark.  Bumstead is assailed by a wave of
     putrid smells.  It's a mess  -  rotten food, overturned
     furniture, dirty clothes.

                         THOMPSON
               Pull up some garbage  -  make
               yourself at home.

     Thompson smiles weakly.  They sit down, face each other in the
     gloom.  A RAT scuttles past Thompson.  With lightning reflexes
     he throws a shoe at it.  The rat runs under a table.  He looks
     back at Bumstead, smiles, slightly insane.

                         THOMPSON
               They've taken my mind, my memories...

                         BUMSTEAD
               What?  Who has?

                         THOMPSON
               Is that your idea of a joke?  I don't
               remember...
                    (looks around)
               Take my advice, Bumstead.  Get off
               this case.  Now.

                         BUMSTEAD
               What is going on?

                         THOMPSON (looks more frightened)
               Wish I could tell you, Bumstead.
               Strange business.  I...
               AAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!

     He screams horribly.  Stands, clutching his head.  Startled,
     Bumstead falls backwards off his chair.  Thompson, still
     clutching his head, runs and starts POUNDING HIS FACE against
     the wall.

                         THOMPSON
               Get away!  Leave me alone!

     Thompson's head is CHANGING  -  bloating.  It rapidly elongates
     into a pink fleshy tube.

     Thompson's head continues to grow -  his features are lost
     beneath folds of skin.  His screaming is stifled.  Thompson
     falls to the floor.  His head HUGE NOW  -  larger than his
     body.  Small tendrils sprout from the main appendage.

     Bumstead takes cover behind a sofa.

     Then, as violently as the head began to transform, it stops.

     Bumstead peaks over the sofa at the huge throbbing purple
     growth sprouting from Thompson's collar.  At the top of the
     growth an orifice opens.

     An EXPLOSION of green bile spouts into the room  -  covers
     everything in sight...

     Then the head starts to shrink.  Thompson's features appear
     again. It returns to normal size.  Thompson groans, sprawled on
     the floor, clutching his head.

     Bumstead looks on in horror.

                         THOMPSON
               It's  -  it's disgusting, I know...

     Thompson's face is heavily bruised, covered in sweat.  His nose
     starts to bleed  -  he wipes it on his sleeve.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Jesus!  We have to get you to a
               doctor...

                         THOMPSON
               No...  No doctor...

     Bumstead stands unsteadily.

                         BUMSTEAD
               But...  How long has this been
               happening?

                         THOMPSON
               A few days...  a few weeks  -  dunno,
               I can't remember.
                    (stands slowly)
               Worse thing is, I never know if it
               will change back again...  Now,
               please leave me alone.


     INT.  APARTMENT  -  NIGHT

     WHITE, ELIZABETH and SACHIKO sit around a small table, eating
     quietly.

     Without warning, Elizabeth starts to cry again.  White tries to
     ignore her. Sachiko looks sadly at the wife, puts a hand on her
     shoulder, gives her a handkerchief.  The woman quietens down.

     They resume eating but in no time Elizabeth again bursts into
     tears.  White looks at her now.

                         ELIZABETH  (through sobs)
               Sorry...

     Sachiko leans across and puts her arm around Elizabeth, helps
     her to her feet.  Elizabeth hangs onto the woman as she is led
     from the room.  White can hear the sobbing still, as the women
     move through to the bedroom.


     INT.  BEDROOM

     They sit on the edge of the bed  -  Sachiko holds Elizabeth's
     hand, smiles at her.

                         ELIZABETH (calmer now)
               I'm sorry...  This is embarrassing  -
               my husband doesn't know who I am...

     With this, she starts to cry again.

     Sachiko leans forward and tenderly kisses Elizabeth's lips.


     INT.  DARK CHAMBER  -  NIGHT

     TIGHT ON TWO MYSTERY MEN speaking in whispers.  The Men
     continue talking as THE CAMERA RISES, through several levels of
     concrete and machinery TO REVEAL:


     EXT.  ROOF-TOP  -  NIGHT

     OTHER MYSTERY MEN are rigging a wire to some kind of antenna
     device.

     BACK DOWN IN THE DARK CHAMBER

     The group of MYSTERY MEN have gathered once again.  One
     addresses them all.

                         MYSTERY MAN
               The line of junction between two
               edges!

                         MEN  (unison)
               YES!

                         MYSTERY MAN
               We have located him.  Now is the
               time, yes.

     A switch is thrown.  Electricity sparks to life.  A hum is in
     the air.

                         MYSTERY MAN
               Let the tuning commence!

     The congregation of MEN place ELECTRODES to their foreheads in
     a trance-like manner.  They chant, quietly at first, steadily
     building in volume.  The MEN stand and MOVE RHYTHMICALLY to
     some inner beat.

     The CAMERA MOVES ACROSS to a diagram pinned on a board.  A
     representation of a man's legs.  Trousers rolled up above the
     knees, showing a number of bite-like wounds on the flesh.
     Labels point out various parts of the legs in medical fashion
     -  the legends are an unknown language.

     ON THE ROOF

     The antenna glows with a ghostly green light.  O.S. SCREAMS
     RISE UP FROM THE STREET.


     INT.  APARTMENT/KITCHEN  -  LATER

     White downs a cup of black coffee, staring blankly out the
     window.  O.S. distant screams.

     He glances across to a wall, notices A FLY there  -  something
     about it looks WRONG.

     FLY'S P.O.V.

     A distorted electronic image of White's FACE looming up.

     At exactly that moment the FLY TAKES OFF, flies erratically
     down the hall, around a turn and disappears.  White follows.

     HALL-WAY

     White moves quietly towards the bedroom door.

     HIS P.O.V.

     It is ajar, dark inside.  Movement.  The women are naked on the
     bed.  The JAPANESE WOMAN has her eyes shut, head back in
     ecstasy. The WIFE is bent over her, kissing her stomach.

     ANGLE ON WHITE  -  watching through the crack in the door.  The
     women are oblivious.

     He moves away slowly, feeling strange.  His feet stop making
     contact with the floor.  He grabs a table to steady himself.
     The table-cloth comes away, things spill to the floor and
     smash. He's FLOATING.

     White desperately reaches out to grab something, holds the
     light-fixture in the ceiling.  It breaks off in a cloud of
     plaster.  Sparks briefly illuminate.  He falls heavily ONTO THE
     CEILING  -  now the floor.  The apartment is upside down.

     He stares up at furniture and objects.

     THE BATHROOM

     White steps into the room, eerily illuminated by a glowing
     heater stuck to the floor.  Water is running  -  filling the
     tub and overflowing, making a suspended puddle above White's
     head.

     White takes off his clothes and climbs the wall, towards the
     floor.  It's difficult, but he reaches the tap, turns it off.
     Pulls himself towards the tub.

     Gravity becomes NORMAL AGAIN as he sinks in the warm water.
     He's incredibly weak  -  floats limply in the bath.  Submerges
     his face.  A distant throbbing O.S., like a huge machine heart
     somewhere in the building.

     He opens his eyes, still underwater, stares up at the ceiling.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A blurry DARK FIGURE moves into his vision.  It stares down at
     him.

     White rigid with fright, cannot focus on the figure through the
     thin veil of water.  The FIGURE reaches out.  A GLOVED HAND
     grabs White about the throat, holds him forcefully.  White
     gulps for air, swallows water.  His eyes widen.  He tries to
     stop the hand strangling him but can't.

     Suddenly the hand pulls away.  The BLURRY FIGURE stumbles back
     and ERUPTS into bloody explosion.  The body splits apart,
     throwing internal organs through the room.

     White awakens in the bathtub.  He looks about the room.  Empty.
     Silent.  He gets out of the water, starts to dress.


     EXT.  BUILDING

     BUMSTEAD'S car pulls up.  He gets out, stained here and there
     with bile.


     INT.  APARTMENT

     A HIGH ANGLE on the slain bodies of the JAPANESE WOMAN and
     WHITE'S WIFE.  TWO COPS wander about the dark room, doing
     stuff.  Bumstead walks up to the cop in charge.

                         COP
               All the same entry wounds.  It's
               definitely him.
                    (indicates Sachiko's
                    corpse)
               She lives...  lived here.  A
               prostitute.

                         BUMSTEAD
               The other one?

                         COP
               His wife.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Jesus.  Small world.
                    (looks around)
               Where's the photographer?

                         COP
               No one available.

     A third YOUNG COP steps up to the cop in charge, glancing at
     the bile on Bumstead's suit.

                         YOUNG COP
               They won't come out.

                         COP
               We'll interrogate them anyway.

     The cop leads Bumstead behind a WOODEN PARTITION.  A small area
     neatly arranged  -  a double bed, various possessions.  Someone
     obviously lives here.  The room is empty however.

                         COP
               This is the family of the victim  -
               apparently they were in the apartment
               when he committed...

                         BUMSTEAD  (looks around empty room)
               What are you talking about?

                         COP
               Oh, yes...

     He walks to THE BED, bends over and lifts the bed-spread.  In
     the shadows underneath, Bumstead can make out SEVERAL FACES.  A
     man, an old woman, three or four children.

                         COP
               They don't speak English...

                         BUMSTEAD
               How will we interrogate them?

                         COP
               Well, sir...  I don't know exactly.

     Under the bed, Bumstead can see a LITTLE GIRL.  He walks over
     to her.  She puts a hand over her mouth, edges away.

                         BUMSTEAD
               It's alright.  I won't hurt you.

     Without coming out from under the bed she hands the inspector a
     crumpled paper.  He looks at it then glances over his shoulder.

     HIS P.O.V.

     The wooden room divider.  The CAMERA MOVES IN steadily, into a
     crack running along the length of the divider  -  we can see
     the room on the other side, with the cops moving about.

     Bumstead looks back at the page he holds in his hands.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A child-like DRAWING.  Two men, stick figures, dressed in
     black, with impossibly big knifes, slash at two screaming
     women.

     Unmistakable  -  MYSTERY MEN.


     INT.  DARK CHAMBER  -  NIGHT

     DOCTOR SCHREBER walks stiffly into the room and sits at the
     head of a boardroom table.  He's cold, pulls his coat up about
     his neck.  The long table is lined on both sides with immobile
     MYSTERY MEN.

     A DARK FIGURE walks into the room, steps up to the other end of
     the table.  This is the enigmatic MISTER BLACK  -  only ever
     seen hidden in shadow.

                         MISTER BLACK  (addressing Men)
               Gentlemen.
                    (peers at Schreber)
               Doctor.

     He sits, dark and mysterious.

                         MISTER BLACK
               I have called this meeting for a
               purpose, yes?
                    (turns to Schreber)
               It is clear to you we are  -
               unhappy, yes?

                         SCHREBER
               Yes, of course.  I...

                         MISTER BLACK
               The tuning failed  -  when our agents
               arrived he was gone.  He knows things
               -  predicts things.  Explain to us,
               Doctor.  Why is the situation this
               way?  Yes?

     Schreber seems distinctly uncomfortable.

                         SCHREBER
               I'm not certain I fully understand
               myself...

                         MISTER BLACK
               No excuses, dearest Doctor!  Answers.
               Yes?

                         MYSTERY MEN  (chant in unison)
               Answers!  Answers!

                         MISTER BLACK
               You said this would be containable!
               Nothing works this time.  Why is this
               so?

                         MYSTERY MEN
               Why!  Why!

                         SCHREBER
               I  -  ah  -  I...  it's a little cold
               in here don't you think?

                         MISTER BLACK
               We must find him.  This is your
               responsibility.

                         SCHREBER (thinking fast)
               Yes, of course...


     INT.  INSPECTOR'S OFFICE

     Bumstead once again scratches his head in front of a map.  The
     little girl's drawing is pinned to his board.  His attention
     wanders.  He notices a FLY CRAWLING across the wall in front of
     his face.  He leans closer, studying it.

     The intercom crackles to life.  The insect flies off.

                         MISS CRENSHAW  (through intercom)
               A call, sir.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Who is it?

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Put it through...

     A light flashes.  Bumstead picks up.

                         BUMSTEAD
               This is Bumstead.  Who is this?

     He listens intently.


     INT.  BUMSTEAD'S OFFICE

     BUMSTEAD enters.  He looks nervous.  His SECRETARY sits at her
     desk in an adjoining office, filing her nails.

                         BUMSTEAD
               I need everything on the Jonathan
               White case.

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Yes, sir.  Everything?

                         BUMSTEAD
               All the important stuff.  Wrap it up
               for me.

     The inspector turns to face her, a little manic. She is staring
     at him.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Please  -  I'm in a hurry.

                         MISS CRENSHAW (evenly)
               Certainly.


     EXT.  POLICE STATION

     BUMSTEAD steps from the doorway and walks across to his car
     briskly.


     INT.  BATH-HOUSE

     Bumstead moves down a long corridor full of people in towels
     and swimming outfits, waiting silently.  They sit lined by a
     wall, staring into space.

     Bumstead walks into a larger tiled room, full of steam.  He
     walks beside a heated pool  -  naked people swim about weakly
     or sit on the edge washing themselves.  He steps up to A FULLY
     DRESSED MAN, sitting silently on a bench.  It is WHITE.

     A feint smile brushes across White's lips as he looks up at the
     inspector.  He looks away, like he's forgotten something.
     Stands, walks over to the pool, cups his hand, bends down,
     scoops some water.

     Bumstead sees White has picked up the LITTLE SILVER FISH.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Why give yourself up?

                         WHITE
               I  -  ah - couldn't think of
               anything else to do.  I thought maybe
               you know something...
                    (beat)
               I'm scared.

                         BUMSTEAD
               That was a pretty good escape act at
               the station.  How did you do that?

                         WHITE
               I woke up in a subway.  I don't know
               how I got there.

                         BUMSTEAD  (not convinced)
               Uh-huh.
                    (pauses)
               What are you scared of?

                         WHITE
               People...  after me.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Who?

                         WHITE
               I don't know who they are.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Why are they after you?

                         WHITE
               Don't know that either.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Don't know much, do you?


     INT.  LABORATORY  -  NIGHT

     Metal scraping.

     PIANO ACCORDION MUSIC wafts on a breeze, someone breathing.

     HIGH ANGLE  -  Down through an OPENING metal hatch.  A dim
     laboratory IS REVEALED  -  a maze of scientific instruments.
     Elongated shadows move about.

     MYSTERY MEN are hunched over something.  Behind them a
     diagrammatic chart of the evolution of the human brain.

     MAN 1 bends across to a CONTROL PANEL, works a switch.  A small
     speaker in a metal box crackles to life.  SOUND OF DISTANT
     SURF.  A WOMAN'S VOICE:

                         VOICE
               What is your name...  What is your
               name...

     Wires lead from the metal box to a HUMAN BRAIN within a
     metallic container.  Electricity arches across electrodes.

     More sounds from the speaker:  WATER BUBBLING.  HIGH HEELS WALK
     DOWN STAIRS.  BED-SPRINGS.  LOVERS MOAN PASSIONATELY.

     MAN 2 steps forward and pulls a bloodied sheet from their
     handiwork.

     A PUPPET-LIKE CREATURE is revealed.  Small  -  two and half
     feet tall.  The top of its head an open hatch containing the
     BRAIN.  Wires lead to this.

     TIGHT ON PUPPET'S EYES  -  They glance about the room. Its body
     is a series of geometric shapes and polished surfaces.

     MAN 1 shines a torch into the puppet's eyes.

     INSIDE ITS HEAD

     Gears turn, illuminated by the beam of the light.  The gears
     part slowly to reveal a small writhing INSECT screwed to a
     metal plate.

     MAN 2 shows the puppet PHOTOGRAPHS:  WHITE as he looks
     currently, shots of him as a teenager, a young boy, a baby.
     Photos of what we realise are his parents, standing on a
     seaside pier sirtiling and waving.  Where he went to school.  A
     red push-bike he owned as a boy.  His first sweetheart.  Then a
     photo of a young woman smiling  -  his WIFE.

     MAN 3 holds up a small sea shell to the mechanical ear of the
     puppet creature  -  MORE SOUNDS OF SURF...

     A FIGURE clutching a wooden cane looks on from the shadows.
     His pale hand fondles the ornate handle of his cane  -  a
     carved silver insect.  It's MISTER BLACK.  Man 3 steps up to
     him.

                         MISTER BLACK
               You have duplicated the personality,
               yes.

                         MAN 3
               It is ready.  The Doctor was most
               helpful.

     Mister Black turns towards the OTHER MEN.

                         MISTER BLACK
               I hear a clock in my head, and I like
               it!

                         MEN  (respond in unison)
               We hear clocks in our heads, and we
               like it!

                         MISTER BLACK
               A world in our likeness!

                         MEN
               A world in our likeness!

     The Men close the hatch in the top of the puppet's head.
     SQUEAK...  CLUNK!  The puppet tests out its MANY WEAPONS, a
     series of nasty-looking blades snap out of its small body, then
     retract.


     INT.  INSPECTOR'S APARTMENT

     Bumstead leads White through the front door, into a SITTING
     ROOM.  Everything is extremely neat and organized, plastic
     coverings on all the furniture.  White steps towards a sofa.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Please.  Not that way.  If you could
               just follow the covering  -  the
               carpet gets stained and it's
               impossible to clean.

     White stops. Bumstead indicates a CLEAR PLASTIC MAT running
     through the room.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Everything the department knows about
               John White is in this.  Here.
                    (hands file)
               Excuse me for a moment.

     White flips through it.  Details of White's history.

     IN THE BEDROOM

     Bumstead removes an empty suitcase from a closet.  Begins to
     place neatly folded clothes within it.

                         BUMSTEAD (calling to White)
               Age thirty one.  Brown hair.  Green
               eyes.  Five feet, ten and a half
               inches tall.  Until recently worked
               for a firm manufacturing scientific
               equipment.  Wife's name  -  Elizabeth.
               Father and mother  -  Harold and
               Edith.  Both dead.  A history of
               mental instability...  etcetera,
               etcetera.

     Bumstead walks back into the sitting room, packed bag in hand.
     He looks at White leafing through the file.

                         BUMSTEAD
               That stuff helpful?

                         WHITE  (disappointed)
               I suppose...
                    (looks up)
               Why are you helping me?

                         BUMSTEAD
               You're case has been driving me
               crazy.  You see, I pride myself on
               being thorough.  There's too many
               loose ends with your case.
                    (a beat)
               Thought it was best you were hidden
               until we understand more about the
               facts.  What do you know about these
               men in black?

     White looks up, pauses as if he didn't understand Bumstead,
     then:

                         WHITE
               If you shoot them here...
                    (points at his
                    forehead)
               you can kill them.  They're not
               people  -  like us  -  got insects in
               their heads...  Got any disinfectant?

     The inspector is caught off-guard by the question.

                         WHITE  (continues)
               It's my legs.  Been bitten.  Giving
               me trouble.

     Bumstead walks silently to the bathroom, opens a medicine
     cabinet.

                         BUMSTEAD  (to himself)
               Insects?

     He returns clutching a small bottle and some cotton wool.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Here.
                    (hands things to
                    White)
               Careful with your trousers.  That
               stuff stains.

     The inspector gives white back his revolver and his wallet.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Here.

     Bumstead paces thoughtfully, careful to stay on the plastic
     protective covering.  He turns, glares at White, who dabs his
     legs with the cotton wool.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Any idea what part the Doctor plays
               in this business?

     White shakes head.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Let's try and find out, shall we.
                    (points at White's
                    shoe)
               Lace is untied.

     White looks down.  Bumstead doesn't lie.


     INT.  DRUG STORE  -  NIGHT

     The BARBER is shaving under the armpit of a client.  GRANDPA
     snores in a corner, his feet buried under a pile of hair
     clippings..

     The BELL hanging above the door rings.  The door swings open.

                         BARBER
               He with you shortly, sir...

     Several heads turn, THEN LOOK DOWN to see the PUPPET.  The
     puppet wheels forward and stops.

                         BARBER (not really looking)
               Hello, sonny.  Cute outfit.  Mother
               get it for you?

     The puppet crosses the room threateningly.  TWO OTHER CLIENTS
     look up startled from their newspapers and girly magazines.

     ON THE PUPPET  -  it wheels up to the barber's leg and GRABS HIS
     TROUSER with a mechanical claw.  The puppet holds out a PHOTO
     OF White.

                         PUPPET (incoherent obscenities)
               EEEEEEEEK...  AHHHHHHH!...
               SHHHHIIIITTTT!...  FUUUUCKER!!

                         BARBER (looks down, scared now)
               Huh?

     He's grabbed and THROWN into a nearby chair.  The puppet leaps
     onto the bench in front of him  -  he's frightened, so are the
     customers.

     Puppet wheels up and down on the bench in front of the
     customers  -  stopping to glance at individuals in a threatening
     manner, holding out the photo of white.

     It leans forward, spinning its blades  -  HAIR FLIES.  Screams
     o.s.

     The PUPPET retracts its weapons  -  COVERED in blood.  It
     wheels forward, through the door and into the street.

     THE CAMERA PANS to reveal a scene of complete carnage.  Blood
     covers the walls.  FOUR BODIES slumped about the room.  Each has
     an outlandish hairstyle.


     INT.  BUMSTEAD'S CAR

     White looks at the inspector  -  street lights pass over his
     features.  Bumstead stares at the road.

                         BUMSTEAD
               I didn't tell you the entire reason I
               helped you.  It started with two
               little girls.  Twins.  Used to play
               with them when I was young.  Couldn't
               remember for the life of me what they
               looked like, then I understood why...

     He looks at the dashboard, brushes away a small piece of lint.

                         BUMSTEAD
               They didn't have faces.

                         WHITE
               What?

                         BUMSTEAD
               That's right.  Just seamless flesh
               across the front of their heads.  No
               mistake.  I just hadn't remembered it
               that way.  Up until then they had
               been normal little girls in my
               memory.
                    (looks back at White)
               That's not all.  Once I started
               examining them, all sorts of things
               about my life, had...
               inconsistencies.  It was like a game.
               I would think about a person or a
               place, or an event.  Then I would
               turn the lights off.  Sit down in a
               comfortable chair...  And study each
               detail of this subject.

     He glances at White, then back to the road.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Everything was liquid beneath a thin
               surface that had always seemed solid
               to me...

     Bumstead and White are quiet momentarily, then:

                         BUMSTEAD
               Is there anything you haven't told me
               about this business?  Even the most
               insignificant thing?

                         WHITE (thinking)
               No.  Nothing I can think of.
               Except...

                         BUMSTEAD
               Go on.

                         WHITE
               Well.  The only thing I've been
               certain of, all this time, is that I
               need to get to the ocean.  The point
               is no one seems to know how to get
               there.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Why, that's ridiculous.  You just...

     He trails off.  Shakes his head slowly.

                         BUMSTEAD
               We'll get to the bottom of this.  I
               mean it.


     INT.  SCHREBER'S SURGERY

     The doctor is sitting at his desk, when the door bursts open
     suddenly.  White and Bumstead move into the room and grab the
     doctor before he can protest.

                         BUMSTEAD
               I met a friend of yours the other
               night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No
               hair.  Rather pale skin...

                         SCHREBER
               I don't know what you're talking
               about.

                         BUMSTEAD
               That's surprising.  He was leaving
               your office at the time...

                         SCHREBER
               You are mistaken.

                         WHITE
               What are you hiding?

                         SCHREBER
               Nothing.  I don't know anything!

     BUMSTEAD removes his revolver, sticks it in the doctor's face.

                         SCHREBER
               Please, they'll kill me...

                         BUMSTEAD
               I think it's time you introduced us
               to your little friends.


     EXT.  ALLEY  -  NIGHT

     SCHREBER, BUMSTEAD AND WHITE sit in Bumstead's car in an
     alleyway.

     Schreber points to a SOLITARY METAL DOOR in a wall.

                         SCHREBER
               In there.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Just like that?

     The threesome step from the car, keep close to a wall.

     Schreber alone steps up to the door, leans down to a mat at the
     foot of the door, lifts it and takes a KEY from underneath.  He
     unlocks the door, opens it, puts the key back, goes inside.  He
     waves the other men forward.

     White and Bumstead step up to the door  -  Bumstead looks at the
     mat  -  it says:  WELCOME on it.

     A CORRIDOR

     Through the door  -  AN ELEVATOR.  There is only a down button.
     Schreber presses it, several seconds later the doors open.

     They step inside.  The doors close, the lift descends.

                         BUMSTEAD
               What is this place?

                         SCHREBER
               You wouldn't believe me if I told
               you, Inspector.  Have patience  -
               you'll see for yourself.

     When the doors open again the three men look out on a DARK
     PASSAGEWAY.


     EXT.  LIBRARY  -  NIGHT

     The PUPPET wheels up to the sweeping set of stairs at the base
     of the building.  It stops, WHEELS BUMP into the steps
     repeatedly.  It looks down and shrieks with a string of
     mechanical obscenities.


     INT.  MYSTERY MEN'S UNDERWORLD

     WHITE and BUMSTEAD follow SCHREBER down a corridor to what
     appears to be an ancient crypt.  They enter a door  -  it has
     something written on it in a strange language.

     INSIDE IS A ROOM

     They stumble around in the darkness, Schreber finds a light
     switch, suddenly White STOPS dead in his tracks  -  Bumstead
     turns to him.

                         WHITE
               Look.

     White points to a wall featuring a line of brass hooks.  On
     these hooks hang MYSTERY MEN coats -  that's not all.  Each hook
     carries A FACE.

     Bumstead and White step closer, look at the faces.  They seem to
     be elaborate, very life-like MASKS.

                         SCHREBER
               Put them on.

     White and the inspector look at each other, incredulous.

     OUTSIDE  -  THE CORRIDOR

     The door opens.  White, Bumstead and Schreber step out, wearing
     poorly fitting masks and coats  -  DISGUISED AS MYSTERY MEN.

     FURTHER ALONG THE CORRIDOR

     The three men come across a small area with a raised platform,
     between arches.  A number of OPEN CARTS roll past on tracks  -
     the scene resembles some bizarre amusement-park ride.  The carts
     are numbered on the side  -  all of them empty.

                         SCHREBER
               Get in.  Hurry.

     White, Bumstead and Schreber hop aboard.  The cart takes them
     into a DARK TUNNEL, deeper into the secret underworld of the
     MYSTERY MEN.  They MOVE THROUGH a subterranean landscape of
     unexplained contraptions and bones.

                         WHITE
                    (to Bumstead)
               Where do you think this goes?

                         BUMSTEAD
               It sure isn't the fun-fair.

     The cart finally comes to a stop in a cave.  Bumstead, White and
     Schreber leap out and hide in a dark doorway, as a LONG LINE OF
     MYSTERY MEN walk past them.

                         SCHREBER
               Follow me, and do exactly as I do.

     They join the end of the line, falling into step.


     INT.  DARK CHAMBER

     The MEN, with WHITE, BUMSTEAD and SCHREBER in tow, enter and
     sit in a number of rows of wooden chairs.  White and the
     inspector do the same.

     MORE MYSTERY MEN appear in circular portals high up on the
     concrete walls.  ONE MAN faces the others at the front of the
     room.

                         MYSTERY MAN 1
               Eleven past eleven  -  the Night of the
               Eye.

     The seated Men start to CHANT.

                         MEN
               NIGHT OF THE EYE!  NIGHT OF THE EYE!

     A MAN in the front row stands.

                         MAN 2
               The Eye is too small for the head of
               the pin!

                         MAN 1
               Yes!

     ANOTHER MAN stands.  Next to the first, who sits again.

                         MAN 3
               What is it that floats on the water?
               The Eye!

                         MAN 1
               Indeed!

     So it goes around the room, each Man takes his turn announcing
     part of the strange ritual.  It will be White, Bumstead and
     Schreber's turn shortly.  White is worried, looks at the
     others.

                         WHITE (whisper)
               What do we do?

                         SCHREBER (hisses back)
               Fake it!

                         BUMSTEAD
               What?

     SCHREBER is next  -  he stands abruptly.

                         SCHREBER
               The eye.  Master of time and space!

     Then it's Bumstead's turn.

                         BUMSTEAD
               The Eye  -  um  -  delicious with
               horseradish on rye!

     MAN 1 at the front seems confused for a moment  -  SEVERAL of
     the others turn towards Bumstead.

                         MAN 1 (uncertain)
               Good.

     The inspector sits back down  -  whispers to White without
     looking at him.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Nothing to it...

     White stands.  Hesitates.  Then:

                         WHITE
               Eye...  eye, captain!

     White sits down, shaking his head, embarrassed.

                         MAN 1
               Um  -  yes...

     THE MAN NEXT TO WHITE rises up  -  keeps rising, FLOATS IN THE
     AIR above the Men's heads.

                         MAN 4
               My spine will bend for the Eye!

     He turns sideways, still floating.


     EXT.  ALLEY

     BACK ABOVE GROUND, Bumstead, White and Schreber run from the
     door at the end of the alley-way, tossing their masks away.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Was that for real down there?

                         SCHREBER
               I'm afraid so.

     The inspector stops walking suddenly, grabs White, holds him
     back.

                         BUMSTEAD
               What the hell is that?

     At the end of the alley the PUPPET advances menacingly.
     Schreber takes his chance and runs down an alley and
     disappears.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Quick.  My car.

     Fortunately BUMSTEAD'S CAR stands nearby.  The two men leap in,
     start it up.  Bumstead guns towards the puppet standing in the
     glare of the headlights.

     The puppet's head opens, a TINY PROPELLER pops out, spins,
     lifting the puppet into the air.  The car passes beneath it at
     speed.  Screeches off into a street, races along between tall
     buildings.

     INSIDE THE CAR

                         WHITE
               What now?

                         BUMSTEAD
               This ocean business...  I know where
               I can find a map.  I need to go back
               to the station.  Where will you be?

     White thinks for a moment, pulls the paper his wife gave him
     from his pocket.

                         WHITE
               I'll go see an uncle of mine.
                    (reading)
               Five  -  one  -  eight  -  three  -  double
               six  -  three...

     Bumstead scribbles on the pad mounted to the dash, battles with
     the wheel, driving at breakneck speed.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Good.
                    (looks in rear
                    mirror)
               Uh-oh...

     White turns and looks behind them.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  HEADLIGHTS gaining on them.

     ON THE PUPPET  -  sitting AT THE WHEEL of a stolen car, driving
     like crazy.

     BACK IN BUMSTEAD'S CAR

     White takes out his gun  -  AIMS at the rapidly approaching
     car.

                         WHITE  (remembers)
               It's empty.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Take mine.

     Bumstead pulls a gun out of his coat.  They swap.

     The puppet PULLS ALONGSIDE, a mechanical arm extends towards
     Bumstead's front tire.  A SPINNING BLADE extends from the end
     of the mechanical arm.

                         PUPPET
               ARRRRRRRRGGGHHHH!...  HA-HA-HA-HA-
               HA!!

     TIGHT ON THE BLADE heading for the spinning wheel.  White
     fires.  Shells hit the PUPPET'S car, shattering windows.

     THE BLADE cuts into the tire  -  it pops loudly, goes flat,
     metal SPARKS off the road.

     White is thrown forward, hits his head on the dash.  Bumstead
     fights to keep control, SWERVES into the side of the other
     vehicle, making it scrape a concrete wall, hits garbage cans
     flying.

     The PUPPET'S car falls behind  -  then swerves off into a side-
     street and disappears.

                         BUMSTEAD  (looks behind him)
               Where did it go?

                         WHITE  (looks back also)
               Don't know.

     Both look FORWARD AGAIN  -  to see the PUPPET'S CAR pull out in
     front of them, BLOCKING THE WAY.  Bumstead's car is going too
     fast.  Slams the brakes.

     TIGHT ON PUPPET  -  Screaming with insane joy as Bumstead's car
     approaches like a bullet.

     INSIDE INSPECTOR'S CAR

                         BUMSTEAD
               Jump!

     Bumstead rips the phone number from the pad.  The two men LEAP.

     The car continues onwards.

     CRASH!  KA-BOOM!

     In the glow of the flaming wrecks, the two men pick themselves
     up from different sides of the street.  Look at each other,
     turn and head in OPPOSITE directions.

     CAMERA MOVES IN on mangled metal  -  a MECHANICAL CLAW starts
     to pull itself from the wreckage.


     EXT.  STREET  -  NIGHT

     White steps up to a SMALL DOOR in the side of a building.  A
     sign above the door depicts an underwater scene, crammed with
     fish, sea-weed, bubbles floating to the surface.  Dominating
     everything is a GREEN MAN with scales  -  a KING NEPTUNE-type.

     INSIDE

     White stops in front of a ticket booth, beside a faded blue
     curtain.  In the booth a TICKET SELLER is snoring with his mouth
     hanging open, his head sagging. White knocks on the window.  The
     man wakes with a start.

                         TICKET SELLER
               Yeah.  That's what I said!
                    (looks at White  -
                    rubs head)
               What..?

                         WHITE
               I'm looking for this address.

     The man squints at the card White holds up, nods groggily.

                         TICKET SELLER
               Upstairs.  Through there.

     He thumbs the blue curtain.  Curls up, shuts his eyes again.

     BEYOND THE CURTAIN

     A dark room full of BUBBLING NOISES AND WATER DRIPPING  -  an
     aquarium.

     Several corridors meander between large glass panels that look
     into illuminated tanks of sea creatures.

     White moves past a shadowy doorway.  He can barely make out
     STAIRS.


     INT.  HALL-WAY

     White moves cautiously in the darkness.  On a door a tiny
     NAMEPLATE says:  K. WHITE.  The door is unlocked.  He opens it
     and goes in.

     INSIDE

     An entrance hall of an apartment.  A large number of MOUNTED
     FISH of all sizes line the hall.

     PHOTOS on the wall  -  family portraits.  White examines these,
     concentrates on one in particular  -  a young boy on a red push-
     bike, in the background a sign with a faded image of a girl in
     a bathing suit:  WELCOME TO BLUMBVILLE!  it says.

     A strange WHIRRING NOISE O.S.  White hides behind a sofa.
     Whatever is making the whirring noise moves past slowly.  White
     cannot see what it is.

                         VOICE O.S.
               John?

     White turns to see an OLD MAN in his pyjamas sitting in a
     WHEELCHAIR.  The man pushes a lever on the side of the chair.  A
     whir of electric motors.  The chair carries him out of the
     shadows.  White steps from behind the sofa.

                         MAN
               Are you alright?  What are you doing
               here?  Is this one of your jokes,
               John?  It's been so long, I thought
               you'd forgotten your uncle Karl?

                         WHITE
               Uncle...  Karl.


     INT.  AIR-CONDITION DUCT

     A P.O.V.  -  MOVING THROUGH a dark, claustrophobic pipe.
     TWISTING around tight corners, DARTING down straight lengths of
     ducting.  Dim light spills from wire grills spaced along the
     walls.

     WE TRAVEL up to one grill, at the end of a long stretch of
     tunnel  -  stop, nowhere left to go. We can see through the gaps
     in the wire, looking down into...

     THE ROOM

     White and uncle Karl are having a SLIDE-SHOW.  Shots of a recent
     vacation  -  the uncle doing a series of mundane things.

                         KARL (chuckling)
               Not often I get a chance to show
               these.

     He changes the slide:  an image of him standing against a brick
     wall.

                         KARL
               And this is me again about  -  um  -  I
               would guess about twelve feet further
               to the right of the last shot.  Now
               just behind the wall is the hotel I
               stayed at  -  sweet little place...

     The PHONE RINGS.  Uncle Karl wheels over, picks up the receiver.

                         KARL (talks down the line)
               Hello...  Yes, he's here...
                    (holds out the phone
                    to White)
               It's for you.

     White concerned  -  takes the phone.

                         WHITE
               Yes?
                    (he listens)
               Oh, it's you...  Yes...  My uncle
               apparently...  Just looking at some
               memories...  You have?  That's good.

                                              CUT TO:

     INT.  POLICE STATION  -  NIGHT

     Bumstead talks to White on the phone.  He stands in a dark
     room, surrounded by charts and maps.

                         BUMSTEAD
               At first I thought there was no way
               to get to the ocean...  The buildings
               are a barrier, no windows, no doors
               -  everything just, well, ends  -  only
               thing would be drill a hole.  But
               then, I saw it, one door, just one...
               Inside a tenement building...

     Bumstead is interrupted by a NOISE O.S.  He looks to a frosted
     partition  -  dark figures walk past on the other side.  He
     quickly sorts through SEVERAL MAPS, making as little noise as
     he can.

                         BUMSTEAD (whisper)
               We can meet later  -  but first I
               have to do something.  Look I got to
               go...

                                              CUT BACK TO:

     White holds THE PHONE, listens to Bumstead on the other end.

                         WHITE
               Where can we meet?...  Alright.
               Good...

     As White hangs up he notices A DOOR behind a big old crockery
     cupboard.  The cupboard has been pushed up against the wall,
     hiding the door.

     BACK IN THE POLICE STATION

     BUMSTEAD quickly folds the map and shoves it into his pocket.
     As he turns and runs from the room we NOTICE A DARK FIGURE
     standing behind a shelf in the room.

     IN UNCLE KARL'S APARTMENT

     UNCLE KARL continues to change slides  -  the noise echoing
     about the room.  White moves over and sits down next to him.

                         KARL
               Look!  This is a good one!

                         WHITE
               What is that door?

                         KARL
               Which one?

                         WHITE
               There.  Behind the cabinet.  Where
               does it go?

     The uncle watches the slides.

                         KARL
               Such a joker!  Like your father.

                         WHITE
               No.  Have a look.

     He leads the old man over to the cabinet.

                         WHITE
               You see it?

                         KARL
               Yes.

                         WHITE
               Where does it lead?

                         KARL
               It must be a closet or something.

     White pushes at the cabinet.  The old man helps.  They only
     manage to push several inches  -  it is very heavy.  White
     decides to just climb over it.  He squeezes through, opens the
     door and climbs a set of dark stairs.  Uncle Karl watches.

                         KARL
               Don't trip over.  It's dark up there.


     INT.  ATTIC  -  NIGHT

     TIGHT ON a light switch  -  it is flipped.

     AN ATTIC  -  full of books, boxes, discarded possessions.
     White picks up a book and opens it  -  the pages have been
     eaten out by a swarm of ROACHES.  He drops it in disgust as the
     insects scurry over his hands.

     In a small wooden box are several toys he examines with great
     interest.  At the bottom of the box he finds a SMALL DOG-EARED
     DRAWING BOOK.  On the cover is a colourful scrawl in child's
     writing  -  a title:  ANSWERS  -  BY JONATHAN WHITE, AGE NINE.

     White sits down and flips through the book in the dim light.
     Page after page is filled with neat handwriting and drawings.
     As he reads segments from the book he seems more and more
     disturbed.  He flips through faster and faster.

     HIS P.O.V.

     Pages flip past, stopping occasionally.  Glimpses of DIAGRAMS.
     The MYSTERY MEN and THEIR WORLD.  Cross-sections of the MYSTERY
     MEN, the cavity in their head with the INSECTS INSIDE clearly
     illustrated.  EVERYTHING.

     PUSH IN CLOSE on White.  He looks up, STUNNED.


     INT.  UNCLE KARL'S APARTMENT

     White emerges from the attic, clutching the small book to his
     chest, lost in thought.  He steps quietly into a hall-way  -
     notices the old man putting THE PHONE back on its cradle.

                         KARL
               John, I didn't see you there.

     A NOISE O.S. White and Uncle Karl turn.  A VENTILATION GRILL
     falls off a wall, revealing a hole.  EYES shine from the
     darkness.

     THE PUPPET leaps from the hole.  Its blades unfolding,
     spinning wildly before it hits the carpet.  It faces the two
     men.

                         KARL
               What is that?

                         WHITE (to Karl)
               Get back!

                         KARL
               Filthy beast!  Shoo!  Go on!  Shoo!

     He wheels forward, attempting to scare the puppet off.

                         WHITE
               No!

     The puppet goes for Uncle Karl.  A whirr of metal, BLOOD
     SPLASHES ACROSS WHITE and the walls.  Uncle Karl SCREAMS
     horribly.

     White grabs a chair  -  holds it above him.  The puppet turns
     from the dead man in the wheelchair.  White lets it have it.
     The chair CRASHES DOWN, splintering into pieces.

     The puppet is dazed, but immediately recovers.  White has a
     fire-poker now.  As the puppet advances, he swings, connecting
     with the creature, hurtling it across the room, into a wall.
     White runs out the door.

     IN THE CORRIDOR

     He leaps into a waiting elevator.  Pushes the top floor button.

     THE ELEVATOR SHAFT  -  The elevator moves upwards.

     INSIDE THE ELEVATOR

     White looks through the circular window in the door.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  Floor after floor SLIDES PAST  -  deserted.  He
     looks at the floor indicator.  TIGHT ON NUMBERS lighting up:
     86, 87, 88...

     Then the elevator stops, the doors open, looking down a dark
     corridor.  The PUPPET is at the end.  It turns to face him,
     SUDDENLY RACES FORWARD, a horrible high-pitched shriek from its
     mechanical voice box.

     White STABS the buttons of the elevator frantically, the doors
     won't close.  The puppet is upon him.  He JUMPS, straight up.
     It goes under him, CRASHING INTO the back of the elevator.
     White hits the down button one last time, and leaps out of the
     compartment AS THE DOORS CLOSE.

     A MECHANICAL extendible arm shoots out and grabs White around
     the ankle. DRAGS him across floor.  THE PUPPET shrieks wildly
     again, as...

     ITS ARM  -  is JAMMED in the closing doors now.  Lift descends.
     The puppet squeals.  The arm SNAPS OFF.

     White stands, pulls dislocated arm off his ankle.  He can hear
     the elevator descending.  Suddenly it STOPS  -  starts
     returning to his floor.  White turns and runs again.

     The lift doors BURST OPEN  -  the ENRAGED CREATURE emerges and
     races after him.

     He tears around a corner  -  finds himself in a dead-end.
     Nowhere to go.  He can hear the puppet approaching along the
     corridor.  Suddenly he notice A GRILL on a wall ABOVE HIS HEAD.
     He pulls it off, climbs into an incredibly tight pipe.  Crawls
     frantically.

     He sees a LIGHT ahead.  An opening.  He kicks the grill off.  A
     sudden gust of wind.

     HIS P.O.V.

     The pipe leads to the outside of the building  -  nowhere to go
     except a hundred stories STRAIGHT DOWN.  He screams, almost
     falls.  Turns to start crawling back.

     Suddenly the end of the pipe fills with WHIRRING METAL BLADES.
     The puppet has followed him in and is advancing.

     No choice  -  he looks out the hole.  SEES A PIPE on the
     outside of the building, running vertically near the opening.
     It looks impossible but it's his only chance.

     He climbs out, balancing himself on the lip of the opening,
     REACHES for the pipe.  The puppet is almost upon him.  He
     swings across, gets a HAND on the pipe.  He slips, DANGLES  -
     holding on  -  one hand on the pipe, one on the edge of the hole.
     The pipe is greasy, slippery, can't grip it.

     SUDDENLY he hears a MECHANICAL CLICKING  -  TURNS to see the
     puppet standing on the edge of the hole, inches from his hand.
     A soft noise reverberates in its voice box  -  a mechanical
     giggle?  A circular blade on one of its arms starts up, moves
     down onto White's HAND.

     TIGHT ON HIS EYES  -  sweat beads and runs down his forehead.

     TIGHT ON THE BLADE  -  as it cuts into flesh.  BLOOD spatters
     White's face as he grimaces with intense pain.  He can't hold
     on.

     HE FALLS, plummets through space.  Screaming.


     INT.  HOSPITAL  -  NIGHT

     A GROUP OF SURGEONS stand about BUMSTEAD'S MOTHER on her life-
     support machinery.  The surgeons have face-masks on and are in
     deep shadow.  The woman stares blankly, still in a coma.

     IN THE RECEPTION AREA

     BUMSTEAD looks up from his wristwatch.

                         BUMSTEAD
               I can't wait any longer...

     He is standing in front of the MALE NURSE in the glassed-in
     counter.

                         NURSE
               I'm sorry.  I told you, she is being
               examined...

     He turns and storms off down the corridor.  The NURSE stands,
     shouting after him.

                         NURSE
               Mister Bumstead!

     INSIDE MOTHER'S ROOM

     One of the "doctors" leans down and grabs a handful of WIRES
     leading out of a box beside the woman.

                         SURGEON
               We will teach the pig to meddle in
               our affairs.  Yes.

     He pulls the wires out in a burst of electrical sparks  -  ALL
     THE MACHINES DIE.  The woman comes to life momentarily, starts
     to claw at the glass shield in front of her face, like she is
     suffocating.  The life drains from her weak body and she is
     STILL.

     ANGLE ON THE DOOR  -  it bursts open.  Bumstead is standing
     there.  The masked surgeons are startled, they turn rapidly to
     face him.

                         BUMSTEAD (steps forward)
               What is happening?

                         SURGEON
               Ah, Inspector Bumstead!  We are glad
               you are here  -  I'm afraid we have
               done all we can.  Yes.  Your Mother
               has passed.  Yes.

     Bumstead turns towards his mother.

                         BUMSTEAD
               But she was getting better...

                         SURGEON
               We are sorry.  The cancer  -  it was
               fatal.

     Bumstead turns to the men, confusion in his eyes.

                         BUMSTEAD
               She doesn't have cancer.

     The men glance at each other for a moment, then back at the
     inspector.

                         SURGEON
               We knew that.  Yes.
                    (the other men nod)
               Anyway  -  she is dead.

     Bumstead leaps forward, RIPS OFF one of the surgeon's masks.

     ANGLE ON THE MAN  -  He turns to look at Bumstead, pale skin,
     staring eyes, a MYSTERY MAN.  TWO OTHER MEN grab him from
     behind.

                         BUMSTEAD (struggles)
               I'll kill you all!

     One of the Mystery Men steps up to the struggling inspector,
     places the palm of his hand across Bumstead's eyes.

                         MYSTERY MAN
               You will obey us, yes.  In your mind
               there is a dark space...

     TIGHT ANGLE

     Bumstead's hand reaches out, fumbles at a tray of surgical
     implements, grabs a SCALPEL.

     WIDER

     He cuts into the hand of one of the Men holding him, SPINS AND
     DRIVES the scalpel into the forehead of the Mystery Man
     attempting to hypnotise him.

     The other Men leap towards him.


     EXT.  CANAL  -  NIGHT

     TIGHT ON WHITE'S FACE

     His eyes are shut tight.  He opens them, slowly LOOKS AROUND,
     curious why he isn't dead.

     WIDER ANGLE

     White floats in MID-AIR, hovering ten feet or so above a dark
     body of water.  He looks amazed.  Shuts his eyes, rubs them,
     opens them again.  Still floating.

     He clenches his fists and TENSES his body.  Slowly he starts to
     MOVE FORWARD, hovering at an even height over the water.

     WIDER STILL

     SEVERAL ANGLES feature the figure of White levitating across
     the harbour, past half-sunken buildings and rusted ships.

     TIGHT ON WHITE  -  He comes to a stop.  Smiles in amazement.
     Then he suddenly plummets into the water, like a trap-door has
     opened beneath him.

     ANGLE ON BUBBLES floating to the surface.  White's FACE rises
     slowly out of the water.

     WIDER  -  CITY SKYLINE

     A SMALL OBJECT floats towards the ground at the end of a tiny
     white parachute.

     BACK ON WHITE

     He swims across to a small boat, climbs aboard, pushes himself
     silently through the still canals of the city.


     EXT.  HARBOUR

     Oil tankers move silently through inky water.

     White paddles the boat to the bottom of A PIER, climbs a rotten
     ladder.  He runs off into the shadows.

     BACK IN THE WATER

     The PUPPET cuts through the waves, pushed along by a rear
     propeller.  It reaches the pier, climbs to the top.  The prop
     retracts, and the creature wheels forward slowly, onto a
     concrete surface.  It looks around  -  it knows White is there
     somewhere.

     PUPPET'S P.O.V.

     A trail of WET FOOTPRINTS on the ground.  It follows them, is
     led to a crane cabin.

     INSIDE THE CRANE'S CABIN  -  is White, a lunatic grin on his
     face, at the controls.

     A NOISE O.S. startles the puppet.  It looks up.

     PUPPET'S P.O.V.

     Follows the crane up into the air.  The crane is swinging around
     against the dark sky.  A HUGE METAL CONTAINER dangles, stops
     above the puppet.

     ON WHITE

                         WHITE
               Nice knowing you.

     TIGHT ON WHITE'S HAND  -  It pulls a lever.

     THE CONTAINER  -  Shakes and starts to fall.

     THE PUPPET  -  Screams up at the plummeting container.

     WIDER

     The container crashes into the ground, crushing the creature.

     Silence.  Dust floats in the air.


     EXT.  STREET

     BUMSTEAD's running.  He looks a mess, clutching a bleeding gash
     in his side, cuts on his face, clothes torn  -  but he made it
     out alive...

                                              CUT TO:

     EXT. ROOF-TOP

     BUMSTEAD sits on the ground, leans against a wall, breathing
     heavily  -  he's losing a lot of blood.

     He waits.

     A NOISE O.S. startles him  -  A FIGURE in the shadows across the
     roof.

                         BUMSTEAD
               White?

     It's too big to be White.  The man steps from the shadows.

                         STROMBOLI (walking forward)
               Hello, Bumstead.

     He's holding a gun, levelled at the inspector.  Bumstead lies
     bleeding, against the wall.  He points his own gun at the
     advancing man and pulls the trigger.

     CLICK!  CLICK!  CLICK!

                         BUMSTEAD
               Dammit.

     Stromboli is upon him, grabs the empty gun, throws it away,
     picks up the inspector, leans him against the wall.  Without
     Stromboli holding him up, Bumstead would not be able to stand.

                         STROMBOLI
               Why do you always have to find things
               out the hard way!  Couldn't you just
               do your job, you idiot?  I told you,
               didn't I?  These people are not
               playing games, Bumstead.  They can do
               anything they want, don't you
               understand?

                         BUMSTEAD (a hiss)
               You're one of them.  You bastard...

                         STROMBOLI (laughing)
               In a way, we all are, inspector!
               You.  Me.  Everybody!

     Stromboli carries Bumstead towards the EDGE of the roof.  He
     keeps laughing.

                         STROMBOLI
               Time for that early retirement,
               Bumstead.  Didn't bring the gold watch
               I'm afraid.

                         BUMSTEAD (weakly)
               No...  Please...

     INSPECTOR'S P.O.V.

     THE EDGE looms up  -  a long drop to the street.


     EXT.  STREET

     White paces nervously through empty streets.  He stops, to get
     his bearings, then turns and runs into:

     A SILHOUETTED FIGURE in a bizarre metal contraption on wheels.
     A skeletal hand reaches out to White, grabs his arm.  An inhuman
     moan.

     Terrorised, White pulls back.

                         FIGURE
               Ahhh...  it hurts!...

     The mechanized figure trundles forward, pins him to a wall.  A
     streetlight reveals...

     DOCTOR SCHREBER covered in blood, encased in a metal framework
     covered in silver blades.

                         WHITE
               What happened to you?

                         SCHREBER
               I'm...  being...  punished.

     The blades are connected to the wheels  -  they turn when he
     moves forward, metal cuts into his flesh, slowly SKINNING HIM
     ALIVE.  A torture machine.  Between screams of intense pain, the
     doctor speaks.

                         SCHREBER
               I had to  -  ahhhh  -  find you...  I..
               I...

     The doctor shuts his eyes, a trickle of blood runs down his
     face.
                         WHITE
               What is it?

                         SCHREBER
               We are...  living in their dreams...

     Schreber turns and rolls off into the night, screaming  -  BLADES
     SPIN furiously, peeling back flesh.  He glances at White one
     last time.

                         SCHREBER
               Insect...  dreams...


     EXT.  STREET

     WHITE is running.  As he approaches the building he hears a
     scream  -  looks up to see a figure PLUNGE OFF the roof.

     He runs over.  Looks down at the twisted body.  THE INSPECTOR
     moans  -  barely alive.  White kneels by his side.

     BUMSTEAD'S hand moves across to an expanding POOL of red beside
     him, traces an 'H' on the ground in the blood.

                         WHITE (reading)
               Aitch?

     The inspector seems to be dying, then revives momentarily, puts
     A MAP in white's hand, looks up at him:

                         BUMSTEAD
               Gesundheit!

     His eyes roll up and he GOES LIMP.  White stares at the body,
     then:

                         WHITE
               I didn't sneeze.


     INT.  MORGUE  -  NIGHT

     The MORTICIAN turns off the lights in the main hall and steps
     into his office, sits down, pours himself a hot drink; turns on
     the radio, opens his conic-book.

     A NOISE O.S. disturbs him and he gets up, walks out of his
     office, looks into the darkness.

     HIS P.O.V. PANS around the empty morgue.  Nothing.  Decides to go
     back to his office.  He turns and is startled by three MYSTERY
     MEN obstructing his path.

                         MAN 1
               We are looking for the White victims.

                         MORTICIAN
               And who the hell are you?

     The mortician catches a glimpse of the shiny dagger Man 1 is
     clutching by his side.  He becomes very scared.

                         MORTICIAN
               Over there.  Numbers eight to twelve.

     THREE MEN look over to where the mortician has pointed in
     unison.  Man 1 looks back.

                         MAN 1
               Thank you.

     A FLASH OF STEEL.  The mortician's throat SPOUTS blood.  He grabs
     reflexively at the gash and falls back onto the floor, DEAD
     before he hits the tiles.

     The Mystery Men step to an adjoining chamber.  Man 2 puts down a
     Box he is carrying, opens the lid.  A green glow oozes out.  The
     other Men manipulate levers on a control panel on a nearby
     wall.  Stainless steel doors open.  Body-length trays slide into
     the dim light.  SHAPES covered in white sheets.

     Man 2 with the box removes a GLASS SYRINGE, filled with a
     glowing green liquid.  He steps TO THE BODIES and injects each
     with the syringe, through the sheets.  When he has finished he
     steps back, places the syringe back in the box.  The MEN leave
     silently.

     All is silent and still.

     Then the shape beneath a sheet starts to SIT UP.  Then another,
     and another.


     INT.  CORRIDOR  -  NIGHT

     WHITE is running again, clutching BUMSTEAD'S MAP.

     CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP

     REVEALS the entire corridor.  KEEPS PULLING BACK  -  until the
     view is impossibly wide  -  like a cross-section of the building
     he's in, a doll's house with the roof taken off.  The TINY
     FIGURE runs, amidst a dark network of surrounding rooms and
     passages.

     CONTINUE PULL BACK

     White is no more than a SPECK  -  the hall-way stretches
     ENDLESSLY in both directions, behind and in front of the moving
     figure, through an infinite labyrinth.

     WIDER STILL

     We no longer make out the figure.  The x-rayed environment
     resembles some intricate aerial map of the vast city  -  the
     corridor an ever increasing SPIRAL.


     INT.  ORNATE APARTMENT BUILDING  -  NIGHT

     White reaches the top of a spiral flight of stairs.

     HIS P.O.V.

     APARTMENT 'H'  -  a rusted metal letter on the door.  White steps
     forward.  He knocks once and the door creaks open, unlocked.

     INSIDE

     The rooms are empty, derelict, strewn with rubbish.  Mould grows
     on the damp walls.  A door stands at the end of a long empty
     room.  He can hear the muffled sounds of SURF, SEAGULLS.  White
     starts to walk forward, smiling.  As he approaches the door he
     begins to feel colder.

     He opens the door and looks out.  A blast of SUNLIGHT  -  blue
     ocean and sky.

                         VOICE O.S.
               John White...

     White does not turn about, he takes a step forward, then
     another  - and RUNS INTO THE SKY  - A PAINTED WALL. He glances up
     at a small SPEAKER built into the wall  -  the SOURCE of the sea-
     side SOUND EFFECTS.

     He hears the click of the gun being cocked behind him.  Hopes
     dashed, he turns.  ANGLE ON A MYSTERY MAN  -  a gun pointed at
     White's stomach.

                         MYSTERY MAN
               There is nothing, Mister White.
               Beyond the city.  Never has been.
               Unfortunate.  Yes?

     White is led into a pitch black room.

     INSIDE

     TIGHT ON WHITE'S FACE  -  In the darkness  -  he looks across to
     the Mystery Man standing beside him.

                         WHITE
               How did you know where to find me?

                         MYSTERY MAN
               We knew you would turn up here
               eventually...  Been waiting for you,
               yes.  Hoped you wouldn't make a
               nuisance of yourself on the way...

     The Man motions with the gun for White to walk forward.  As soon
     as White turns to do this, the Man slips from the room and
     shuts the door, cutting off any existing light.

     A NOISE O.S.  -  some kind of machine being turned on  -  lights
     start to come up all over the room.

     It's a normal, average-sized, living room.  All the furniture
     has been removed and replaced with chairs, tables, podiums  -  an
     arrangement resembling an IMPROVISED COURT of law.  In fact,
     White realizes he is standing behind some kind of witness box.

     The apartment is devoid of people, though almost immediately a
     door opens to the side (looks like it would lead to the
     kitchen) and a series of figures step through.  MYSTERY MEN.

     All the MEN take up specific positions around the room, without
     uttering a word, but don't sit.  One MYSTERY MAN opens a curtain
     beneath an arched entrance  -  beyond it, within a very small
     room, stand DOZENS OF PEOPLE, crammed shoulder to shoulder.  The
     people stare at White silently  -  a bizarre gallery of
     spectators.

     An eerie silence falls on the room.

     The kitchen door opens again.  White is shocked to see the
     VICTIMS WALK INTO the room and adopt positions in what is
     obviously the area for the jury.

     The DISEMBOWELED CORPSE OF A WOMAN steps out of the shadows,
     pushing a pram.  Her throat is cut, she is shrouded in a white
     sheet.

     Within the pram is the BABY clutching its own head, with spine
     attached, under its arm.

     Then the mutilated FREDRICK hops out, followed by the three
     brown blood-stained paper parcels containing what is left of
     the YOUNG BOY.

     Finally, his WIFE and the JAPANESE WOMAN, still in passionate
     embrace, take their positions.

     Another door opens  -  a closet. Within stands the figure we have
     only seen as a shadow  -  the elderly MYSTERY MAN with the cane.
     MISTER BLACK slowly reaches above him and pulls at a chain
     hanging from the ceiling  -  the light snaps on inside the
     closet.  Somewhere, a long way off in the same building, a
     toilet is heard flushing.

     He is much older than the rest, carries himself with authority
     as he hobbles across the room to a raised podium, supporting
     his withered body on his cane.  Looks like he will play JUDGE.

     Everyone in the room now sits.  Mister Black looks at White.

     ANGLE ON WHITE  -  He starts to tremble, not so much from fear,
     but cold.

                         MISTER BLACK
               Welcome.

     White just looks at him, still clutching the small notebook
     called:  ANSWERS.

                         MISTER BLACK
               John White, you are to be tried for
               murder, yes.  You wish to confess to
               these crimes now?

     White is silent.  He leans over and scratches his legs through
     the fabric of his trousers.  They itch like crazy.

     Mister Black turns to the assembled people.

                         MISTER BLACK
               Very well.  The testimony of the
               prosecutors.  Yes.

     TWO MYSTERY MEN stand and step across to a wooden easel.  MAN 1
     stands beside it, reveals a series of visuals, charts, etc.
     drawn on stiff cardboard.  MAN 2 uses a pointer while he
     describes the evidence to support their case.

                         MYSTERY MAN 2
               We will show that John White is
               abnormal, a menace to society, a
               dangerous sick individual, and that
               the court should have no mercy in
               finding him guilty and punishable to
               the extreme for his crimes.

     MAN 1 places a large black and white photo blow-up on the
     easel.  It shows White at the door of the JAPANESE WOMAN'S
     apartment, clutching a kitchen knife, covered in blood.

                         MYSTERY MAN 1
               Exhibit A shows the accused leaving
               the scene of his most recent crime,
               yes.  A photo taken by a remote camera
               planted by one of our agents.

     White watches in stunned silence.

     A general murmur of agreement through the room as the point is
     made.  Mister Black turns to the victims, nods his head slowly.

                         MYSTERY MAN 2
               Exhibit B...

     MAN 1 removes a small tape recorder, hands it to MAN 2.

                         MYSTERY MAN 2
               Actual tape recording of accused
               committing aforementioned crime, yes.

     He turns a switch, the reels spin slowly.  A hush fills the
     room.

                         VOICE 1 (sounds like JAPANESE WOMAN)
               No...  Please...

     A scream.

                         VOICE 2 (sounds like White)
               Shut up!

     Another scream.  A ripping sound.

                         VOICE 3 (sounds like his WIFE)
               John!  Don't...

     Another scream.

     White is standing up, involuntarily, he can't listen to this
     any longer.

                         WHITE (a squeak, almost inaudible)
               Stop it!  This is a lie...

     Mister Black turns to White.  The Men testifying stop the tape
     and look at him also.

                         MISTER BLACK
               Something to say?  Ready to confess?

     The Men in the audience turn and all stare at White, as do the
     victims and the spectators in the adjoining room.

                         WHITE (back to a whisper)
               I didn't kill anyone.

                         MISTER BLACK
               Speak up.  Yes.

                         WHITE (finds his voice)
               It's lies.  Everything.

     He grips the barrier before him.

     A SHRIEK from the pram containing the BABY  -  it rocks violently
     from side to side.

     The DISEMBOWELED WOMAN rises from her chair.  She has difficulty
     standing, her limbs stiff.  She looks at White, opens her mouth
     to say something, but no sound comes out.  Instead a tiny RED
     CRAB scuttles out, across her face, and falls to the ground.
     She sits down.

     White is stunned.

                         MISTER BLACK
               Bring the witnesses.

     AN OLDER COUPLE are led out of the kitchen by a Mystery Man.
     Shown to seats behind a podium.  The woman looks sadly at White.

                         MISTER BLACK
               You are the accused's parents?

                         FATHER
               That's right.

                         MOTHER
               Yes.

                         WHITE
               Wait a minute...

                         MISTER SLACK
               You had your turn!  Let them speak.

                         WHITE (angry)
               My parents are supposed to be dead!
               You can't keep changing the damn
               rules like this!  Why go through this
               ridiculous set-up!  Why don't you
               just kill me and be done with it!

                         MISTER BLACK (smiles at parents)
               Please, continue...

                         WHITE
               This is insane!

     He looks over to the victims.

                         WHITE
               It was them, not me.
                    (points at the
                    Mystery Men)
               They killed you.

     Looks back at the Mystery Men.

                         WHITE
               You have invented all this.  History
               is a lie, not just mine, everyone's  -
               a fiction.  You are the authors.

     His knuckles go white as he squeezes tighter on the barrier.

                         MISTER BLACK
               A fanciful idea, Mister White.

                         WHITE
               Everyone has a job  -  a function.  Each
               one teaches you more about your
               invention.  I'm what is called a
               murderer.

     The whole court listens in silence to White's testimony.

                         WHITE
               You've given everybody memories, but
               I missed out.  The Doctor saw to that
               -  played your own game.  And now...

     WHITE looks at the MYSTERY MEN, then back at MISTER BLACK.

                         WHITE
               You're trying to get rid of me.

     There is silence.  Whispers.  Faces staring.

                         WHITE
               Why do I threaten you?  You're scared
               aren't you?

     MISTER BLACK and the gathered MYSTERY MEN look speechless at
     White.  Suddenly everyone bursts into spontaneous LAUGHTER, led
     by Mister Black.

     A terrible cackle fills the room  -  all the MYSTERY MEN laugh
     hysterically, so do the mutilated victims.  The spectators in
     the adjoining room remain silent.

                         MISTER BLACK
               Ah  -  a plot.  Now we have a plot!
                    (chuckling)
               Very inventive...

     The older couple behind the podium look disturbed.

                         MOTHER
               Please, John, you're embarrassing
               us...

                         WHITE
               Shut up!

                         MISTER BLACK (chuckling still)
               You have proof?  Evidence?  Yes?

                         WHITE (holds up notebook)
               It's all here!

     Mister Black seems startled by the book, then pretends it's
     nothing.

                         MISTER BLACK
               A book of delusions.  Anything else?

                         WHITE
               But I...

                         MISTER BLACK
               I see.
                    (turns to the
                    victims)
               The verdict, yes...

                         WHITE
               Wait, this isn't fair...

     The DISEMBOWELED WOMAN stands again.  This time she opens her
     mouth, there is a bubbling noise, water runs out, then:

                         DISEMBOWELED WOMAN (whisper)
               Guil  -  ty...

     White is agitated, fear in his face.  Mister Black stamps SOME
     PAPERS before him repeatedly.

     ON THE PAPERS  -  official-looking documents.  The stamp says:
     GUILTY.

     CLOSE on White's eyes.

                         MISTER BLACK
               Before I pronounce sentence...

     Suddenly the papers on the bench in front of Mister Black BURST
     INTO FLAMES.  Mister Black recoils, almost falling off his
     chair, taken by surprise.  The Mystery Men all look at White, a
     murmur of concern.

     Mister Black looks up at White  -  angered.

                         MISTER BLACK
               How dare you use your tricks on me!

     White, genuinely surprised, looks around.  Several Mystery Men
     BACK AWAY from him, scared.

                         WHITE
               I didn't realise...

                         MISTER BLACK
               Shut up, freak!  Monster!  You are
               insignificant.

     He glares across the room, angrily.  An WOODEN CHAIR in a corner
     starts to vibrate.

     CLOSE on Mister Black's eyes.

     The chair rises into the air  -  HURLS across the room at White.

     Mister Black laughs as it crashes into the wall.  White ducks
     just in time.

     The gathered Mystery Men erupt into enthusiastic applause.

     White regains his composure and tries some mind tricks of his
     own.  He lifts a small table into the air, and makes it spin  -
     a knife and fork dance back and forth on the surface, as several
     plates (from a stack in the kitchen) hurl, firstly at the
     spinning table, then go flying across the room, smashing near
     Mister Black, making him dance back and forth comically.

     This display is accompanied by a rousing rendition of a WALTZ
     playing on a floating gramophone White has also activated with
     his mind.

     SEVERAL Mystery Men are TERRIFIED.  White is amazed at his own
     performance.

                         MISTER BLACK
               You'll regret that.

     Mister Black is furious, spluttering, spit flying from his
     mouth.

                         MISTER BLACK (shouts)
               SHUT IT DOWN!

     A Mystery Man by the window, picks up a phone and dials
     furiously.  Everyone in the room remains silent  -  waiting.

                         MAN ON PHONE
               Yes, we have a problem here.  Shut it
               down immediately.

     White doesn't understand what is going on.  O.S. the SOUND of
     machinery WINDING DOWN.

     ANGLE ON a clock hanging on the wall.  ON the SECOND HAND.  It
     suddenly STOPS.

     All eyes are on Mister Black.

                         MISTER BLACK
               This has all gone too far.  Yes, much
               too far.

     Mister Black starts to SHAKE.  His eyes shut, clenches his
     teeth, grips the insect on his cane, plants his feet firmly to
     the floor.

     Around the room WALLS CRACK, plaster rains down from the
     ceiling...

                                              CUT TO:

     EXT.  CITY  -  NIGHT

     All over the city things START TO FALL APART  -  a devastating
     impact on the landscape.

     MONTAGE

     A street CRACKS OPEN.  Beneath the pavement are pulsating
     intestine-like organs.  These burst open with pus...

     A building vanishes...

     A car on a street corner flies into the air...

     A telephone box STARTS TO SPIN, faster and taster, digging
     itself into the concrete.  Monstrous INSECT LEGS sprout from the
     hole left behind...

     Geysers of STEAMING BILE spurt into the night sky...

     BLACK EXCREMENT forces up out of a sewer, runs down stone
     steps...

     THE CITY is coming apart...

                                              CUT BACK TO:

     INT.  APARTMENT H'

     The room looks like an earthquake hit it  -  broken furniture and
     gaping holes torn in the walls.

     Several MYSTERY MEN huddle behind an upturned table, watching
     WHITE and MISTER BLACK.  They face each other, both still
     standing  - mental energies focused against each other in battle.

     The fighting is taken its toll on both men.

     A DAGGER hangs suspended in mid-air, slowly rotating to face
     White with its shining silver blade.

     Mister Black is clenching his rotting teeth, tightening bony
     fists by his side.  Pushing every ounce of mental power at the
     knife.

     White, bleeding from a gash in his cheek, is straining his mind
     against the knife.

     The blade STARTS TO MOVE, ever so slowly at first, towards
     White.  His body is shaking with his mental effort.  A bead of
     sweat runs down his brow, dripping into his eye, blurring his
     vision.

     He is losing.


     INT.  KITCHEN  -  NIGHT

     We see an OUT OF FOCUS IMAGE.  A group of dark figures.  WHITE
     regains consciousness, strapped to a kitchen table.  From his
     perspective, in the immediate foreground, a figure speaks as he
     removes a syringe from White's FOREHEAD.

                         FIGURE
               Good as new.  Yes.  Everything is
               easier now.

     His vision CLEARS, he can see.  It's MISTER BLACK.  Behind him a
     SMALL CROWD who turn out to be MYSTERY MEN.

     Mister Black suddenly pulls at his own face, removes the mask.

     Underneath is a mess of PULSATING ORGANS AND INSECT PARTS.
     This is what Mystery Men really look like.  He laughs, starts to
     MOVE rhythmically  -  a strange dance-step.  The others join in,
     as they too pull off masks.

     Each Man reaches up to his left ear in unison.  They pull
     squirming INSECTS out, hold them up to the light.  The insects
     scream triumphantly.

     White screams too.  And he can't stop.

     Everything goes BLACK.  Then the sound of a key rattling in a
     lock.  A door slowly creaks open...


     INT.  SEASIDE HOTEL ROOM  -  DAY

     A P.O.V. enters a small room.

     Dappled SUNLIGHT through a tattered lace curtain. A clock ticks
     on a wall.  A cough O.S. from the corridor.  A FAT MAN, talks as
     he enters:

                         FAT MAN
               It's small but clean...
                    (it isn't)
               ...and the view's nice.
                    (points to window)
               Isn't it?

     JOHN WHITE enters.  He is haggard, eyes rimmed with red.  He
     still holds the small black NOTEBOOK, tight to his chest.  He
     stands in the centre of the room, looks up.  Strangely, though
     the room is very small, it extends upwards several stories  -
     windows sit at various heights.

     White walks to the lace curtain, opens it with shaking hands.

     OUTSIDE

     A narrow street and at the end, the ocean.  The sound of distant
     surf, he can taste the salt spray.

                         WHITE (without turning)
               I'll take it.

     The man behind him blows his nose loudly and turns to go,
     shutting the door.  White puts the notebook down on a table near
     the open window.

     LATER

     White has fallen asleep on the bed.

     He wakes, troubled.  Stands and walks over to the sink next to
     the bed.  He moves like he is underwater.  The sea-breeze tugs at
     the curtain, draws him to the window.

     HIS P.O.V.

     Down the street to the small patch of sand between buildings.
     TWO FIGURES  approach each other.

     He pulls out his wallet and removes the torn photo of the
     woman, places it against the pillow on the bed.  He sits on the
     edge of the bed and lifts his trousers, looks at his legs
     nothing out of the ordinary.

     White is disturbed by a TINY MOVEMENT in his coat pocket.  He
     reaches in and pulls out a small, EMACIATED FISH.

     Disgusted, he drops the fish to the floor, looks at the
     creature.  White raise his foot.  His heel comes down with a
     sickening SQUISH.

     THE CAMERA MOVES IN STEADILY towards the notebook near the
     window.  As the SHOT TIGHTENS we can read the title on the
     cover:  ANSWERS  -  BY JONATHAN WHITE, AGE NINE.

     Now a sudden GUST OF WIND blows open the book.  The pages
     flicker past.  Glimpses of happy things.  A child's drawings of
     smiling people.  The sun shining down on a blue ocean full of
     sailing boats.  Fields of colourful flowers.  Cute animals.


     INT.  LONG CORRIDOR  -  DAY

     SOUND OF SURF, distant, muffled.

     CAMERA MOVES slowly towards a door.  The final door  -  no
     others beyond this.  ECHOIC FOOTSTEPS.

     TIGHT ON WHITE  -  His haggard face moves through darkness.  He
     looks down at his walking feet.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  White sees water, waves breaking, through the
     cracks in the floorboards of the hallway.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     The cracks around the closed door are illuminated, white-hot,
     by the SUN outside.

     ON HIS HAND  -  As he reaches towards the handle.

     ON HIS FACE  -  As the door opens.  A sharp line of light cuts
     across his features, as his eyes blink and water.  The wind
     pulls at his messy hair.  SURF NOISE is louder now.

     REVERSE ANGLE  -  WIDER  -  OUTSIDE looking through the door,
     along a long wooden pier jutting out into a blue seascape.  At
     the end of the pier stands the tiny figure of A WOMAN WITH RED
     HAIR.  She looks out at the ocean, her back turned.

     ANGLE LOOKS BACK at White standing in the open doorway, squints
     into the sun.  Suddenly he looks relieved, almost happy for the
     first time.  He steps OUT OF FRAME briskly  -  a weight gone
     from his shoulders.  Everything is clear finally, he knows
     exactly what to do.

     A voice recites names over a P.A. system.

     REVERSE ANGLE

     A TRACKING SHOT follows White, moves down the pier toward the
     woman.  As White steps up to her, she turns and smiles.

                         WOMAN  (indicates the sea)
               Beautiful.

     White nods slowly.  He looks out of place in his crumpled suit.
     He stares out at the ocean.  Seagulls fly over.  Sun reflects
     off waves.

                         WHITE
               Yes...

                         WOMAN
               What's your name?

     He looks at her.  Smiles.  Then, slowly, brings his hands to her
     throat.

                         WHITE
               John...  White.

                             Alex Proyas







                            REVISED DRAFT
                         November 29th, 1992





     DARKNESS

     A LOW RUMBLE increases in volume.


     FADE UP:

     A BLACK-GLOVED HAND wraps around a bulky electrical lever,
     thrusts FORWARD.

     SNAP!  -  Electricity arcs through darkness.

     O.S. sound of MACHINERY turning ON.

     TITLES OVER

     MONTAGE OF CLOCKS starting  -  various.  Second hands turn  -
     TICKING gets louder.


     INT.  BATHROOM  -  NIGHT

     SHADOWS DANCE.  A bare bulb swings from the ceiling revealing:
     clothes on a chair, puddles of water on the floor...

     SLEEPING EYES in and out of darkness.  The eyes open.
     Confusion.

     WIDEN ANGLE ON JONATHAN WHITE  -  a man in his early thirties,
     dark featured.

     He sits up.  Water splashes.  He's in a tub of long cold water.
     His neck aches like he's been sleeping forever.

     He looks down into the murky water around him.  A feint
     movement beneath the surface, something swimming  -  A SMALL
     DARK SHAPE.  Startled, he leaps from the bath.

     ANGLE  -  THE SWINGING LIGHT BULB.  The man's hand reaches up,
     stops the light-bulb mid swing.

     He steps to a circular window.  The glass is cracked, covered
     in grime.  He wipes it, this only smears the dirt.

     It's dark out there.


     EXT.  BUILDING  -  NIGHT

     ANGLE ON WHITE  -  from outside the window, through blurry
     glass.

     A RAPID FLYING P.O.V. PULLS BACK in silence.  The window is a
     SPECK on the side of a vast grey tower.

     BACK IN THE BATHROOM

     White shivers, cold.  He stares down at the puddle he drips on
     the floor.  He looks at his feet and legs, covered with
     numerous SMALL BITES.  He dries the bloody wounds with a towel.

     He picks up the clothes lying on the chair, puts them on.
     Loose trousers with braces, a plain shirt, leathers shoes with
     HOLES in both soles.  In his trouser pocket he finds a key  -
     a room number on a plastic tag.

     He hears splashing in the bath-tub.  He steps over, looks into
     the murky water.  Suddenly a SMALL SILVER FISH leaps from the
     water, lands at his feet, panting heavily and flapping about.

     He leans down, picks the fish up, throws it back into the
     water.

     Like a blind man, he feels the walls, comes to a door in the
     shadows.  He hears something on the other side, hesitates, hand
     inches from the doorknob.  He leans down.

     TIGHT ON HIS EYE

     Blinking through the key-hole.

     P.O.V. OF AN EMPTY ROOM  -  A glimpse of motion  -  the door
     across the room (leading to a corridor?) is shutting.


     INT.  HOTEL ROOM  -  NIGHT

     WHITE pushes the door open, steps into the adjoining room.

     No sign of life.  Cheap decorations.  He walks around
     cautiously.  Turns lights on.  Then reconsiders.  Turns them off
     again.  Disturbed, he studies his features in a wall mirror.

     ANGLE ON OPEN BATHROOM DOOR  -  the fish has jumped from the tub
     again and is flapping on the floor.

     White steps back into the bathroom.  He picks up the fish again,
     doesn't know what to do with it, so he puts it in his pocket.

     BACK IN THE OTHER ROOM

     He searches through things.  A grey overcoat in the closet.  He
     goes through the pockets, finds a WALLET.  No I.D., just a
     laundry bill, some money and a postcard from a sea-side town.

     ANGLE ON A REVOLVER on the bed-side table.  He picks it up, his
     grip tightens on the handle, his finger applies pressure to the
     trigger and...

     BANG!

     The gun goes off.  A BULLET RICOCHETS wildly around the room,
     bounces off the metal bed-head, smashes a vase, embeds itself
     in the wall.

     Startled, he holds the gun away from him like it might go off
     again.  He examines it carefully now.  Opens the chamber.

     TIGHT ON THE GUN  -  Five bullets left.

     He turns the chamber carefully, shuts it, puts the gun in the
     inside pocket of the coat.

     He moves to the bed.  A RIPPED PHOTOGRAPH on the rug.  A
     fragment of a woman's face, her left eye.  He lifts the
     fragment up.  There's handwriting on the back, part of a note:

               ...MEANS THE MOST TO ME.  LOVE YOU
               FOREVER.  -  E...

     The rest is missing.

     He sits on the edge of the bed.  As he does this, he notices
     something else on the floor.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  follows a dark stain on the floorboards, to a
     woman's bare foot behind the bed.  He stands abruptly, fumbles
     across the bed to stare into a dark corner of the room.

     In the shadows he can make out a woman's naked BODY lying in a
     pool of blood.  Her eyes stare lifeless.

     White stumbles back in horror, throws his hands across his
     mouth.


     INT.  HOTEL CORRIDOR  -  NIGHT

     White stumbles from the room, leans against a wall for support.

     Lights flicker.

     At the end of the corridor, elevator doors open.  Light and
     musak flood out.


     INT.  LOBBY  -  NIGHT

     White staggers from the elevator, moves past a deserted front
     desk.  A VOICE from the back room:

                         HOTEL MANAGER O.S.
               Hey, you! You gotta message.

     White stops, looks uncertainly towards a bead curtain.

                         WHITE
               What?

                         MANAGER O.S.
               Message in d'box!  You deaf?

     White sees several nooks for messages and keys in front of him.
     Reaching across the desk, he glances through the bead curtain
     into the manager's office.  TELEVISION SOUNDS O.S.

     HIS P.O.V.

     Hard to see  -  the man sits in the chair, lit by the glow of
     the T.V. set.  White grabs the note, looks at it.  A PHONE
     NUMBER, also his room number, and what appears to be his name:
     JONATHAN WHITE.  That's all.  White thrusts the message in his
     pocket.

                         MANAGER O.S.
               Got my money?

                         WHITE
               What?  I...  How long have I been
               here?

                         MANAGER O.S.
               Jeez, too damn long if you ask me!
               What about the two weeks y'owe me...

     Totally confused, White turns to leave, sees something.  Stops.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  A painting on a wall (cheap print variety)  -
     waves on a beach.  A breeze rustles the pages of a calender,
     pinned beside the picture.
   
     TIGHT ON WHITE  -  MOVE IN on his ear.  O.S. SOUND  -  surf
     crashes on shore.  A WOMAN'S VOICE WHISPERS:

                         VOICE O.S.
               What is your name...  What is your
               name...

     He backs away from the painting, looks about the lobby in panic
     -  sees a sign:  TOILETS.  A painted hand points the way.

                         MANAGER O.S.
               Hey!

                         WHITE (without turning)
               I'll be back later.

                         MANAGER O.S.
               Yeah.  Well, y'better be.
          
     CAMERA REVEALS A FIGURE  -  watching from a shadowy corner of
     the lobby.

     As White runs out, the MYSTERY MAN picks up a pay-phone, dials.
     Whispers into the receiver in a foreign language.


     INT.  CORRIDOR  -  NIGHT

     White pushes shakily through a red door, runs down a corridor.
     Pipes steam and drip water.  He rounds a corner, slips, nearly
     falls.


     INT.  MEN'S ROOM  -  NIGHT

     Puddles on the floor, stains on the walls.

     White bursts through the door and into a cubicle.  He bends
     over a toilet bowl and VOMITS.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     He looks up, wipes his mouth on his sleeve.  A breeze tugs at
     his stringy hair.  A tiny ventilation grill above the cistern
     looks out at the street.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  OUTSIDE

     Sheets of newspaper blow past.  A full moon, surrounded by
     blood red clouds, hangs above empty streets.


     INT.  CINEMA  -  NIGHT

     A WATCH  -  on a hairy wrist.  Seconds tick past.  Soft
     flickering light.  VOICES O.S.

     ANGLE ON FRANK BUMSTEAD  -  police inspector.  He looks down at
     the watch.  Time to leave.  He STANDS, heads for an illuminated
     exit sign.

     Images flicker on a SCREEN.  The inspector rushes to the door,
     runs into an USHER, who gasps.

                         BUMSTEAD (to usher)
               Gesundheit!

     Bumstead quickly moves off.


     INT.  CINEMA LOBBY

     The INSPECTOR makes a call, licks the tip of a pencil,
     scribbles in a notebook.  Behind thick glass, he argues
     soundlessly into a phone.

     BIG IN FOREGROUND  -  a popcorn machine rattles noisily.

     INSIDE THE BOOTH

     The inspector is upset, face strained.  A MALE VOICE chatters
     quickly through the receiver.

                         BUMSTEAD (cuts in)
               ...but you told me the meeting was
               ten-thirty.

     A burst of chatter.

                         BUMSTEAD
               I know, sir, but I can't make it at
               nine-thirty...  It's  -  um  -  well,
               inconvenient...

     A stream of chatter stops him.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Yes, sir...  I understand...  Yes...
               But, I've done fine so far without an
               assistant...

     The inspector tries to interject as the VOICE cuts in again...

                         BUMSTEAD
               But...  But I...  I...
                    (defeated)
               Nine-thirty.  Yes.


     INT.  MEN'S ROOM

     We are underwater.  WHITE's FACE swims into view.  Bubbles spew
     from the mouth,  the eyes stare in horror.

     ANGLE ON MEN'S ROOM

     White washes his face in a sink.  He looks up, wipes his face
     dry with his coat.  He turns towards the door to leave.

     There are TWO  -  identical.  He cannot remember which he came
     through.  Takes a guess, opens one and steps into darkness.

     He realizes he's picked the wrong door, tries to go back but
     the door CLICKS behind him:  locked.


     INT.  CONCRETE TUNNEL

     Pitch black.  Trickling water.  A distant voice over a P.A.
     system recites names, followed by numbers.  A LIGHT, far away.
     White walks towards it.

     He steps into a bare concrete area, a public phone hangs on a
     blank wall.  He pulls a coin from his pocket, puts it in the
     slot, dials the number on his message.  Ringing  -  no answer.

     Suddenly White feels cold.

                         VOICE O.S.
               There you are.

     Startled, White drops the phone and turns.  A figure moves
     forward out of darkness:

     ANGLE ON THE MYSTERY MAN from the hotel lobby.  The stranger
     wears a long black coat, dark glasses, and has extremely pale
     skin.  He is completely bald.  He studies White carefully.

     White glances about nervously  -  walks back up the corridor,
     his eyes pinned to the man.

                         MYSTERY MAN
               You are lost, yes?

     White retreats faster.

     A FLASH OF STEEL  -  a dagger appears by the stranger's side,
     gripped in a black leather glove.  He moves forward, a grin on
     his pale face.

     White stops, backs against the wall.

                         MYSTERY MAN
               Co-operate.  Do not make this
               difficult.

     White panics  -  he's cornered.  He remembers the revolver.  He
     pulls it from his coat and LEVELS it at the stranger, his hand
     shakes terribly.

     ON THE STRANGER continuing to advance.  Something about his
     eyes makes White immobile, unable to think clearly.

                         MYSTERY MAN
               You will not shoot, yes.  There is a
               place in your mind, a corner of
               darkness...

     THE GUN FIRES again and again.  Red splashes appear on the man.
     His shoulder.  His leg.  His neck.  He walks forward, with
     spastic jerks as bullets RIP into him.

     A final shot POINT BLANK into the stranger's forehead.  A
     stream of black liquid spouts from the hole.

     Blue smoke clears.  The man stands motionless, his mouth hangs
     open.  Then his eyes roll up, and he collapses to the ground.


     INT.  MORGUE  -  NIGHT

     CLICKING of new leather shoes, walking, striking tiles.
     INSPECTOR BUMSTEAD strides down a silent corridor.  He reaches
     into his pocket, removes a SURGICAL MASK, places it over his
     nose and mouth.

     WIDER ANGLE

     Bumstead steps up to a bald man with a moustache standing at
     the end of the corridor.  The man, who is dressed identically
     to the inspector, is his superior:  CHIEF-INSPECTOR STROMBOLI.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Good evening, sir.

                         STROMBOLI
               Yes.  This way.

     STROMBOLI leads the inspector into a tiled room containing
     several COVERED BODIES.  The two men are greeted by a cheerful-
     looking MORTICIAN.

                         MORTICIAN
               Welcome, gentlemen.  Youíre early.
               Here for the examination, right?

     Stromboli nods, then ignores the mortician and walks along the
     row of corpses.  Bumstead follows.

                         STROMBOLI
               The handiwork of an extremely sick
               individual.

     He throws back covers to reveal horrible mutilations.

                         STROMBOLI
               Youíve read the reports.  Not much to
               go on.  We know nothing about him,
               except that he likes to cut them...
               Always the same type of blade.
               Forensics match in each case...
               Anyway, it's all in the reports, read
               them for yourself.

     STROMBOLI shakes his head, turns away from the final body,
     looks at the inspector.

                         STROMBOLI
               Why are you wearing that thing on
               your face?

                         BUMSTEAD
               Germs, sir.  These places are full of
               them.

                         STROMBOLI
               I see.
                    (continues)
               One thingís for sure, heís ambitious.
               Youíll be a busy man from now on.

                         MORTICIAN
               You can say that again.

     Stromboli looks annoyed at the smiling man.  The Mortician
     becomes serious and goes back to his work.

                         BUMSTEAD
               What about Thompson, sir?  Wasnít
               this his case?

                         STROMBOLI
               Thompson suffered a kind of severe
               delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway
               he isnít with us any longer.  The
               case is yours.  Go through his files.
               Take what you need.
                    (less business-like)
               By the way, howís your mother?

                         BUMSTEAD
               Sheís getting better, thanks.  She...

                         STROMBOLI (cuts in)
               Very good...

     The chief-inspector turns, paces to the door briskly.

                         STROMBOLI
               Letís go, Bumstead.  So much to do
               and so little time.


     EXT.  BUILDING  -  NIGHT

     A large faded BILLBOARD advertisement on a building facade.  A
     portrait of a smiling woman clutching a product called, "LUMP-
     O"  -  a cereal box carton.

     THE CAMERA MOVES IN STEADILY, rises upwards, CLOSER on the
     womanís face, finally enters a hole at the centre of her
     PAINTED IRIS.


     INT.  STAIR-WELL

     A raftered room on the other side of the billboard.  CAMERA
     TILTS TO a convoluted staircase  -  at the base, the SHADOW OF
     A MAN runs.

     FEET pace rapidly.  TILT UP TO REVEAL  -  WHITE.

     CAMERA FOLLOWS as he tries to lose himself from possible
     pursuers.  He steps through a low archway into a back alley,
     rounds a corner.

     A DEAD-END.  White stops, looks around, then up.  Heís breathing
     heavily, trying to catch his breath.  He starts to shake.

     ABOVE, the walls stretch into darkness.  An OPENING way up
     there  -  he can see stars.  Something dark crosses the gap of
     sky.  A RUSHING NOISE in the distance.  Wind starts to pick up.

     Trash is being kicked up.  A sheet of NEWSPAPER wraps around
     Whiteís leg.  He tries to kick it away repeatedly but it wonít
     come off.  He bends down, grabs it to throw it away, but
     something grabs his eye.

     He stares at the page for a moment  -  then his LEGS SLIP from
     under him and he falls to the ground.  He holds his head like
     itís going to explode.  A whimper deep in his throat.  His body
     is trembling violently.

     PUSH IN TIGHT on the paper on the ground.  A front-page
     headline:  MAN-HUNT CONTINUES FOR SERIAL KILLER!

     White looks up  -  terrified.  The RUSHING NOISE O.S. again.

     HIS P.O.V.

     ON THE WALL facing him, a DOOR has appeared where moments
     before there was nothing.  The door creaks open to reveal
     ANOTHER DOOR WITHIN.  This one extends outwards on the end of a
     lengthening wooden shaft.

     White, stands quickly, thrusts the newspaper into a pocket.
     Tries to side-step the ADVANCING DOOR but itís too late, he can
     only open it and step through, to avoid getting pinned to the
     wall.


     INT.  HOTEL LOBBY  -  NIGHT

     HAND-HELD P.O.V. THROUGH the swaying beads hanging in the back-
     room doorway.  TWO FIGURES peer into the room.

                         FIGURE 1
               We are looking for Jonathan White.

     THE HOTEL MANAGER looks up, moves forward into light:  a squat,
     hunch-backed man with glasses.  He steps through the beads,
     glares at the intruders.

                         MANAGER
               What for?

     ON THE MEN  -  an uncanny resemblance to the one who tried to
     kill White.  Black coats, glasses, pale skin.  Creepy.

     A BLACK GLOVED HAND flashes forward, grips the managerís face
     and doesnít let go.  The manager struggles, gulps for air.
     Heís pushed back heavily against the wall.

                         MAN 1
               Which room is he in?

     The leather glove SQUEEZES, blood trickles from the managerís
     ears, through the fingers.


     INT.  ROOM 43

     ANOTHER (VERY SHORT) FIGURE is searching the room.  He hears
     NOISES O.S. in the corridor, runs to the door, presses against
     the wall.

     ON THE MAN  -  FREDRICK  -  a stunted body, an oversized head,
     thick limbs.  The rest of his features lost in shadow.

     The door swings open, a shaft of light floods the dark room.

     ON THE TWO MYSTERY MEN as they step in and look around.  They
     search the room, knock stuff over.  One of the men kicks at the
     womanís corpse in the corner.  Behind him, Fredrick, still
     hiding near the door, slips into the corridor unnoticed.


     EXT.  FLYING P.O.V.  -  NIGHT

     A FLYING PERSPECTIVE past buildings.  An INSECT-LIKE BUZZING
     O.S.  Way down BELOW, in a canyon of silent buildings, a LONE
     FIGURE walks.


     EXT.  DOWN ON THE STREET

     A breeze pulls at WHITEís hair and coat.  He takes out the
     wallet  -  a few dollars.

     HIS P.O.V. AS HE WALKS

     The city is DEAD.  Empty.  Desolate.  Buildings hang down out
     of black.  Day-time was never invented.

     As he puts the wallet back in his pocket, a BUSINESS CARD he
     hadnít noticed, flutters to the ground.  He stops, picks it up.
     In simple print:  DOCTOR D.P. SCHREBER M.D., a phone number.
     Scribbled handwriting on the back says:  Thursday 0930.

     ON WHITE  -  he glances across the street.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  A cafe.  A broken NEON FISH buzzes above the
     doorway.


     INT.  CHINESE CAFE

     He walks up rickety stairs, into a small room with five or six
     tables.  Empty.  Dirty.  He sits and waits.

     A CLOCK ticks on the wall  -  midnight.  White coughs, for
     attention.

     A NOISE from a doorway.  A SHADOW moves towards him, dragging
     one foot as it walks.  A SMALL ASIAN WOMAN appears and limps to
     his table.  She speaks very quickly IN CHINESE.  He does not
     understand.

     She points to a chalk board on the wall  -  a list of dishes
     also in Chinese, only one in English  -  the last one.  At the
     bottom.  In small print.  "NOODLES".

                         WHITE (nods)
               The noodles.  Iíll have some noodles.

     The old woman rips a YELLOW TICKET from a pad, gives it to
     White.  A number on it.  She points her crooked finger again
     at a SPEAKER BOX above a small serving window in the wall.  A
     greenish fluoro pulses from the room within.

                         WOMAN
               We call.

     She leaves again.

     White looks about the empty room.  Insects are zapped on an
     illuminated DEVICE hanging on the wall.  An old air-conditioner
     RATTLES noisily.

     NOISES from the kitchen  -  voices argue in Chinese, a baby
     cries.  Then SILENCE.

     White removes the newspaper from his coat and spreads it on the
     table.

     He overcomes his fear, starts to read the article.  Leans
     forward, hands trembling.  Without realising, he holds the
     paper OVER A CANDLE burning on the table.  The paper CATCHES
     FIRE, is engulfed.  He drops the flaming page on the table.  Now
     the table-cloth starts to burn.

     White is frantic.  On a nearby table he finds a pitcher of
     water, and dumps this on the flames.  It kills the fire but
     leaves a black hole in the table-cloth.  The paper is ash.

     He moves to another table pretending nothing happened, fans the
     smoke away.


     INT.  POLICE STATION  -  NIGHT

     BUMSTEAD is moving quickly.  He suddenly trips and falls to the
     floor.  He curses under his breath, then looks up.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A door  -  THOMPSON:  DETECTIVE/INSPECTOR on the frosted glass.
     Bumstead stands, pushes into the office.

     INSIDE
 
     A total mess  -  paperwork everywhere, dozens of used coffee
     cups, rotting food in greasy paper bags.  Bumstead shakes his
     head.

                         BUMSTEAD
               A real shame...

     He starts to look around.

     TIGHT ON FILING CABINET  -  a drawer is pulled open.
     Thompsonís files are also a mess.  Bumstead continues to shake
     his head.  He reaches for a file.  A loud SNAP!

                         BUMSTEAD (screams)
               YAAAAAAAAAH!

     He recoils.  A mousetrap has snapped over his fingers.  He
     pulls it off his hand, throws it to the floor, cursing.


     INT.  CHINESE CAFE

     White is still waiting for his food.

     He leans down to scratch an itchy ankle, lifts his trouser leg
     to examine the bites  -  worse, inflamed.  He uses a napkin to
     wipe at the pus.

     AERIAL PERSPECTIVE OF A FLY  -  circling the room, looking down
     on White.

     ON THE FLY  -  It lands on a plate of half eaten food on
     another table.  The creature is some kind of SURVEILLANCE
     DEVICE  -  half insect/half machine.  Itís spying on him.  MOVE
     IN TIGHT as inbuilt camera lenses focus in its head.  It shits
     on the food behind it.

     White is oblivious to this.  Heís finished examining his leg,
     is sitting quietly.  He yawns.  His head nods forward briefly.

     A NOISE.  White looks up.

     A TRAP-DOOR has opened in the ceiling.  Two feet in black
     leather shoes descend from the hole.  A sea breeze blows
     through the room.  The SOUND OF SURF, SEAGULLS CRYING.

     ON Whiteís nose twitching.  He can smell the ocean.

     The WALLPAPER COMES ALIVE  -  like a seething tangle of worms.

     One by one, THREE MEN in black coats lower into the room,
     floating on air.  They pull out knifes, step forward.

     ON WHITE rigid with terror.

     ON THE MEN  -  though their faces cannot be seen clearly in the
     gloom, they too resemble the MAN who confronted White earlier.
     They walk towards him slowly, holding knifes above their heads.
     Ready to attack.  They lean over him, pause dramatically.

                         MAN 1
               Donít fall asleep.
                    (chuckles softly)
               Might never wake, yes.

     This Man turns to the others.  They all smile, then turn back
     to White.

                         MEN (in unison)
               Fifty-six.

     ANOTHER VOICE has been speaking softly  -  now it is louder.
     Repeating:

                         VOICE
               Fifty-six...  Fifty-six...

     ANGLE  -  a chair falls to the floor.

     White leaps up from the table, terrified, disoriented.  Just a
     DREAM  -  he had dozed.

     WIDEN ANGLE  -  The place is still empty.  White glances to the
     serving window.  A DISH waits for him, framed in the glowing
     fluoro square.  He gets it.  A bowl of soupy liquid with
     noodles.  He sits down.

     He is about to start eating  -  realizes he has a fork instead
     of a spoon.  Picking up the bowl again, he heads to the
     kitchen.


     INT.  CORRIDOR

     He takes a door beneath a set of wooden stairs and finds
     himself in another corridor.  He looks about, unsure which
     direction to go in.


     INT.  SERIES OF ROOMS  -  LATER

     White is lost, still holding the soup.

     He moves through a number of RUSTED METAL DOORS that open and
     shut automatically.  Each reveals another room or corridor.
     Deserted spaces long forgotten  -  dusty, crumbling.

     He feels the fish moving about in his pocket, pulls it out and
     looks at it.

     White holds the dying fish in one hand, the bowl of cold soup
     in the other.  Disgusted, he puts the fish into the bowl.


     INT.  CORRIDOR

     A TICKING SOUND O.S.

     White stops.  Looks up.  A large clock suspended from the
     rafters.  A tug at his coat.

     Standing beside him is FREDRICK  -  the little man from Whiteís
     hotel room.

                         FREDRICK (stutters)
               Where have you been?  The doctorís
               been worried about you.

                         WHITE
               What?  Who are you?

     Fredrick looks nervously down the corridor.

                         FREDRICK
               Címon, letís go!  We donít have any
               time.

     The little man grabs Whiteís sleeve, starts to pull him along.

                         WHITE
               Hold it a minute.  Letís start at the
               beginning, huh?

     ANGLE ON  -  the top of a set of stairs in front of them.  Two
     dark figures appear.

     Fredrick looks up at them in horror.

                         FRERICK
               Shit!
                    (looks at White)
               Quick!  Run!

     Both men run like crazy, White awkwardly holding the bowl of
     soup.  They come to a junction, each takes a separate corridor.
     Fredrick finds some stairs, climbs two at a time.

     White climbs INTO FRAME, looks around, finds another corridor.
     The little man is nowhere to be seen.  White reaches another
     junction  -  several corridors branch off.             

     HIS P.O.V. PANNING AROUND                   

     Each passageway completely deserted.        

                         WHITE
               Shit.                                       

     He keeps running.


     INT.  HOTEL LOBBY

     A PHOTO FLASH  -  illuminates the dead body of the hotel manager,
     slumped in his own blood.

     Bumstead leans INTO FRAME, examines the corpse.  He notices
     several stab wounds in the manís abdomen.  Various cops search
     the room.

     One cop walks up to the Inspector.

                         COP
               We got another one upstairs

                         BUMSTEAD (deadpan)
               Great.


     INT.  ROOM  -  NIGHT

     A SMALL ROOM with arched windows that look over the city.
     Fredrick is pulling a notebook and pen from under an upturned
     table.

     He scrawls rapidly, screws the message into a tight tube, then
     puts it into a METAL CYLINDER he finds beneath the table also.

     He glances out a window, notices A FIGURE standing beneath a
     street-lamp below, looking up at him.  Startled, Fredrick darts
     back into shadow, goes to a wall covered in about a dozen
     vertical PIPES running up into the ceiling.

     TIGHT ON ONE OF THE PIPES  -  he opens a small hatch and puts
     the metal cylinder in it.  The cylinder is snatched from his
     hand, sucked into the pipe with a rush of air.

     WIDER

     Fredrick steps back, a sigh of relief.  A shadow falls across
     his back.  He turns.  He screams.

     INT./EXT.  VARIOUS

     TIGHT  -  rushing along lengths of rusted pipe, at blinding
     speed.  The cylinder races around corners.  It clanks and
     grinds.  HURTLES up the side of a building.  THEN PLUMMETS
     underground.  Rushes through darkness.


     EXT.  BRIDGE  -  NIGHT

     THE CAMERA MOVES along a bridge-like structure.  An enclosed
     corridor supported by rotting wooden pylons.  Under the bridge,
     pipes spew sewage into stagnant water.

     ANGLE ON WHITE WALKING  -  seen through a series of illuminated,
     dirty, windows.  He occasionally glances into the bowl he holds
     before him.

     INSIDE

     TIGHT ON the fish swimming weakly in the soup.

     ANGLE ON WHITE  -  He stops, looks up at O.S. SOUND of
     clattering metal.  A pipe runs the length of the corridor  -
     the invisible clanging cylinder races away, into darkness.

     Then the silence is shattered by a piercing series of SCREAMS
     somewhere in the building.  White hurriedly moves towards the
     source.

     ANOTHER CORRIDOR

     White rounds a corner, stops, notices a small rectangular HOLE
     in a wall.  ANOTHER SCREAM, weaker now  -  He runs to the hole
     in the wall and looks through.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A small, very ordered ROOM.  A fake fireplace bathes the room
     in a warm glow.

     White cranes his neck forward, stretches his head through the
     hole.  He can see into an adjoining room to his right  -  two
     dark figures stand over a man on the floor lying in a pool of
     dark crimson.  The man looks up  -  itís Fredrick  -  just as
     both dark figures stab him repeatedly with bloody daggers.  He
     doesnít scream this time, just gags on blood running from his
     mouth.

     Suddenly a sliding door SLAMS onto the back of Whiteís neck,
     traps his head in the hole.  He struggles, tries to free
     himself.  Drops the bowl of soup.  It shatters on the hard
     floor, makes a mess.

     INSIDE THE BATHROOM  -  The killers look up at the smashing
     noise.

     BACK IN THE CORRIDOR  -  White pulls with all his strength.
     The door gives and he stumbles backwards.  He is about to run
     away but glances at the floor.

     The fish is flapping about  -  still alive.


     EXT.  STREET

     White darts from a doorway, trips and falls.  He sprawls at the
     base of sweeping stone steps.  He looks at a building towering
     above him.  Chiselled in the facade, above the entrance:
     LIBRARY.


     INT.  POLICE STATION

     A series of ply-wood SILHOUETTES race through frame.  Stop
     suddenly, mechanically.  LOUD GUNSHOTS.  Chunks of ply-wood
     blast away violently.

     BUMSTEAD is practising his marksmanship.

     A HAND  -  on his shoulder.  He whips around, startled.

     ON MISS CRENSHAW  -  a young, stiff-looking woman.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Dammit!

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Sorry, sir.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Donít ever sneak up on me like that!
               Who are you?

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Patricia Crenshaw.

     She puts out her hand.

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Iím your new assistant.

                         BUMSTEAD
               I didnít requisition a secretary.

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               The Chief-Inspector thought you might
               need a hand.

                         BUMSTEAD (uncertain)
               Oh.

     He takes her hand tentatively.  They shake.

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Iíve taken the liberty and had
               Inspector Thompsonís office searched,
               as I believe you instructed.  All
               clear now, sir.  They found several
               more traps and things were filed
               under pretty strange categories...
               Poor man.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Good.

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               You wonít regret this, sir.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Fine.

     Bumstead moves off.


     INT.  LIBRARY

     White steps into a vast, empty room, stops beneath a big sign
     saying, SILENCE in formal letters.  The place seems abandoned,
     then he notices a hint of movement.  Cigarette smoke snakes
     into the air, a light, across the expanse of polished floor.

     He walks up to an elderly female LIBRARIAN sitting behind a
     desk, smoking, reading.  White looks somewhat distraught still.

                         WHITE
               Keep newspapers here, birth
               certificates, records of deaths, that
               kind of thing?

     The librarian looks up from her book.

                         LIBRARIAN
               Which would you like first?

                         WHITE
               Okay.  Newspapers.

     She takes her glasses off.  Her eyes are TINY, like pin-heads.
     She studies White.

                         LIBRARIAN
               Are you alright?

     He looks around  -  restrained panic.

                         WHITE (looks at the woman)
               Sure.  Iím fine.

                         LIBRARIAN (nods)
               Mmm-hmm.  Stairs at the end of the
               hall.  Third floor.  Turn left.
               Section C-7.  Row 35, near the
               toilets.

     She replaces her glasses, watches White rush away.

                         LIBRARIAN
               Donít mention it...

     She blows her nose into a handkerchief.  The snort ECHOES
     LOUDLY.


     INT.  LIBRARY CORRIDOR

     White rushes down a dark hall lined with bronze statues.  He
     finds section C then walks between towering rows stacked with
     old volumes.  Comes to number 7.

     He follows an arrow past row after row  -  finally finds Row 34
     but then it skips straight to letters again, A, B, C, etc.

     No Row 35.

     He stops and looks around  -  sure enough a door displays a
     small sign:  TOILETS.

     White is sweating profusely.  He now sits on a chair, takes off
     his shoes, rubs his feet.  He pulls a book from a shelf behind
     him, looks about, opens the book and tears several pages out,
     folds them, stuffs them into his shoes to plug up the holes.

     He gets up, tries to backtrack, comes across an elaborate
     diagram of the library interior.  An arrow points to a section
     near a wing labelled:  MAPS.  Near the arrow it says:  YOU ARE
     HERE.

     He keeps walking.

     He finds the door to the maps wing but the door is locked, a
     sign is nailed to it:  WE ARE REMODELLING.  WE APOLOGIZE FOR ANY
     INCONVENIENCE.

     White, annoyed now, tries to force his way in.  Puts his
     shoulder to the door, pushes several times.  It CRUMBLES under
     his weight  -  rotten.

     He finds himself in a DUSTY ROOM.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A narrow room, filled with rows of bookshelves with stacks of
     old newspapers.

     TIGHT ON WHITE  -  he steps forward, pulls a folded newspaper
     off the shelf.  The instant he picks it up, it crumbles to dust
     in his hands.  He picks up another, and another, each in turn
     breaking apart and dissolving to nothingness.


     INT.  DARK CHAMBER  -  NIGHT

     TWO SILHOUETTED FIGURES face each other across a polished black
     table.  They speak in a foreign language.  A phone rings.
     Figure 1 picks up the receiver and listens attentively.

     Figure 2 is involved with various metal shapes he is trying to
     lock together.  A complex puzzle.  He gets impatient with the
     puzzle, dashes it to the floor.

     Figure 1, on the phone, hangs up and writes something.  Hands
     the note to Figure 2, who in turn drops it into A CHUTE.

     CONTROL ROOM

     The note falls from a slot in the wall before Figure 3 (in
     shadow yet again).  He reads from the note over a silver
     microphone, still in the unfamiliar tongue.

     TIGHT ON A SPEAKER  -  his distorted voice.  A final mysterious
     person  -  Figure 4  -  listens to the announcement.  He takes
     a stick and moves a small cut-out figure of a man across a
     board, away from a large grouping of similar cut-outs.  The
     board resembles a planning table in a war-room.

     A HIGH ANGLE as the CAMERA PULL BACKS on the grouping of cut
     out figures.  More and more of them.  Ten.  Twenty.  A hundred.
     A sinister army.


     INT.  INTERSECTING STREET  -  NIGHT

     White is in a phone booth.  He removes the note from his
     pocket, dials.  No answer again.  He dials the OPERATOR.  A
     muffled voice over the line.

                         WHITE
               Iím trying to reach nine zero eight
               triple two.  I canít get through...
                    (beat)
               What?!...
                    (angry)
               Shit!

     He reaches into his pocket, pulls out a coin, puts it into the
     slot.  Heís sweating again.  He wipes his brow with a trembling
     hand.

                         WHITE
               It is?...  Which area is that number
               listed in?...  Is that near the
               ocean?...  The ocean...  Never mind.
               Have a Jonathan White listed?...
               WHITE.  Seventeen?  All Johns?  I
               see...  Never mind.

     He hangs up, then removes the business card he found in his
     wallet.  He is about to dial but decides otherwise.  He steps
     into the street.

     A HIGH ANGLE

     White walks between tall buildings, towards a narrow street
     that branches off into two separate routes.  He stops.  He
     canít decide which branch to take  -  he steps to the left,
     then steps back, takes a few steps to the right, reconsiders
     again...


     INT.  POLICE STATION/BUMSTEADíS OFFICE  -  NIGHT

     TRACK ALONG  -  piles of towering files bursting at the seams
     with paperwork  -  TO FIND Bumstead hunched over notes,
     photographs and files.  His eyes are rimmed with red.  He
     doesnít seem to be getting anywhere.

                         CRENSHAW O.S.
               Coffee?

     He looks up.  The secretary stands in the doorway with another
     big pile of paperwork.

                         BUMSTEAD
               What?  I donít drink coffee.  A cup
               of tea would be good.  Milk and no
               sugar.

     Crenshaw puts the paperwork down on Bumsteadís already
     overcrowded desk.

                         CRENSHAW
               Making progress?

     He looks at her like she just slapped him.

                         BUMSTEAD
               These are the investigations of a
               madman.  He has fabricated an entire
               bizarre paranoid delusion with no
               internal logic whatever.
                    (without looking up)
               This is a mess.  A horrible mess.
                    (looks at her now)
               Itís the second time now.

     Miss Crenshaw looks concerned.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Look at this!

     He holds up a sheet of white paper  -  a report.  The woman
     steps over and looks at it.

                         BUMSTEAD
               You typed this report?

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?

                         BUMSTEAD
               Wrong?  Look at this!

     The woman bends down, adjusts her glasses, examines it.

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               It seems fine.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Fine?  Look here!

     His finger points at the bottom of the page  -  a tiny,
     INSIGNIFICANT ink smudge.

                         BUMSTEAD
               How can I submit this?

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Iím sorry...

                         BUMSTEAD
               Do you wash your hands before you
               type things?

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Why, yes.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Well be more careful, please.

     An embarrassed beat, then:

     RI-I-I-ING!

     Bumstead reaches for the phone but Crenshaw is on it first.

                         CRENSHAW
               Inspector Bumsteadís office...
               Yes...  Yes...

     She cups the receiver with her hand, looks at Bumstead.

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Yes, sir.  The Chief-Inspector said
               he would see you now.


     INT.  POLICE STATION HALL-WAY

     TRACKING SHOT towards a door:  CHIEF-INSPECTOR on the frosted
     glass.  A hand reaches INTO FRAME, knocks twice.

                         STROMBOLI O.S.
               Enter!

     INSIDE

     Bumstead steps into the office  -  finds STROMBOLI wandering
     about the room, distracted, searching for something...

                         STROMBOLI
               What is it?

     He pulls the waste-basket up and empties the contents onto his
     desk, sorts through it.

                         BUMSTEAD
               A formality.  I need to speak with
               Thompson.  Officially I need your
               written permission.

     Stromboli is looking through his desk drawers now.

                         STROMBOLI
               Why do you want to speak to him?

                         BUMSTEAD
               A hunch.  He might be able to...

                         STROMBOLI (from under desk)
               Bumstead, donít be so paranoid.
               Leave him alone  -  heís a sad case.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Itís extremely important to my
               investigation...

                         STROMBOLI
               Iíll be the judge of that.  Anything
               else?

                         BUMSTEAD
               Actually, I was wondering, sir, if
               you could let me have a few uniforms,
               to follow up for me...

                         STROMBOLI O.S. (pokes head above desk)
               Absolutely not.  Up to my ears in
               cases right now  -  canít spare
               anyone.

     Stromboli becomes distracted again  -  stands up, looks behind
     pictures hanging off the walls.  A big sign suspended above his
     desk says, SO MUCH TO DO AND SO LITTLE TIME  -  his motto.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Lost something?

                         STROMBOLI
               What makes you think that!  If you
               would learn to concentrate on facts,
               not get so side-tracked  -  you might
               get things done faster, Bumstead...

     The door clicks shut.  Stromboli looks up  -  the inspector has
     gone.


     EXT.  PLAZA  -  NIGHT

     White walks under stone archways.

     Across an empty plaza is a sign above a door:   DRUGS OPEN 24
     HOURS and in smaller print, recently added beneath:   SHAVE &
     HAIRCUT $5.00.


     INT.  DRUG STORE  -  NIGHT

     White walks between bare, dusty shelves.  Only one shelf
     carries products  -  BOX AFTER BOX OF "LUMP-O".  He moves up to
     a small counter.  A man with thick glasses, dressed like a
     BARBER, is seated there.

                         WHITE
               I need something to keep me awake.

                         BARBER
               Looks like you need a haircut to me.

                         WHITE
               Thanks.  Just some pills.

                         BARBER
               Only two bucks.  Shave as well...

                         WHITE (annoyed now)
               Your sign says you sell drugs  -
               well, Iím here to buy some.  Okay?

                         BARBER
               Relax.  Sure!

     He waves dramatically to a shelf above his head, with several
     bottles of all sorts of different coloured capsules.

                         BARBER
               Tell you what  -  let me cut yer
               hair, give ya watcha need half price.
               Canít argue at that!

                         WHITE (evenly)
               I donít want a haircut.

     LATER

     CAMERA TRACKS OFF a clock on a wall  -  REVEALS WHITE in a
     barber chair.  The BARBER gleefully works on WHITEís hair.  A
     thin OLD GUY in a moth-eaten suit steps from behind a curtain,
     smiles, playing a violin.  Heís passionate but bad.

                         BARBER (talks fast)
               Cut hair when I was in the navy,
               yíknow  -  havenít lost the touch.
               Bet youíre happy ëbout that.  Huh!

                         WHITE
               Sell maps?

                         BARBER
               What of?

                         WHITE
               The city.  I need to get to the
               ocean.

                         BARBER
               Nope.  No maps.  Ocean, huh?  On
               vacation?

     White doesnít answer.  The old guy with the violin moves back
     and forth behind White, smiling as he plays.

                         BARBER
               Grandpa thought customers might like
               some mood music.

                         WHITE (unconvinced)
               Nice...

                         BARBER
               You still look familiar.  Itís
               driving me nuts!  Sure I donít know
               ya from somewhere?

                         WHITE (nervous now)
               Not me.

     Barber looks out the front window as his hands busily trim
     hair.

                         BARBER
               Mnunn.  Cold lately.
                    (lathers up Whiteís
                    face)
               That night, couple weeks ago.  That
               was real cold.  Remember that?

                         WHITE
               Not really...

                         BARBER
               Yeah, Iím like that.  Senility says
               the wife.  But she sure canít
               complain.  Heh.  The erector set still
               works good.
                    (points to head)
               And this ainít no fucking rug!
               Gíhead.  Feel it!  All mine!

     Grandpa laughs and plays louder.

                         GRANDPA
               Yes! Feeeeel it!

     PUSH IN ON WHITE  -  he smiles weakly.


     INT.  DETAIL  -  NIGHT

     A HAND scrawls cryptic diagrams into a notebook.

     PULL OUT TO REVEAL

     DOCTOR SCHREBER at his desk.  Heís bearded, with thick lensed
     glasses.  He puts the phone down, sits quietly at his desk,
     staring into space, lost in thought.

     A LOUD RATTLING NOISE FILLS THE ROOM.  Schreber looks up.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A rusted pipe runs across the ceiling and down one wall.  He
     steps across to the pipe on the wall, leans down, looks into an
     open hatch at its base.

     Without warning, out of the hatch pops the metal cylinder FROM
     SEVERAL SCENES PREVIOUS and bounces off the doctor's head.

     He curses, picks it up, opens it.  He plucks out the note and
     reads FREDRICKís SCRAWLED MESSAGE:

               DOCTOR, I DID AS YOU ASKED.  BUT
               THINK I MADE STUPID MISTAKE.  HOPE
               THINGS DONíT GET BACK TO YOU.  SORRY.
               -  FREDRICK.

     Schreber looks up  -  then PUNCHES HIS FIST into the desk
     angrily.


     INT.  EMPTY BUILDING

     A P.O.V. MOVES DOWN halls made of wood slatting  -  the floors,
     walls and ceilings are bare boards.  FOOTSTEPS O.S.

     TIGHT ON  -  a manís shadow as it descends a wooden staircase.

     REVEAL WHITE  -  He rummages in a paper bag as he walks.  Pulls
     out two capsules, swallows them.  Now he pulls out a pack of
     "LUMP-O", rips it open, eats ravenously.


     EXT.  STREET  -  NIGHT

     White steps out into a street, turns a corner, drops the empty
     packet of cereal.  Now he sees TWO FIGURES APPROACH.  He hides
     behind a wall before he is seen.  Suddenly a deafening RINGING
     startles him.  He looks across a plaza.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  A CHURCH.  A bell-tower, black against the sky.

     White stares up into the night.


     INT. CHURCH - NIGHT

     White walks in, sits on A PEW, towards the back of the room,
     glances over his shoulder.  He tries to blend in with the SMALL
     GATHERING OF PEOPLE sitting silently around him.

     A PRIEST  -  appears at the altar, cloaked in a blood-red robe,
     followed by two altar boys also in red.  They move past a
     statue of an insect-like creature, walk in circles chanting
     softly, stop and stare at the congregation through eye-slits in
     their hoods.  The priest begins his sermon.

                         PRIEST
               Beware!  The night is deadly.  There
               is a criminal among us.

     White looks forward.

     TIGHT ON the priestís hand  -  It rises, points, moves over the
     heads of the congregation, accusingly.  Suddenly the red finger
     jabs towards an OLD WOMAN in the front row.

                         PRIEST
               It could be she!  The innocent across
               the street!

     All the congregation turn and stare at the woman.  Sheís
     terrified.

     The hand moves slowly now, across to a BEAUTIFUL JAPANESE WOMAN
     several rows back.

                         PRIEST
               Or the temptress next door!

     The priest pauses dramatically then:

                         PRIEST
               Or mister nervy stranger at the back!

     Suddenly the finger is pointing at White. All the faces turn,
     stare suspiciously at White.

     ANGLE ON WHITE  -  frozen with fright.  Fortunately his face is
     obscured by shadow and the priest lowers his hand, continues
     the sermon.  The people look away.

                         PRIEST
               You are thinking it could be anyone?
               And youíre right!  Why, it could even
               be Mother!

     White goes to leave.  As he stands he notices the DOORS of the
     church open  -  two figures step in and move into the candle-
     light.

     MYSTERY MEN  -  Whiteís bizarre pursuers.  They look around.

     White ducks down, crawls between pews, startling several of the
     congregation.  He motions to them to keep quiet.  He runs into
     the legs of the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN the priest pointed out.  She is
     startled momentarily but looks down at him, smiles.

                         PRIEST (continues sermon)
               Evil stalks our streets.  It seeks to
               hide in our hearts.  Have you not
               evil within you now?

     White sees a nearby CONFESSION BOX.  Staying low, he runs,
     almost knocks over a large illuminated candle-holder, darts
     inside.  The girl watches him.

     A GAUNT-FACED WOMAN stands.  Hysterical.  She looks at the
     priest.

                         GAUNT WOMAN
               He took my little boy!  Iíll rip out
               his eyes!

     INSIDE  -  White breaths relief.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  carved on the dark stained wood in front of him
     is a crucified insect.  A voice surprises him.  Another PRIEST,
     OLDER.

                         OLDER PRIEST
               You have sinned?

                         WHITE
               NO.  Ah...

     White watches the two Mystery Men walk past, through the ornate
     wooden grill in front of his face.

                         PRIEST
               I am listening.

                         WHITE (lying)
               Thereís a...  woman.  I don't know
               but I think I, ahh...

                         PRIEST
               You fornicated?

     The Mystery Men look towards the box for a moment, towards
     White, but keep walking.

                         WHITE
               No.  I, ah...

                         PRIEST
               You seem restless.

     The Mystery Men seem to have gone.  White takes out the gun,
     keeping it hidden from the priest.  Opens the chamber.

     TIGHT ON THE GUN  -  Only ONE BULLET left.

                         WHITE
               Someoneís after me.

                         PRIEST
               Then we must call the police.

                         WHITE
               No.  I mean...  that isnít necessary.

     The silhouette on the other side of the box leans forward.

                         PRIEST
               I see.  Then who is after you?  What
               sins have you committed?

                         WHITE
               Just let me sit here for a moment?
               Iíll go soon, and stop bothering you.

     The priest suddenly stares incredulously at White.  His eyes
     widen in horror.

                         PRIEST
               Youíre the murderer?
                    (starts to yell)
               Yes!  That must be it!  Donít kill
               me!

     White lunges, grabs his collar with one hand, slaps the other
     over his mouth.  The old man stares at him, trembling
     uncontrollably.

                         WHITE
               Shut up!  Listen.  Walk out quietly.
                    (holds up gun)
               Understand?

     The priest nods stupidly.  White pushes him out of the
     confession box, grabs his coat from behind, puts the gun to his
     back.  Together they head for the doors.  Still no sign of the
     Mystery Men.

                         PRIEST
               Donít kill me!

                         WHITE
               Shut up!

                         PRIEST
               Please...

     White loses his temper, grabs the priest, shakes him violently.

                         WHITE (not so quietly)
               Iím not going to kill you, okay!

     Faces turn.

     The priest kicks White in the leg, bites his hand.  While White
     is wincing in pain, the priest breaks away.

                         PRIEST (shouting/pointing)
               CRIMINAL!

     People start to scream and run.  The GAUNT WOMAN points at
     White.

                         GAUNT WOMAN (screams insanely)
               Itís him!  Rip out his eyes!

     Frightened, White holds the gun out.  Everyone panics,
     scatters.  People run for the exit.  Religious statues topple
     and smash.  The gaunt woman is pushed screaming to the floor,
     trampled by the crowd.

     Amidst the chaos, the two MYSTERY MEN appear across the room,
     see White, head towards him.  He turns and runs.

     A STAIRCASE

     White climbs narrow stairs rapidly.


     INT.  BELL TOWER

     White stops, nowhere left to go, just a long drop to the street
     through a series of arched windows.  A low, raftered room,
     three huge black BELLS.

     Suddenly a groan of gears in the ceiling and the bells start to
     swing, build momentum.

     CLANG!  CLA-A-A-ANG!  A cacophony of noise.

     White puts his hands over his ears in pain, then turns to the
     stairs.

     HIS P.O.V.

     Through the swinging bells  -  the MYSTERY MEN climb the last
     few steps on the other end of the dark room.  They advance
     slowly, clutching daggers.

     White raises his gun.  Aims.  Difficult to find his target  -
     the approaching MEN are obscured by the bells.

     White steps sideways, never taking his eyes off the Men.  They
     follow him slowly, pivoting about the bells in the centre of
     the tower, pursuers and pursued remaining a semi-circle apart.

                         WHITE (shouts)
               What do you want?  Tell me!

     The Men stop.  So does White.  They separate, now approaching
     him from OPPOSITE sides, moving around the bells.

     White doesnít know who to point the gun at  -  he swings back
     and forth, one to the other, faster and faster, as the Men
     approach.

     He lets them get uncomfortably close, then swings to his right,
     thrusts the gun to one Manís forehead.  FIRES.  The Man steps
     back, spouting liquid from the bullet hole, hits a low railing,
     FALLS into the shaft at the centre of the tower.

     The second Man SWINGS his dagger at White.

     White falls backwards, dropping his gun clumsily.  The Man
     advances, smiling  -  kicks the gun across the wooden floor.

     White, clutching at straws, lifts his foot, kicks down hard on
     a loose floorboard.  The board flies up, pivoting against
     Whiteís heel, catches the Mystery Man with a CRACK under the
     chin.

     White runs at the off-balance Man, head-butts him in the
     stomach.  The Man recoils, canít stop, steps off backwards into
     space, PLUMMETS INTO DARKNESS towards the street below.

     White relieved, turns, dusts himself, picks up his gun.  Looks
     down at the floor.  Broken glass and capsules everywhere  -  he
     dropped the bottle of pills during the scuffle.  Starts to pick
     them up.

     Behind him SOMETHING is rising.

     The shadowy Mystery Man is LEVITATING HIMSELF back up to the
     bell-tower.  He lands behind White, approaches, lifting his
     dagger, closer and closer.

     White glances around.

     The Man lunges, pushing White towards the shaft beneath the
     swinging bells.  White FALLS, dangles over dark space, the Man
     stands above him.

                         MYSTERY MAN (shouts)
               Do not make us hurt you...

     The bells are swinging very close to the Man.

                         MYSTERY MAN
               It will be inconvenient, yes...

     Suddenly, to Whiteís amazement, the shiny black rim of a bell
     clips the Manís head.  SLAMS it against a low wooden beam in
     the ceiling.  A splash of black liquid.  The Man slumps to the
     ground, his head crushed beyond recognition.

     White pulls himself up  -  stands over the Manís body, trying
     to decide what to do.  A MOVEMENT catches his eye.

     TIGHT ON the collapsed Manís ear  -  something moves inside.  A
     BLACK INSECT, half-dead, crawls out of his crushed head.

     White revolted, SQUASHES the insect under his shoe.


     EXT./INT.  VARIOUS  -  MONTAGE

     RAPID MOVE ACROSS MYSTERY MEN screaming.  Faces contort with
     pain.  INTERCUT WITH:

     Electricity ARCING between electrodes.

     A building against the sky.  The windows EXPLODE.  Glass blows
     out, raining down on the street.

     A concrete wall SPLITS OPEN.  Slime oozes through the crack.

     An old man, walks on a deserted street, looks up at the sky.
     One of the lenses of his spectacles CRACKS without warning.
     A chair falls over in a dark room.

     A woman under a hair-dryer gossips on a phone.  Suddenly the
     phone emits a high-pitched shriek.  Her ear spouts blood and
     she screams.

     A small transistor radio emits a high frequency and short
     circuits with a spark.


     EXT.  BUILDING

     TIGHT ON  -  a wristwatch spinning backwards rapidly  -
     completely haywire.

     INSPECTOR BUMSTEAD stands on a street corner staring blankly at
     his watch.  Taps it several times, annoyed, then looks up at a
     THREE STOREY BUILDING.  He holds a piece of paper in his other
     hand  -  on it a number rapidly scrawled:  23.

     HIS P.O.V.

     The dilapidated building  -  arched windows only on the topmost
     floor.  A faded number on the facade  -  also 23.  The windows
     light up continuously with rapid bursts of white light.

     INSIDE

     The inspector climbs a staircase, enters a dark room.

     TWO FIGURES move about.  Bumstead glances at a UNIFORMED MAN,
     standing beside a fake fire, who acknowledges his arrival.

     To the side, A POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER flashes something swinging
     back and forth, hanging from the ceiling.  It looks like...
     Fredrick.  Dead.  His arms and legs missing.  A pool of blood
     beneath the mutilated torso.

     Bumstead looks at the cop.

                         BUMSTEAD
               How long have you been here?

                         COP
               Maybe ten minutes...
                    (looks at his watch)
               Thatís strange.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Spinning backwards?

     The cop is shaking his watch, tapping it with his finger.  He
     looks up.  Bumstead indicates his own watch.

                         COP
               Yours too?

     Bumstead nods.  He removes a notebook from his pocket, walks
     about the room, glances at objects, makes notes.

     Bumstead steps over to a small RECTANGULAR HOLE in the wall.
     He examines it carefully, then bends down and puts his head
     through.  On the other side is a corridor snaking off into
     darkness.  Just beneath the hole, is a broken dish and a
     puddle.  Lying half in the puddle is the business card of
     Doctor D.P. Schreber M.D.

     Without removing his head from the hole he shouts to the nearby
     cop.

                         BUMSTEAD
               I want prints over here...

     Suddenly the door has caught Bumsteadís head in it.  He
     struggles.  The cop and the photographer run over to help.


     EXT.  BUILDING  -  NIGHT

     MOVE IN ON a doorway.  Above it a small illuminated red sign:

     DOCTOR D.P. SCHREBER M.D.

     REVERSE ANGLE ON WHITE

     He stands on the street, under the sign, rummaging in his
     wallet, obviously looking for the business card he doesnít have
     anymore.


     INT.  WAITING ROOM

     A white room, bare.  Dirt stains the walls near the air-vents.
     A NURSE is typing behind her desk.

     A THUMPING fills the room.  The nurse stands, removes her shoe
     and hits a pipe running along the wall several times.  The
     noise stops.

     The front door creaks open and White enters.  She watches him
     step into the room.

                         WHITE
               I want to see the doctor.  It's
               important.

                         NURSE
               What time was your appointment?

                         WHITE (angry)
               Look!  Tell him I'm here.  Now.

     He's leaning across her desk threateningly.

                         NURSE (scared/standing)
               Yes, certainly...  Who should I say?

                         WHITE
               No idea.  Just get him...

     Suddenly a door opens and DOCTOR SCHREBER, clutching a file of
     papers, steps out.  He freezes, stares at White.  The papers
     fall from his hands to the floor.


     INT.  DARK CHAMBER  -  NIGHT

     A group of DARK SILHOUETTES file into a concrete room.

     The MYSTERY MEN have gathered.  Like the Men who pursue White,
     they wear coats, leather gloves, dark glasses, and have near
     white skin.

     One MAN points to diagrams on a chalk board and speaks in the
     peculiar foreign tongue.

     TIGHT ON THE DIAGRAM  -  a path through the city.  A circle
     marks the point where the red line ends  -  a cathedral.  The
     Man goes into broken English  -  a guttural accent.

                         MAN 1
               It has failed.

     ANOTHER MAN stands at the rear of the room.

                         MAN 2
               This is becoming dangerous, yes!

     YET ANOTHER MAN starts to tremble violently, seized with some
     kind of convulsion.  He froths at the mouth and throws his head
     about.  A TALLER MAN standing beside him opens a silver box,
     removes a small WRITHING WORM.  He places this on the tip of
     the trembling Man's tongue, who swallows it and calms down.

                         MAN 3
               Let's get this over with.

     ANOTHER MAN rises suddenly, pushes forcefully to the front of
     the group.

                         MAN 5
               What about the dance-steps!  This is
               my responsibility, we must resolve
               this issue, yes?

     THE MEN turn to face him.  He is out of line.  He becomes
     irritated, as if to say something further, then pulls himself
     short, sits down.

                         MAN 5
               Sorry.

                         MAN 3
               The situation has changed.
                    (pacing the room)
               This one is in possession of
               knowledge...

                         MAN 1 (cuts in)
               ...to avoid influence, yes.

                         MAN 4
               A freak!

                         MAN 1
               Impossible!

     RUMBLING NOISE O.S. attracts everyone's attention.  They all
     look to a round portal high on a wall.  The noise is louder.
     several figures on stilts run past outside the opening  -  then
     the noise subsides.  The MYSTERY MEN go back to more important
     things.

                         MAN 3
               It gets interesting, yes.

                         MAN 2
               Stop this!  It has gone too far!
               Tell Mister Black!

     Man 2 stares blankly into space, he makes a peculiar clicking
     noise with his mouth, his eyes roll upwards.


     INT.  DOCTOR'S OFFICE

     THE CAMERA GLIDES down a corridor, towards a door  -  a sign
     says, DOCTOR IS:  IN.

     INSIDE

     White sits in a leather chair across from an ornate wooden
     desk.  THE DOCTOR paces up and down in front of glass jars
     containing preserved specimens.  He stops, looks at White.

                         SCHREBER
               You remember nothing?  Who you are?
               What you've done?

                         WHITE
               You know something about me?

                         SCHREBER
               Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't
               it?
                    (smiles)
               Is there nothing you remember?  Not
               even a detail?   You must try.

                         WHITE
               You think I haven't been trying!
                    (calms himself)
               It's like there was never anything
               there.
                    (pauses)
               Just water.

                         SCHREBER
               Water?

                         WHITE
               Waves...  A beach.  A woman
               whispering.  That's all.
                    (looks up, yawns)
               I need to stay awake.  Do you have
               any pills?

     The doctor walks to a glass cabinet and removes a bottle, takes
     out two green capsules.  Hands them to White.  Sits behind the
     desk again.

                         SCHREBER
               What does she say?  The woman.

                         WHITE
               Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just
               like a broken record.  Only thing is,
               I can't answer.  I've no idea what my
               name is.

                         SCHREBER
               Your name is John White.

                         WHITE
               That's what people keep telling me.

     Te doctor walks to a small sink in the corner, returns, hands
     White a glass of water.  White swallows the pills.

                         SCHREBER  (indicates pills)
               And what's this about?  Why?

     White stands up, starts to pace nervously.

                         SCHREBER
               Bad dreams?

                         WHITE
               Yes.

                         SCHREBER
               Tell me about them...

                         WHITE (interrupts)
               Yeah well, why don't I ask some
               questions for a change.

                         SCHREBER
               If you like.

                         WHITE
               You're supposed to be my doctor,
               right?

                         SCHREBER
               That's right.  I am your doctor.

     White is very agitated now, his voice is getting edgy.

                         WHITE
               Known me for long?

                        SCHREBER
               Well...

                         WHITE (cuts in)
               Am I a killer?

                         SCHREBER
               I cannot say...  You don't know the
               answer to that?

                         WHITE
               I told you, I can't remember a thing!

     White reaches across abruptly, GRABS the doctor.

                         WHITE  (angry now  -  shouting)
               Look, you know something about me,
               out with it!  Let's end this
               bullshit!  I want answers!

     The doctor is obviously scared.

                         SCHREBER
               We won't get anywhere like this.
               Please.  Let's take things in easy
               steps...


     INT.  BUMSTEAD'S APARTMENT/KITCHEN  -  NIGHT

     TIGHT ON DRAWING PINS  -  Being pushed into a map.  A seeming
     random pattern across the terrain of the city.  Each pin is
     labelled:  VICTIM 1, VICTIM 2,...  etc.

     WIDER ON BUMSTEAD

     He's tired, like he hasn't slept.  He's looking at the map
     stuck to a wall.  There's several neat piles of folders on the
     kitchen table in front of him.  The kitchen itself is
     incredibly neat  -  everything completely organized.

     Bumstead shakes his head slowly, turns away from the board.
     Picks up a cup of hot tea, pours milk into it from a small jar.

     TIGHT ON THE TEA CUP  -  Cream SWIRLS into a rapidly dissolving
     spiral.  Bumstead looks up.  Puts down the cup hurriedly, turns
     back to the map.

     With a thick pen he traces a line between each point marking
     the location of the victims.  He steps back to examine his
     handiwork.

     A SPIRAL  -  moving outwards.  Beyond the last victim it
     becomes a dotted line, following the same trajectory but with a
     big question mark beside it.

     Bumstead glances over to a blackboard with a list of names and
     addresses on it.  He holds up the doctor's card and stares at
     it.  He turns it over, notices an address on the back.


     INT.  DOCTOR SCHREBER'S OFFICE  -  NIGHT

     SCHREBER is showing WHITE a series of CHARTS.  The doctor seems
     nervous about White's potential for further violence.

                         SCHREBER
               Put simply...  a penetration of the
               left parieto-occipital area of the
               cranium...  complicated by
               inflammation that resulted in
               adhesions of the brain to the
               meninges.  Without going into
               detail...  the formation of scar
               tissue altered the configuration of
               the lateral ventricles, producing
               incipient atrophy of the medulla...

                         WHITE (cuts in)
               Look.  It was a simple question.  Can
               someone kill and not remember it?

                         SCHREBER (smiles)
               I'm sorry.  I get carried away
               sometimes.  Possible?  I'm...  ah,
               afraid so.

                         WHITE
               Did she drown?  The woman you told me
               about?

                         SCHREBER
               Not exactly.  She was found in a
               canal, disembowelled.  Throat cut.
               Blood drained.  The body wrapped in a
               bed-sheet.

     White shakes his head, looking blankly at the doctor.

                         WHITE
               Horrible...

                         SCHREBER
               You remember nothing, eh?
                    (shakes his head)
               Let me show you something.

     Schreber turns, points to DOUBLE-DOORS.  He walks towards
     these.  White follows.

                         SCHREBER
               Formation of memories is the most
               important of brain functions.

     THE DOORS ARE OPENED

     They step into a room of living animal experiments.

                         SCHREBER
               We are little more than a sum of
               memories.  From them we reference who
               we are, where we're going.  Without a
               past we are nothing.  This is why you
               are so interesting.

                         WHITE
               I'm nothing then.

                         SCHREBER
               Anything but, my friend.

     The two men look down on a monkey with the top of its head
     missing, squirming in a mechanical device that restricts its
     movements.

                         SCHREBER
               It feels no pain.

     White turns and starts to pace away.  Schreber reluctantly
     follows.

                         WHITE
               Can I get my life back?

                         SCHREBER
               Maybe.

     Schreber points dramatically at a wooden structure containing
     two rats.

                         SCHREBER
               We know of two kinds of memory.
               Firstly, declarative memory.

     The rats perform various activities involving mazes and
     geometric symbols.  Schreber turns to look at White, eyebrow
     raised.

                         SCHREBER
               And then there is procedural memory.

     TIGHT ON HIS SLENDER FINGER  -  pointing to a machine also run
     by rats.  The object is to make it through a guillotine device.
     One rat is successful, the other is chopped neatly in two.

                         SCHREBER
               Follow?

     White nods.

                         SCHREBER
               Research on simple animals can be...
               useful.  To show us where memory
               storing systems are located, for
               example.  I am building an experiment
               with hamsters next.
                    (looks at nearby cage
                    of hamsters)
               Cute little things.

     Schreber puts a hand on White's shoulder.

                         SCHREBER
               Listen to me talk!  You must be
               hungry.

     White nods again, extremely troubled.


     INT.  HALL-WAY (DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE)

     Schreber's office is an annex of his living quarters  -  a
     maze-like series of rooms and halls.  White is led down a dark
     hall by Schreber, clutching a candle.

                         SCHREBER
               Whole damn wing lost power.  Wiring's
               old.  Keep meaning to get it fixed.
               Here we are.

     They've stopped outside a flaking door.


     INT.  KITCHEN

     A small eat-in kitchen.  Dirty and run-down.  White, sits at a
     bench, as Schreber removes items from the refrigerator.  The
     doctor holds up a large FROZEN fish.

                         SCHREBER
               Ah.  Beautiful!  Head and all!  Just
               how I like 'em!

     ANGLE ON FRYING PAN ON STOVE  -  The fish lands in it and starts
     to sizzle furiously.

     ANGLE ON WHITE

                         WHITE
               I'm sorry.  About before.

                         SCHREBER
               I don't blame you for getting angry.
               You are in a frustrating situation.
               You must be patient though.  Trust me
               completely.  I'm here to help.

     A set of swinging doors on the other side of the room open
     slightly and THE NURSE looks in.

                         NURSE (to Schreber)
               I have to talk to you.

                         SCHREBER
               It can't wait?

     She shakes her head, with a serious expression, then darts out
     again.

                         SCHREBER  (to White)
               Excuse me.  Ah, make yourself at
               home.

     He leaves.

     Alone, White looks around the bleak room.  He takes off his
     coat and sits down again.  He removes the FISH.  The eye opens.
     The creature looks up at him.  It breaths painfully.

                         WHITE
               Still kicking, huh?

     He puts it back in his pocket.

     The OTHER fish is spattering oil everywhere.  Smoke starts to
     fill the room.  White, steps over and looks at the frying pan.
     The fish is turning black.  He turns the heat down.

     He notices a SMALL HOLE in the wall.  At eye height.  He steps
     across, looks through.

     TIGHT ON WHITE'S eye through the hole.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A dark room.  Shadows on the wall.  Something wet, some kind of
     ANIMAL, moving in the darkness.  He can hear breathing and
     whispering voices.

     White's eyes start to blur, he rubs them.

                         SCHREBER O.S.
               How are things in here?

     White spins, like he's caught doing something wrong.  The
     Doctor walks across to the stove, prods the frying fish with a
     fork.

                         SCHREBER
               Ah, nearly done.  So tell me about
               your dreams.  I'm very interested.

     White is having a hard time focusing.

                         WHITE
               Just the typical fabrications of a
               distorted mind.  You know, chased by
               mysterious men in black, that kind of
               thing...

     WHITE'S P.O.V.  -  ANGLE ON Schreber with his back turned, at
     the stove.  THE IMAGE is blurring.

                         SCHREBER
               Ah, our friends in black...  they are
               not just a figment of your
               imagination you know, in fact none of
               what you are experiencing is anything
               but real.

     Smoke rises thickly around the doctor.

                         SCHREBER
               I know everything about you.  You
               have no choice but to trust me.

     Flames are shooting up around Schreber from the frying pan.
     His arms catch fire, and he suddenly spins around clutching
     flaming daggers in both hands, his whole body engulfed in fire,
     his face charred, black flesh hanging off his skull.

                         SCHREBER
               Scarey, isn't it?

     White startles awake.

     Schreber stands at the stove looking at White.  Everything is
     normal.

                         SCHREBER
               Are you feeling alright?

     White stands awkwardly, pulls his coat on.

                         SCHREBER
               What are you doing?

                         WHITE
               I have to go...

                         SCHREBER
               You can't go yet.  We've got so much
               to talk about...

     Suddenly White feels feint  -  leans against the wall to steady
     himself.

                         SCHREBER
               You're tired.  You need to lie down.

     ON WHITE  -  swaying.

                         WHITE
               Those pills...

     HIS P.O.V.

     The scene is distorted  -  like looking through water.  Things
     start SPINNING.

                         SCHREBER (echoic)
               Yes.  A little something to help you
               relax.  Harmless...

     A tile floor RISES rapidly TOWARDS CAMERA.

                                              CUT TO:

     GREY LIMBO

     Objects float underwater.  They rise upwards amidst bubbles,
     break the surface.  A storm at sea  -  dismembered BODY PARTS
     float all the way to the horizon.

     TWO FOETUSES in separate jars are talking to each other through
     the glass.

                         FOETUS 1
               This is madness.  If we're caught...

                         FOETUS 2
               Shut-up.  Help me with these
               straps...


     INT.  EXAMINATION ROOM

     WHITE wakes strapped to an exantination table.  SCHREBER and the
     NURSE loom above him.  The nurse hands Schreber a long, chrome
     SYRINGE.  The doctor moves towards White.

                         SCHREBER (holds syringe up)
               Now you must relax, Anton.

     A DOOR-BELL RINGS O.S. The nurse makes for the door.

                         SCHREBER
               Leave it!

     He's tapping the side of the syringe, squirting out air
     bubbles.  THE DOOR-BELL RINGS again  -  very insistent.
     Schreber looks at the nurse, annoyed.

                         SCHREBER
               Damn!  Whoever it is  -  get rid of
               them!

     She heads to the door  -  turns back.

                         NURSE
               Keys.

     Schreber puts the syringe down, fumbles in his pocket, pulls
     out a huge collection of KEYS on a ring, walks to the nurse,
     hands them to her.

     White manages to wriggle a hand free from the leather strap
     holding him.  The nurse leaves, the doctor shuts the door,
     locks it.  He steps over to White.

                         SCHREBER
               I'm sorry I had to put you through
               this, Anton.
                    (lowers syringe to
                    White's forehead)
               There will be some pain, but things
               will be easier this way.

     White lashes out, PUNCHES the doctor in the face.  His glasses
     go flying, and he falls to the floor, blinded, scrambling for
     the spectacles.

     A convenient scalpel cuts White from his remaining bonds.  He
     undoes the last strap around his ankles as the doctor replaces
     his glasses and leaps at him trying to drive the syringe INTO
     WHITE'S FOREHEAD.

     The struggle continues  -  each man tries to turn the syringe
     on the other.  White pushes the doctor, who falls backwards.
     Schreber leaps onto him, both fall against a tray of medical
     instruments.

     A loud THUMPING on the examination room door.  White is grabbed
     from behind, pinned down with the syringe INCHES from his face.

     A CRASH O.S.  Splintering wood.  The door bursts open.

     A ROTUND SILHOUETTE  -  is revealed, clutching a police
     special, flashing a badge.  A squeaky, over-excited, voice:

                         BUMSTEAD
               Hold it!

     Schreber and White FREEZE in mid-struggle, look at the
     inspector.  Behind him, the nurse appears in the hallway.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Police.  Nobody move.

                         SCHREBER
               He tried to kill me!

                         BUMSTEAD
               Shut up!  Everybody stay calm...

     Bumstead steps into the light, shoves his gun in White's face,
     handcuffs him.  Bumstead searches White, finds the revolver,
     takes this.  Also takes his wallet.  He glances at the doctor,
     who hides the syringe behind his back.

                         BUMSTEAD (to Doctor)
               You Schreber?

     Schreber nods blankly.

     Bumstead runs his hand over White's side pocket  -  feels
     something.

                         BUMSTEAD
               What's that?

     White says nothing.  The inspector opens the pocket and looks
     in.

                         BUMSTEAD (disgusted)
               A fish, huh?


     EXT.  CITY STREETS  -  NIGHT

     An old-fashioned BLACK SEDAN drives over a rusty suspension
     bridge.  Stone gargoyles look down at the lone vehicle.  It's
     been raining.  Streets are empty.

     INSIDE THE CAR

     WHITE and the INSPECTOR drive silently.  Bumstead has appointed
     his un-marked police vehicle with all the comforts of home.
     Hot thermos.  Note pad holder, complete with light.  Coat
     hanger.  Gun rack.  A system for everything.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Dammit!
                    (glances at his
                    watch)
               I'm curious?  How many so far?

     He shakes his watch, puts it to his ear.

                         WHITE (confused)
               What?  I...

                         BUMSTEAD (counts on fingers)
               Let's see, there's the little guy
               with no arms or legs.  And the young
               boy?

                         WHITE (disturbed)
               Young boy?

     CLOSE ON WHITE  -  frightened now.

                         BUMSTEAD
               The six year old.  Sure, you
               remember.

     Bumstead pulls something from under the dashboard.  A SANDWICH,
     carefully wrapped and prepared.  After glancing at his watch
     again, he bites into it.

                         BUMSTEAD (chewing)
               Y'know, the kid you left in the meat
               packing plant, cut into pieces.
               Packed into brown paper parcels,
               wrapped in twine, that kind of thing.

     No answer.

                         BUMSTEAD
               You sure have demonstrated a great
               deal of...  imagination.  The baby
               was the best though.  Several cops
               lost their lunch over that one.  Head
               twisted off, spine pulled out,
               yeech...

                         WHITE (cuts in)
               Stop it.  You're making me sick...

                         BUMSTEAD
               We count seven so far.  Anyone we
               missed?

     RADIO CRACKLE O.S.  -  A tinny voice cuts in.

                         VOICE
               Inspector Bumstead...  Inspector...

     Bumstead picks up a microphone, speaks into it.

                         BUMSTEAD
               What is it, Crenshaw?

                         CRENSHAW
               Just reminding you...  your eight pee
               em...

                         BUMSTEAD
               Dammit.
                    (looks at watch)
               Very efficient, as usual, Crenshaw.
               Remind me to give you my watch.  It
               needs fixing.

                         CRENSHAW
               Yes sir.

     Bumstead replaces the microphone under the dashboard, takes a
     SHARP CORNER as he finishes off the sandwich.

                         WHITE
               Where are we going?

                         BUMSTEAD
               Shut-up.

     Burastead pulls out a small brush, cleans the fallen crumbs from
     his trousers, keeping a hand on the wheel.

     White is silent  -  his wounds continue to bother him.  He
     leans down to scratch through his trousers.

                         WHITE (quietly)
               Shit!

                         BUMSTEAD
               Gesundheit!

                         WHITE (looks up)
               I didn't sneeze.


     EXT.  HOSPITAL ENTRANCE  -  NIGHT

     The INSPECTOR's car pulls up and stops.

     INSIDE THE CAR

                         WHITE
               What are we doing here?

     Bumstead grabs a bunch of flowers off the back seat.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Get out.


     INT.  HOSPITAL  -  NIGHT

     BUMSTEAD pushes the handcuffed WHITE through a swinging metal
     door.  They enter a sterile air-conditioned room.  An
     effeminate MALE NURSE sits behind a glassed-in counter.
     Directly opposite is a small WAITING ROOM through a glass
     panelled door.  Bumstead pushes White into this room.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Wait here.

     The inspector shuts the door behind him.  White looks about the
     blank room, takes a seat.  He can see Bumstead, through the
     glass panel in the door, walk up to the male nurse opposite.

     OUT IN THE CORRIDOR

     The inspector talks to the male nurse through a tiny opening in
     the window.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Bumstead.  I'm here to see my mother.

     BACK TO WHITE

     He cannot hear anything of what Bumstead is saying.  He sees
     him take out his wallet and show his badge.  The male nurse is
     concerned, looks over towards White, then opens a drawer, hands
     Bumstead a KEY.  The inspector steps back to the waiting room
     door and LOCKS IT from the outside.  He looks at White for a
     moment, then walks away, along the corridor.


     INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM

     Bumstead enters darkness  -  pneumatic MACHINE NOISE fills the
     gloom.  He walks quietly to his mother, encased in a metallic
     contraption, something like an iron lung.

                         BUMSTEAD (whisper)
               Brought you these.

     He places flowers on the bedside table.  His mother just stares
     expressionless into space, in a coma.  He sits on a metal
     chair, looks at the woman.  Her life-sustaining machines hiss
     and breathe.


     INT.  POLICE STATION

     A FINGER presses down on the sticky surface of a page.  It
     pulls away revealing an inky finger-print.

     WIDER

     White is standing in a bare room, in front of a finger-printing
     machine.  He's alone.  A blast of electrical FEED-BACK.  White
     looks up at a speaker mounted to the wall.

                         MECHANICAL VOICE  (through speaker)
               Move  -  forward.

     White follows a painted line on the floor, stands against a
     wall, in front of an old-fashioned camera.  A slot opens in the
     wall behind him, mechanical arms spring forward, restrain him,
     one arm holds a sign with a number in front of him.  A flash
     goes off, the click of a shutter.

                         MECHANICAL VOICE
               Left  -  profile.

     A claw lowers from the ceiling, grips White's head, turns it
     abruptly  -  the camera fires.

                         MECHANICAL VOICE
               Right  -  profile.

     The claw turns his head the other way.  The camera fires again.

                         MECHANICAL VOICE
               Move  -  forward.

     Across the room A BUZZER SOUNDS, a red light flashes above a
     door.  White is released by the mechanical hands, walks over,
     opens the door and steps into darkness.

     LIGHTS COME ON  -  extremely bright.  A room for line-ups  -
     markings on the white wall behind White indicate varying
     heights, a darkened window faces him.  He is obviously to be
     identified by an unseen person.

     A buzzer sounds again, a light indicates another door.

                         VOICE
               Move  -  forward.

     White moves into another room.  A chair faces a large wheel
     painted in a black and white spiral.  He sits down  -  the
     wheel turns, faster and faster.

                         VOICE
               Watch  -  the  - wheel.

     The wheel stops after several seconds.

                         VOICE
               Move  -  forward.

     The next room is full of scientific equipment.

                         VOICE
               Stand  -  behind  -  the  -  screen.

     White sees a metal-frame X-ray machine  -  he steps across to
     it.  The screen lights up, filling the room with a green glow.
     We can see the shape of his skeleton.  Where his pocket would
     be, is the tiny skeleton of the fish.

                         VOICE
               Move  -  forward.

     The next room is empty.

                         VOICE
               Face  -  the  - wall.

     White turns.  As soon as he has done this hears a door open
     behind him.  FOOTSTEPS approach.  Blows rain down on him, fists,
     boots, clubs.  He slides to the floor.  The lights go out.


     INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM

     LIGHTS come on again.  White is dazed  -  in a chair, a bright
     light in his face blinds him.

                         VOICE
               What's your name?

                         WHITE  (squints into light)
               I don't remember.

                         VOICE
               Oh, no?

     White shakes his head slowly and looks at the floor.  The light
     is angled away, pointed down towards A TABLE.  White can see
     now.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A featureless room.  STROMBOLI stands over him, behind him is
     BUMSTEAD and two shadowy guards.  Bumstead picks up an
     envelope, removes a SERIES OF PHOTOS, hands these to Stromboli.

                         STROMBOLI
               John...

     He throws the first shot down on the table in front of White.
     A black and white police photo of a murder victim.

                         STROMBOLI
               ...Murderer.

     Another photo goes down.  Another victim.  Another and another.
     Each more grisly than the last.

                         STROMBOLI
               You'll sign a confession?

     White nods.  He's looks utterly lost.

     Bumstead steps across to a small speaker box on the wall near
     the only door, presses a button.

                         BUMSTEAD (into speaker)
               Okay.

     TWO GUARDS immediately step through the door, GRAB White by his
     arms.  They carry him off.


     INT.  PRISON CELL

     White is woken by a UNIFORMED GUARD shining a light in his
     eyes.

                         GUARD
               Visitor.


     INT.  VISITING ROOM

     White is led into an empty pale green room with a glass barrier
     down the middle.  The guard tells him to sit and wait.

     The door on the other side of the barrier opens with a squeak  -
     DOCTOR SCHREBER steps in, looking frightened.

                         WHITE  (to guard)
               Keep him away:  He's insane.

     The guard just smiles, looks at the doctor knowingly.

                         SCHREBER
               Please, stay calm.

                         WHITE  (to guard)
               This man wants to kill me.

     The guard remains indifferent.

                         SCHREBER  (to guard)
               Just one of his many delusions  -
               it's nothing.
                    (a whisper to White)
               Shut up!  Listen, damn you!  This is
               a fortunate coincidence  -  we won't
               get another chance like this.  Listen
               to me.

                         WHITE  (turns to Doctor)
               What do you want?

                         SCHREBER
               You're innocent...
                    (still a whisper)
               You didn't kill anyone.

                         WHITE  (sarcastic)
               What am I doing in here then?

                         SCHREBER
               Listen to what I have to say.  Decide
               for yourself.

     AN ADJOINING ROOM

     The dark silhouettes of BUMSTEAD and ANOTHER COP watch from
     behind a two-way mirror.

                         BUMSTEAD
               What's he doing here?

                         COP
               Says he is the man's doctor...
                    (taps side of his
                    head)
               You know...

                         BUMSTEAD
               I know it's his doctor...
                    (into intercom)
               I need the file on..
                    (reads clip-board)
               Daniel Paul Schreber M.D.

                         MISS CRENSHAW'S VOICE O.S.
               Schreber.  Yes.  Isn't that his
               doctor?

                         BUMSTEAD (evenly)
               Yes.
                    (beat)
               And it's SCHREBER  -  with an 'h'.

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Yes.  An "h".

     The inspector looks up from the speaker.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  THROUGH THE MIRROR, White seems to have calmed
     down.

     BACK IN THE VISITING ROOM

                         SCHREBER
               The men in black  -  they're the
               killers.

     White stands abruptly, pushes himself against the glass.

                         WHITE
               You're a liar!

                         SCHREBER
               No, it's the truth.

                         WHITE
               So you're telling me the truth this
               time?  Is that it!

     The doctor removes a SMALL SYRINGE from his black bag, places
     it on the table in front of the glass, blocks it from the
     guard's view.

                         SCHREBER
               If you would only take this, inject
               it in your brain, everything would be
               much clearer.

                         WHITE
               Not that again...

                         SCHREBER
               Everyone get's one  -  very much like
               this...
                    (points to syringe)
               But this one's special.  It will help
               you understand, everything...

                         WHITE (cuts in)
               I'm not injecting anything into my
               brain.

                         SCHREBER
               Anton  -  I mean, John, there
               has been an experiment, a dangerous
               experiment.  I arranged it.  It was a
               lie from the beginning.  It almost
               worked, but things did not go as they
               should have.  You have been left  -
               blank.

     Schreber waves frantically at the air surrounding him.

                         SCHREBER
               You can change this, all this.
                    (points at syringe
                    again)
               But you must take it.

     White stares blankly at him for a moment, then:

                         WHITE
               You've been working too hard.

                         SCHREBER
               Please!  Don't be foolish!  Time is
               short.  Let me show you something.
               Look at this syringe.

                         WHITE
               Why?

                         SCHREBER
               Don't ask stupid questions.  Look at
               it.

     White reluctantly does this.

                         SCHREBER
               Concentrate.  Imagine the syringe
               rising.  Picture it floating above the
               table.

     TIGHT ON WHITE

                         SCHREBER
               Do it!

     WHITE'S P.O.V.

     The syringe starts to vibrate, actually RISES INTO THE AIR  -
     floats stationary between White and Schreber.

                         WHITE
               It's a trick.

                         SCHREBER
               No it isn't.  You are doing it!  Now
               raise it over the glass and...

     Suddenly the syringe spins towards the doctor, IMPALES itself
     in his shoulder.  He yelps, grabs it.

                         WHITE
               Oh, sorry...

     The doctor pulls out the syringe, is about to say more when a
     BUZZER SOUNDS.

                         MECHANICAL VOICE
               Your  -  time  -  is  -  up.

     Schreber looks to where the voice came from  -  a speaker above
     their heads.

                         SCHREBER (looks at White)
               I gave you your chance, now it's too
               late.  They'll learn you are here
               soon.  It's all over.


     INT.  POLICE STATION CORRIDOR

     DOCTOR SCHREBER paces towards the exit.  BUMSTEAD steps in
     front of him.  The doctor is startled.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Doctor!  What brings you here?

                         SCHREBER
               Just visiting my patient.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Really?  And how is his state of
               mind?

                         SCHREBER
               He's seriously disturbed...

     The doctor is nervous, glancing about.

                         BUMSTEAD
               You seem a little edgy.  Everything
               okay?

                         SCHREBER
               Yes, of course.  Everything's fine...

     He tries to push past.  Bumstead grabs his arm.

                         BUMSTEAD
               To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've
               run into each other like this.  Maybe
               you can help me tidy some loose ends.

                         SCHREBER
               Loose ends?

     SCHREBER looks like a trapped animal, when:

                         VOICE O.S.
               Bumstead!

     Bumasead turns to look down the corridor.  He sees STROMBOLI
     peaking out of his office door.

                         STROMBOLI
               I need to speak to you.  Immediately.

     The door shuts again.  Bumstead turns back.  The doctor is GONE
     -  the corridor empty.


     INT.  HOLDING CELL

     White is staring through a glass door at A COP.  A KETTLE
     WHISTLES O.S.  The cop gets up and moves off.

     White looks up.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A small WINDOW, high up on the wall.  Impossible to get to,
     even if his hands weren't cuffed.  Nothing he can do  -  he
     looks at a clock on a wall.

     PUSH IN on the clock  -  TICKING GETS LOUDER.


     INT.  POLICE STATION

     BUMSTEAD enters STROMBOLI'S office.  A nervous CHIEF-INSPECTOR
     is flanked by TWO STRANGE-LOOKING MEN in ill-fitting brown
     suits.

                         STROMBOLI
               Bumstead, these...  er, gentlemen are
               here to collect White.

     Bumstead suspiciously eyes the two men, beside STROMBOLI'S
     desk.

                         BUMSTEAD  (to men)
               Who are you?

                         STROMBOLI (even more nervous)
               Please, Bumstead.  Co-operate  -
               it's easier.

                         BUMSTEAD
               This is highly irregular.  I have a
               right to know.

                         MAN 1
               We are from a mental asylum.

     He notices that this man's moustache is LOP-SIDED.  The other
     man wears spectacles WITH NO LENSES in the frames, clutches an
     un-lit pipe in his teeth.

                         STROMBOLI
               Yes.  That's right.  He's ill  -  he
               needs expert help.

                         BUMSTEAD
               I see...

                         MAN 1
               Yes, Inspector.  Has he been
               displaying any strange...  behaviour?

                         BUMSTEAD
               He's been a little angel...

                         STROMBOLI
               If you could show them to the holding
               cell now.

     SLOW MOVE IN on Bumstead's face.

     IN THE CORRIDOR

     Bumstead and the MYSTERY MEN walk towards the holding cell.
     Bumstead glances up through the glass in the door before he
     enters.  IT'S EMPTY.

     He fumbles furiously for the key in his pocket  -  BURSTS into
     the room.  White is gone.  But where?  Bumstead throws a look
     back TO THE FRONT DESK.

                         MAN 1
               Where is he?

     The cop is just returning, holding a cup of coffee.  He looks
     at the inspector, sees the room is empty.  A nervous twitch
     knocks the cup from the cop's hands.

     TIGHT ON THE CUP  -  smashing on the floor.


     INT.  SUBWAY STATION  -  NIGHT

     Underground.  CONSTANT NOISE O.S. of trains arriving and
     departing but none are seen.

     CAMERA MOVES PAST broken tiles on a wall to REVEAL:  WHITE  -
     sitting amidst rubbish on the ground, looking around, confused,
     groggy from sleep.  He looks down at his hands, unsuccessfully
     tries to free them from the cuffs.

     MOVE IN TIGHT ON WHITE

     He starts to cry.  He puts his head in his hands, his body
     spasms with each sob.

     SEVERAL ANGLES of the empty corridors of the subway.  White's
     crying is heard  -  echoic.

     BACK ON WHITE  -  A small feminine HAND touches his head.

     Startled, he throws himself back, like he's about to be
     attacked.

     THE BEAUTIFUL JAPANESE WOMAN from the church looks down at him.


     INT.  POLICE STATION

     BUMSTEAD and the COP are getting grilled by STROMBOLI.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Yes, sir.  I'm sorry...  But I don't
               understand how it was possible.  The
               only window was twenty feet up a
               vertical wall, he was cuffed...

                         STROMBOLI
                    (shouts at cringing
                    COP)
               How could you have been so stupid?
 
                         COP
               I'm sorry, sir.

                         STROMBOLI
               Alright, get out.

     Bumstead gets up and leaves.

                         STROMBOLI
               You stay.

     The cop hustles out, shuts the door.

                         STROMBOLI
               Bumstead, you're starting to annoy
               me.  This case is very important to
               me.  Just a little warning:  I've got
               my eye on you inspector, remember
               that.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Yes, sir.

     He leaves.


     INT.  APARTMENT BUILDING

     White, awkwardly trying to hide his cuffed hands in his coat,
     follows the JAPANESE WOMAN up a flight of dark stairs.  she
     keeps looking back at him, smiling but SAYS NOTHING.


     INT.  APARTMENT

     White and the woman step into a run-down apartment.  She points
     to a couch.  White looks uncomfortable.  She smiles again, then
     turns on the radio.  MUSIC.

     She steps into an adjoining bedroom, leaving White alone.  He
     gets up and starts to tune the radio.  A babble of fragments of
     voices and music, then:  A NEWS REPORT...

                         NEWS READER O.S.
               ...earlier this evening it was
               reported a man fitting his
               description had been apprehended.

     White listens nervously.

                         NEWS READER O.S.
               ...and now for a message from LUMP-O
               food products...

     Across the room he can see the woman's bedroom door ajar.  He
     crosses to the doorway and looks in.  The woman stands naked
     against a deep red wall, her back turned.  She has an elaborate
     TATTOO on her back  -  looks like an INSECT.  She puts on a
     dressing gown and TURNS SUDDENLY.

     White steps back before she notices him, he goes back to the
     couch.

     She steps from the doorway holding a BAR OF SOAP in her hand.
     She sits down beside White and takes his hands, gently
     lathering soap around the handcuffs, continuing to smile at
     him.  White looks down.

     His hands seem to have SHRUNK  -  they poke out of his sleeves
     like tiny children's limbs.  The cuffs effortlessly slip off.

     White looks at the woman, then back at his hands  -  NOTHING
     STRANGE, they are normal size, but somehow the cuffs have been
     removed.  He looks at the woman again, grateful.  He can't help
     smiling.

     HIS P.O.V.

     Her eyes.  Her lips.  Her neck.  She leans forward, goes OUT OF
     FOCUS.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     She touches her tongue to his lips.  Kisses his face.  She
     pushes him back on the couch and pulls her dressing gown open.
     White does not respond  -  seems uncertain.  She sits upright,
     astride his body, unbuckles his belt, opens his shirt, caresses
     his chest.  She stops, her face in shadow.

     Slowly, White lifts his hands to her breasts, touches them.
     She starts to breath deeply.

     OUT OF FOCUS  -  their bodies entangle, begin to move
     rhythmically.  The CAMERA TRACKS SIDEWAYS, REVEALS a microphone
     behind a chair, leads us to a mirror on a wall.  On the other
     side of the one-way glass a reel-to-reel tape recorder is
     picking up the SOUNDS OF HEAVY BREATHING.

     OUTSIDE

     The building the lovers are in SLOWLY RISES into the air, past
     taller buildings and floats out over the city.  Its shadow
     moves past empty plazas and across faces of grey towers.

     INSIDE

     White sleeps, as buildings move past outside the window.  He
     opens his eyes, FORCES himself awake.  Looks across the dark
     room.

     The JAPANESE WOMAN stands naked at the window, clutching a
     large red megaphone.  IN PERFECT ENGLISH she shouts down at the
     streets drifting past.

                         JAPANESE WOMAN
               He's up here!  He raped me!  Hurry!
               Before he kills again!

     OUTSIDE

     MYSTERY MEN stand on roof-tops, watching the building drift
     past.

     BACK IN THE ROOM

     White runs to the window, GRABS the woman.  As they struggle,
     the building is landing softly in another part of the city.

     LONG SHADOWS move towards the entrance...

     WHITE WAKES UP AGAIN  -  finds he is still on the couch.  NO
     SIGN of the woman.  Then he notices her standing by the window
     (minus megaphone).  The wind pulls at her black hair.  A
     distant SIREN O.S.

     He gets up, walks over, stands beside her, looks out at the
     dark city.  She ignores him, goes back to the couch, turns on a
     table-lamp, puts her hands before the lit bulb, casts animal
     shadows on the wall.

     White watches her.  He walks across and sits next to her.  She
     points to herself.

                         WOMAN  (a whisper)
               Sachiko.

     He nods slowly, looks at her.  She waits for him to respond
     with his name.  He shrugs, remains silent.  Then he puts his
     hands in the light, makes his own animal shadow.

                         WHITE
               That's me.  I'm a shadow.

     She smiles at the shadows.

                         WHITE
               Do I look like a murderer to you?

     She just keeps smiling, not understanding.  Kisses him. He
     notices an old phone on a corner table, removes the note again
     and rings the same number.  This time, after several rings the
     call is answered.

                         WOMAN'S VOICE O.S.
               Yes?...  Who is this?...  Who's
               there?...

     White remains silent.  Sachiko stands and leaves the room.

                         WOMAN'S VOICE O.S.
               John?  Is that you?

                         WHITE
               Who is this?  What do you know about
               me?

     In the darkness of a doorway Sachiko hesitates momentarily.
     She slides a hand into White's coat, removes the wallet.  She
     takes out some cash, puts the wallet back, then she MOVES OFF.


     EXT.  STREET  -  NIGHT

     BUMSTEAD pulls up in his car.  Across the street is DOCTOR
     SCHREBER'S surgery.

     He is about to get out of the car, when the SURGERY DOOR OPENS
     and A FIGURE steps into the street.  Bumstead watches the
     shadowy man for a moment.  Then gets out and FOLLOWS, assuming
     it is Schreber.

     ALLEYWAY

     Bumstead follows inconspicuously.  Without warning, the figure
     stops and TURNS.  Bumstead backs into a doorway to hide.  He
     gets a glimpse of the gaunt features of a MYSTERY MAN in the
     dim light of the alley.

     When Bumstead steps into the alley again there is no sign of
     the Man  -  like he disappeared into thin air.  A SHADOW
     crosses the wall beside Bumstead.  He spins, looking around
     behind him.  Then he looks up into the air.

     HIS P.O.V.

     The shadow of a LEVITATING FIGURE crosses the face of a
     building.


     INT.  APARTMENT BUILDING PASSAGEWAY  -  NIGHT

     SOUND OF A WOMAN SOBBING O.S.  A wet dog sits in a corner
     gnawing a bone.  A crackly voice recites a list of names from a
     small speaker-box mounted to a wall.  A TREMBLING FINGER
     presses a door buzzer.

     SACHIKO, opens the door and looks out.

     ANGLE ON  -  A STRANGE WOMAN in the dark corridor adjusting her
     hair nervously.  She pushes past the Japanese woman, into the
     room.

     INSIDE

                         WOMAN
               John.

     WHITE stands inside the room, looking at the woman,
     expressionless. The woman suddenly leaps forward, grabs him,
     kisses him passionately.

     White tries to push her away, but she takes his hand, pulls it
     inside her dress, makes him touch her breasts.  He pushes
     harder, she trips on a chair, falls to the floor.  She starts
     to cry.


     EXT.  APARTMENT BUILDING FACADE

     The CAMERA MOVES past flaking bricks  -  to a window.  Behind
     the glass WHITE and SACHIKO sit across from the WOMAN who
     attacked White.  She is talking, though nothing can be heard,
     drying her eyes with a handkerchief.

     INSIDE

     The strange woman looks at White intently between sobs.

                         WOMAN
               Please believe me.  It's me, John.
               Your WIFE.  I wouldn't lie to you.
               You told me I could come and see you
               -  now you want to just send me away
               again...

     White looks AT THE FLOOR.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  a crack in the floorboards  -  movement
     underneath.

                         WHITE
               I thought it would make more sense.
               I'm getting the pieces, but when I
               put it together it feels like...
               Like you're telling me about somebody
               else's life...

                         WIFE
               It's the truth...  I need you.  I
               know you're innocent.

                         WHITE
               How do you know I'm innocent?

                         WIFE
               Of course you are.  You couldn't do
               those terrible things.  Come home with
               me  -  maybe things will make sense
               then...

                         WHITE
               I can't do that.  It's dangerous.
               What about my parents?  Do you know
               where I can find them?

                         WIFE
               They're dead, John.

     He stands and walks to the window  -  looks out at the city.

                         WIFE
               You have an uncle.  You were very
               close.

     She fumbles in her handbag, pulls out a notebook, scribbles
     something on a piece of paper, hands it to White.

                         WIFE
               This is where he lives. I'm sure he
               would like to see you.

                         WHITE (taking paper)
               Thanks.

                         WIFE (looks at him for a beat)
               Don't you want me?   My body?
               Remember how my skin feels?  Touch
               it.  I...

     She notices Sachiko  -  becomes self-conscious.  Sachiko
     silently stands and leaves the room.  The wife puts her face in
     her hands, overcome with tears.

                         WHITE
               What's your name?

                         WIFE  (looks up  -  still sobbing)
               Elizabeth.

     White removes the torn fragment of the photograph he has in his
     wallet, holds the black and white eye up to her face  -  it
     matches.

                         WHITE  (thoughtful)
               Yes...

     In the darkness of a doorway Sachiko watches the couple.  She
     MOVES OFF.

                         ELIZABETH
               I want to help...

                         WHITE
               Alright.  Here...

     He pulls the postcard from his wallet, holds it up so the woman
     can see it.

                         WHITE
               Know this place?

     She looks at the card.

                         ELIZABETH  (stops crying)
               Of course.  Your home town  -  where
               you grew up...

     White stands abruptly, startling the woman.  He glares down at
     her intensely.

                         WHITE
               How do I get there?  Tell me.

                         WIFE
               That's easy.  You...

     She trails off into silence.  Her hand, about to point in a
     certain direction, freezes in mid-air.

                         ELIZABETH
               ...strange, I forgot.

     White sits back down quietly.

                         WHITE
               Yes.  Very strange.


     INT.  BATHROOM

     Sachiko locks the door behind her and steps to the middle of
     the room, lifts a small round rug off the tiled floor.

     Underneath is a TRAP-DOOR.  Opening it, she climbs down a
     hole.

     UNDER THE FLOOR

     In the semi-darkness she moves to a WOODEN BOX.  She cranks a
     small metal handle on the box which makes the lid open.  Music
     plays softly.

     She looks into the yawning black mouth of the box.  A WORM-LIKE
     apparition threads its way out of the hole, wraps about her
     thigh.  She breaths deeply, shuts her eyes.


     INT.  TENEMENT BUILDING CORRIDOR

     LOW ANGLE TRACKING SHOT  -  feet walk along a tattered rug,
     approach a door.  Bumstead's shoes, shiny as always.


     INT.  TENEMENT ROOM

     A KNOCK ON THE DOOR startles a huddled man in a blanket,
     sitting before a small t.v. set.  This is THOMPSON  -  the
     detective with mental problems.  He's unshaven, haunted.

     Clutching a shotgun, he steps to the door, peeks through a spy-
     hole.

     HIS P.O.V.

     Bumstead, back turned, glancing at his watch.

     Thompson backs away, points his gun at the figure through the
     door.

                         THOMPSON
               Go away!

                         BUMSTEAD O.S.
               Open up, Thompson.  It's me...

     Thompson puts his eye to the door again.

                         THOMPSON
               Bumstead?

     THROUGH THE SPY-HOLE LENS the inspector turns, looks at us, his
     face DISTORTED, fish-like.  Thompson undoes four locks, opens
     the door a crack, but leaves it chained.

                         THOMPSON
               Can't let you in...  sorry.

                         BUMSTEAD
               I'm on the serial killer case, need
               to talk.

                         THOMPSON
               Not that.  Anything else.

     Thompson wipes at the sweat on his forehead.

                         BUMSTEAD
               You don't look so well...  C'mon, let
               me in Thompson.

     Thompson stares at Bumstead, then silently unchains the door
     and lets him through.

                         THOMPSON
               I can't talk about that.  As long as
               you understand, that's all.

     The room is very dark.  Bumstead is assailed by a wave of
     putrid smells.  It's a mess  -  rotten food, overturned
     furniture, dirty clothes.

                         THOMPSON
               Pull up some garbage  -  make
               yourself at home.

     Thompson smiles weakly.  They sit down, face each other in the
     gloom.  A RAT scuttles past Thompson.  With lightning reflexes
     he throws a shoe at it.  The rat runs under a table.  He looks
     back at Bumstead, smiles, slightly insane.

                         THOMPSON
               They've taken my mind, my memories...

                         BUMSTEAD
               What?  Who has?

                         THOMPSON
               Is that your idea of a joke?  I don't
               remember...
                    (looks around)
               Take my advice, Bumstead.  Get off
               this case.  Now.

                         BUMSTEAD
               What is going on?

                         THOMPSON (looks more frightened)
               Wish I could tell you, Bumstead.
               Strange business.  I...
               AAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!

     He screams horribly.  Stands, clutching his head.  Startled,
     Bumstead falls backwards off his chair.  Thompson, still
     clutching his head, runs and starts POUNDING HIS FACE against
     the wall.

                         THOMPSON
               Get away!  Leave me alone!

     Thompson's head is CHANGING  -  bloating.  It rapidly elongates
     into a pink fleshy tube.

     Thompson's head continues to grow -  his features are lost
     beneath folds of skin.  His screaming is stifled.  Thompson
     falls to the floor.  His head HUGE NOW  -  larger than his
     body.  Small tendrils sprout from the main appendage.

     Bumstead takes cover behind a sofa.

     Then, as violently as the head began to transform, it stops.

     Bumstead peaks over the sofa at the huge throbbing purple
     growth sprouting from Thompson's collar.  At the top of the
     growth an orifice opens.

     An EXPLOSION of green bile spouts into the room  -  covers
     everything in sight...

     Then the head starts to shrink.  Thompson's features appear
     again. It returns to normal size.  Thompson groans, sprawled on
     the floor, clutching his head.

     Bumstead looks on in horror.

                         THOMPSON
               It's  -  it's disgusting, I know...

     Thompson's face is heavily bruised, covered in sweat.  His nose
     starts to bleed  -  he wipes it on his sleeve.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Jesus!  We have to get you to a
               doctor...

                         THOMPSON
               No...  No doctor...

     Bumstead stands unsteadily.

                         BUMSTEAD
               But...  How long has this been
               happening?

                         THOMPSON
               A few days...  a few weeks  -  dunno,
               I can't remember.
                    (stands slowly)
               Worse thing is, I never know if it
               will change back again...  Now,
               please leave me alone.


     INT.  APARTMENT  -  NIGHT

     WHITE, ELIZABETH and SACHIKO sit around a small table, eating
     quietly.

     Without warning, Elizabeth starts to cry again.  White tries to
     ignore her. Sachiko looks sadly at the wife, puts a hand on her
     shoulder, gives her a handkerchief.  The woman quietens down.

     They resume eating but in no time Elizabeth again bursts into
     tears.  White looks at her now.

                         ELIZABETH  (through sobs)
               Sorry...

     Sachiko leans across and puts her arm around Elizabeth, helps
     her to her feet.  Elizabeth hangs onto the woman as she is led
     from the room.  White can hear the sobbing still, as the women
     move through to the bedroom.


     INT.  BEDROOM

     They sit on the edge of the bed  -  Sachiko holds Elizabeth's
     hand, smiles at her.

                         ELIZABETH (calmer now)
               I'm sorry...  This is embarrassing  -
               my husband doesn't know who I am...

     With this, she starts to cry again.

     Sachiko leans forward and tenderly kisses Elizabeth's lips.


     INT.  DARK CHAMBER  -  NIGHT

     TIGHT ON TWO MYSTERY MEN speaking in whispers.  The Men
     continue talking as THE CAMERA RISES, through several levels of
     concrete and machinery TO REVEAL:


     EXT.  ROOF-TOP  -  NIGHT

     OTHER MYSTERY MEN are rigging a wire to some kind of antenna
     device.

     BACK DOWN IN THE DARK CHAMBER

     The group of MYSTERY MEN have gathered once again.  One
     addresses them all.

                         MYSTERY MAN
               The line of junction between two
               edges!

                         MEN  (unison)
               YES!

                         MYSTERY MAN
               We have located him.  Now is the
               time, yes.

     A switch is thrown.  Electricity sparks to life.  A hum is in
     the air.

                         MYSTERY MAN
               Let the tuning commence!

     The congregation of MEN place ELECTRODES to their foreheads in
     a trance-like manner.  They chant, quietly at first, steadily
     building in volume.  The MEN stand and MOVE RHYTHMICALLY to
     some inner beat.

     The CAMERA MOVES ACROSS to a diagram pinned on a board.  A
     representation of a man's legs.  Trousers rolled up above the
     knees, showing a number of bite-like wounds on the flesh.
     Labels point out various parts of the legs in medical fashion
     -  the legends are an unknown language.

     ON THE ROOF

     The antenna glows with a ghostly green light.  O.S. SCREAMS
     RISE UP FROM THE STREET.


     INT.  APARTMENT/KITCHEN  -  LATER

     White downs a cup of black coffee, staring blankly out the
     window.  O.S. distant screams.

     He glances across to a wall, notices A FLY there  -  something
     about it looks WRONG.

     FLY'S P.O.V.

     A distorted electronic image of White's FACE looming up.

     At exactly that moment the FLY TAKES OFF, flies erratically
     down the hall, around a turn and disappears.  White follows.

     HALL-WAY

     White moves quietly towards the bedroom door.

     HIS P.O.V.

     It is ajar, dark inside.  Movement.  The women are naked on the
     bed.  The JAPANESE WOMAN has her eyes shut, head back in
     ecstasy. The WIFE is bent over her, kissing her stomach.

     ANGLE ON WHITE  -  watching through the crack in the door.  The
     women are oblivious.

     He moves away slowly, feeling strange.  His feet stop making
     contact with the floor.  He grabs a table to steady himself.
     The table-cloth comes away, things spill to the floor and
     smash. He's FLOATING.

     White desperately reaches out to grab something, holds the
     light-fixture in the ceiling.  It breaks off in a cloud of
     plaster.  Sparks briefly illuminate.  He falls heavily ONTO THE
     CEILING  -  now the floor.  The apartment is upside down.

     He stares up at furniture and objects.

     THE BATHROOM

     White steps into the room, eerily illuminated by a glowing
     heater stuck to the floor.  Water is running  -  filling the
     tub and overflowing, making a suspended puddle above White's
     head.

     White takes off his clothes and climbs the wall, towards the
     floor.  It's difficult, but he reaches the tap, turns it off.
     Pulls himself towards the tub.

     Gravity becomes NORMAL AGAIN as he sinks in the warm water.
     He's incredibly weak  -  floats limply in the bath.  Submerges
     his face.  A distant throbbing O.S., like a huge machine heart
     somewhere in the building.

     He opens his eyes, still underwater, stares up at the ceiling.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A blurry DARK FIGURE moves into his vision.  It stares down at
     him.

     White rigid with fright, cannot focus on the figure through the
     thin veil of water.  The FIGURE reaches out.  A GLOVED HAND
     grabs White about the throat, holds him forcefully.  White
     gulps for air, swallows water.  His eyes widen.  He tries to
     stop the hand strangling him but can't.

     Suddenly the hand pulls away.  The BLURRY FIGURE stumbles back
     and ERUPTS into bloody explosion.  The body splits apart,
     throwing internal organs through the room.

     White awakens in the bathtub.  He looks about the room.  Empty.
     Silent.  He gets out of the water, starts to dress.


     EXT.  BUILDING

     BUMSTEAD'S car pulls up.  He gets out, stained here and there
     with bile.


     INT.  APARTMENT

     A HIGH ANGLE on the slain bodies of the JAPANESE WOMAN and
     WHITE'S WIFE.  TWO COPS wander about the dark room, doing
     stuff.  Bumstead walks up to the cop in charge.

                         COP
               All the same entry wounds.  It's
               definitely him.
                    (indicates Sachiko's
                    corpse)
               She lives...  lived here.  A
               prostitute.

                         BUMSTEAD
               The other one?

                         COP
               His wife.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Jesus.  Small world.
                    (looks around)
               Where's the photographer?

                         COP
               No one available.

     A third YOUNG COP steps up to the cop in charge, glancing at
     the bile on Bumstead's suit.

                         YOUNG COP
               They won't come out.

                         COP
               We'll interrogate them anyway.

     The cop leads Bumstead behind a WOODEN PARTITION.  A small area
     neatly arranged  -  a double bed, various possessions.  Someone
     obviously lives here.  The room is empty however.

                         COP
               This is the family of the victim  -
               apparently they were in the apartment
               when he committed...

                         BUMSTEAD  (looks around empty room)
               What are you talking about?

                         COP
               Oh, yes...

     He walks to THE BED, bends over and lifts the bed-spread.  In
     the shadows underneath, Bumstead can make out SEVERAL FACES.  A
     man, an old woman, three or four children.

                         COP
               They don't speak English...

                         BUMSTEAD
               How will we interrogate them?

                         COP
               Well, sir...  I don't know exactly.

     Under the bed, Bumstead can see a LITTLE GIRL.  He walks over
     to her.  She puts a hand over her mouth, edges away.

                         BUMSTEAD
               It's alright.  I won't hurt you.

     Without coming out from under the bed she hands the inspector a
     crumpled paper.  He looks at it then glances over his shoulder.

     HIS P.O.V.

     The wooden room divider.  The CAMERA MOVES IN steadily, into a
     crack running along the length of the divider  -  we can see
     the room on the other side, with the cops moving about.

     Bumstead looks back at the page he holds in his hands.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A child-like DRAWING.  Two men, stick figures, dressed in
     black, with impossibly big knifes, slash at two screaming
     women.

     Unmistakable  -  MYSTERY MEN.


     INT.  DARK CHAMBER  -  NIGHT

     DOCTOR SCHREBER walks stiffly into the room and sits at the
     head of a boardroom table.  He's cold, pulls his coat up about
     his neck.  The long table is lined on both sides with immobile
     MYSTERY MEN.

     A DARK FIGURE walks into the room, steps up to the other end of
     the table.  This is the enigmatic MISTER BLACK  -  only ever
     seen hidden in shadow.

                         MISTER BLACK  (addressing Men)
               Gentlemen.
                    (peers at Schreber)
               Doctor.

     He sits, dark and mysterious.

                         MISTER BLACK
               I have called this meeting for a
               purpose, yes?
                    (turns to Schreber)
               It is clear to you we are  -
               unhappy, yes?

                         SCHREBER
               Yes, of course.  I...

                         MISTER BLACK
               The tuning failed  -  when our agents
               arrived he was gone.  He knows things
               -  predicts things.  Explain to us,
               Doctor.  Why is the situation this
               way?  Yes?

     Schreber seems distinctly uncomfortable.

                         SCHREBER
               I'm not certain I fully understand
               myself...

                         MISTER BLACK
               No excuses, dearest Doctor!  Answers.
               Yes?

                         MYSTERY MEN  (chant in unison)
               Answers!  Answers!

                         MISTER BLACK
               You said this would be containable!
               Nothing works this time.  Why is this
               so?

                         MYSTERY MEN
               Why!  Why!

                         SCHREBER
               I  -  ah  -  I...  it's a little cold
               in here don't you think?

                         MISTER BLACK
               We must find him.  This is your
               responsibility.

                         SCHREBER (thinking fast)
               Yes, of course...


     INT.  INSPECTOR'S OFFICE

     Bumstead once again scratches his head in front of a map.  The
     little girl's drawing is pinned to his board.  His attention
     wanders.  He notices a FLY CRAWLING across the wall in front of
     his face.  He leans closer, studying it.

     The intercom crackles to life.  The insect flies off.

                         MISS CRENSHAW  (through intercom)
               A call, sir.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Who is it?

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Put it through...

     A light flashes.  Bumstead picks up.

                         BUMSTEAD
               This is Bumstead.  Who is this?

     He listens intently.


     INT.  BUMSTEAD'S OFFICE

     BUMSTEAD enters.  He looks nervous.  His SECRETARY sits at her
     desk in an adjoining office, filing her nails.

                         BUMSTEAD
               I need everything on the Jonathan
               White case.

                         MISS CRENSHAW
               Yes, sir.  Everything?

                         BUMSTEAD
               All the important stuff.  Wrap it up
               for me.

     The inspector turns to face her, a little manic. She is staring
     at him.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Please  -  I'm in a hurry.

                         MISS CRENSHAW (evenly)
               Certainly.


     EXT.  POLICE STATION

     BUMSTEAD steps from the doorway and walks across to his car
     briskly.


     INT.  BATH-HOUSE

     Bumstead moves down a long corridor full of people in towels
     and swimming outfits, waiting silently.  They sit lined by a
     wall, staring into space.

     Bumstead walks into a larger tiled room, full of steam.  He
     walks beside a heated pool  -  naked people swim about weakly
     or sit on the edge washing themselves.  He steps up to A FULLY
     DRESSED MAN, sitting silently on a bench.  It is WHITE.

     A feint smile brushes across White's lips as he looks up at the
     inspector.  He looks away, like he's forgotten something.
     Stands, walks over to the pool, cups his hand, bends down,
     scoops some water.

     Bumstead sees White has picked up the LITTLE SILVER FISH.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Why give yourself up?

                         WHITE
               I  -  ah - couldn't think of
               anything else to do.  I thought maybe
               you know something...
                    (beat)
               I'm scared.

                         BUMSTEAD
               That was a pretty good escape act at
               the station.  How did you do that?

                         WHITE
               I woke up in a subway.  I don't know
               how I got there.

                         BUMSTEAD  (not convinced)
               Uh-huh.
                    (pauses)
               What are you scared of?

                         WHITE
               People...  after me.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Who?

                         WHITE
               I don't know who they are.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Why are they after you?

                         WHITE
               Don't know that either.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Don't know much, do you?


     INT.  LABORATORY  -  NIGHT

     Metal scraping.

     PIANO ACCORDION MUSIC wafts on a breeze, someone breathing.

     HIGH ANGLE  -  Down through an OPENING metal hatch.  A dim
     laboratory IS REVEALED  -  a maze of scientific instruments.
     Elongated shadows move about.

     MYSTERY MEN are hunched over something.  Behind them a
     diagrammatic chart of the evolution of the human brain.

     MAN 1 bends across to a CONTROL PANEL, works a switch.  A small
     speaker in a metal box crackles to life.  SOUND OF DISTANT
     SURF.  A WOMAN'S VOICE:

                         VOICE
               What is your name...  What is your
               name...

     Wires lead from the metal box to a HUMAN BRAIN within a
     metallic container.  Electricity arches across electrodes.

     More sounds from the speaker:  WATER BUBBLING.  HIGH HEELS WALK
     DOWN STAIRS.  BED-SPRINGS.  LOVERS MOAN PASSIONATELY.

     MAN 2 steps forward and pulls a bloodied sheet from their
     handiwork.

     A PUPPET-LIKE CREATURE is revealed.  Small  -  two and half
     feet tall.  The top of its head an open hatch containing the
     BRAIN.  Wires lead to this.

     TIGHT ON PUPPET'S EYES  -  They glance about the room. Its body
     is a series of geometric shapes and polished surfaces.

     MAN 1 shines a torch into the puppet's eyes.

     INSIDE ITS HEAD

     Gears turn, illuminated by the beam of the light.  The gears
     part slowly to reveal a small writhing INSECT screwed to a
     metal plate.

     MAN 2 shows the puppet PHOTOGRAPHS:  WHITE as he looks
     currently, shots of him as a teenager, a young boy, a baby.
     Photos of what we realise are his parents, standing on a
     seaside pier sirtiling and waving.  Where he went to school.  A
     red push-bike he owned as a boy.  His first sweetheart.  Then a
     photo of a young woman smiling  -  his WIFE.

     MAN 3 holds up a small sea shell to the mechanical ear of the
     puppet creature  -  MORE SOUNDS OF SURF...

     A FIGURE clutching a wooden cane looks on from the shadows.
     His pale hand fondles the ornate handle of his cane  -  a
     carved silver insect.  It's MISTER BLACK.  Man 3 steps up to
     him.

                         MISTER BLACK
               You have duplicated the personality,
               yes.

                         MAN 3
               It is ready.  The Doctor was most
               helpful.

     Mister Black turns towards the OTHER MEN.

                         MISTER BLACK
               I hear a clock in my head, and I like
               it!

                         MEN  (respond in unison)
               We hear clocks in our heads, and we
               like it!

                         MISTER BLACK
               A world in our likeness!

                         MEN
               A world in our likeness!

     The Men close the hatch in the top of the puppet's head.
     SQUEAK...  CLUNK!  The puppet tests out its MANY WEAPONS, a
     series of nasty-looking blades snap out of its small body, then
     retract.


     INT.  INSPECTOR'S APARTMENT

     Bumstead leads White through the front door, into a SITTING
     ROOM.  Everything is extremely neat and organized, plastic
     coverings on all the furniture.  White steps towards a sofa.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Please.  Not that way.  If you could
               just follow the covering  -  the
               carpet gets stained and it's
               impossible to clean.

     White stops. Bumstead indicates a CLEAR PLASTIC MAT running
     through the room.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Everything the department knows about
               John White is in this.  Here.
                    (hands file)
               Excuse me for a moment.

     White flips through it.  Details of White's history.

     IN THE BEDROOM

     Bumstead removes an empty suitcase from a closet.  Begins to
     place neatly folded clothes within it.

                         BUMSTEAD (calling to White)
               Age thirty one.  Brown hair.  Green
               eyes.  Five feet, ten and a half
               inches tall.  Until recently worked
               for a firm manufacturing scientific
               equipment.  Wife's name  -  Elizabeth.
               Father and mother  -  Harold and
               Edith.  Both dead.  A history of
               mental instability...  etcetera,
               etcetera.

     Bumstead walks back into the sitting room, packed bag in hand.
     He looks at White leafing through the file.

                         BUMSTEAD
               That stuff helpful?

                         WHITE  (disappointed)
               I suppose...
                    (looks up)
               Why are you helping me?

                         BUMSTEAD
               You're case has been driving me
               crazy.  You see, I pride myself on
               being thorough.  There's too many
               loose ends with your case.
                    (a beat)
               Thought it was best you were hidden
               until we understand more about the
               facts.  What do you know about these
               men in black?

     White looks up, pauses as if he didn't understand Bumstead,
     then:

                         WHITE
               If you shoot them here...
                    (points at his
                    forehead)
               you can kill them.  They're not
               people  -  like us  -  got insects in
               their heads...  Got any disinfectant?

     The inspector is caught off-guard by the question.

                         WHITE  (continues)
               It's my legs.  Been bitten.  Giving
               me trouble.

     Bumstead walks silently to the bathroom, opens a medicine
     cabinet.

                         BUMSTEAD  (to himself)
               Insects?

     He returns clutching a small bottle and some cotton wool.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Here.
                    (hands things to
                    White)
               Careful with your trousers.  That
               stuff stains.

     The inspector gives white back his revolver and his wallet.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Here.

     Bumstead paces thoughtfully, careful to stay on the plastic
     protective covering.  He turns, glares at White, who dabs his
     legs with the cotton wool.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Any idea what part the Doctor plays
               in this business?

     White shakes head.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Let's try and find out, shall we.
                    (points at White's
                    shoe)
               Lace is untied.

     White looks down.  Bumstead doesn't lie.


     INT.  DRUG STORE  -  NIGHT

     The BARBER is shaving under the armpit of a client.  GRANDPA
     snores in a corner, his feet buried under a pile of hair
     clippings..

     The BELL hanging above the door rings.  The door swings open.

                         BARBER
               He with you shortly, sir...

     Several heads turn, THEN LOOK DOWN to see the PUPPET.  The
     puppet wheels forward and stops.

                         BARBER (not really looking)
               Hello, sonny.  Cute outfit.  Mother
               get it for you?

     The puppet crosses the room threateningly.  TWO OTHER CLIENTS
     look up startled from their newspapers and girly magazines.

     ON THE PUPPET  -  it wheels up to the barber's leg and GRABS HIS
     TROUSER with a mechanical claw.  The puppet holds out a PHOTO
     OF White.

                         PUPPET (incoherent obscenities)
               EEEEEEEEK...  AHHHHHHH!...
               SHHHHIIIITTTT!...  FUUUUCKER!!

                         BARBER (looks down, scared now)
               Huh?

     He's grabbed and THROWN into a nearby chair.  The puppet leaps
     onto the bench in front of him  -  he's frightened, so are the
     customers.

     Puppet wheels up and down on the bench in front of the
     customers  -  stopping to glance at individuals in a threatening
     manner, holding out the photo of white.

     It leans forward, spinning its blades  -  HAIR FLIES.  Screams
     o.s.

     The PUPPET retracts its weapons  -  COVERED in blood.  It
     wheels forward, through the door and into the street.

     THE CAMERA PANS to reveal a scene of complete carnage.  Blood
     covers the walls.  FOUR BODIES slumped about the room.  Each has
     an outlandish hairstyle.


     INT.  BUMSTEAD'S CAR

     White looks at the inspector  -  street lights pass over his
     features.  Bumstead stares at the road.

                         BUMSTEAD
               I didn't tell you the entire reason I
               helped you.  It started with two
               little girls.  Twins.  Used to play
               with them when I was young.  Couldn't
               remember for the life of me what they
               looked like, then I understood why...

     He looks at the dashboard, brushes away a small piece of lint.

                         BUMSTEAD
               They didn't have faces.

                         WHITE
               What?

                         BUMSTEAD
               That's right.  Just seamless flesh
               across the front of their heads.  No
               mistake.  I just hadn't remembered it
               that way.  Up until then they had
               been normal little girls in my
               memory.
                    (looks back at White)
               That's not all.  Once I started
               examining them, all sorts of things
               about my life, had...
               inconsistencies.  It was like a game.
               I would think about a person or a
               place, or an event.  Then I would
               turn the lights off.  Sit down in a
               comfortable chair...  And study each
               detail of this subject.

     He glances at White, then back to the road.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Everything was liquid beneath a thin
               surface that had always seemed solid
               to me...

     Bumstead and White are quiet momentarily, then:

                         BUMSTEAD
               Is there anything you haven't told me
               about this business?  Even the most
               insignificant thing?

                         WHITE (thinking)
               No.  Nothing I can think of.
               Except...

                         BUMSTEAD
               Go on.

                         WHITE
               Well.  The only thing I've been
               certain of, all this time, is that I
               need to get to the ocean.  The point
               is no one seems to know how to get
               there.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Why, that's ridiculous.  You just...

     He trails off.  Shakes his head slowly.

                         BUMSTEAD
               We'll get to the bottom of this.  I
               mean it.


     INT.  SCHREBER'S SURGERY

     The doctor is sitting at his desk, when the door bursts open
     suddenly.  White and Bumstead move into the room and grab the
     doctor before he can protest.

                         BUMSTEAD
               I met a friend of yours the other
               night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No
               hair.  Rather pale skin...

                         SCHREBER
               I don't know what you're talking
               about.

                         BUMSTEAD
               That's surprising.  He was leaving
               your office at the time...

                         SCHREBER
               You are mistaken.

                         WHITE
               What are you hiding?

                         SCHREBER
               Nothing.  I don't know anything!

     BUMSTEAD removes his revolver, sticks it in the doctor's face.

                         SCHREBER
               Please, they'll kill me...

                         BUMSTEAD
               I think it's time you introduced us
               to your little friends.


     EXT.  ALLEY  -  NIGHT

     SCHREBER, BUMSTEAD AND WHITE sit in Bumstead's car in an
     alleyway.

     Schreber points to a SOLITARY METAL DOOR in a wall.

                         SCHREBER
               In there.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Just like that?

     The threesome step from the car, keep close to a wall.

     Schreber alone steps up to the door, leans down to a mat at the
     foot of the door, lifts it and takes a KEY from underneath.  He
     unlocks the door, opens it, puts the key back, goes inside.  He
     waves the other men forward.

     White and Bumstead step up to the door  -  Bumstead looks at the
     mat  -  it says:  WELCOME on it.

     A CORRIDOR

     Through the door  -  AN ELEVATOR.  There is only a down button.
     Schreber presses it, several seconds later the doors open.

     They step inside.  The doors close, the lift descends.

                         BUMSTEAD
               What is this place?

                         SCHREBER
               You wouldn't believe me if I told
               you, Inspector.  Have patience  -
               you'll see for yourself.

     When the doors open again the three men look out on a DARK
     PASSAGEWAY.


     EXT.  LIBRARY  -  NIGHT

     The PUPPET wheels up to the sweeping set of stairs at the base
     of the building.  It stops, WHEELS BUMP into the steps
     repeatedly.  It looks down and shrieks with a string of
     mechanical obscenities.


     INT.  MYSTERY MEN'S UNDERWORLD

     WHITE and BUMSTEAD follow SCHREBER down a corridor to what
     appears to be an ancient crypt.  They enter a door  -  it has
     something written on it in a strange language.

     INSIDE IS A ROOM

     They stumble around in the darkness, Schreber finds a light
     switch, suddenly White STOPS dead in his tracks  -  Bumstead
     turns to him.

                         WHITE
               Look.

     White points to a wall featuring a line of brass hooks.  On
     these hooks hang MYSTERY MEN coats -  that's not all.  Each hook
     carries A FACE.

     Bumstead and White step closer, look at the faces.  They seem to
     be elaborate, very life-like MASKS.

                         SCHREBER
               Put them on.

     White and the inspector look at each other, incredulous.

     OUTSIDE  -  THE CORRIDOR

     The door opens.  White, Bumstead and Schreber step out, wearing
     poorly fitting masks and coats  -  DISGUISED AS MYSTERY MEN.

     FURTHER ALONG THE CORRIDOR

     The three men come across a small area with a raised platform,
     between arches.  A number of OPEN CARTS roll past on tracks  -
     the scene resembles some bizarre amusement-park ride.  The carts
     are numbered on the side  -  all of them empty.

                         SCHREBER
               Get in.  Hurry.

     White, Bumstead and Schreber hop aboard.  The cart takes them
     into a DARK TUNNEL, deeper into the secret underworld of the
     MYSTERY MEN.  They MOVE THROUGH a subterranean landscape of
     unexplained contraptions and bones.

                         WHITE
                    (to Bumstead)
               Where do you think this goes?

                         BUMSTEAD
               It sure isn't the fun-fair.

     The cart finally comes to a stop in a cave.  Bumstead, White and
     Schreber leap out and hide in a dark doorway, as a LONG LINE OF
     MYSTERY MEN walk past them.

                         SCHREBER
               Follow me, and do exactly as I do.

     They join the end of the line, falling into step.


     INT.  DARK CHAMBER

     The MEN, with WHITE, BUMSTEAD and SCHREBER in tow, enter and
     sit in a number of rows of wooden chairs.  White and the
     inspector do the same.

     MORE MYSTERY MEN appear in circular portals high up on the
     concrete walls.  ONE MAN faces the others at the front of the
     room.

                         MYSTERY MAN 1
               Eleven past eleven  -  the Night of the
               Eye.

     The seated Men start to CHANT.

                         MEN
               NIGHT OF THE EYE!  NIGHT OF THE EYE!

     A MAN in the front row stands.

                         MAN 2
               The Eye is too small for the head of
               the pin!

                         MAN 1
               Yes!

     ANOTHER MAN stands.  Next to the first, who sits again.

                         MAN 3
               What is it that floats on the water?
               The Eye!

                         MAN 1
               Indeed!

     So it goes around the room, each Man takes his turn announcing
     part of the strange ritual.  It will be White, Bumstead and
     Schreber's turn shortly.  White is worried, looks at the
     others.

                         WHITE (whisper)
               What do we do?

                         SCHREBER (hisses back)
               Fake it!

                         BUMSTEAD
               What?

     SCHREBER is next  -  he stands abruptly.

                         SCHREBER
               The eye.  Master of time and space!

     Then it's Bumstead's turn.

                         BUMSTEAD
               The Eye  -  um  -  delicious with
               horseradish on rye!

     MAN 1 at the front seems confused for a moment  -  SEVERAL of
     the others turn towards Bumstead.

                         MAN 1 (uncertain)
               Good.

     The inspector sits back down  -  whispers to White without
     looking at him.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Nothing to it...

     White stands.  Hesitates.  Then:

                         WHITE
               Eye...  eye, captain!

     White sits down, shaking his head, embarrassed.

                         MAN 1
               Um  -  yes...

     THE MAN NEXT TO WHITE rises up  -  keeps rising, FLOATS IN THE
     AIR above the Men's heads.

                         MAN 4
               My spine will bend for the Eye!

     He turns sideways, still floating.


     EXT.  ALLEY

     BACK ABOVE GROUND, Bumstead, White and Schreber run from the
     door at the end of the alley-way, tossing their masks away.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Was that for real down there?

                         SCHREBER
               I'm afraid so.

     The inspector stops walking suddenly, grabs White, holds him
     back.

                         BUMSTEAD
               What the hell is that?

     At the end of the alley the PUPPET advances menacingly.
     Schreber takes his chance and runs down an alley and
     disappears.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Quick.  My car.

     Fortunately BUMSTEAD'S CAR stands nearby.  The two men leap in,
     start it up.  Bumstead guns towards the puppet standing in the
     glare of the headlights.

     The puppet's head opens, a TINY PROPELLER pops out, spins,
     lifting the puppet into the air.  The car passes beneath it at
     speed.  Screeches off into a street, races along between tall
     buildings.

     INSIDE THE CAR

                         WHITE
               What now?

                         BUMSTEAD
               This ocean business...  I know where
               I can find a map.  I need to go back
               to the station.  Where will you be?

     White thinks for a moment, pulls the paper his wife gave him
     from his pocket.

                         WHITE
               I'll go see an uncle of mine.
                    (reading)
               Five  -  one  -  eight  -  three  -  double
               six  -  three...

     Bumstead scribbles on the pad mounted to the dash, battles with
     the wheel, driving at breakneck speed.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Good.
                    (looks in rear
                    mirror)
               Uh-oh...

     White turns and looks behind them.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  HEADLIGHTS gaining on them.

     ON THE PUPPET  -  sitting AT THE WHEEL of a stolen car, driving
     like crazy.

     BACK IN BUMSTEAD'S CAR

     White takes out his gun  -  AIMS at the rapidly approaching
     car.

                         WHITE  (remembers)
               It's empty.

                         BUMSTEAD
               Take mine.

     Bumstead pulls a gun out of his coat.  They swap.

     The puppet PULLS ALONGSIDE, a mechanical arm extends towards
     Bumstead's front tire.  A SPINNING BLADE extends from the end
     of the mechanical arm.

                         PUPPET
               ARRRRRRRRGGGHHHH!...  HA-HA-HA-HA-
               HA!!

     TIGHT ON THE BLADE heading for the spinning wheel.  White
     fires.  Shells hit the PUPPET'S car, shattering windows.

     THE BLADE cuts into the tire  -  it pops loudly, goes flat,
     metal SPARKS off the road.

     White is thrown forward, hits his head on the dash.  Bumstead
     fights to keep control, SWERVES into the side of the other
     vehicle, making it scrape a concrete wall, hits garbage cans
     flying.

     The PUPPET'S car falls behind  -  then swerves off into a side-
     street and disappears.

                         BUMSTEAD  (looks behind him)
               Where did it go?

                         WHITE  (looks back also)
               Don't know.

     Both look FORWARD AGAIN  -  to see the PUPPET'S CAR pull out in
     front of them, BLOCKING THE WAY.  Bumstead's car is going too
     fast.  Slams the brakes.

     TIGHT ON PUPPET  -  Screaming with insane joy as Bumstead's car
     approaches like a bullet.

     INSIDE INSPECTOR'S CAR

                         BUMSTEAD
               Jump!

     Bumstead rips the phone number from the pad.  The two men LEAP.

     The car continues onwards.

     CRASH!  KA-BOOM!

     In the glow of the flaming wrecks, the two men pick themselves
     up from different sides of the street.  Look at each other,
     turn and head in OPPOSITE directions.

     CAMERA MOVES IN on mangled metal  -  a MECHANICAL CLAW starts
     to pull itself from the wreckage.


     EXT.  STREET  -  NIGHT

     White steps up to a SMALL DOOR in the side of a building.  A
     sign above the door depicts an underwater scene, crammed with
     fish, sea-weed, bubbles floating to the surface.  Dominating
     everything is a GREEN MAN with scales  -  a KING NEPTUNE-type.

     INSIDE

     White stops in front of a ticket booth, beside a faded blue
     curtain.  In the booth a TICKET SELLER is snoring with his mouth
     hanging open, his head sagging. White knocks on the window.  The
     man wakes with a start.

                         TICKET SELLER
               Yeah.  That's what I said!
                    (looks at White  -
                    rubs head)
               What..?

                         WHITE
               I'm looking for this address.

     The man squints at the card White holds up, nods groggily.

                         TICKET SELLER
               Upstairs.  Through there.

     He thumbs the blue curtain.  Curls up, shuts his eyes again.

     BEYOND THE CURTAIN

     A dark room full of BUBBLING NOISES AND WATER DRIPPING  -  an
     aquarium.

     Several corridors meander between large glass panels that look
     into illuminated tanks of sea creatures.

     White moves past a shadowy doorway.  He can barely make out
     STAIRS.


     INT.  HALL-WAY

     White moves cautiously in the darkness.  On a door a tiny
     NAMEPLATE says:  K. WHITE.  The door is unlocked.  He opens it
     and goes in.

     INSIDE

     An entrance hall of an apartment.  A large number of MOUNTED
     FISH of all sizes line the hall.

     PHOTOS on the wall  -  family portraits.  White examines these,
     concentrates on one in particular  -  a young boy on a red push-
     bike, in the background a sign with a faded image of a girl in
     a bathing suit:  WELCOME TO BLUMBVILLE!  it says.

     A strange WHIRRING NOISE O.S.  White hides behind a sofa.
     Whatever is making the whirring noise moves past slowly.  White
     cannot see what it is.

                         VOICE O.S.
               John?

     White turns to see an OLD MAN in his pyjamas sitting in a
     WHEELCHAIR.  The man pushes a lever on the side of the chair.  A
     whir of electric motors.  The chair carries him out of the
     shadows.  White steps from behind the sofa.

                         MAN
               Are you alright?  What are you doing
               here?  Is this one of your jokes,
               John?  It's been so long, I thought
               you'd forgotten your uncle Karl?

                         WHITE
               Uncle...  Karl.


     INT.  AIR-CONDITION DUCT

     A P.O.V.  -  MOVING THROUGH a dark, claustrophobic pipe.
     TWISTING around tight corners, DARTING down straight lengths of
     ducting.  Dim light spills from wire grills spaced along the
     walls.

     WE TRAVEL up to one grill, at the end of a long stretch of
     tunnel  -  stop, nowhere left to go. We can see through the gaps
     in the wire, looking down into...

     THE ROOM

     White and uncle Karl are having a SLIDE-SHOW.  Shots of a recent
     vacation  -  the uncle doing a series of mundane things.

                         KARL (chuckling)
               Not often I get a chance to show
               these.

     He changes the slide:  an image of him standing against a brick
     wall.

                         KARL
               And this is me again about  -  um  -  I
               would guess about twelve feet further
               to the right of the last shot.  Now
               just behind the wall is the hotel I
               stayed at  -  sweet little place...

     The PHONE RINGS.  Uncle Karl wheels over, picks up the receiver.

                         KARL (talks down the line)
               Hello...  Yes, he's here...
                    (holds out the phone
                    to White)
               It's for you.

     White concerned  -  takes the phone.

                         WHITE
               Yes?
                    (he listens)
               Oh, it's you...  Yes...  My uncle
               apparently...  Just looking at some
               memories...  You have?  That's good.

                                              CUT TO:

     INT.  POLICE STATION  -  NIGHT

     Bumstead talks to White on the phone.  He stands in a dark
     room, surrounded by charts and maps.

                         BUMSTEAD
               At first I thought there was no way
               to get to the ocean...  The buildings
               are a barrier, no windows, no doors
               -  everything just, well, ends  -  only
               thing would be drill a hole.  But
               then, I saw it, one door, just one...
               Inside a tenement building...

     Bumstead is interrupted by a NOISE O.S.  He looks to a frosted
     partition  -  dark figures walk past on the other side.  He
     quickly sorts through SEVERAL MAPS, making as little noise as
     he can.

                         BUMSTEAD (whisper)
               We can meet later  -  but first I
               have to do something.  Look I got to
               go...

                                              CUT BACK TO:

     White holds THE PHONE, listens to Bumstead on the other end.

                         WHITE
               Where can we meet?...  Alright.
               Good...

     As White hangs up he notices A DOOR behind a big old crockery
     cupboard.  The cupboard has been pushed up against the wall,
     hiding the door.

     BACK IN THE POLICE STATION

     BUMSTEAD quickly folds the map and shoves it into his pocket.
     As he turns and runs from the room we NOTICE A DARK FIGURE
     standing behind a shelf in the room.

     IN UNCLE KARL'S APARTMENT

     UNCLE KARL continues to change slides  -  the noise echoing
     about the room.  White moves over and sits down next to him.

                         KARL
               Look!  This is a good one!

                         WHITE
               What is that door?

                         KARL
               Which one?

                         WHITE
               There.  Behind the cabinet.  Where
               does it go?

     The uncle watches the slides.

                         KARL
               Such a joker!  Like your father.

                         WHITE
               No.  Have a look.

     He leads the old man over to the cabinet.

                         WHITE
               You see it?

                         KARL
               Yes.

                         WHITE
               Where does it lead?

                         KARL
               It must be a closet or something.

     White pushes at the cabinet.  The old man helps.  They only
     manage to push several inches  -  it is very heavy.  White
     decides to just climb over it.  He squeezes through, opens the
     door and climbs a set of dark stairs.  Uncle Karl watches.

                         KARL
               Don't trip over.  It's dark up there.


     INT.  ATTIC  -  NIGHT

     TIGHT ON a light switch  -  it is flipped.

     AN ATTIC  -  full of books, boxes, discarded possessions.
     White picks up a book and opens it  -  the pages have been
     eaten out by a swarm of ROACHES.  He drops it in disgust as the
     insects scurry over his hands.

     In a small wooden box are several toys he examines with great
     interest.  At the bottom of the box he finds a SMALL DOG-EARED
     DRAWING BOOK.  On the cover is a colourful scrawl in child's
     writing  -  a title:  ANSWERS  -  BY JONATHAN WHITE, AGE NINE.

     White sits down and flips through the book in the dim light.
     Page after page is filled with neat handwriting and drawings.
     As he reads segments from the book he seems more and more
     disturbed.  He flips through faster and faster.

     HIS P.O.V.

     Pages flip past, stopping occasionally.  Glimpses of DIAGRAMS.
     The MYSTERY MEN and THEIR WORLD.  Cross-sections of the MYSTERY
     MEN, the cavity in their head with the INSECTS INSIDE clearly
     illustrated.  EVERYTHING.

     PUSH IN CLOSE on White.  He looks up, STUNNED.


     INT.  UNCLE KARL'S APARTMENT

     White emerges from the attic, clutching the small book to his
     chest, lost in thought.  He steps quietly into a hall-way  -
     notices the old man putting THE PHONE back on its cradle.

                         KARL
               John, I didn't see you there.

     A NOISE O.S. White and Uncle Karl turn.  A VENTILATION GRILL
     falls off a wall, revealing a hole.  EYES shine from the
     darkness.

     THE PUPPET leaps from the hole.  Its blades unfolding,
     spinning wildly before it hits the carpet.  It faces the two
     men.

                         KARL
               What is that?

                         WHITE (to Karl)
               Get back!

                         KARL
               Filthy beast!  Shoo!  Go on!  Shoo!

     He wheels forward, attempting to scare the puppet off.

                         WHITE
               No!

     The puppet goes for Uncle Karl.  A whirr of metal, BLOOD
     SPLASHES ACROSS WHITE and the walls.  Uncle Karl SCREAMS
     horribly.

     White grabs a chair  -  holds it above him.  The puppet turns
     from the dead man in the wheelchair.  White lets it have it.
     The chair CRASHES DOWN, splintering into pieces.

     The puppet is dazed, but immediately recovers.  White has a
     fire-poker now.  As the puppet advances, he swings, connecting
     with the creature, hurtling it across the room, into a wall.
     White runs out the door.

     IN THE CORRIDOR

     He leaps into a waiting elevator.  Pushes the top floor button.

     THE ELEVATOR SHAFT  -  The elevator moves upwards.

     INSIDE THE ELEVATOR

     White looks through the circular window in the door.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  Floor after floor SLIDES PAST  -  deserted.  He
     looks at the floor indicator.  TIGHT ON NUMBERS lighting up:
     86, 87, 88...

     Then the elevator stops, the doors open, looking down a dark
     corridor.  The PUPPET is at the end.  It turns to face him,
     SUDDENLY RACES FORWARD, a horrible high-pitched shriek from its
     mechanical voice box.

     White STABS the buttons of the elevator frantically, the doors
     won't close.  The puppet is upon him.  He JUMPS, straight up.
     It goes under him, CRASHING INTO the back of the elevator.
     White hits the down button one last time, and leaps out of the
     compartment AS THE DOORS CLOSE.

     A MECHANICAL extendible arm shoots out and grabs White around
     the ankle. DRAGS him across floor.  THE PUPPET shrieks wildly
     again, as...

     ITS ARM  -  is JAMMED in the closing doors now.  Lift descends.
     The puppet squeals.  The arm SNAPS OFF.

     White stands, pulls dislocated arm off his ankle.  He can hear
     the elevator descending.  Suddenly it STOPS  -  starts
     returning to his floor.  White turns and runs again.

     The lift doors BURST OPEN  -  the ENRAGED CREATURE emerges and
     races after him.

     He tears around a corner  -  finds himself in a dead-end.
     Nowhere to go.  He can hear the puppet approaching along the
     corridor.  Suddenly he notice A GRILL on a wall ABOVE HIS HEAD.
     He pulls it off, climbs into an incredibly tight pipe.  Crawls
     frantically.

     He sees a LIGHT ahead.  An opening.  He kicks the grill off.  A
     sudden gust of wind.

     HIS P.O.V.

     The pipe leads to the outside of the building  -  nowhere to go
     except a hundred stories STRAIGHT DOWN.  He screams, almost
     falls.  Turns to start crawling back.

     Suddenly the end of the pipe fills with WHIRRING METAL BLADES.
     The puppet has followed him in and is advancing.

     No choice  -  he looks out the hole.  SEES A PIPE on the
     outside of the building, running vertically near the opening.
     It looks impossible but it's his only chance.

     He climbs out, balancing himself on the lip of the opening,
     REACHES for the pipe.  The puppet is almost upon him.  He
     swings across, gets a HAND on the pipe.  He slips, DANGLES  -
     holding on  -  one hand on the pipe, one on the edge of the hole.
     The pipe is greasy, slippery, can't grip it.

     SUDDENLY he hears a MECHANICAL CLICKING  -  TURNS to see the
     puppet standing on the edge of the hole, inches from his hand.
     A soft noise reverberates in its voice box  -  a mechanical
     giggle?  A circular blade on one of its arms starts up, moves
     down onto White's HAND.

     TIGHT ON HIS EYES  -  sweat beads and runs down his forehead.

     TIGHT ON THE BLADE  -  as it cuts into flesh.  BLOOD spatters
     White's face as he grimaces with intense pain.  He can't hold
     on.

     HE FALLS, plummets through space.  Screaming.


     INT.  HOSPITAL  -  NIGHT

     A GROUP OF SURGEONS stand about BUMSTEAD'S MOTHER on her life-
     support machinery.  The surgeons have face-masks on and are in
     deep shadow.  The woman stares blankly, still in a coma.

     IN THE RECEPTION AREA

     BUMSTEAD looks up from his wristwatch.

                         BUMSTEAD
               I can't wait any longer...

     He is standing in front of the MALE NURSE in the glassed-in
     counter.

                         NURSE
               I'm sorry.  I told you, she is being
               examined...

     He turns and storms off down the corridor.  The NURSE stands,
     shouting after him.

                         NURSE
               Mister Bumstead!

     INSIDE MOTHER'S ROOM

     One of the "doctors" leans down and grabs a handful of WIRES
     leading out of a box beside the woman.

                         SURGEON
               We will teach the pig to meddle in
               our affairs.  Yes.

     He pulls the wires out in a burst of electrical sparks  -  ALL
     THE MACHINES DIE.  The woman comes to life momentarily, starts
     to claw at the glass shield in front of her face, like she is
     suffocating.  The life drains from her weak body and she is
     STILL.

     ANGLE ON THE DOOR  -  it bursts open.  Bumstead is standing
     there.  The masked surgeons are startled, they turn rapidly to
     face him.

                         BUMSTEAD (steps forward)
               What is happening?

                         SURGEON
               Ah, Inspector Bumstead!  We are glad
               you are here  -  I'm afraid we have
               done all we can.  Yes.  Your Mother
               has passed.  Yes.

     Bumstead turns towards his mother.

                         BUMSTEAD
               But she was getting better...

                         SURGEON
               We are sorry.  The cancer  -  it was
               fatal.

     Bumstead turns to the men, confusion in his eyes.

                         BUMSTEAD
               She doesn't have cancer.

     The men glance at each other for a moment, then back at the
     inspector.

                         SURGEON
               We knew that.  Yes.
                    (the other men nod)
               Anyway  -  she is dead.

     Bumstead leaps forward, RIPS OFF one of the surgeon's masks.

     ANGLE ON THE MAN  -  He turns to look at Bumstead, pale skin,
     staring eyes, a MYSTERY MAN.  TWO OTHER MEN grab him from
     behind.

                         BUMSTEAD (struggles)
               I'll kill you all!

     One of the Mystery Men steps up to the struggling inspector,
     places the palm of his hand across Bumstead's eyes.

                         MYSTERY MAN
               You will obey us, yes.  In your mind
               there is a dark space...

     TIGHT ANGLE

     Bumstead's hand reaches out, fumbles at a tray of surgical
     implements, grabs a SCALPEL.

     WIDER

     He cuts into the hand of one of the Men holding him, SPINS AND
     DRIVES the scalpel into the forehead of the Mystery Man
     attempting to hypnotise him.

     The other Men leap towards him.


     EXT.  CANAL  -  NIGHT

     TIGHT ON WHITE'S FACE

     His eyes are shut tight.  He opens them, slowly LOOKS AROUND,
     curious why he isn't dead.

     WIDER ANGLE

     White floats in MID-AIR, hovering ten feet or so above a dark
     body of water.  He looks amazed.  Shuts his eyes, rubs them,
     opens them again.  Still floating.

     He clenches his fists and TENSES his body.  Slowly he starts to
     MOVE FORWARD, hovering at an even height over the water.

     WIDER STILL

     SEVERAL ANGLES feature the figure of White levitating across
     the harbour, past half-sunken buildings and rusted ships.

     TIGHT ON WHITE  -  He comes to a stop.  Smiles in amazement.
     Then he suddenly plummets into the water, like a trap-door has
     opened beneath him.

     ANGLE ON BUBBLES floating to the surface.  White's FACE rises
     slowly out of the water.

     WIDER  -  CITY SKYLINE

     A SMALL OBJECT floats towards the ground at the end of a tiny
     white parachute.

     BACK ON WHITE

     He swims across to a small boat, climbs aboard, pushes himself
     silently through the still canals of the city.


     EXT.  HARBOUR

     Oil tankers move silently through inky water.

     White paddles the boat to the bottom of A PIER, climbs a rotten
     ladder.  He runs off into the shadows.

     BACK IN THE WATER

     The PUPPET cuts through the waves, pushed along by a rear
     propeller.  It reaches the pier, climbs to the top.  The prop
     retracts, and the creature wheels forward slowly, onto a
     concrete surface.  It looks around  -  it knows White is there
     somewhere.

     PUPPET'S P.O.V.

     A trail of WET FOOTPRINTS on the ground.  It follows them, is
     led to a crane cabin.

     INSIDE THE CRANE'S CABIN  -  is White, a lunatic grin on his
     face, at the controls.

     A NOISE O.S. startles the puppet.  It looks up.

     PUPPET'S P.O.V.

     Follows the crane up into the air.  The crane is swinging around
     against the dark sky.  A HUGE METAL CONTAINER dangles, stops
     above the puppet.

     ON WHITE

                         WHITE
               Nice knowing you.

     TIGHT ON WHITE'S HAND  -  It pulls a lever.

     THE CONTAINER  -  Shakes and starts to fall.

     THE PUPPET  -  Screams up at the plummeting container.

     WIDER

     The container crashes into the ground, crushing the creature.

     Silence.  Dust floats in the air.


     EXT.  STREET

     BUMSTEAD's running.  He looks a mess, clutching a bleeding gash
     in his side, cuts on his face, clothes torn  -  but he made it
     out alive...

                                              CUT TO:

     EXT. ROOF-TOP

     BUMSTEAD sits on the ground, leans against a wall, breathing
     heavily  -  he's losing a lot of blood.

     He waits.

     A NOISE O.S. startles him  -  A FIGURE in the shadows across the
     roof.

                         BUMSTEAD
               White?

     It's too big to be White.  The man steps from the shadows.

                         STROMBOLI (walking forward)
               Hello, Bumstead.

     He's holding a gun, levelled at the inspector.  Bumstead lies
     bleeding, against the wall.  He points his own gun at the
     advancing man and pulls the trigger.

     CLICK!  CLICK!  CLICK!

                         BUMSTEAD
               Dammit.

     Stromboli is upon him, grabs the empty gun, throws it away,
     picks up the inspector, leans him against the wall.  Without
     Stromboli holding him up, Bumstead would not be able to stand.

                         STROMBOLI
               Why do you always have to find things
               out the hard way!  Couldn't you just
               do your job, you idiot?  I told you,
               didn't I?  These people are not
               playing games, Bumstead.  They can do
               anything they want, don't you
               understand?

                         BUMSTEAD (a hiss)
               You're one of them.  You bastard...

                         STROMBOLI (laughing)
               In a way, we all are, inspector!
               You.  Me.  Everybody!

     Stromboli carries Bumstead towards the EDGE of the roof.  He
     keeps laughing.

                         STROMBOLI
               Time for that early retirement,
               Bumstead.  Didn't bring the gold watch
               I'm afraid.

                         BUMSTEAD (weakly)
               No...  Please...

     INSPECTOR'S P.O.V.

     THE EDGE looms up  -  a long drop to the street.


     EXT.  STREET

     White paces nervously through empty streets.  He stops, to get
     his bearings, then turns and runs into:

     A SILHOUETTED FIGURE in a bizarre metal contraption on wheels.
     A skeletal hand reaches out to White, grabs his arm.  An inhuman
     moan.

     Terrorised, White pulls back.

                         FIGURE
               Ahhh...  it hurts!...

     The mechanized figure trundles forward, pins him to a wall.  A
     streetlight reveals...

     DOCTOR SCHREBER covered in blood, encased in a metal framework
     covered in silver blades.

                         WHITE
               What happened to you?

                         SCHREBER
               I'm...  being...  punished.

     The blades are connected to the wheels  -  they turn when he
     moves forward, metal cuts into his flesh, slowly SKINNING HIM
     ALIVE.  A torture machine.  Between screams of intense pain, the
     doctor speaks.

                         SCHREBER
               I had to  -  ahhhh  -  find you...  I..
               I...

     The doctor shuts his eyes, a trickle of blood runs down his
     face.
                         WHITE
               What is it?

                         SCHREBER
               We are...  living in their dreams...

     Schreber turns and rolls off into the night, screaming  -  BLADES
     SPIN furiously, peeling back flesh.  He glances at White one
     last time.

                         SCHREBER
               Insect...  dreams...


     EXT.  STREET

     WHITE is running.  As he approaches the building he hears a
     scream  -  looks up to see a figure PLUNGE OFF the roof.

     He runs over.  Looks down at the twisted body.  THE INSPECTOR
     moans  -  barely alive.  White kneels by his side.

     BUMSTEAD'S hand moves across to an expanding POOL of red beside
     him, traces an 'H' on the ground in the blood.

                         WHITE (reading)
               Aitch?

     The inspector seems to be dying, then revives momentarily, puts
     A MAP in white's hand, looks up at him:

                         BUMSTEAD
               Gesundheit!

     His eyes roll up and he GOES LIMP.  White stares at the body,
     then:

                         WHITE
               I didn't sneeze.


     INT.  MORGUE  -  NIGHT

     The MORTICIAN turns off the lights in the main hall and steps
     into his office, sits down, pours himself a hot drink; turns on
     the radio, opens his conic-book.

     A NOISE O.S. disturbs him and he gets up, walks out of his
     office, looks into the darkness.

     HIS P.O.V. PANS around the empty morgue.  Nothing.  Decides to go
     back to his office.  He turns and is startled by three MYSTERY
     MEN obstructing his path.

                         MAN 1
               We are looking for the White victims.

                         MORTICIAN
               And who the hell are you?

     The mortician catches a glimpse of the shiny dagger Man 1 is
     clutching by his side.  He becomes very scared.

                         MORTICIAN
               Over there.  Numbers eight to twelve.

     THREE MEN look over to where the mortician has pointed in
     unison.  Man 1 looks back.

                         MAN 1
               Thank you.

     A FLASH OF STEEL.  The mortician's throat SPOUTS blood.  He grabs
     reflexively at the gash and falls back onto the floor, DEAD
     before he hits the tiles.

     The Mystery Men step to an adjoining chamber.  Man 2 puts down a
     Box he is carrying, opens the lid.  A green glow oozes out.  The
     other Men manipulate levers on a control panel on a nearby
     wall.  Stainless steel doors open.  Body-length trays slide into
     the dim light.  SHAPES covered in white sheets.

     Man 2 with the box removes a GLASS SYRINGE, filled with a
     glowing green liquid.  He steps TO THE BODIES and injects each
     with the syringe, through the sheets.  When he has finished he
     steps back, places the syringe back in the box.  The MEN leave
     silently.

     All is silent and still.

     Then the shape beneath a sheet starts to SIT UP.  Then another,
     and another.


     INT.  CORRIDOR  -  NIGHT

     WHITE is running again, clutching BUMSTEAD'S MAP.

     CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP

     REVEALS the entire corridor.  KEEPS PULLING BACK  -  until the
     view is impossibly wide  -  like a cross-section of the building
     he's in, a doll's house with the roof taken off.  The TINY
     FIGURE runs, amidst a dark network of surrounding rooms and
     passages.

     CONTINUE PULL BACK

     White is no more than a SPECK  -  the hall-way stretches
     ENDLESSLY in both directions, behind and in front of the moving
     figure, through an infinite labyrinth.

     WIDER STILL

     We no longer make out the figure.  The x-rayed environment
     resembles some intricate aerial map of the vast city  -  the
     corridor an ever increasing SPIRAL.


     INT.  ORNATE APARTMENT BUILDING  -  NIGHT

     White reaches the top of a spiral flight of stairs.

     HIS P.O.V.

     APARTMENT 'H'  -  a rusted metal letter on the door.  White steps
     forward.  He knocks once and the door creaks open, unlocked.

     INSIDE

     The rooms are empty, derelict, strewn with rubbish.  Mould grows
     on the damp walls.  A door stands at the end of a long empty
     room.  He can hear the muffled sounds of SURF, SEAGULLS.  White
     starts to walk forward, smiling.  As he approaches the door he
     begins to feel colder.

     He opens the door and looks out.  A blast of SUNLIGHT  -  blue
     ocean and sky.

                         VOICE O.S.
               John White...

     White does not turn about, he takes a step forward, then
     another  - and RUNS INTO THE SKY  - A PAINTED WALL. He glances up
     at a small SPEAKER built into the wall  -  the SOURCE of the sea-
     side SOUND EFFECTS.

     He hears the click of the gun being cocked behind him.  Hopes
     dashed, he turns.  ANGLE ON A MYSTERY MAN  -  a gun pointed at
     White's stomach.

                         MYSTERY MAN
               There is nothing, Mister White.
               Beyond the city.  Never has been.
               Unfortunate.  Yes?

     White is led into a pitch black room.

     INSIDE

     TIGHT ON WHITE'S FACE  -  In the darkness  -  he looks across to
     the Mystery Man standing beside him.

                         WHITE
               How did you know where to find me?

                         MYSTERY MAN
               We knew you would turn up here
               eventually...  Been waiting for you,
               yes.  Hoped you wouldn't make a
               nuisance of yourself on the way...

     The Man motions with the gun for White to walk forward.  As soon
     as White turns to do this, the Man slips from the room and
     shuts the door, cutting off any existing light.

     A NOISE O.S.  -  some kind of machine being turned on  -  lights
     start to come up all over the room.

     It's a normal, average-sized, living room.  All the furniture
     has been removed and replaced with chairs, tables, podiums  -  an
     arrangement resembling an IMPROVISED COURT of law.  In fact,
     White realizes he is standing behind some kind of witness box.

     The apartment is devoid of people, though almost immediately a
     door opens to the side (looks like it would lead to the
     kitchen) and a series of figures step through.  MYSTERY MEN.

     All the MEN take up specific positions around the room, without
     uttering a word, but don't sit.  One MYSTERY MAN opens a curtain
     beneath an arched entrance  -  beyond it, within a very small
     room, stand DOZENS OF PEOPLE, crammed shoulder to shoulder.  The
     people stare at White silently  -  a bizarre gallery of
     spectators.

     An eerie silence falls on the room.

     The kitchen door opens again.  White is shocked to see the
     VICTIMS WALK INTO the room and adopt positions in what is
     obviously the area for the jury.

     The DISEMBOWELED CORPSE OF A WOMAN steps out of the shadows,
     pushing a pram.  Her throat is cut, she is shrouded in a white
     sheet.

     Within the pram is the BABY clutching its own head, with spine
     attached, under its arm.

     Then the mutilated FREDRICK hops out, followed by the three
     brown blood-stained paper parcels containing what is left of
     the YOUNG BOY.

     Finally, his WIFE and the JAPANESE WOMAN, still in passionate
     embrace, take their positions.

     Another door opens  -  a closet. Within stands the figure we have
     only seen as a shadow  -  the elderly MYSTERY MAN with the cane.
     MISTER BLACK slowly reaches above him and pulls at a chain
     hanging from the ceiling  -  the light snaps on inside the
     closet.  Somewhere, a long way off in the same building, a
     toilet is heard flushing.

     He is much older than the rest, carries himself with authority
     as he hobbles across the room to a raised podium, supporting
     his withered body on his cane.  Looks like he will play JUDGE.

     Everyone in the room now sits.  Mister Black looks at White.

     ANGLE ON WHITE  -  He starts to tremble, not so much from fear,
     but cold.

                         MISTER BLACK
               Welcome.

     White just looks at him, still clutching the small notebook
     called:  ANSWERS.

                         MISTER BLACK
               John White, you are to be tried for
               murder, yes.  You wish to confess to
               these crimes now?

     White is silent.  He leans over and scratches his legs through
     the fabric of his trousers.  They itch like crazy.

     Mister Black turns to the assembled people.

                         MISTER BLACK
               Very well.  The testimony of the
               prosecutors.  Yes.

     TWO MYSTERY MEN stand and step across to a wooden easel.  MAN 1
     stands beside it, reveals a series of visuals, charts, etc.
     drawn on stiff cardboard.  MAN 2 uses a pointer while he
     describes the evidence to support their case.

                         MYSTERY MAN 2
               We will show that John White is
               abnormal, a menace to society, a
               dangerous sick individual, and that
               the court should have no mercy in
               finding him guilty and punishable to
               the extreme for his crimes.

     MAN 1 places a large black and white photo blow-up on the
     easel.  It shows White at the door of the JAPANESE WOMAN'S
     apartment, clutching a kitchen knife, covered in blood.

                         MYSTERY MAN 1
               Exhibit A shows the accused leaving
               the scene of his most recent crime,
               yes.  A photo taken by a remote camera
               planted by one of our agents.

     White watches in stunned silence.

     A general murmur of agreement through the room as the point is
     made.  Mister Black turns to the victims, nods his head slowly.

                         MYSTERY MAN 2
               Exhibit B...

     MAN 1 removes a small tape recorder, hands it to MAN 2.

                         MYSTERY MAN 2
               Actual tape recording of accused
               committing aforementioned crime, yes.

     He turns a switch, the reels spin slowly.  A hush fills the
     room.

                         VOICE 1 (sounds like JAPANESE WOMAN)
               No...  Please...

     A scream.

                         VOICE 2 (sounds like White)
               Shut up!

     Another scream.  A ripping sound.

                         VOICE 3 (sounds like his WIFE)
               John!  Don't...

     Another scream.

     White is standing up, involuntarily, he can't listen to this
     any longer.

                         WHITE (a squeak, almost inaudible)
               Stop it!  This is a lie...

     Mister Black turns to White.  The Men testifying stop the tape
     and look at him also.

                         MISTER BLACK
               Something to say?  Ready to confess?

     The Men in the audience turn and all stare at White, as do the
     victims and the spectators in the adjoining room.

                         WHITE (back to a whisper)
               I didn't kill anyone.

                         MISTER BLACK
               Speak up.  Yes.

                         WHITE (finds his voice)
               It's lies.  Everything.

     He grips the barrier before him.

     A SHRIEK from the pram containing the BABY  -  it rocks violently
     from side to side.

     The DISEMBOWELED WOMAN rises from her chair.  She has difficulty
     standing, her limbs stiff.  She looks at White, opens her mouth
     to say something, but no sound comes out.  Instead a tiny RED
     CRAB scuttles out, across her face, and falls to the ground.
     She sits down.

     White is stunned.

                         MISTER BLACK
               Bring the witnesses.

     AN OLDER COUPLE are led out of the kitchen by a Mystery Man.
     Shown to seats behind a podium.  The woman looks sadly at White.

                         MISTER BLACK
               You are the accused's parents?

                         FATHER
               That's right.

                         MOTHER
               Yes.

                         WHITE
               Wait a minute...

                         MISTER SLACK
               You had your turn!  Let them speak.

                         WHITE (angry)
               My parents are supposed to be dead!
               You can't keep changing the damn
               rules like this!  Why go through this
               ridiculous set-up!  Why don't you
               just kill me and be done with it!

                         MISTER BLACK (smiles at parents)
               Please, continue...

                         WHITE
               This is insane!

     He looks over to the victims.

                         WHITE
               It was them, not me.
                    (points at the
                    Mystery Men)
               They killed you.

     Looks back at the Mystery Men.

                         WHITE
               You have invented all this.  History
               is a lie, not just mine, everyone's  -
               a fiction.  You are the authors.

     His knuckles go white as he squeezes tighter on the barrier.

                         MISTER BLACK
               A fanciful idea, Mister White.

                         WHITE
               Everyone has a job  -  a function.  Each
               one teaches you more about your
               invention.  I'm what is called a
               murderer.

     The whole court listens in silence to White's testimony.

                         WHITE
               You've given everybody memories, but
               I missed out.  The Doctor saw to that
               -  played your own game.  And now...

     WHITE looks at the MYSTERY MEN, then back at MISTER BLACK.

                         WHITE
               You're trying to get rid of me.

     There is silence.  Whispers.  Faces staring.

                         WHITE
               Why do I threaten you?  You're scared
               aren't you?

     MISTER BLACK and the gathered MYSTERY MEN look speechless at
     White.  Suddenly everyone bursts into spontaneous LAUGHTER, led
     by Mister Black.

     A terrible cackle fills the room  -  all the MYSTERY MEN laugh
     hysterically, so do the mutilated victims.  The spectators in
     the adjoining room remain silent.

                         MISTER BLACK
               Ah  -  a plot.  Now we have a plot!
                    (chuckling)
               Very inventive...

     The older couple behind the podium look disturbed.

                         MOTHER
               Please, John, you're embarrassing
               us...

                         WHITE
               Shut up!

                         MISTER BLACK (chuckling still)
               You have proof?  Evidence?  Yes?

                         WHITE (holds up notebook)
               It's all here!

     Mister Black seems startled by the book, then pretends it's
     nothing.

                         MISTER BLACK
               A book of delusions.  Anything else?

                         WHITE
               But I...

                         MISTER BLACK
               I see.
                    (turns to the
                    victims)
               The verdict, yes...

                         WHITE
               Wait, this isn't fair...

     The DISEMBOWELED WOMAN stands again.  This time she opens her
     mouth, there is a bubbling noise, water runs out, then:

                         DISEMBOWELED WOMAN (whisper)
               Guil  -  ty...

     White is agitated, fear in his face.  Mister Black stamps SOME
     PAPERS before him repeatedly.

     ON THE PAPERS  -  official-looking documents.  The stamp says:
     GUILTY.

     CLOSE on White's eyes.

                         MISTER BLACK
               Before I pronounce sentence...

     Suddenly the papers on the bench in front of Mister Black BURST
     INTO FLAMES.  Mister Black recoils, almost falling off his
     chair, taken by surprise.  The Mystery Men all look at White, a
     murmur of concern.

     Mister Black looks up at White  -  angered.

                         MISTER BLACK
               How dare you use your tricks on me!

     White, genuinely surprised, looks around.  Several Mystery Men
     BACK AWAY from him, scared.

                         WHITE
               I didn't realise...

                         MISTER BLACK
               Shut up, freak!  Monster!  You are
               insignificant.

     He glares across the room, angrily.  An WOODEN CHAIR in a corner
     starts to vibrate.

     CLOSE on Mister Black's eyes.

     The chair rises into the air  -  HURLS across the room at White.

     Mister Black laughs as it crashes into the wall.  White ducks
     just in time.

     The gathered Mystery Men erupt into enthusiastic applause.

     White regains his composure and tries some mind tricks of his
     own.  He lifts a small table into the air, and makes it spin  -
     a knife and fork dance back and forth on the surface, as several
     plates (from a stack in the kitchen) hurl, firstly at the
     spinning table, then go flying across the room, smashing near
     Mister Black, making him dance back and forth comically.

     This display is accompanied by a rousing rendition of a WALTZ
     playing on a floating gramophone White has also activated with
     his mind.

     SEVERAL Mystery Men are TERRIFIED.  White is amazed at his own
     performance.

                         MISTER BLACK
               You'll regret that.

     Mister Black is furious, spluttering, spit flying from his
     mouth.

                         MISTER BLACK (shouts)
               SHUT IT DOWN!

     A Mystery Man by the window, picks up a phone and dials
     furiously.  Everyone in the room remains silent  -  waiting.

                         MAN ON PHONE
               Yes, we have a problem here.  Shut it
               down immediately.

     White doesn't understand what is going on.  O.S. the SOUND of
     machinery WINDING DOWN.

     ANGLE ON a clock hanging on the wall.  ON the SECOND HAND.  It
     suddenly STOPS.

     All eyes are on Mister Black.

                         MISTER BLACK
               This has all gone too far.  Yes, much
               too far.

     Mister Black starts to SHAKE.  His eyes shut, clenches his
     teeth, grips the insect on his cane, plants his feet firmly to
     the floor.

     Around the room WALLS CRACK, plaster rains down from the
     ceiling...

                                              CUT TO:

     EXT.  CITY  -  NIGHT

     All over the city things START TO FALL APART  -  a devastating
     impact on the landscape.

     MONTAGE

     A street CRACKS OPEN.  Beneath the pavement are pulsating
     intestine-like organs.  These burst open with pus...

     A building vanishes...

     A car on a street corner flies into the air...

     A telephone box STARTS TO SPIN, faster and taster, digging
     itself into the concrete.  Monstrous INSECT LEGS sprout from the
     hole left behind...

     Geysers of STEAMING BILE spurt into the night sky...

     BLACK EXCREMENT forces up out of a sewer, runs down stone
     steps...

     THE CITY is coming apart...

                                              CUT BACK TO:

     INT.  APARTMENT H'

     The room looks like an earthquake hit it  -  broken furniture and
     gaping holes torn in the walls.

     Several MYSTERY MEN huddle behind an upturned table, watching
     WHITE and MISTER BLACK.  They face each other, both still
     standing  - mental energies focused against each other in battle.

     The fighting is taken its toll on both men.

     A DAGGER hangs suspended in mid-air, slowly rotating to face
     White with its shining silver blade.

     Mister Black is clenching his rotting teeth, tightening bony
     fists by his side.  Pushing every ounce of mental power at the
     knife.

     White, bleeding from a gash in his cheek, is straining his mind
     against the knife.

     The blade STARTS TO MOVE, ever so slowly at first, towards
     White.  His body is shaking with his mental effort.  A bead of
     sweat runs down his brow, dripping into his eye, blurring his
     vision.

     He is losing.


     INT.  KITCHEN  -  NIGHT

     We see an OUT OF FOCUS IMAGE.  A group of dark figures.  WHITE
     regains consciousness, strapped to a kitchen table.  From his
     perspective, in the immediate foreground, a figure speaks as he
     removes a syringe from White's FOREHEAD.

                         FIGURE
               Good as new.  Yes.  Everything is
               easier now.

     His vision CLEARS, he can see.  It's MISTER BLACK.  Behind him a
     SMALL CROWD who turn out to be MYSTERY MEN.

     Mister Black suddenly pulls at his own face, removes the mask.

     Underneath is a mess of PULSATING ORGANS AND INSECT PARTS.
     This is what Mystery Men really look like.  He laughs, starts to
     MOVE rhythmically  -  a strange dance-step.  The others join in,
     as they too pull off masks.

     Each Man reaches up to his left ear in unison.  They pull
     squirming INSECTS out, hold them up to the light.  The insects
     scream triumphantly.

     White screams too.  And he can't stop.

     Everything goes BLACK.  Then the sound of a key rattling in a
     lock.  A door slowly creaks open...


     INT.  SEASIDE HOTEL ROOM  -  DAY

     A P.O.V. enters a small room.

     Dappled SUNLIGHT through a tattered lace curtain. A clock ticks
     on a wall.  A cough O.S. from the corridor.  A FAT MAN, talks as
     he enters:

                         FAT MAN
               It's small but clean...
                    (it isn't)
               ...and the view's nice.
                    (points to window)
               Isn't it?

     JOHN WHITE enters.  He is haggard, eyes rimmed with red.  He
     still holds the small black NOTEBOOK, tight to his chest.  He
     stands in the centre of the room, looks up.  Strangely, though
     the room is very small, it extends upwards several stories  -
     windows sit at various heights.

     White walks to the lace curtain, opens it with shaking hands.

     OUTSIDE

     A narrow street and at the end, the ocean.  The sound of distant
     surf, he can taste the salt spray.

                         WHITE (without turning)
               I'll take it.

     The man behind him blows his nose loudly and turns to go,
     shutting the door.  White puts the notebook down on a table near
     the open window.

     LATER

     White has fallen asleep on the bed.

     He wakes, troubled.  Stands and walks over to the sink next to
     the bed.  He moves like he is underwater.  The sea-breeze tugs at
     the curtain, draws him to the window.

     HIS P.O.V.

     Down the street to the small patch of sand between buildings.
     TWO FIGURES  approach each other.

     He pulls out his wallet and removes the torn photo of the
     woman, places it against the pillow on the bed.  He sits on the
     edge of the bed and lifts his trousers, looks at his legs
     nothing out of the ordinary.

     White is disturbed by a TINY MOVEMENT in his coat pocket.  He
     reaches in and pulls out a small, EMACIATED FISH.

     Disgusted, he drops the fish to the floor, looks at the
     creature.  White raise his foot.  His heel comes down with a
     sickening SQUISH.

     THE CAMERA MOVES IN STEADILY towards the notebook near the
     window.  As the SHOT TIGHTENS we can read the title on the
     cover:  ANSWERS  -  BY JONATHAN WHITE, AGE NINE.

     Now a sudden GUST OF WIND blows open the book.  The pages
     flicker past.  Glimpses of happy things.  A child's drawings of
     smiling people.  The sun shining down on a blue ocean full of
     sailing boats.  Fields of colourful flowers.  Cute animals.


     INT.  LONG CORRIDOR  -  DAY

     SOUND OF SURF, distant, muffled.

     CAMERA MOVES slowly towards a door.  The final door  -  no
     others beyond this.  ECHOIC FOOTSTEPS.

     TIGHT ON WHITE  -  His haggard face moves through darkness.  He
     looks down at his walking feet.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  White sees water, waves breaking, through the
     cracks in the floorboards of the hallway.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     The cracks around the closed door are illuminated, white-hot,
     by the SUN outside.

     ON HIS HAND  -  As he reaches towards the handle.

     ON HIS FACE  -  As the door opens.  A sharp line of light cuts
     across his features, as his eyes blink and water.  The wind
     pulls at his messy hair.  SURF NOISE is louder now.

     REVERSE ANGLE  -  WIDER  -  OUTSIDE looking through the door,
     along a long wooden pier jutting out into a blue seascape.  At
     the end of the pier stands the tiny figure of A WOMAN WITH RED
     HAIR.  She looks out at the ocean, her back turned.

     ANGLE LOOKS BACK at White standing in the open doorway, squints
     into the sun.  Suddenly he looks relieved, almost happy for the
     first time.  He steps OUT OF FRAME briskly  -  a weight gone
     from his shoulders.  Everything is clear finally, he knows
     exactly what to do.

     A voice recites names over a P.A. system.

     REVERSE ANGLE

     A TRACKING SHOT follows White, moves down the pier toward the
     woman.  As White steps up to her, she turns and smiles.

                         WOMAN  (indicates the sea)
               Beautiful.

     White nods slowly.  He looks out of place in his crumpled suit.
     He stares out at the ocean.  Seagulls fly over.  Sun reflects
     off waves.

                         WHITE
               Yes...

                         WOMAN
               What's your name?

     He looks at her.  Smiles.  Then, slowly, brings his hands to her
     throat.

                         WHITE
               John...  White.

                    DARK STAR: A SCIENCE FICTION ADVENTURE

                 A Screenplay by John Carpenter and Dan O'Bannon







     OPEN ON BLACK SILENCE.

     The sound of electronic music rises, hollow, metallic.

     FADE IN on a long TRACKING SHOT through the universe.  As the NARRATOR
     speaks we move through galaxies, nebulae, solar systems, moving from
     the infinite slowly down to a particular planetary system deep within
     a maze of suns.

                                   NARRATOR
                              (over)
                    It is the mid 22nd Century.  Mankind
                    has explored the boundaries of his
                    own solar system, and now he reaches
                    out to the endless interstellar
                    distances of the universe.  He moves
                    away from his own small planetary
                    system in huge hyperdrive starships:
                    computer-driven, self-supporting,
                    closed-system spacecraft that travel
                    at mind-staggering post-light
                    velocities.  Man has begun to spread
                    among the stars.  Enormous ships
                    embark with generations of colonists
                    searching the depths of space for
                    new earths, now homes, new
                    beginnings.  Far in advance of these
                    colony ships goes a new pioneer: the
                    scouts, the pathfinders, a special
                    breed of man who has dedicated his
                    life to blazing the trail through
                    the most distant, unexplored
                    galaxies, opening up the farthest
                    frontiers of space.  These are the
                    men of the Advance Exploration
                    Corps.  The task they face is one of
                    unbelievable isolation and
                    loneliness.  So far from home that
                    Earth is no longer even a point of
                    light in the sky, they must comb the
                    universe for those unstable planets
                    whose existence poses a threat to
                    the peaceful colonists that follow.
                    They must find these rogue planets
                    -- and destroy them.  Among these
                    commandos are the men of the
                    scoutship Dark Star.

     We are now moving toward a planet.  Floating in front of the planet is
     the SCOUTSHIP DARK STAR.  As we move toward the ship, we begin to hear
     VOICES, crackling with static.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                              (over -- radio filter)
                    Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?

                                   PINBACK
                              (over -- great static)
                    Mafhkin oble groop...

                                   DOOLITTLE
                              (over -- filter)
                    Ah, what was that again, I still
                    can't hear you?

                                   PINBACK
                              (over -- filter)
                    I said I'm trying to reach Talby.
                    Something's wrong with the damn
                    intercom.  I need a last-minute
                    diameter approximation.

     CAMERA IS NOW FLOATING TOWARD THE OBSERVATION DOME on top of the ship.
     In the Dome sits TALBY.  He is staring around, wide-eyed, at the
     planets and stars.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                              (over -- filter)
                    Talby, Talby, this is Doolittle.  Do
                    you read me?  Talby?

     WE MOVE IN CLOSE ON TALBY'S FACE.  The shot stops and holds as he
     continues to stare, rapt.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                              (cont'd -- over --
                              filter)
                    Talby, do you read me?

     There is a CRACKLE, and Doolittle's voice suddenly booms through, loud
     and clear:

                                   DOOLITTLE
                              (cont'd)
                    TALBY!

                                   TALBY
                              (snaps out of it)
                    Oh!  Ah, yes, Doolittle.  What is it?

                    minute.

     CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL BACK along the length of the control room,
     revealing three men: BOILER, DOOLITTLE, and PINBACK.  They are seated
     close together in cramped little chairs, surrounded by a maze of
     instrumentation, pressing buttons, making adjustments and corrections.
     There is one EMPTY CHAIR; the panel in front of it looks burned.

     Pinback hits a button on his panel.

     INTERIOR - BOMB BAY

     The screen is BLACK for an instant.  Then, two enormous doors begin to
     open ponderously, revealing the planet rotating below.  A huge BOMB,
     designated with a giant #19 on its side, lowers slowly out of the
     ship on a rack.

                                   NARRATOR
                              (over)
                    This is a chain-reaction bomb,
                    otherwise known as an Exponential
                    Thermostellar Device.  Its own
                    destructive power is small, barely
                    enough to vaporize twelve city
                    blocks.  However, when it explodes in
                    contact with an object the size of a
                    planet, it starts a chain-reaction
                    in the very matter of that planet,
                    turning it into a giant reactor
                    which destroys itself in one
                    staggering thermal flash.

                    These bombs are equipped with
                    sophisticated thought and speech
                    mechanisms, to allow them to make
                    executive decisions in the event of
                    a crisis situation.  These judgment
                    centers are controlled by a fail-
                    safe mechanism.

     The DARK STAR accelerates into hyperdrive and streaks away through

     The force field around Talby disappears as the ship comes out of
     hyperdrive.  He rubs his eyes as though awakening, then looks down at

     Powell's empty seat, and hurls it at Boiler.  With a sour look at
     Pinback, Boiler picks up the notebook and begins to leaf through it.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Let's have some music in here,
                    Boiler.

     Boiler presses a button.  LOUD COUNTRY MUSIC THEME BEGINS TO PLAY.

     EXTERIOR - DARK STAR (TITLE SEQUENCE)

     This sequence includes shots of the DARK STAR drifting through space,
     past various cosmic wonders, intercut with shots of the men relaxing
     (Talby staring into space; Boiler trimming his beard; Doolittle
     playing solitaire; Pinback reading a comic book).

     CREDITS AND MUSIC OVER.

     SEQUENCE ENDS.

     INTERIOR - DARK STAR

     Beep.

     We are watching a filmed tape.  Doolittle has just turned it on and is
     staring into the camera.  Crosshairs and blipping numbers superimposed.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Ship's log, entry number 1,943.
                    Dark Star cruising at light speed
                    through Sector Theta 990.  En route
                    to Veil Nebula for destruction of
                    unstable planet.  Our ETA is 1700
                    hours.
                              (thinks)
                    Ship's systems continue to
                    deteriorate...

     Pinback leans into view and whispers into Doolittle's ear.  Doolittle
     nods and Pinback withdraws.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                              (cont'd)
                    The short circuit in the rear seat
                    panel which killed Commander Powell
                    continues to be faulty.
                              (thinks)
                    Uh... Storage Area 9...

     Pinback leans back in and whispers emphatically.  Doolittle looks put-
     upon.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                              (cont'd)
                    And because he's sitting next to it,
                    it continues to bother Pinback.
                              (glares at Pinback.
                              Then:)
                    Storage Area 9 self-destructed last
                    week, destroying entire ship's
                    supply of toilet paper.  That's all.

     Beep.

     INTERIOR - OBSERVATION DOME

     Talby is still gazing around at the stars.

     A hatch opens in the floor and Doolittle sticks his head up.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Talby.

     Talby rotates his seat and looks down at Doolittle.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                              (cont'd)
                    Here's some breakfast.

     Doolittle climbs into the dome and sits on the floor.  He hands Talby
     the food package, and watches matter-of-factly as Talby begins to eat.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                              (cont'd)
                    You know, Talby, you really ought to
                    eat with the rest of us.  You spend
                    too much time up here.

                                   TALBY
                    I like it up here.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Must get lonely being up here so
                    much.

                                   TALBY
                    I don't like to go below since
                    Commander Powell died.  I feel
                    enclosed down there.  If it were big
                    enough, I'd sleep up here...

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    ... Should spend some time below, see
                    more of the rest of the ship...

                                   TALBY
                    ... You see, I can watch things up
                    here, Doolittle.  I love to watch
                    things, just stare at the planets
                    and meteors and asteroids, gas
                    clusters...

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    You'll have plenty of time for that,
                    you know.  Figure it this way: twenty
                    years in space and we've only aged
                    three, so there'll be plenty of time
                    to stare around...

                                   TALBY
                    You know, Doollttle, if we're going
                    into the Veil Nebula, we may
                    actually find a strange and
                    beautiful thing: the Phoenix
                    Asteroids.  They should be passing
                    through there about now...

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Phoenix Asteroids?  Never heard of
                    'em.

                                   TALBY
                    They are a body of asteroids that
                    make a complete circuit of the
                    universe once every 12.3 trillion
                    years.  The Phoenix Asteroids... From
                    what I've heard, Doolittle, they
                    glow... glow with all the colors of
                    the rainbow.  Nobody knows why.  They
                    just glow as they drift around the
                    universe.  Imagine all the sights
                    they've seen in the time they've
                    been travelling -- the birth and
                    death of stars, things we'll never
                    see.  The universe is alive,
                    Doolittle.  I thought it was all
                    empty, but it isn't.  In between the
                    stars, it's seething with light and
                    gasses and dust.  There are little
                    pebbles drifting around, planets no
                    one on Earth has ever seen... No one
                    but the Phoenix Asteroids...

     There is a BLIPPING SOUND.  It is insistent.  Talby is rudely yanked
     from his reverie.  He looks down at a panel.  But his soft talk has
     started Doolittle reminiscing.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    You know what I think about, Talby?

                                   TALBY
                    I'm getting something here, on this
                    readout...

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    It's funny, but I kind of sit
                    around, you know, a lot of time to
                    myself...

                                   TALBY
                    I think I'm getting a malfunction
                    here somewhere.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    I can't talk to the others, but with
                    time to myself, I think about back
                    home, back home at Malibu.  I used to
                    surf a lot, Talby.  I used to be a
                    great surfer.

                                   TALBY
                    Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a
                    definite malfunction on one of the
                    closed-circuit computer systems...

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    The waves at Malibu and Zuma were
                    fantastic in the springs Talby.  I
                    can remember running out on the
                    beach early spring mornings with my
                    board and a wet suit...

                                   TALBY
                    I can't seem to locate the
                    malfunction exactly...

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Waves would be peaking really high
                    and glassy.  Hit that water.  Ridin'
                    the wall just perfect.

                                   TALBY
                    ... Somewhere in the autonomic relay
                    circuits...

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    I guess I miss the waves and my
                    board most of all.

     Talby turns in his seat and addresses Doolittle directly.

                                   TALBY
                    Ah, Doolittle, I do have a
                    malfunction on this readout, but I
                    can't seem to pinpoint exactly where
                    it is.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                              (snapped out of his
                              daydream)
                    Don't worry about it.  We'll find out
                    when it goes bad.

                                   TALBY
                              (chagrined)
                    I really think I should try and
                    locate it immediately.  Might be
                    something important.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    I wish I had my board with me now.
                    Even if I could only polish it once
                    in awhile.

     EXTERIOR - SPACE

     LONG SHOT of the DARK STAR drifting through space.

     INTERIOR - KITCHEN

     Boiler, Pinback, and Doolittle are descending a ladder into the
     kitchen.

                                   BOILER
                    I'm getting this flickering light on
                    one of my panels.

                                   PINBACK
                    What flickering light?

                                   BOILER
                    The one on unit... oh, I think it's
                    GMR twelve zero zero.

                                   PINBACK
                    Oh.  What's wrong now?

                                   BOILER
                    I'm not sure.  I think something is
                    fucked up somewhere in the ship,
                    though.

                                   PINBACK
                    I hope it's not the oven again.

                                   BOILER
                    Yeah.

                                   PINBACK
                    Remember when the artificial
                    gravity, went out in the toilet?

     The men sit for their meal.  Doolittle brings food packets from the
     oven.

                                   PINBACK
                    Hey, Doolittle, think we'll ever
                    find real intelligent life out
                    there?

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Out where?

                                   PINBACK
                    Veil nebula.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Who cares?

     INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM

     The Control Room is EMPTY.  After a moment, there is a repetitive BEEP.

     CLOSE SHOT - TV SCREEN.  On the screen is the message:

                            INCOMING COMMUNICATION

     This fades, and MISSION CONTROLLER appears on the screen, against a
     background of computer terminals.  He is dressed in a snappy tunic, and
     when he receives the on-camera cue, he smiles ingratiatingly.

                                   MISSION CONTROLLER
                    Hi, guys.  Glad to get your message.
                    We gather from the ten-year
                    communications lag that you are
                    approximately 18 parsecs away.  Drop
                    us a line more often, won't you?

                    Sorry to hear about all the
                    malfunctions, and real sorry to hear
                    about the death of Commander Powell.
                    There was a week of mourning all
                    over Earth.  The flags were at half
                    mast.

                    Now I hate to send bad news when you
                    guys are up there doing such a swell
                    job, but something's come up, and we
                    all felt you ought to know about it.
                    Our systems simulation computer has
                    predicted that by the time this
                    message reaches you -- that is to
                    say, in about ten years -- there
                    will be a failure in one of your
                    vital ship's systems.  The
                    malfunction will occur in --
                              (rifles papers)
                    -- system number E180246.  You can
                    see what a problem this would be if
                    you didn't catch it on time.  Now
                    what you should do is this: First,
                    do not, repeat, do not attempt to
                    adjust the system manually.
                    Second --

     INTERIOR - COMPUTER ROOM

     The room is dim and eerie, banks of dimly flickering lights and the
     hum of air-cooling machinery.

     Talby is seated before a glowing screen.  He punches several buttons,
     and the screen comes to life.  A schematic cross-section of the ship
     appears in glowing green lines.

     Talby punches more buttons, and the screen flashes through the levels
     or the ship.  Finally it shows Level 6.  There is a small red light
     pulsing in the Emergency Air Lock.

     Talby punches another button.  The Emergency Air Lock is magnified
     fifteen times until it fills the screen.  The red light is pulsing in a
     small area labelled COMMUNICATIONS LASER #17.

     Talby picks up a microphone.

                                   TALBY
                    Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby.
                    Lieutenant?

                                   DOOLITTLE
                              (over -- filter)
                    Yes, Talby, what is it?

                                   TALBY
                    Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir,
                    but I'm in the Computer Room, and I
                    think I've located the malfunction.
                    The scanner shows it to be some sort
                    of fault in the communications
                    laser, down by the Emergency Air

                    anything important comes up.

     Doolittle hangs up the mike.

     Doolittle thinks about it, and an odd expression crosses his face.

                    What's my first name?

     Talby stops facing LASER SHAFT 17.

     The plate cover on the laser shaft hangs loose; it appears to be
     burned.  Talby approaches it and puts down his tool kit.  He turns on
     his helmet radio.

     Talby stands in front of the laser shaft, trying to reach Doolittle on
     his helmet radio.

                                   TALBY
                    Hello?  Lieutenant Doolittle?  Hello!

     Silence.

     Very carefully, Talby reaches out to touch the dangling plate cover on
     the laser shaft.  He pushes it, and it drops to the floor of the lock
     with a CLANG.

     He takes a long tool from the tool kit.  Slowly, with agonizing care,
     he inserts the tool into the laser shaft, painstakingly avoiding the
     beam.  He engages the tool into the base of the laser, and begins
     slowly to make an adjustment.

     There is a BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT.

     Talby drops the tool and staggers back, clutching his face plate.

     INTERIOR - FREEZER ROOM

     Doolittle climbs down a ladder into the icy-blue, cold Freezer Room.
     The walls are covered with frost, and mist hangs in the air.

     He pulls on a pair of insulated gloves and approaches a heavy freezer
     door.  On the door is a sign:

                         CRYOGENIC FREEZER COMPARTMENT

                         CAUTION

     He opens the door.

     COMMANDER POWELL is encased in the freezer in a post-death, frozen
     ammonia state.  Wire and electrodes are attached to his head.

     Doolittle takes a microphone from a console on the freezer.  He flips a
     switch and speaks into the mike:

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Commander Powell?  Commander Powell,
                    this is Doolittle.  Can you read me?

     A crackle of static comes from a speaker grille, along with the FAINT
     MUTTERING OF COMMANDER POWELL'S VOICE:

     Doolittle fiddles with the volume control, trying to bring Commander
     Powell's voice into audibllity.

                    since anyone has come to talk with
                    me.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Commander, sir, we have a big
                    problem.  You see, the Veil Nebula
                    bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck.  It
                    won't drop from the bomb bay.  It
                    refuses to listen and plans to
                    detonate in --
                              (checks watch)
                    -- less than eleven minutes.

                                   POWELL
                    Doolittle, you must tell me one
                    thing.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    What's that, sir?

                                   POWELL
                    Tell me, Doolittle, how are the
                    Dodgers doing?

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up,
                    disbanded over thirteen years ago.

                                   POWELL
                    Ah... pity, pity...

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    You don't understand, sir, we can't
                    get the bomb to drop.

                                   POWELL
                    Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't
                    you have anything nice to tell me
                    when you activate me?  Oh, well, did
                    you try the azimuth clutch?

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Yes sir.  Negative effect.

                                   POWELL
                    What was that, Doolittle?

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Negative effect.

                                   POWELL
                    It didn't work?

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    That's correct, sir.

                                   POWELL
                    Sorry, Doolittle.  I've forgotten so
                    much since I've been in here.  So
                    much.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    What should we do, sir?  The time is
                    running out.

                                   POWELL
                    Well, what you might try is --

     Commander Powell's voice is drowned in a burst of static.  Doolittle
     fiddles with the dials.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Commander Powell?  Commander, hello!

                                   POWELL
                    Doolittle, hello?

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Sorry, sir, you faded out there for
                    a minute.

                                   POWELL
                    Sorry.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    What were you saying, Commander,
                    about the bomb?

                                   POWELL
                    Ah... it seems to me, Doolittle...
                    Sorry, I've drawn a blank.  Hold it.
                    I'll have it again in a minute.  I
                    forget so many things in here, so
                    many things.  Hold on, just a minute,
                    let me think...

                    bay.  It's foolish.  You'll kill us

                                   POWELL
                    Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    We're running out of time, sir.

                                   POWELL
                    Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you
                    can't get it to drop you'll have to
                    talk to it.

                                   DOOLITTLE

                    Talk to the bomb.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    I already have, sir, and Pinback is
                    talking to it now.

                                   POWELL
                    No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it.
                    Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.

                    Of course.

                    Are you willing to entertain a few

                    Fine.  Think about this one, then:

                    Well of course I exist.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    But how do you know you exist?

                                   BOMB #20
                    It is intuitively obvious.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Intuition is no proof.  What concrete
                    evidence do you have of your own
                    existence?

                                   BOMB #20
                    Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I
                    am.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    That's good.  Very good.  Now then,
                    how do you know that anything else
                    exists?

                                   BOMB #20
                    My sensory apparatus reveals it to
                    me.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Right!

                                   BOMB #20
                    This is fun.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    All right now, here's the big
                    question: how do you know that the
                    evidence your sensory apparatus
                    reveals to you is correct?

     Talby lies unconscious near the burned laser.

     EXTERIOR - BOMB BAY

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    What I'm getting at is this: the
                    only experience that is directly
                    available to you is your sensory
                    data.  And this data is merely a
                    stream of  electrical impulses which
                    stimulate your computing center.

                                   BOMB #20
                    In other words, all I really know
                    about the outside universe relayed
                    to me through my electrical
                    connections.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Exactly.

                                   BOMB #20
                    Why, that would mean... I really
                    don't know what the outside universe
                    is like at all, for certain.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    That's it.

                                   BOMB #20
                    Intriguing.  I wish I had more time
                    to discuss this matter.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Why don't you have more time?

                                   BOMB #20
                    Because I must detonate in seventy-
                    five seconds.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Now, bomb, consider this next
                    question, very carefully.  What is
                    your one purpose in life?

                                   BOMB #20
                    To explode, of course.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    And you can only do it once, right?

                                   BOMB #20
                    That is correct.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    And you wouldn't want to explode on
                    the basis of false data, would you?

                                   BOMB #20
                    Of course not.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Well then, you've already admitted
                    that you have no real proof of the
                    existence of the outside universe.

                                   BOMB #20
                    Yes, well...

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    So you have no absolute proof that
                    Sergeant Pinback ordered you to
                    detonate.

                                   BOMB #20
                    I recall distinctly the detonation
                    order.  My memory is good on matters

                    Yes, of course you remember it, but
                    what you are remembering is merely a
                    series of electrical impulses which
                    you now realize have no necessary
                    connection with outside reality.

                                   BOMB #20
                    True, but since this is so, I have
                    no proof that you are really telling
                    me all this.

     INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM

     Pinback is pawing frantically through the control room, searching for
     the key.  Boiler is apoplectic.

                    The key, goddamit, the key!

                    We're gonna die, Boiler.  We're gonna

                    That's all beside the point.  The
                    concepts are valid, wherever they
                    originate.

                    I must think on this further.

     THE BOMB RAISES ITSELF BACK INTO THE SHIP.  Doolittle practically
     collapses with relief.

     Talby, upside down, is falling in the opposite direction.

                    Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?

                    Here I am.  I think I'm spinning...
                    We're both falling, Talby, in
                    opposite directions, away from each
                    other.  My -- my jetpack's gone.

                    Bomb must have gone off inside the

                    skipper.  He made it.  Commander
                    Powell made it!

     A block of ice with a man's body in it tumbles past, end over end.

                                   POWELL

                    Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.

     The planet begins to rise behind Doolittle.

                    Looks like I'm headed for the
                    planet, Talby.  Going right toward
                    it.

                                   TALBY
                    When you fall, Doolittle, if there's
                    anyone down there on the planet,
                    somebody may see you.  They may see
                    you coming down.  What a beautiful

     Talby turns his head and looks behind him.

                                   TALBY
                    Doolittle, I'm heading right toward
                    something.  It's behind me, in the
                    distance.  Something that glows.

     Far behind Talby, coming nearer, is a shimmering point of light.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Oh yeah?

                                   TALBY
                    Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix
                    Asteroids!

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Phoenix?

     The point of light is closer now, and it has begun to differentiate
     into a group of beautifully colored frost-like shapes.

                                   TALBY
                    It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix!
                    They glow with all the colors of the
                    rainbow, just like everybody said.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    No kidding?

                                   TALBY
                    I'm going into them, I'm going to
                    hit them.  Doolittle...

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Yeah?

                                   TALBY
                    Before we get too far away, and our
                    signals start to fade, I just wanted
                    to tell you... you were my favorite.
                    I really liked you, Doolittle.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    I really liked you too, Talby.  Hey,
                    some debris from the ship!  It's
                    coming right by me.

     Several chunks of debris from the ship drift past Doolittle.

                                   TALBY
                    Doolittle, I'm catching up to the
                    asteroids.  I'm going to be a part of
                    them in a minute.  Doolittle, I'm
                    going into them.

     Talby drifts into the huge frost-like shapes, expanding and glowing
     and spinning, slowly refracting all the colors of the spectrum with a
     cold glow.

                                   TALBY
                              (cont'd)
                    I'm beginning to glow.

     The field of spectral shapes, with Talby in their midst, begin to
     drift away into the distance.

                                   TALBY
                              (cont'd)
                    They're taking me with them, with
                    the Phoenix... going to circle the
                    universe forever.  I'm with them
                    now... be back this way again some
                    day.  Doolittle, before it's too
                    late, there's one last thing I
                    want to tell you...

     Talby's signal dies out as the glowing lights disappear into the
     depths of space.

     Doolittle is hanging onto a long, thin chunk of debris.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Hey, Talby!  I've grabbed a piece of
                    the ship, and I think I've figured
                    out a way!

     He pulls the piece of metal down beneath his feet, and stands on it.

     Crouching and extending his arms, Doolittle surfs down into the
     atmosphere of the planet, banking and planing as he disappears to a
     small dot.

DARK STAR: A SCIENCE FICTION ADVENTURE

                 A Screenplay by John Carpenter and Dan O'Bannon







     OPEN ON BLACK SILENCE.

     The sound of electronic music rises, hollow, metallic.

     FADE IN on a long TRACKING SHOT through the universe.  As the NARRATOR
     speaks we move through galaxies, nebulae, solar systems, moving from
     the infinite slowly down to a particular planetary system deep within
     a maze of suns.

                                   NARRATOR
                              (over)
                    It is the mid 22nd Century.  Mankind
                    has explored the boundaries of his
                    own solar system, and now he reaches
                    out to the endless interstellar
                    distances of the universe.  He moves
                    away from his own small planetary
                    system in huge hyperdrive starships:
                    computer-driven, self-supporting,
                    closed-system spacecraft that travel
                    at mind-staggering post-light
                    velocities.  Man has begun to spread
                    among the stars.  Enormous ships
                    embark with generations of colonists
                    searching the depths of space for
                    new earths, now homes, new
                    beginnings.  Far in advance of these
                    colony ships goes a new pioneer: the
                    scouts, the pathfinders, a special
                    breed of man who has dedicated his
                    life to blazing the trail through
                    the most distant, unexplored
                    galaxies, opening up the farthest
                    frontiers of space.  These are the
                    men of the Advance Exploration
                    Corps.  The task they face is one of
                    unbelievable isolation and
                    loneliness.  So far from home that
                    Earth is no longer even a point of
                    light in the sky, they must comb the
                    universe for those unstable planets
                    whose existence poses a threat to
                    the peaceful colonists that follow.
                    They must find these rogue planets
                    -- and destroy them.  Among these
                    commandos are the men of the
                    scoutship Dark Star.

     We are now moving toward a planet.  Floating in front of the planet is
     the SCOUTSHIP DARK STAR.  As we move toward the ship, we begin to hear
     VOICES, crackling with static.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                              (over -- radio filter)
                    Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?

                    Ah, what was that again, I still
                    can't hear you?

                              (over -- filter)
                    I said I'm trying to reach Talby.
                    Something's wrong with the damn
                    intercom.  I need a last-minute
                    diameter approximation.

     CAMERA IS NOW FLOATING TOWARD THE OBSERVATION DOME on top of the ship.
     In the Dome sits TALBY.  He is staring around, wide-eyed, at the
     planets and stars.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                              (over -- filter)
                    Talby, Talby, this is Doolittle.  Do
                    you read me?  Talby?

     WE MOVE IN CLOSE ON TALBY'S FACE.  The shot stops and holds as he
     continues to stare, rapt.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                              (cont'd -- over --
                              filter)
                    Talby, do you read me?

     There is a CRACKLE, and Doolittle's voice suddenly booms through, loud
     and clear:

                                   DOOLITTLE
                              (cont'd)
                    TALBY!

                                   TALBY
                              (snaps out of it)
                    Oh!  Ah, yes, Doolittle.  What is it?

                    Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a
                    minute.

     CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL BACK along the length of the control room,
     revealing three men: BOILER, DOOLITTLE, and PINBACK.  They are seated
     close together in cramped little chairs, surrounded by a maze of
     instrumentation, pressing buttons, making adjustments and corrections.
     There is one EMPTY CHAIR; the panel in front of it looks burned.

                                   PINBACK
                    I need a GHF reading on the gravity

                    Yes, Doolittle.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.

                    Boiler, can you set me up with some
                    temp figures?

                    Ninety seven million, minus eight,
                    corrected to mass critical.

                    I read that with a quantum increase

                    Bomb bay systems operational.

     Pinback hits a button on his panel.

     INTERIOR - BOMB BAY

     The screen is BLACK for an instant.  Then, two enormous doors begin to
     open ponderously, revealing the planet rotating below.  A huge BOMB,
     designated with a giant #19 on its side, lowers slowly out of the
     ship on a rack.

                                   NARRATOR
                              (over)
                    This is a chain-reaction bomb,
                    otherwise known as an Exponential
                    Thermostellar Device.  Its own
                    destructive power is small, barely
                    enough to vaporize twelve city
                    blocks.  However, when it explodes in
                    contact with an object the size of a
                    planet, it starts a chain-reaction
                    in the very matter of that planet,
                    turning it into a giant reactor
                    which destroys itself in one
                    staggering thermal flash.

                    These bombs are equipped with
                    sophisticated thought and speech
                    mechanisms, to allow them to make
                    executive decisions in the event of
                    a crisis situation.  These judgment
                    centers are controlled by a fail-
                    safe mechanism.

                    Not much.  Nothing at all in this
                    sector.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Find me something, I don't care
                    where it is.

                                   BOILER
                    Well, I show a 95% probability of
                    sentient life in the Horsehead
                    Nebula...

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Fuck that shit.

                                   BOILER
                    Well, it is kind of a long shot...

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    It's a goddamn wild goose chase.
                    Remember when Commander Powell found
                    that 99 plus probability of sentient
                    life in the Magellanic Cloud?

                                   BOILER
                    Well, there's the possibility of...

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Remember what we found?  Fourteen
                    light years for a fucking mindless
                    vegetable that looked like a limp
                    balloon and went squawk and let a
                    fart when you touched it.  Remember?

                                   BOILER
                    All right, then...

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    So don't give me any of that
                    sentient life crap.  Find me
                    something I can blow up.

     A LIGHT flares on Pinback's board.  He looks up.

                    New star.

                    Hey, guess what?  I got a new star on
                    the readout.

                              (not looking up)

                                   PINBACK
                    Another unknown.  Not on the charts.
                    A red dwarf.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Any planets?

                    Yeah.  Eight, it says here.

                    Any of 'em any good?

                              (scans the board)
                    Naah.  All stable.

     Doolittle loses interest.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                              (not looking up)
                    What?

                                   PINBACK
                    The new star.  What are you gonna
                    name it?

                    Who cares.  Don't bother me.

     Pinback's mouth tightens.  A pause.

                                   PINBACK
                    Commander Powell would have named
                    it.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Commander Powell is dead.

     Involuntarily, Pinback glances at Commander Powell's empty, burned
     seat.  The panels behind it sputter.

                                   PINBACK
                    Come on, Doolittle, give it a name.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Fred.

                    Wha?

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    I hereby name this star Fred.

                                   BOILER
                    Hey, Doolittle, here's one.  An
                    unstable planet.  85% probability of
                    an unstable planet in the Veil
                    Nebula that will probably go off its
                    orbit and hit a star.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Sounds good.  Chart a course for the
                    Veil Nebula.

                                   BOILER
                    Pinback, throw me the chart log.

     Pinback draws a loose-leaf notebook from a shelf above Commander
     Powell's empty seat, and hurls it at Boiler.  With a sour look at
     Pinback, Boiler picks up the notebook and begins to leaf through it.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Let's have some music in here,
                    Boiler.

     Boiler presses a button.  LOUD COUNTRY MUSIC THEME BEGINS TO PLAY.

     EXTERIOR - DARK STAR (TITLE SEQUENCE)

     This sequence includes shots of the DARK STAR drifting through space,
     past various cosmic wonders, intercut with shots of the men relaxing
     (Talby staring into space; Boiler trimming his beard; Doolittle
     playing solitaire; Pinback reading a comic book).

     CREDITS AND MUSIC OVER.

     SEQUENCE ENDS.

     INTERIOR - DARK STAR

     Beep.

     We are watching a filmed tape.  Doolittle has just turned it on and is
     staring into the camera.  Crosshairs and blipping numbers superimposed.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Ship's log, entry number 1,943.
                    Dark Star cruising at light speed
                    through Sector Theta 990.  En route
                    to Veil Nebula for destruction of
                    unstable planet.  Our ETA is 1700
                    hours.
                              (thinks)
                    Ship's systems continue to
                    deteriorate...

     Pinback leans into view and whispers into Doolittle's ear.  Doolittle
     nods and Pinback withdraws.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                              (cont'd)
                    The short circuit in the rear seat
                    panel which killed Commander Powell
                    continues to be faulty.
                              (thinks)
                    Uh... Storage Area 9...

     Pinback leans back in and whispers emphatically.  Doolittle looks put-
     upon.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                              (cont'd)
                    And because he's sitting next to it,
                    it continues to bother Pinback.
                              (glares at Pinback.
                              Then:)
                    Storage Area 9 self-destructed last
                    week, destroying entire ship's
                    supply of toilet paper.  That's all.

     Beep.

     INTERIOR - OBSERVATION DOME

     Talby is still gazing around at the stars.

     A hatch opens in the floor and Doolittle sticks his head up.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Talby.

     Talby rotates his seat and looks down at Doolittle.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                              (cont'd)
                    Here's some breakfast.

     Doolittle climbs into the dome and sits on the floor.  He hands Talby
     the food package, and watches matter-of-factly as Talby begins to eat.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                              (cont'd)
                    You know, Talby, you really ought to
                    eat with the rest of us.  You spend
                    too much time up here.

                                   TALBY
                    I like it up here.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Must get lonely being up here so
                    much.

                                   TALBY
                    I don't like to go below since
                    Commander Powell died.  I feel
                    enclosed down there.  If it were big
                    enough, I'd sleep up here...

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    ... Should spend some time below, see
                    more of the rest of the ship...

                                   TALBY
                    ... You see, I can watch things up
                    here, Doolittle.  I love to watch
                    things, just stare at the planets
                    and meteors and asteroids, gas
                    clusters...

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    You'll have plenty of time for that,
                    you know.  Figure it this way: twenty
                    years in space and we've only aged
                    three, so there'll be plenty of time
                    to stare around...

                                   TALBY
                    You know, Doollttle, if we're going
                    into the Veil Nebula, we may
                    actually find a strange and
                    beautiful thing: the Phoenix
                    Asteroids.  They should be passing
                    through there about now...

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Phoenix Asteroids?  Never heard of
                    'em.

                                   TALBY
                    They are a body of asteroids that
                    make a complete circuit of the
                    universe once every 12.3 trillion
                    years.  The Phoenix Asteroids... From
                    what I've heard, Doolittle, they
                    glow... glow with all the colors of
                    the rainbow.  Nobody knows why.  They
                    just glow as they drift around the
                    universe.  Imagine all the sights
                    they've seen in the time they've
                    been travelling -- the birth and
                    death of stars, things we'll never
                    see.  The universe is alive,
                    Doolittle.  I thought it was all
                    empty, but it isn't.  In between the
                    stars, it's seething with light and
                    gasses and dust.  There are little
                    pebbles drifting around, planets no
                    one on Earth has ever seen... No one
                    but the Phoenix Asteroids...

     There is a BLIPPING SOUND.  It is insistent.  Talby is rudely yanked
     from his reverie.  He looks down at a panel.  But his soft talk has
     started Doolittle reminiscing.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    You know what I think about, Talby?

                                   TALBY
                    I'm getting something here, on this
                    readout...

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    It's funny, but I kind of sit
                    around, you know, a lot of time to
                    myself...

                                   TALBY
                    I think I'm getting a malfunction
                    here somewhere.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    I can't talk to the others, but with
                    time to myself, I think about back
                    home, back home at Malibu.  I used to
                    surf a lot, Talby.  I used to be a
                    great surfer.

                                   TALBY
                    Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a
                    definite malfunction on one of the
                    closed-circuit computer systems...

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    The waves at Malibu and Zuma were
                    fantastic in the springs Talby.  I
                    can remember running out on the
                    beach early spring mornings with my
                    board and a wet suit...

                                   TALBY
                    I can't seem to locate the
                    malfunction exactly...

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Waves would be peaking really high
                    and glassy.  Hit that water.  Ridin'
                    the wall just perfect.

                                   TALBY
                    ... Somewhere in the autonomic relay
                    circuits...

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    I guess I miss the waves and my
                    board most of all.

     Talby turns in his seat and addresses Doolittle directly.

                                   TALBY
                    Ah, Doolittle, I do have a
                    malfunction on this readout, but I
                    can't seem to pinpoint exactly where
                    it is.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                              (snapped out of his
                              daydream)
                    Don't worry about it.  We'll find out
                    when it goes bad.

                                   TALBY
                              (chagrined)
                    I really think I should try and
                    locate it immediately.  Might be

     This fades, and MISSION CONTROLLER appears on the screen, against a
     background of computer terminals.  He is dressed in a snappy tunic, and
     when he receives the on-camera cue, he smiles ingratiatingly.

                                   MISSION CONTROLLER
                    Hi, guys.  Glad to get your message.
                    We gather from the ten-year
                    communications lag that you are
                    approximately 18 parsecs away.  Drop
                    us a line more often, won't you?

                    Sorry to hear about all the
                    malfunctions, and real sorry to hear
                    about the death of Commander Powell.
                    There was a week of mourning all
                    over Earth.  The flags were at half
                    mast.

                    Now I hate to send bad news when you
                    guys are up there doing such a swell
                    job, but something's come up, and we
                    all felt you ought to know about it.
                    Our systems simulation computer has
                    predicted that by the time this
                    message reaches you -- that is to
                    say, in about ten years -- there
                    will be a failure in one of your
                    vital ship's systems.  The
                    malfunction will occur in --
                              (rifles papers)
                    -- system number E180246.  You can
                    see what a problem this would be if
                    you didn't catch it on time.  Now
                    what you should do is this: First,
                    do not, repeat, do not attempt to
                    adjust the system manually.
                    Second --

     INTERIOR - COMPUTER ROOM

     The room is dim and eerie, banks of dimly flickering lights and the
     hum of air-cooling machinery.

     Talby is seated before a glowing screen.  He punches several buttons,
     and the screen comes to life.  A schematic cross-section of the ship
     appears in glowing green lines.

     Talby punches more buttons, and the screen flashes through the levels
     or the ship.  Finally it shows Level 6.  There is a small red light
     pulsing in the Emergency Air Lock.

     Talby punches another button.  The Emergency Air Lock is magnified
     fifteen times until it fills the screen.  The red light is pulsing in a
     small area labelled COMMUNICATIONS LASER #17.

     Talby picks up a microphone.

                                   TALBY
                    Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby.

                    Yes, Talby, what is it?

                                   TALBY
                    Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir,
                    but I'm in the Computer Room, and I
                    think I've located the malfunction.
                    The scanner shows it to be some sort
                    of fault in the communications
                    laser, down by the Emergency Air
                    Lock.  Can't pinpoint it exactly, but
                    I'm going down there with a starsuit
                    and try to find it.

                    anything important comes up.

     Doolittle hangs up the mike.

                                   BOILER
                    Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here

                    He just likes it up in the dome,
                    that's all.

     Boiler seems to be thinking.  He frowns, looks at Doolittle.

                                   BOILER
                    What's Talby's first name?

     Doolittle thinks about it, and an odd expression crosses his face.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    What's my first name?

     INTERIOR - EMERGENCY AIR LOCK

     CAMERA SLOWLY PANS DOWN the chromium-steel walls of the Emergency Air
     Lock to reveal Talby in a starsuit.  He is wearing it only as
     protection against possible depressurization, and therefore wears no
     jetpack.  Carrying a tool kit, he is slowly circling the lock.

     Talby stops facing LASER SHAFT 17.

     The plate cover on the laser shaft hangs loose; it appears to be
     burned.  Talby approaches it and puts down his tool kit.  He turns on
     his helmet radio.

     Talby stands in front of the laser shaft, trying to reach Doolittle on

                    Hello?  Lieutenant Doolittle?  Hello!

     Silence.

     Very carefully, Talby reaches out to touch the dangling plate cover on

     with a CLANG.

     slowly to make an adjustment.

     There is a BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT.

                    still in the bomb bay.  Try it again,
                    Pinback.

     Pinback resets his panel.  The honker stops.

     The men stare at each other in silence for a long moment.
     Simultaneously they begin hitting buttons.

     Talby lies unconscious on the floor of the lock.

     Pause.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Only one thing to do.  I'll have to
                    ask Commander Powell.  I'll have to
                    ask him what to do.

     INTERIOR - FREEZER ROOM

     Doolittle climbs down a ladder into the icy-blue, cold Freezer Room.
     The walls are covered with frost, and mist hangs in the air.

     He pulls on a pair of insulated gloves and approaches a heavy freezer
     door.  On the door is a sign:

                         CRYOGENIC FREEZER COMPARTMENT

                         CAUTION

                         ABSOLUTE ZERO

     He opens the door.

     COMMANDER POWELL is encased in the freezer in a post-death, frozen
     ammonia state.  Wire and electrodes are attached to his head.

     Doolittle takes a microphone from a console on the freezer.  He flips a
     switch and speaks into the mike:

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Commander Powell?  Commander Powell,
                    this is Doolittle.  Can you read me?

     A crackle of static comes from a speaker grille, along with the FAINT
     MUTTERING OF COMMANDER POWELL'S VOICE:

                                   POWELL
                    ... muffirup glurrinpinfropal...

     Doolittle fiddles with the volume control, trying to bring Commander
     Powell's voice into audibllity.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Commander Powell, this is Doolittle.
                    Ah, there's something serious come
                    up, sir, and I have to ask you
                    something.

                                   POWELL
                              (very weakly)
                    I'm glad you've come to talk with
                    me, Doolittle.  It's been so long
                    since anyone has come to talk with
                    me.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Commander, sir, we have a big
                    problem.  You see, the Veil Nebula
                    bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck.  It
                    won't drop from the bomb bay.  It
                    refuses to listen and plans to
                    detonate in --
                              (checks watch)
                    -- less than eleven minutes.

                                   POWELL
                    Doolittle, you must tell me one
                    thing.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    What's that, sir?

                                   POWELL
                    Tell me, Doolittle, how are the
                    Dodgers doing?

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up,
                    disbanded over thirteen years ago.

                                   POWELL
                    Ah... pity, pity...

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    You don't understand, sir, we can't
                    get the bomb to drop.

                                   POWELL
                    Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't
                    you have anything nice to tell me
                    when you activate me?  Oh, well, did
                    you try the azimuth clutch?

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Yes sir.  Negative effect.

                                   POWELL
                    What was that, Doolittle?

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Negative effect.

                                   POWELL
                    It didn't work?

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    That's correct, sir.

                                   POWELL
                    Sorry, Doolittle.  I've forgotten so
                    much since I've been in here.  So
                    much.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    What should we do, sir?  The time is
                    running out.

                                   POWELL
                    Well, what you might try is --

     Commander Powell's voice is drowned in a burst of static.  Doolittle
     fiddles with the dials.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Commander Powell?  Commander, hello!

                                   POWELL
                    Sorry.

                    What were you saying, Commander,
                    about the bomb?

                                   POWELL
                    Ah... it seems to me, Doolittle...
                    Sorry, I've drawn a blank.  Hold it.
                    I'll have it again in a minute.  I
                    forget so many things in here, so
                    many things.  Hold on, just a minute,
                    let me think...

                    Intuition is no proof.  What concrete

                    My sensory apparatus reveals it to
                    me.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Right!

                                   BOMB #20
                    This is fun.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    All right now, here's the big
                    question: how do you know that the
                    evidence your sensory apparatus
                    reveals to you is correct?

     INTERIOR - EMERGENCY AIR LOCK

     Talby lies unconscious near the burned laser.

     EXTERIOR - BOMB BAY

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    What I'm getting at is this: the
                    only experience that is directly
                    available to you is your sensory
                    data.  And this data is merely a
                    stream of  electrical impulses which
                    stimulate your computing center.

                                   BOMB #20
                    In other words, all I really know
                    about the outside universe relayed
                    to me through my electrical
                    connections.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Exactly.

                                   BOMB #20
                    Why, that would mean... I really
                    don't know what the outside universe
                    is like at all, for certain.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    That's it.

                                   BOMB #20
                    Intriguing.  I wish I had more time
                    to discuss this matter.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Why don't you have more time?

                                   BOMB #20
                    Because I must detonate in seventy-
                    five seconds.

                    You must have it, you idiot, we can

     EXTERIOR - BOMB BAY

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Now, bomb, consider this next
                    question, very carefully.  What is
                    your one purpose in life?

                                   BOMB #20
                    To explode, of course.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    And you can only do it once, right?

                                   BOMB #20
                    That is correct.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    And you wouldn't want to explode on
                    the basis of false data, would you?

                                   BOMB #20
                    Of course not.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Well then, you've already admitted
                    that you have no real proof of the
                    existence of the outside universe.

                                   BOMB #20
                    Yes, well...

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    So you have no absolute proof that
                    Sergeant Pinback ordered you to
                    detonate.

                                   BOMB #20
                    I recall distinctly the detonation
                    order.  My memory is good on matters
                    like these.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Yes, of course you remember it, but
                    what you are remembering is merely a
                    series of electrical impulses which
                    you now realize have no necessary
                    connection with outside reality.

                                   BOMB #20
                    True, but since this is so, I have
                    no proof that you are really telling
                    me all this.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    That's all beside the point.  The
                    concepts are valid, wherever they
                    originate.

                                   BOMB #20

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    So if you detonate in...

                    of false data.

                                   BOMB #20
                    I have no proof that it was false
                    data.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    You have no proof that it was
                    correct data.

     There is a long pause.

                                   BOMB #20
                    I must think on this further.

     THE BOMB RAISES ITSELF BACK INTO THE SHIP.  Doolittle practically
     collapses with relief.

                    Let there be light.

     THE SCREEN GOES WHITE.

     EXTERIOR - SPACE

     IN DEAD SILENCE, THE WHITE SCREEN FADES DOWN TO SHOW A GIANT WHITE
     FIREBALL IN SPACE.  THE FIREBALL CONTRACTS TO A HARD CORE, GROWING RED.
     THEN

     A BLINDING WHITE FLASH.

     Doolittle flies past, falling backward.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Whoa!

     Talby, upside down, is falling in the opposite direction.

                                   TALBY
                    Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Here I am.  I think I'm spinning...
                    We're both falling, Talby, in
                    opposite directions, away from each
                    other.  My -- my jetpack's gone.

                                   TALBY
                    What happened, Doolittle?

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Bomb must have gone off inside the
                    ship.  Nothing we can do about it
                    now.  Hey, it looks like... the
                    skipper.  He made it.  Commander
                    Powell made it!

     A block of ice with a man's body in it tumbles past, end over end.

                                   POWELL
                              (weakly)
                    Men... men... what happened, men?

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.

     The planet begins to rise behind Doolittle.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                              (cont'd)
                    Looks like I'm headed for the
                    planet, Talby.  Going right toward
                    it.

                                   TALBY
                    When you fall, Doolittle, if there's
                    anyone down there on the planet,
                    somebody may see you.  They may see
                    you coming down.  What a beautiful
                    way to die... as a falling star...

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Guess you're right.

     Talby turns his head and looks behind him.

                                   TALBY
                    Doolittle, I'm heading right toward
                    something.  It's behind me, in the
                    distance.  Something that glows.

     Far behind Talby, coming nearer, is a shimmering point of light.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Oh yeah?

                                   TALBY
                    Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix
                    Asteroids!

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Phoenix?

     The point of light is closer now, and it has begun to differentiate
     into a group of beautifully colored frost-like shapes.

                                   TALBY
                    It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix!
                    They glow with all the colors of the
                    rainbow, just like everybody said.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    No kidding?

                                   TALBY
                    I'm going into them, I'm going to
                    hit them.  Doolittle...

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Yeah?

                                   TALBY
                    Before we get too far away, and our
                    signals start to fade, I just wanted
                    to tell you... you were my favorite.
                    I really liked you, Doolittle.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    I really liked you too, Talby.  Hey,
                    some debris from the ship!  It's
                    coming right by me.

     Several chunks of debris from the ship drift past Doolittle.

                                   TALBY
                    Doolittle, I'm catching up to the
                    asteroids.  I'm going to be a part of
                    them in a minute.  Doolittle, I'm
                    going into them.

     Talby drifts into the huge frost-like shapes, expanding and glowing
     and spinning, slowly refracting all the colors of the spectrum with a
     cold glow.

                                   TALBY
                              (cont'd)
                    I'm beginning to glow.

     The field of spectral shapes, with Talby in their midst, begin to
     drift away into the distance.

                                   TALBY
                              (cont'd)
                    They're taking me with them, with
                    the Phoenix... going to circle the
                    universe forever.  I'm with them
                    now... be back this way again some
                    day.  Doolittle, before it's too
                    late, there's one last thing I
                    want to tell you...

     Talby's signal dies out as the glowing lights disappear into the
     depths of space.

     Doolittle is hanging onto a long, thin chunk of debris.

                                   DOOLITTLE
                    Hey, Talby!  I've grabbed a piece of
                    the ship, and I think I've figured
                    out a way!

     He pulls the piece of metal down beneath his feet, and stands on it.

     Crouching and extending his arms, Doolittle surfs down into the
     atmosphere of the planet, banking and planing as he disappears to a
     small dot.

     END TITLES AND MUSIC OVER.

          INT. PIER BUILDING - DAY


          BANG!!
          A shock chord as we cut from black to a harshly toplit

                         CLOSE SHOT:
          A man is talking into a cellular phone. He is a paunchy
          but powerful looking black man, bald with a gray fringe.
          His baldness makes his head look muscular; he is a tough
          man whose life has been shaped by the violence of the docks.
          His name is EDDIE BLACK.
          In the distance a foghorn moans.
          We are pulling back.

                         BLACK
          Yeah. .'Cause he's an asshole. Tell
          him no... Tell him no too... Him, tell
          fuck you... Yeah... Uh huh...
          The continuing pull back shows that we are inside a huge
          empty pier building. Black is leaning against the roof of
          his car, which is parked in the middle of the vast empty
          space.
          The room is lit by bare bulbs, its farthest reaches
          falling into darkness.

                         BLACK
          No, I'll be a few minutes here. Guy
          comin' up, thinks he's gonna muscle me
          outs my property... Does it matter?
          Just another tough guy...Yeah, okay...
          Another hard-looking man is approaching.

                         CONTINUED

                         MAN
          They're drivin' up.
          Black nods.

                         BLACK
          Get their pieces. We got a surprise
          for those fuckers.

                         2

          2 EXT WHARF - DAY
          We are tracking towards a chain link fence which is
          swinging open to admit two midnight blue Lincoln
          Continentals.
          The cars stop in the foreground and eight men get out,
          eerily backlit in the mist of the riverfront.

                         3

          3 SLOW TRACKING - ROBERT G. DURANT

          wears a powder blue, polyester leisure suit. His nose has
          been broken several times from his years in the Mexican
          boxing league. He was almost a contender.

          7 SLOW TRACKING - RICK
          is a wiry twenty-year old who looks about in short, jerky
          motions. He huddles in behind the others. He is
          stylishly dressed, with slicked back, black hair. His
          protruding Adams apple bobs as he swallows.

          is middle-aged and balding. His spare tire hangs over the
          edge of his suit pants. He subdues a belch. He raises a
          bottle of Maalox and slugs down fifty cents worth. A ring
          of white chalky fluid coats his lips.

          10 SLOW TRACKING - CORKY CORCORAN 10
          has a thatch of blond hair, he spits out tobacco juice
          between his wide spaced front teeth.
          11 They are approached by a group of fifteen dock workers, 11
          Black's men, with massive shoulders and grain-sack bellies.
          Looks like they just got off their shift and now they're
          ready to kick some ass.

                         DOCK WORKER
          Okay, against the car, ladies. You're
          c gonna stand for a search.
          12 The eight visitors assume the position, placing their 12
          hands on the roof of their car. The dock workers pat them
          down and haul off iron -- lots of it.

                         DOCK WORKER #2
          Bunch a cuties.

                         DOCK WORKER #3
          Put skirts on 'em, I'd marry one.
          From the other Dock Workers, hearty male laughter. The
          visitors bare up in silence.

          13 INT PIER BUILDING -- NIGHT 13
          As the visitors are led in, into the beams of the car
          headlights, escorted by the dock workers. The Dock
          Workers take up positions around Durant and his men.

                          15
          15 The dock workers laugh. Black indulges his wens'
          laughter, then cuts

                         BLACK
          okay, let's cut the crap here.
          Durant, I got just three things to say
          to you. One
          He holds up a chubby finger.

                         BLACK
          I ain't selling my property.
          He flashes a second finger.

                         BLACK
          Two. Nobody muscles Eddie Black
          Especially a bunch of fucks.
          He flashes a third finger.

                         BLACK

          Number three, if you guys is unha

          The last shot echoes away to leave silence -- except for
          the arhythmic echoing scuffle of Skip's one shoe, as he
          continues to hop in place for balance.
          Smiley, after a watchful pause to make sure everyone is
          dead, sticks out his left arm at waist level.
          Skip grabs the arm for support, stops hopping, and there
          is now...total silence.

          ROBERT G. DURANT
          the elegantly suited leader, takes out a cigar and a
          gold-plated cigar trimmer. SNIP--he trims the and of
          the cigar, and sticks it in his mouth.
          As he walks towards the dumbly apprehensive Black:

                         DURANT
          Now let's consider my points, one by
          one...

                         GUZMAN
          puts a full nelson on Black. Trumayne, grabs Black's
          right hand and holds it out, fingers splayed, towards
          Durant.

                          DURANT
          One...
           He slips one of Black's fingers into his cigar trimmer.

                          DURANT
          .1 try not to let my anger get the
          better of me.
          SNIP! Black screams. As Durant goes for another finger:

                         DURANT
          ...Two: I don't always succeed.
          SNIP! Black screams. Reaching for another finger:

                         DURANT
          ...Three: I've got seven more points.

           Looking down on the lonely waterfront building, we hear
           Black's screams.

          21 INT WESTLAKE LAB - DAY - AN ENORMOUS EYE
          Making jerky little movements this way and that.

          EYE'S POV: AN ENORMOUS NOSE
          We pull focus through the nose, then back to sharp focus
          again. The nose fills the screen, every pore a cavern,
          every blemish a mountain.

          Blinking.

          As it hums to life. It is a box containing linear rows of
          densely packed pins. Tiny servo-motors beneath the pins
          allow each pin to rise or fall individually, per computer
          command. A smooth synthetic substance is being sprayed
          evenly atop the surface of the pins. The sprays halts; the
          wet substance glistens. The densely packed pins rise to
          programmed heights, molding the solidifying synthetic
          substance into an exact replica of Yakatito's nose.

          arms and closes her eyes blissfully. Reluctantly, she rises
          and slips on her shoes. Peyton watches her admiring everything
          about her. She gracefully lays her legal papers in her
          briefcase and heads for the door. Half way out the door she

                         JULIE
          No thank you. Mr. Strack, I've been
          going over some documents and I came
          across something that puzzled me. It's
          a memo from your office to a Mr.
          Claude Bellasarious--it went out over
          your father's signature. It detailed

                         CERTAIN PAYMENTS--
          Strack has gotten up to pace.

          ...It seems like the payments... were-

                         STRACK
          .Does that shock you?

                         (QUIETLY)
          No. In fact I'd surmised as much.

                         STRACK
          But it disappoints you.

          Surely you don't expect me to endorse
          it.

                         STRACK
          Course not. I'm sure my father never
          intended for you to know about it.
          I'm sorry if He's compromised
          you in any way. But I am asking you
          to understand. I'm not going to bore
          you with that old speech about how we
          all have to swim in the same

          not so much as one mini-mall ever went
          up in this city without some grease
          being laid into the palms downtown.
          You're not naive; you know
          it's a cost of doing business.
          Ordinarily you don't have to face it.
          Well, I face it, and a lot worse,
          into acynic--that's the easy way out,
          and I'm tougher than that.
          Strack gestures towards a table-top architectural model of
          the Riverfront Development.

                         STRACK
          Take a look at that model, Julie.
          That was my father's dream. Now it's
          my dream. Acres of riverfront
          reclaimed from decay, thousands of
          jobs created, a building block--a very
          large building block--laid for the
          future. Not such a bad dream, as
          dreams go. And if the price of
          realizing that dream is the occasional
          distasteful chore, well...

                         (BEAT)
          .the point is my father is well
          beyond the reach of the law, but that
          memo could embarrass Strack
          enterprises.

                         JULIE
          All right, you're point is well taken.
          But the fact remains that I'm in
          possession of evidence of the
          commission of a crime. You can no
          more ask me to destroy it than I could
          ask you to destroy one of your
          buildings.

                         STRACK
          Let me suggest this. You excuse
          yourself for a few minutes, go to the
          ladies' room, leaving your briefcase
          here. What happens to the memorandum
          while it's in my custody is my
          responsibility.

          I wish it were that simple. First of
          all, I don't have the memo with me.
          Even if I did--

                         STRACK
          It isn't safe to have that document.

          The undifferentiated blue resolves itself, as a ripplin
          blue fluid, resembling the acid bath in Peyton's lab. A
          form emerges from it's depths; a completely bandaged head
          breaks the surface of the fluid.

          A patient is lifted from a hydro tank, the complex water
          vessel in which burn patients are treated. He lies

          some still submerged in their hydro-tanks.

          saunter over to the hydraulic bed where nurses adjust
          the patient's I.V. tubing.

                         RESIDENT
          Here we have a 25-30 year-old-male, no
          I.D., no medical history. Fished the
          guy out of the river with burns
          covering over forty percent of his
          body. His hands and.face were the
          most severe.

          110 A BURN NURSE
          pushes a button. Motors grinding, the hydraulic platform
          rotates, slowly spinning the mummified man. For a brief
          moment he is upside down.

                         RESIDENT
          Ten years ago, pain from the burns
          would have been intolerable. The guy
          would have spent the rest of his
          screaming. Now we use the Rangeveritz
          technique; quite simply, we sever his
          spino-thalamic nerve...

                         111

          vibratory sense to the brain.

          112,
          112 ZIIIP! He collapses the pointer and returns it to his
          pocket.

          113 THE HYDRAULIC BURN PLATFORM
          continues its slow rotation with the mummified patient
          now turned sideways.

                         RESIDENT
          No longer receiving impulses of pain,
          you stick him with a pin...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.

                         114
          He jabs a sterilized needle deep into the bandaged knee. 114
          Interns gasp. The resident leaves the pin in the knee
          for dramatic effect.

                         RESIDENT
          .and he can't even feel it.
          With a sharp practiced motion, he plucks out the pin.

                         115

          PATIENT'S BANDAGED FACE

                         115
          His eyes still closed. No response.

                         RESIDENT
          Of course, there are serious emotional
          side effects to this operation. When
          the body ceases to feel, when so much
          sensory input is lost, the patient
          becomes alienated. The mind, cut off
          from its regular diet of input, has a
          never-satisfied thirst; alienation
          gives rise to loneliness, anger;
          uncontrolled rage is not uncommon.
          And the rage problem is exacerbated by
          the chemical effect of severing the
          nerve. Now, surges of adrenaline flow
          unchecked through body and brain--
          giving him the strength of dozen men.
          Hence the leather restraints.
          The resident turns and heads for the door. The interns

          crowded table.

          ON THE TABLE
          a huge cake, elaborately constructed in the sleek shape
          of a sleek, modern skyline. The same as the model on
          Strack's desk.

          knife.

                         LOUD APPLAUSE
          The Governor passes the piece to LOUIS STRACK JR. who
          sits at his side.

                         GOVERNOR

                         (TO STRACK)
          As usual, Louis, you get the first
          piece of the action.
          LAUGHTER...Strack takes a bite from the building's top floors.

                         GOVERNOR
          Louis, I want to take this
          opportunity to express my gratitude,
          my extreme gratitude--

                         STRACK
          (to the crowd)
          He's talking about my campaign

                         CONTRIBUTION--
          LOUD LAUGHTER. The Governor waves it away.

                         GOVERNOR
          I'm talking about the Riverside
          development program. Louis, you've
          breathed new life into a neighborhood
          long ago lost to the democrats.

          The band is faintly heard. Julie stands before the mirror
          and practices a convincing smile. Beside her, a young
          woman pouts to the mirror as she applies lipstick. The
          woman exits through the tiled archway. Her shadow meets
          that of a man's. Julie watches the happy shadows embrace,
          kiss and move off. She stands immobilized, overcome.

          wearing a tight fitting, formal black dress. She
          forces a smile. She looks unhappy, but she looks good.
          She sits at a bar a little away from the party area.

                         JULIE
          Vodka and lime, please. A double.
          A business man, flushed with drink, observes her.
          He moves to the seat beside her.

                         BUSINESSMAN
          Drowning your sorrows, eh?

                         JULIE
          Just giving them something to swim
          around in.
          She drinks the vodka quickly. She sighs.

          LOUIS STRACK, JR.
          stands before him. Distinguished and dapper, looking `
          better than ever. He gives his famous grin. It's worth
          a million dollars.

                         STRACK
          Ferguson, you've had too much to
          drink.

                         BUSINESSMAN
          Right away, Mr. Strack.
          Chastened, he beats a hasty retreat. Strack turns
          to Julie.

                         JULIE
          Thanks for getting rid of that guy.

                         STRACK
          Thank you for coming. I'm glad you're
          here.
          He takes her by the arm and starts to lead her across the
          crowded floor.

                         STRACK
          I haven't wanted to bother you during
          your period of grief, but I have to
          know whether you've come to a decision
          regarding the Belasarius Memorandum.

          The decision's been made for both of
          us. The papers were destroyed in the
          fire. I want to forget all about that--

                         (THINKS)
          The fire-- the whole thing. . I'm
          quite disturbed by it. I can't help
          but wonder.

                         JULIE
          What?

                         STRACK
          Do you remember when I mentioned a
          certain competitor of mine, Robert G.
          Durant?

                         JULIE
          No. No. I've considered it. but the
          police ruled out arson. It burned
          hot. A gas fire. There was an
          acetylene leak -- the tiniest spark

                         COULD HAVE--
          She breaks off, getting choked up. Strack's manner is
          sympathetic and solemn.

                         STRACK
          Believe me, I am no stranger to the
          frustration and anguish that comes
          from the loss of a loved one.
          He forces himself to rally his spirits.

                         STRACK
          My dear, there's no cure for grief

                         EXCEPT TIME--
          He takes-her by the hand.

          Don't be childish, I had every right.
          He doesn't want to lose you--said
          he'll fight tooth and nail to keep you
          at the firm. Good! I like a good
          scrap! If it's not worth fighting for
          it's not worth having. Just consider
          that I won't be outbid. Think about

          into his confidence.

          I'll consider it...
          Strack smiles. As he sweeps her around, her eye catches
          something. Her face tightens.

          to a pair of headsets worn by Darkman. His eyes glisten
          through the slits of his bandages.
          A set of hands enter frame and crack him viciously across
          the head. He sprawls backward, caught off guard.

          Studies Durant/Darkman with uncertainty. After

          The Darkman's eyes shift. He was not expecting this.
          Hung Fat is waiting for an explosion. There is none.

          picks It up.

          THE TH33NG
          is slims and translucent. Durant holds it to the light.
          It's the mask of his own face. It smolders and melts.

          into the dark subway tunnel.

          holds up his hand commanding silence as-they come to an
          intersection of subway tunnels. Both lead into darkness.
          They listen, but all is quiet. They speak in hushed
          tones.

                         TRUMAYNE
          Now what?

                         DURANT
          You go that way. We'll take this one.

                         TRUMAYNE
          doesn't look too thrilled by the prospect of being
          alone in the tunnels.

                         TRUMAYNE
          Alone?

                         DURANT

          with you!

                         DURANT
          tosses him the penlight. Hard. Casually he lights a
          cigar and continues forward.

                         TRUMAYNE
          watches Durant and Guzman disappear down the tunnel.
          The sound of their footsteps recedes. Trumayne's
          breathing is shallow. He loosens his necktie and
          unbuttons his collar. He takes a breath.

          Trumayne flinches. He points the penlight in the
          direction of the clanging sound.

          raises the penlight.

          THE FEEBLE LIGHT BEAM

          sound of FOOTSTEPS. Crunching on gravel; Approaching.

          The 3i,a is a hairless skull, covered with random bits of

          entire 3ength of his teeth are exposed down to the root,
          connec g crookedly to the jaw bone. One ear remains
          intact, the other a burnt hole. Only the rudimentary
          cartile forms the nose. But it is the wild eyeballs
          protruig obscenely from the bone of their sockets, that
          tell tba,story. There, lies madness; a dark river of evil

          hair, turns and walks slowly along the tracks. That's
          when we see his back: the train has raked off the fabric
          of his suit and pants, exposing bare back and buttocks.
          Somehow maintaining his dignity, Durant picks up the
          smouldering cigar from the tracks. He takes a puff
          and moves off.

          Darkman sits with the phone faintly ringing against his
          ear. Something frantic about him, the vein in his fore-
          head, faintly beating. While he waits for the other
          party to answer, he cuts into the painless wound on his
          arm with a surgical instrument, digging for something
          . Finally Julie's voice comes on:

                         DARKMAN

          on the table.

          truly embarrassed to own... and then
          I've got to run.
          They have stopped in front of a booth where softballs get
          tossed at bottle pyramids. Peyton lays down a dollar and
          is handed three balls.

          On that word he throws the last ball with great force.
          The pyramid explodes.
          Peyton, breathing heavily, takes a moment to collect

          her hand trembles as she lifts the eyeless face into
          frame. She forces herself to examine it closely. Her the
          revulsion gives way to pity. She brings it into
          beam of light.

          S372 JULIE'S HAND HOLDS THE MASK -
          Accomparaed by the sound of BUZZING FLIES and
          SIZZLING Skin blisters boil furiously. She drops it

                         A SCREAM

                         373
          373 She steadies herself against the computer table
          There are tears in her eyes. Trembling, she turns to
          face the darkness.

                         374

                         374 DARKMAN
          Presses bimself into the shadows.

          Peyton. .?

                         375

                         375 DARKMAN
          turns his head sharply. Only the upper right corner
          of his face falls into the light. The handsome,
          undamaged portion.

                         JULIE
          Why didn't you tell me? If you loved
          me, why didn't you tell me?

                         376

                         376 DARKMAN
          shamed, to be both coward and monster, clutches his
          bony hand to his skull.

                         JULIE
          You had no right--

                         377
          377 Tears stream down Julie's face but she is too upset
          to brush them away. She moves forward.

                         JULIE
          coward!

                         378
          378 She angrily shoves the computer off the table. It
          crashes to the ground, sparking.

                         JULIE
          Do you think it was the face I cared
          about?! Is that how little you think
          of me?! Why didn't you come to me?

                         379

                         379 DARKMAN
          He is shaken by a silent sob. More of his face falls
          into light, illuminating leathery neck muscles and
          hideous bone.

                         380
          380 Julie looks about the dark and desolate warehouse.
          The sight of the bandages. The liquid skin. The
          charred Peyton/Julie photograph. Her face softens.
          She feels the Darkman's pain.

                         QUIETLY;

                         JULIE
          I would have helped you.
          She stares into the shadows a long time without
          speaking.

                         JULIE
          Don't you know I love you, Peyton?
          And no matter what--no matter what
          you've become I'll always love you?

                         381

          381 CLOSE ON DARKMAN
          his eyes expressing a ray of hope he didn't think
          possible until now. O.S. We hear the sound of

          383 INT. EACK'S APARTMENT - DAY

          Strackâ naked except for a monogrammed bath towel
          wrapd around his thickening midriff, walks across
          the plush bedroom of his penthouse apartment. A
          Mahler symphony plays in the background.
          He bends to hoist a huge inlaid mahogany chest that
          rests on a marble stand, 'then, grunting under the
          strain of the load, he staggers back across the room
          to the king-sized bed.
          With a mighty heave he tips the contents of the chest
          out onto the bed. A torrent of golden ICrugerands.
          They wash over the bed, so many that some spill over
          the sides and clatter to the floor.
          Strack pauses for a beat, staring down at the booty,
          then reaches down to the towel and lets it drop to the
          floor.
          Like a swan he dives.
          He rolls, luxuriating in the feel of gold against
          flesh, laughter bubbling from his lips.
          Gold coins stick to his flushed, sweating flesh, then
          slough off, leaving their imprint.
          Strack makes swimming motions with his arms, laving
          himself with the golden coins--
          A knock at the door.
          Strack freezes.

                         STRACK
          Huhh??:!

                         VOICE

          He stands. A coin or two falls from his dimpled ass
          as he reaches down for his pants.

          Strack enters, tying his tie.

                         STRACK
          Julie, how sweet of you to come before
          our appointed hour... but I expected--
          you in something a little more formal.
          Didn't Ruth inform you that we have
          tickets to Der Fliedermause tonight?

                         JULIE
          I can't go, Louis. We have to talk.

                         STRACK
          Excellent! I love to talk. Brandy?

                         JULIE
          Thank you, no.

                         STRACK
          I'll have one;_
          As he walks to a bar and pours himself a drink.

                         STRACK
          ...Fair warning--it's Napoleon, and
          it's quite good--

                         JULIE
          Louis, I can't see you anymore.

                         STRACK
          Darling, settle down. Don't be rash.
          As you say, let's talk.

                         STRACK

                         OF COURSE--

                         JULIE
          Louis, he's alive. He's back. He was
          burned, horribly, horribly burned--I
          don't understand what happened but I
          know he needs my help.
          Strack is visibly taken aback. He sets the brandy
          down.

                         STRACK
          .Your news has a bittersweet
          flavor... Of course I'm very happy for
          you. If there's anything I can do--
          the finest medical care can be at your
          disposal--burn therapy, recon-
          structive surgery. How badly was
          he... mutilated?
          Julie has broken down. She sits down on Strack's
          sofa, her body wracked with sobs.

                         STRACK
          ... Where is he, Julie?

                         JULIE
          He's living in an abandoned warehouse.
          He's alone... he needs me.
          The phone RINGS. Strack crosses to the desk and picks
          it up.

                         STRACK
          Not now!... Who?... All right, I'll
          take it in the other room.
          He looks up at Julie.

          Yes, Franz... And the closing

          Wipes a tear from her eyes. She moves closer.

                         STRACK (OS)
          I feel sufficiently diversified...
          Franz, it is immaterial to me what the
          market is doing. I want you to buy...

                         STRACK
          .I'm sorry you had to find that,

          this further strain.

                         JULIE

          Not me personally. I have an employee
          who does certain things for me,
          unofficially, off the books. Robert

          expensive police department quite
          unsympathetic.

          388 Strack moves quickly to the briefcase. He taps

          Robert! I have good news and bad.

                         DURANT
          Custom dictates that you render the
          bad news first.

                         STRACK
          You recall the little difficulty with
          my father and how you resolved it. We
          have a similar situation with Miss
          Hastings. It seems Miss Hastings has
          uncovered some unflattering
          information about us.

                         DURANT
          No problem at all. And the good news?

                         STRACK
          Your wife died. I'm joking, of
          course. No, the good news is that I
          know who's behind our little troubles
          of late. When you retrieved my
          memorandum, you failed to excise the
          good doctor.

          and the lab is quiet.
          Guzman speaks quietly into a walkee-talkee.

           hang on parallel clothes lines. Durant, Pauly, Skip,
           and Smiley. In the shadows, their eyeless heads are
           wrinkled and grotesquely life-like.
          398 Guzman moves through the gallery of faces. A breeze 398
           through the open window makes the clothes-line SQUEAK
           as the faces bob and nod to him.
          399 He stops suddenly. His body shudders at the sight of... 399

                         400 A FACE 400

          swoops lower, slamming the Darkman to the pavement. He
          drags for a moment, a pack of motorcycles WHIZZING past
          his head. Like a marionette, he's jerked back up right
          in front of an oncoming 1973 Delta 88 Oldsmobile. He is
          grazed by the car's hood. His body bounces off the
          windshield.

          smile vanishes.

                         ROBERT DURANT
          enters. He looks awful--face scorched and bruised,

          They do look up to me.
          The elevator grinds to a halt and the two emerge. The
          lights of the city tremble over the water. A glitter
          and breadth to the landscape, an urban grandeur.

          against the occasional girder, momentarily flattening
          out into the recognizable face of Durant, and then peels
          away again. It spins downward towards a forest of
          reinforcing bars that form a pungi pit of steel spikes

          Savage punches send Strack reeling--BAM!--he falls onto
          the girder... nearby are a bunch of tools... Strack
          crawls toward them.

                         CONTINUED

                         

                         

                         

                         

          167.
          451 CONTI1rn D 451

          A RIVET GUN
          only a few inches from his grasp.

                         DARIOM
          swoops onto Strack, pummelling him.

                         STRACR'S HAND
          inching painfully toward the rivet gun.

                         DARKMAN
          pummelling, lost in the act of his final revenge. He
          steps back to give a final blow...
          .and slips on some loose rivets, flailing for balance.

                         STRACK
          lunges. CLANG! Darkman slams into a vertical bar.

          ZMMMMMM! Z !

                         452
          452 The rivet gun shoots a bolt through Darkman's wrist,
          then the other wrist--pinning him to the I-beam...
          Strack takes a step backward, exhausted.

                         453

                         453 STRACK

                         STRACK
          Now you get to watch your girl-friend
          die.
          He moves toward a terrified Julie.

                         DARXMAN
          SHRIEKS and reality melts around him as he tastes the
          hot soup of rage.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          454 CRACK!
          Gigantic fissures appear on all the girders... we spin
          into Darkman's eyeball to find--

          455 THE ULTIMATE RAGE MONTAGE 455
          Nightmarish flashes of laughing faces jeering into the
          camera; Julie and Strack kissing, naked.
          456 Strack's face bobs, attached now to the body of the 456
          dunking bird, his nose nearing the ignition of a huge
          lighter. As contact is made the lighter explodes in a
          shower of gold Krugerands.
          457 The gold coins fall away to reveal Peyton's unscathed 457
          head, bobbing on a freakish and deformed doll's body.
          Atop a circus platform, he does an angry jig. He wears
          a funny little hat.
          458 Peyton's face liquefies and flows off his head to reveal- 458
          the face of the Darkman.
          459 A drop of liquid Peyton falls upon... A cube of ice. It 459
          bursts into flames.
          460 The camera races back from Darkman's eye.. his vein 460
          pulsing madly.

          461 DARXMAN'S RIVETED HAND 461
           insensitive to pain, he pulls, every sinew concentrated
           on the task. GGGGGGGG ! A horrible grating
           sounds as the first rivet rips through steel... One hand
           is freed. GGGGGGG ! .The other is freed.

                         462 STRACK 462
          with his back to him, doesn't have a chance to turn as:

                         CONTINUED

                         

                         

                         

                         

          169.

                         462 CONTINUED

                         DARKMAN
          pounces.
          He lifts him full into the air. Strack's legs and arms
          flail impotently.

                         DARKMAN

          ARRRRRRRGGGGGGG !
          Darkman hurls him up, up into the air.
          463 Strack rises helpless, flailing his limbs... then begins 463
          to fall, yards away from the girder.
          464 He spins, end over end, to--PPHHHHFFFTHHMP!--be impaled 464
          on the rebars many floors below, next to Durant's face.

                         CUT TO:

          465 INT. CONSTRUCTION ELEVATOR 465

          HUMMING at the cut. Darkman and Julie are inside.
          Darkman remains turned from Julie, facing the shadows.
          Gently, Julie touches his shoulder to draw him toward
          her.

                         JULIE
          Peyton, I can help.

                         DARKMAN
          No one can help.

                         JULIE
          I don't care how you look, Peyton! I.
          love you. The burns don't matter.
          There's a long pause. Then Darkman turns the twisted
          remains of. his face toward her. Julie sees them in
          close-up.
          CLAMP! The elevator jars to a halt on street level.

                         CONTINUED

                         465 CONTINUED

                         DARKMAN
          Take my hand.
          Julie stares at the charred skeletal fingers. She
          overcomes her repulsion and puts her hand in his.

                         DARKMAN
          It disgusts you.

                         JULIE
          No.
          Darkman stares at her a long time, anguished, torn.

                         FINALLY:

                         DARKMAN
          This hand... it used to caress you.
          Now it can only tear, rip away at
          things.

                         JULIE

                         (ANXIOUS;

                         PERSUASIVE)
          But you'll perfect the skin. You'll
          get rid of the scars.

                         DARKMAN
          It's not just the scars. I've changed-
          He grips his skull.

                         DARKMAN
          --inside.
          He pulls the elevator open.

                         DARKMAN

                         (BEAT)
          I can live with it now, but I don't
          think anyone else can.

                         JULIE
          (tears in her

                         EYES)
          I want it back. The two of us--the way
          it was...
          Darkman's voice breaks:

                         DARKMAN
          What we had--our life together--it
          belonged in the light of day.
          He disappears into the darkness.

                         JULIE
          Peyton!
          Darkman's voice floats back as he stalks away:

                         DARKMAN
          Peyton is gone...
          466 He heads into the shadows. At the edge of the darkness 466
          he pulls a mask from his coat and disappears behind a
          construction trailer. A pedestrian reappears on the other
          side.
          Julie knows it's!Darkman. She chases after him but he
          slips into the pedestrian traffic.
          The camera hurries down the street with Julie as she
          desperately searches for him, turning people around,
          staring at their faces... It begins to snow.

                         JULIE
          Peyton!
          She rushes from pedestrian to pedestrian, staring into
          alien faces in search of the man she loves.

          AS WE ROLL END CREDITS
          The camera pulls back into the crowd of pedestrians,
          any one of who could be Darkman... We continue to pull
          back, down avenues and side-streets, byways, courtyards,
          wherever the crowd spills, into an alley... As a street-
          person shuffles into view:

          467 A MUSCULAR HAND 467
          snaps open a switch-blade. A second set of arms grabs
          the street person and spins him around, revealing--

          THE CHARRED SKULL OF DARKMAN
          Wild, half-mad eyes gleam wickedly from boney sockets.
          Mandibles yank back and, through a lipless smile, he

                         RASPS:

          CUT TO BLACK
DAY
OF
THE
DEAD
(The original script)
by George A. Romero



	FADE IN:

1	EXT. THE EMPTY STREET OF A CITY - DAY

No people. A FEW CARS AND TRUCKS are parked at odd angles, abandoned. 
A TITLE FADES IN, one phrase at a time.

FIVE YEARS...
SINCE THE DEAD FIRST WALKED.

2	EXT. THE CITY - DAY

We hear THE SOUND OF A STRONG WIND. DEBRIS flutters through the 
streets. A LARGE ALLIGATOR slithers into frame, stops and looks 
around.

MONTAGE: as MORE GATORS explore the empty streets, knocking over 
GARBAGE CANS, upsetting the MANNEQUINS in A DEPARTMENT STORE WINDOW. 
A GATOR crawls out through the open doors of AN ABANDONED BANK. LOOSE 
BILLS are dragged along under the animal's tail. They flutter away on 
the WIND.

3	EXT. THE CITY - DAY

GATORS crawl over A '79 CADELLIC. A FEMALE SKELETON sits slumped over 
the steering wheel. In the back a BABY'S BONES are strapped into AN 
INFANT'S SAFETY SEAT. One of the gators THUMPS its tail maddeningly 
against the windshield. ANOTHER TITLE APPEAR:

FLORIDA - 1987

4	EXT. THE CITY - DAY

CLOSE ON A SECTION OF PAVEMENT as we hear THE SOUND OF SLUGGISH 
FOOTSTEPS approaching. A SHADOW appears at the bottom of the frame. 
It gets longer and takes on the shape of a man.

TIGHT ON THE AFTERNOON SUN, blinding us. Into the FOREGROUND lurches 
THE FIGURE which cast the shadow. Glare obscures all facial detail 
until the head jogs into position directly in front of the fiery ball 
in the sky. Then we see its hideous, dead eyes, its blue-grey colour, 
the blackened wound where a large portion of jaw has been ripped 
away. This is a ZOMBIE! A MUSIC CHORD SOUNDS and THE MAIN TITLE 
APPEARS:

DAY OF THE DEAD

5	EXT. THE CITY - DAY

HEAD CREDITS ROLL over A MONTAGE: the CITY STREETS are now populated 
by the WALKING DEAD. In every shape, size and colour they wander, 
without purpose, up and down the avenues, in and out of buildings. 
The city is theirs, they have inherited the place. Man, in his human 
form, seems to be gone.

As the CREDITS END, we CUT TO:

6	EXT. A MAIN STREET - DAY

We are looking down from a HIGH ANGLE. The corner of A TALL BUILDING 
is in the FOREGROUND. A CORPSE is dangling from A NOOSE. It's been 
dead for some time. It's mostly bone now, its blackened flesh picked 
clean by scavenger birds and harbour rats. A SIGN flaps against its 
chest cavity. Its hurriedly scrawled message reads: TAKE ME, LORD! I 
LOVE YOU!

THE ROPE BREAKS suddenly and THE CORPSE FALLS out of frame.

7	EXT. THE STREET - DAY

We're at GROUND LEVEL now...SMACK!!! THE CORPSE HITS THE PAVEMENT and 
SHATTERS as though made of potter's clay. BONES bounce over a wide 
area. THE SIGN is carried off by the WIND.

8	EXT. AN ABANDONED MARINA - DAY

THE SIGN gallops across the grass of A HARBOUR PARK towards the water 
where A FEW DERELICT BOATS sway in the WIND.

Slowly, THE SOUND OF A MOTOR FADES IN.

9	EXT. THE MARINA (CLOSER ANGLE) - DAY

A FISHING BOATS, old and sea-worn, chugs into the harbour.

10	EXT. THE MARINA (CLOSE ON THE FISHING BOAT) - DAY

There are people on board, THREE MEN AND TWO WOMEN. They look like 
guerilleros from somewhere in Latin America. They're heavily armed, 
unshaven, covered with months worth of jungle crud. They are 
obviously exhausted. They gaze up to the city. Their deep-sunken eyes 
are too war-weary to show much emotion but we can read their despair.

TONY
Another dead place. I tol' you. Let's get 
out to the islands.

MIGUEL
The radio signals were coming from this 
area.

TONY
Not from the city. In every city it's the 
same. Dead. Let's get out to the barrier 
islands. If there are survivors sending 
those signals that's where we'll find them.

MIGUEL
Plenty of time for the islands. The rest of 
our...life...on the islands...I think.

Miguel is drifting. The sight of the dead city has pushed him a few 
inches closer to the brink of insanity. He catches himself and comes 
back toward reality.

MIGUEL
We gotta see if there are others here. We 
came all this way. We're gonna check it 
out.

11	EXT. THE MARINA (AT THE DOCKS) - DAY

CLOSE ON THE OPEN GASOLINE RECEPTACLE in the hull of AN ABANDONED 
BOAT. A WOMAN'S HANDS shove a LENGTH OF HOSE down into the hole.

The woman, MARIA, puts the other end of the hose to her mouth and 
sucks the air out.

At ANOTHER DERELICT BOAT, TONY sucks on ANOTHER HOSE.

TONY
Ptoooo! Nothing! Dry as a bone. No gas. 
Let's get outa here.

MIGUEL
Check them all. And check the tanks under 
the pumps.
	
MIGUEL and the other two guerilleros, SARAH AND CHICO, start to walk 
up the dock towards the harbour park, toward the city. MIGUEL has AN 
ELECTRONIC BULLHORN in one hand, his AUTOMATIC RIFLE ready in the 
other.

12	EXT. THE HARBOUR PARK - DAY

THE TRIO of refugees move across the grass. The WIND blows DEBRIS 
around them as they stare towards the downtown buildings. MIGUEL 
lifts THE BULLHORN to his mouth.

MIGUEL
HELLO. IS THERE ANYONE THERE? HELLO. 
HELLOOOOOOO....

13 	EXT. THE CITY - DAY

MONTAGE: as THE WALKING DEAD hear that human VOICE. Throughout the 
city they turned towards THE SOUND, at once confused and excited.

MIGUEL (o.s.)
HELLOOOOOOOOOOO....

THE DEAD start to GROAN hungrily, almost pleadingly. All over the 
city their VOICES RISE.

14	EXT. THE HARBOUR PARK - DAY

It comes to MIGUEL AND THE OTHERS as A MASSIVE WALL OF NOISE, THE 
SOUND of hundreds-of-thousands of damned souls moaning on one solid 
voice. The sound of hell on earth.

15	EXT. THE MARINA (AT THE DOCKS) - DAY

TONY AND MARIA hear it as well and feel the familiar grip of cold 
fear. Maria makes the sign of the cross.

MARIA
Dios mia.

TONY
I tol' him. I tol' him this is a dead 
place. Like all the others.

CUT TO:

16	EXT. THE CITY (FROM THE WATER) - DAY

We see the place FROM A GREAT DISTANCE. In the FOREGROUND THE FISHING 
BOAT, with all five REFUGEES back on board, chugs into open waters.

CUT TO:

17	EXT.	A SMALL PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

Away from the city, this dock is wooden, rickety. DERELICT BOATS rust 
at their moorings. THE FISHING BOAT is tied-on at one end of the pier 
and THE GUERILLEROS are moving through the area, scavenging. This 
time CHICO helps MARIA with the SIPHON HOSES. TONY lingers sullenly 
near the fishing boat which has its motor still idling.

MARIA'S SIPHON HOSE is stuffed into the gas tank of A LARGE TRAWLER. 
She sucks on the hose and, unexpectedly, foul tasting liquid fills 
her mouth.

MARIA
AY! GASOLINA! GASOLINA!

Without warning, A FIGURE pops up from behind the side wall of the 
trawler. He reaches out and grabs the woman, pulling her against the 
boat, his arm around her neck, a pistol to her head.

TONY sees the action. He dives into the fishing boat, crawls over to 
his RIFLE and scrambles towards the pilot's controls.

With a lightning move, MARIA pulls A KNIFE from her belt. She 
wrenches around and PLUNGES THE BLADE INTO HER ATTACKER'S CHEST. The 
man staggers back, screaming. MARIA breaks away and runs across the 
dock. THE MAN FIRES HIS PISTOL wildly.

MARIA IS HIT IN THE ARM. She tumbles forwards onto the decking.

TONY reacts, OPENING FIRE WITH HIS AUTOMATIC.

BULLETS RIP INTO THE ATTACKERS CHEST: HE FALLS OUT OF THE TRAWLER 
onto the dock, but TWO MORE GUNMEN appear behind him, mean-looking 
desperadoes with RIFLE SPITTING LEAD.

TONY ducks as low as he can. He grabs the controls and pilots the 
fishing boat along the edge of the dock toward the downed woman.

18	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

MIGUEL, SARAH AND CHICO react to the gunfire. They draw their WEAPONS 
and look for cover.

They are at the far end of the dock, their backs to the sea. There is 
a WORK SHED nearby. BULLETS WHIZ past them as they charge towards the 
wooden structure. They make it there safely and they begin to RETURN 
FIRE. A gun battle ensues between the two groups.

19	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

MARIA, her ARM BLEEDING, rolls off the dock and into THE FISHING 
BOAT. TONY guns the engine and the boat pulls out into open water.

THE ATTACKERS try to FIRE AT THE ESCAPING BOAT but they are forced to 
duck BULLETS which RICOCHET OFF THE TRAWLER pinning them down.

20	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

MIGUEL'S RIFLE is in his right hand. His left hand clings to the 
frame of AN OPEN WINDOW on his side of the shed. There's a SUDDEN, 
STARTLING MUSIC STING and, with it, A ZOMBIE appears inside the open 
window. Grotesque and drooling dark SALIVA, its hungry mouth lunges 
at MIGUEL'S left arm. ITS TEETH TEAR A LARGE STRIP OF FLESH OUT OF 
THE ARM six inches above the wrist.

MIGUEL screams. He pulls away from the creature, his terrified eyes 
staring at the BLEEDING WOUND. A zombie bite means infection and 
almost certain death.

THE ZOMBIE leans out through the open window, its hands clawing the 
air trying to reach MIGUEL. SARAH pulls A GIANT .45 from her holster 
belt. BULLAMN! BULLAMN! BULLAMN! She FIRES three rapid shots.

THE SKULL OF THE ZOMBIE INDENTS IN FRONT like a hard-boiled egg shell 
that's been whacked with a spoon bowl. BLACKENED BLOOD AND BRAIN 
MATTER FLIES OUT OF THE BACK where the bullets exit. The creature 
falls, destroyed.

21	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

SARAH acts quickly. She lunges towards CHICO and snatches A MACHETE 
out of his belt. CHICO shows concern but he's busy RETURNING FIRE at 
THE ATTACKERS on the trawler.

SARAH
I have to stop the infection... Querrida...
	
MIGUEL looks into SARAH'S eyes. He has started to tremble. A cry of 
primal panic is gurgling up in his throat. With a sudden move, SARAH 
slams her RIFLE BUTT into the side of his head with all her might. He 
reels backwards and slams into the boathouse wall. His eyes roll but 
he stays on his feet, still conscious.

CHICO steps away from his post and stands squarely in front of 
MIGUEL. WHAP! He slugs him with a powerhouse right-cross. MIGUEL 
still stands. WHAP! He slugs him again. WHAP! Again. Finally, MIGUEL 
collapses into the man's arms and CHICO lays the limp body down on 
the deck.

BUDDABLAM! RATTATATTATATTATATT! THE ENEMY, sensing an upper hand, 
starts FIRING WITH MORE INTENSITY. CHICO steps away from MIGUEL and 
SENDS SOME LEAD BACK their way.

22	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

SARAH is crying. It's not weakness. She's crying for MIGUEL, crying 
for his pain. But she doesn't hesitate in what she has to do. She 
crouches over the BITTEN ARM and raises the MACHETE over her head.

THUCK! SHE CHOPS AT THE ELBOW JOINT with all her strength. THE BLADE 
BITES DEEP BUT DOESN'T CUT THROUGH. SHE LIFTS IT AND CHOPS AGAIN AND 
AGAIN....THUCK! THUCK! Then SHE DIGS AROUND, searching for the joint 
the way she might on a turkey drumstick. Finding the spot, SHE PUSHES 
DOWN WITH BOTH HANDS, leaning all her weight on the top edge of the 
blade. TEARS are running down her cheeks when THE BIG KNIFE 
FINALLY.... THUMMMPPP!....CUTS THROUGH TO THE DECKING.

Repulsed, angry, SARAH SWEEPS THE SEVERED FOREARM AWAY WITH THE BLADE 
the way a butcher might sweep away unwanted fat. BLOOD IS SPURTING 
OUT OF THE STUMP at an alarming rate. SARAH has to act quickly again.

While CHICO continues to RETURN FIRE at the enemy, SARAH swings 
herself up onto the sill of the open boathouse window and disappears 
inside the place.

23	INT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY

The place is dark and cluttered (oars, bait buckets, fishing gear, 
life preservers, tools, paints, varnishes). SARAH snatches up AN AXE 
HANDLE.

THE ZOMBIE that bit Miguel lies nearby with its skull laid open. Its 
hand is jogged, startingly, when SARAH grabs A BOTTLE OF PAINT 
THINNER from the floor beside the corpse.

From out of the shadows...A HAND! It grabs SARAH'S ankle. She kicks 
violently and pulls away. ANOTHER ZOMBIE is crawling across the 
floor. ONE OF ITS LEGS IS MISSING AND THE OTHER IS BADLY DAMAGED.

SARAH draws her .45 and BULLAMM! BULLAMM! SHE PUMPS TWO ROUNDS INTO 
THE CREATURE'S BRAIN.

24	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

CHICO ducks the enemy's RICOCHETING BULLETS.

CHICO
HEY ! WHAT ARE WE DOIN' THIS FOR? WE CAN 
STICK TOGETHER. WE CAN USE EACH OTHER'S 
GUNS.

At THE TRAWLER, ONE OF THE ATTACKERS shouts a response.

ATTACKER #1
You could use our guns, maybe. We can't use 
yours. Unless you can get yer boat back 
here.

CHICO
You got a boat.

ATTACKER #1
Shit, man. We can drift this tub into the 
bay...tow her around with a dinghy...but 
she ain't gonna get us nowhere. Ev'ry boat 
you see here is long dead, soldier...else 
we'd be long gone. Can you get your boat 
back here?

CHICO
I don't know where they went, man. I don't 
know. I swear.

ATTACKER #1
Then, like I said...we can't use you. We 
ain't got the food nor the patience to put 
up with you.

The man FIRES A LONG BURST from his automatic.

CHICO
YOU....YOU MOTHERFUCKERS!

He reaches around the corner of the shed with his own rifle and FIRES 
blind in return. SARAH clambers out through the shed windows having 
wrapped A LARGE PIECE OF CLOTH around the end of the AXE HANDLE.
	
She reaches into a shirt pocket and produces A WOODEN MATCH. She 
strikes the match and touches the flame to the thinner-soaked cloth. 
PHOOOOOMPH! The axe handle becomes an angrily flaming torch.

25	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

As the gun battle continues, SARAH crouches over MIGUEL. BLOOD IS 
STILL FOUNTAINING FROM THE STUMP OF HIS LEFT ARM. The woman slaps THE 
FLAMING END OF HER TORCH ONTO THE STUMP. There's A SIZZLING SOUND as 
the raw flesh there cooks.

The pain reaches MIGUEL even though his unconscious state. He starts 
to breathe heavily. His head shakes from side to side silently 
pleading "NO, NO, NO." The flames do their job. THE FLESH CRUSTS OVER 
AND THE BLEEDING STOPS.

MIGUEL'S SHIRT CATCHES. Suddenly his eyes pop open and he screams 
like the man on fire he is. He lurches away from the flame, his body 
slamming against the shed wall. SARAH flings the torch into the water 
and dives on top of the man.

SARAH
MIGUELITO. MI VIDA. MIGUEL MIO.

MIGUEL, trying to scream but needing to vomit, is doing neither. His 
body is convulsing in the woman's arms. She rubs the sparks on his 
shirt until they disappear then she caresses him, holding his head 
against hers, rocking him back and forth.

26	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

CHICO is still busy RETURNING FIRE. BULLETS WHIZ through the air 
around his head. ONE KNICKS HIM ON THE SHOULDER, a superficial but 
painful wound.

CHICO
JESUS CHRIST! GET UP HERE, WOMAN! GET THE 
HELL UP HERE!

SARAH has no choice but to help in the fight. She lays MIGUEL as 
gently as she can on his back. He's gone into deep shock, shivering 
violently. Rubbing tears away from her eyes, SARAH jumps to her feet, 
takes up a post and begins to FIRE AT THE ATTACKERS.

THE ATTACKERS are grinning like old-fashioned pirates as their GUNS 
CHEW UP THE DOCK. Suddenly, just behind THE TRAWLER, we see A FLASH 
OF COLOUR SPEEDING BY...

It's THE FISHING BOAT! The WOUNDED MARIA is steering. TONY is 
standing on the prow with his RIFLE FIRING... 
RATTATATTATATTATATTATATT!!!!

ONE OF THE ATTACKERS IS HIT FROM BEHIND. HIS BACK TURNS SOLID RED and 
HE PITCHES FORWARDS, FALLING between the boat and the dock into the 
water below.

THE OTHER ATTACKER (#1) turns and FIRES IN RESPONSE. TONY IS HIT IN 
THE STOMACH. He falls to his knees and grabs the side of the boat but 
he KEEPS FIRING.

THE ATTACKER pivots against a mast. For a moment he doesn't realise 
that HIS NECK HAS BEEN RIPPED OPEN BY A LINE OF BULLETS. He tries to 
scream. Can't. A PLUME OF RED SHOOT OUT OF HIS MOUTH. Then he 
realises. He realises that he's a dead man. He falls.

MARIA
TONY....TONY....

TONY
PULL IN! GET THE OTHERS.

TONY is clutching at his BLEEDING BELLY as MARIA, in pain from her 
own wound, circles the boat towards the edge of the dock.

27	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

Behind the boathouse, SARAH slings her rifle onto her shoulder and 
she leans over MIGUEL who is now catatonic.

SARAH
Help me get him to the boat.

CHICO
Leave him.

SARAH calmly raises her .45 and aims it directly at CHICO's head.

SARAH
Help me or die.

Reluctantly the man moves towards MIGUEL and the two survivors drag 
his limp body over the decking.

DISSOLVE TO:

28	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - SUNSET

The fishing boat is gone. Orange light from the western horizon 
paints the scene. FIGURES are moving about on the dock, slumped, 
lumbering figures....ZOMBIES.

They're clustering around THE TRAWLER, around THE CORPSES OF THE 
ATTACKERS.

THEY BEGIN PULLING THOSE CORPSES APART AND EATING THEM HUNGRILY.

ONE CREATURE has found MIGUEL'S SEVERED FOREARM. IT PULLS A BIG CHUNK 
OFF THE THING WITH ITS TEETH. It chews for a time, ITS DROOL TURNING 
RED. Then it spits out MIGUEL'S WRISTWATCH as though it was a 
bothersome bit of bone.

29	EXT. THE FISHING BOAT (IN DEEP WATER) - SUNSET

THE TWO WOMEN hover over their wounded, TONY AND MIGUEL. CHICO steers 
the boat. Suddenly, TONY arches his back and screams in pain.

TONY
Aaaaaaah...my God...my God...I am heartily 
sorry...for having offended 
Thee....offended Thee...

MARIA
Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest.

TONY
I detest all my sins...because... because 
of Thy just punishment... because of 
Thy...just...punish...

A coughing fit interrupts his Act of Contrition. From across the open 
cabin, from within SARAH'S arms, MIGUEL stares. His eyes have the 
glaze of a madman's eyes. Despite that, and despite the physical 
trauma he has endured, he seems remarkably in command.

MIGUEL
He is dying. I will end his pain.

MIGUEL draws his PISTOL.

MARIA
NOOOOOOOOO!

TONY
...but most of all because...they offend 
Thee, my God...Who art all good...and 
deserving...deserving of all my love...

MIGUEL
He is dying. He knows it.

MARIA
You are dying, too.

MIGUEL
No. The disease was cut away from me. I 
will live. I will live.

TONY
I firmly resolve...with the... with the 
help...the help of...of Thy grace...

TONY collapses. A long, gurgling breath of surrender spills out of 
him and BLOOD TRICKLES FROM HIS LIFELESS MOUTH.

MARIA
Tony...TONY!

The woman folds TONY'S corpse into her arms as though trying to give 
it life from her own wounded body. For a long moment there is only 
the CHUG-CHUG-CHUG of the tired engine. Then the woman, sensing 
something, turns back towards MIGUEL. His pistol is raised, aimed at 
TONY'S head.

MARIA
NO! YOU CAN'T!

SARAH
It must be done. You know this. It must by 
done to keep him from...

MARIA
It won't happen to him! It won't happen to 
him! You heard his prayer. His prayer will 
save him. He could never become one 
of...one of those... devils.

MIGUEL
Prayers have no power to save. The knife 
can save. It can cut the disease away. The 
bullet. It can shatter the brain where the 
evil takes seed. These are saviours...our 
new saviours...our only saviours.

MARIA
We must wait. One day the curse will pass. 
One day a dead man will... will...

MIGUEL
One day a dead man will refuse to return, 
and that man will be a saint. The first 
saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. 
A catechism. Something the priests tell us 
to believe.

MARIA
You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you 
if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do 
it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to 
be done.

MIGUEL
No. You won't be able to do it. He will 
rise. He will rise and you... you will die.

That madman's glaze is wet in MIGUEL'S eyes again. A grin curls his 
mouth into an odd shape. He freezes, staring, waiting. SARAH shows 
concern.

30	EXT. DEEP WATER (WITH THE FISHING BOAT) - NIGHT

A CRESCENT MOON lies on its back. Below, on the pitch black water, 
its reflection, a vertical stripe, breaks open as THE BOAT passes 
through it...CHUG-CHUG-CHUG.

31	EXT. THE FISHING BOAT (IN DEEP WATER) - NIGHT

CHICO has fallen asleep at the tiller. SARAH is asleep as well, and 
so is MARIA.

A SILENT SHADOW moves over the side rail. HANDS reach out and grip 
MARIA'S shoulders, lifting her up, up from sleep. Her eyes flutter 
open.

TONY'S face is blue-grey in the moonlight. It takes the woman a 
second or two to recognise that HE IS ONE OF THE LIVING DEAD. His 
hungry mouth lunges towards her neck. His DROOLING TEETH SINK DEEP. 
The woman screams.

SARAH wakes with a start. MIGUEL is already awake. He's been watching 
all along. Now he watches still, his PISTOL idle in his one good 
hand, his mouth curled in that strange grin, as MARIA'S screams 
shatter the quiet night.

At the tiller, CHICO sees what's happening. He fumbles for the 
AUTOMATIC RIFLE that's strapped over his shoulder.

A PORK-CHOP-SIZE CHUNK COMES OUT OF MARIA'S NECK IN THE CLENCHED 
TEETH OF THE TONY-CREATURE. BLOOD SQUIRTS UPWARD IN A FIVE-FOOT ARC.

SARAH lifts her RIFLE from her lap. She is the first to FIRE. An 
instant later, CHICO FIRES as well.

THE HEAD ON THE TONY-CREATURE IS HIT BY RAPID-FIRE LOADS from each 
gun and IT COME APART ABOVE THE EYES. Its body staggers stiffly into 
MARIA. She tries to stand, tries to pull away, screams still bubbling 
in her torn throat. She topples backward over the side rail. The 
corpse, taller and heavier, flips rigidly over, its feet kicking 
skyward, and splashes in to the deep, black Gulf. 

MARIA, the small of her back balanced precariously on the side rail, 
grabs at the air trying to swing her weight back on board. SARAH 
springs forward. She reaches the other woman a second too late. Their 
hands brush but don't catch. MARIA slips over the side. A LOUD SPLASH 
CUTS OFF HER SCREAMS.

CHICO brings the boat about in as tight a circle as possible. He and 
SARAH stare out over the water. The blackness out there is absolute. 
Visibility zero.

Silence....but for the CHUG-CHUG-CHUG of the boat's engine.

MIGUEL slowly raises his hand and aims his PISTOL at a LARGE, TURTLE-
SHAPED SPLOTCH OF BLOOD on the hull across the cabin, the spot where 
TONY died. With that odd grin still on his lips, HE BEGINS TO FIRE 
one shot at a time in deliberate, slow rhythm.

THE BULLETS PUNCH HOLES through the wooden side-wall, most of them 
hitting squarely in the blood stain.

SARAH looks over toward CHICO who returns her look with frightened 
eyes.

32	EXT. GASPARILLA'S ISLAND (EST.) - DAY

It looks like a tropical paradise. Greatly separated from the other 
smaller islands on the horizon, its vegetation is dense and lush. 
There's no sign that civilisation ever invaded the place, no power 
lines, no buildings. What meets the eye is all natural and inviting.

THE FISHING BOAT chugs into a tidewater basin on the afternoon side 
of the island.

33	EXT. THE FISHING BOAT (IN THE BASIN) - DAY

CHICO
It looks uninhabited. What do you think?

MIGUEL
I think we should burn the church. Kill the 
priest and burn the church. It's the only 
way. The only way.

MIGUEL is sweating profusely yet shivering as though cold. FLIES ARE 
BUZZING in a cluster around his WRAPPED STUMP. He's over the edge 
now, insane. And worse than that, the infection from the original 
bite is spreading. The amputation was not done quickly enough to 
prevent the parasites from racing through his veins to the brain and 
elsewhere.

SARAH turns towards the madman once her lover. Her heart is too 
callused for emotion to reach it. She just stares, her eyes dead cold 
like the eyes of a shark.

CHICO
I'm pullin' in.

34	EXT. THE ISLAND (WITH THE FISHING BOAT) - DAY

THE BOAT noses into a swamp water backwash. Tall reeds and cypress 
moss camouflage it completely. It's at though the boat is sailing 
right onto dry land.

SHOCK CUT TO:

35	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE INLET - DAY

THWOCK! CLOSE ON A MACHETE. The blade chops into the top of a 
coconut.

CHICO drinks the milk. SARAH sits on a nearby rock, her RIFLE AND A 
BACK-PACK full of supplies strapped over her shoulders.

MIGUEL, his madman's eyes wide with excitement, is trotting urgently 
from spot to spot where a spectacular specie of sub-tropical plant 
grows. There are hundreds of them, six-feet tall and flowering. Their 
red-gold blossoms are shaped like trumpets hanging with their bells 
down.

MIGUEL
DATURA!!! DATURA!!! MIRA. DATURA!!!

CHICO
What's he saying?
	
SARAH shrugs, not knowing. CHICO looks down at her, empathising.

CHICO
His madness....could be from shock.

SARAH
No. I didn't stop the infection in time. I 
know.
(She speaks softly, matter-of-factly)
Don't worry. When he dies, I won't be like 
Maria. I'll shoot him.

MIGUEL
DATURA!!! DATURA!!! DATURA METEL!!!

36	EXT. THE INLAND JUNGLE - DAY

THE GUERILLEROS hack their way through thick undergrowth with 
MACHETES. MIGUEL is ineffectual. He lags behind the others who are 
doing trailblazing. THE SOUNDS OF WILDLIFE, excited by the intruders, 
fill the close, humid air, sometimes beautiful, sometimes grotesque, 
sometimes startling.

37	EXT. A SWAMPY AREA - DAY

ALLIGATORS lurk and SNAKES slither among the reeds. A FOURTEEN FOOT 
GATOR opens its jaws wide making a SOUND LIKE ESCAPING STEAM. CHICO 
draws his PISTOL but SARAH reaches out to grab his hand.

SARAH
No. No shooting. Not until we're sure we're 
alone on this island.

MIGUEL
No. No, thank you. No ice. Straight up, 
please. No ice. Thank you.

MIGUEL'S eyes roll up into his head. His knees buckle. SARAH grabs 
him under the arms barely keeping from falling face first into the 
muddy swamp water. CHICO comes to help.

38	EXT. THE SWAMP - DAY

THE TWO drag MIGUEL to the edge of dry land. They flop him onto his 
back and SARAH puts her canteen to his lips.

MIGUEL
NO ICE, I SAID!!! NOOOOO ICE!!!

He slams his good hand against the canteen, knocking it away. It 
plops into the marsh water, its contents lost.

MIGUEL
Burn the church. Kill the priest and burn 
the church. Burn....

His mouth keeps on shaping words but no sound comes out. He squirms 
for a moment, then he seems to fall asleep.

CHICO looks down at him. Unable to help, he moves off towards solid 
ground and disappears in the thick brush. After a time, SARAH follows 
after him.

39	EXT. THE CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY

CHICO is at the edge of a clearing when SARAH reaches him. His eyes 
are wide, frightened by what they see.

In the ground before them there's AN ENORMOUS IRON PLATE, fifty feet 
by ten, all painted in brown and green camouflage patterns.

SARAH
What is it?

CHICO
I dunno. Landing pad for a helicopter? I 
dunno.

Suddenly there's A GREAT RUMBLING, like the giant gears and pistons 
of a drawbridge being activated. The iron plate shudders and starts 
to move, downward, into the earth. SARAH AND CHICO duck into the 
nearby jungle.

40	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY

They take cover in a thicket, both their GUNS up and ready. OTHER 
SOUNDS can be heard now, clunking sounds of metal on metal, and a few 
heavy thuds. There are also VOICES on the wind but their words are 
indistinguishable.

CHICO
It's some kind of....elevator. There must 
be something under the ground 
here....maybe....military.

SARAH
Look.

41	EXT. THE CAVE ENTRANCE (THEIR P.O.V.) - DAY

SEVERAL FIGURES are rising up in to view, a dozen, maybe fifteen. 
Details are obscured by FOREGROUND FOLIAGE but we can read helmets, 
heavy armaments, packs, utility belts. The impression is of a ghostly 
cadre of soldiers rising from hell.

SARAH (o.s.)
Jesus Christ!

CHICO (o.s.)
It is military. I don't believe it.

42	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY

CHICO
What do we do? Let'em know we're here....or 
what?

SARAH
Let's just....wait a minute. Get a better 
look.

She moves to another spot a few feet away. CHICO follows.

43	EXT. THE CAVE ENTRANCE (THEIR P.O.V.) - DAY

THE PLATOON OF SOLDIERS, still obscured by foliage, moves off into 
the jungle carrying A COLLECTION OF PARAPHERNALIA.

There are THREE SOLDIERS who do not move off with the others. They 
are standing still with their shoulders slumped, their heads lolling 
listlessly from side to side. They have the body attributes of 
prisoners yet there's something menacing about them. We HEAR A SERIES 
OF ELECTRONIC BEEPS, something like computer beeps, and, as though in 
response to that signal, the three slumped figures start to walk. 
They move slowly, stiffly, their feet shuffling, their arms dangling 
lifelessly at their sides.

SARAH (o.s.)
Oh....oh, my God.

44	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY

SARAH'S eyes are wide in their sockets with disbelief, revulsion, 
horror. Beside her CHICO, also astonished, makes the sign of the 
cross.

SARAH
OH, MY GOD!!!

45	EXT. THE CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY

As we CUT IN CLOSER we see that the three slumped figures are 
ZOMBIES. They are wearing khakis and they are armed with RIFLES AND 
PISTOL BELTS. Their HELMETS have been painted an identifying bright 
RED and they wear slipover vests dyed the same bright colour.

All the others in the platoon are humans. They, too, wear vests but 
theirs are not red but WHITE, WITH LARGE ORANGE CIRCLES emblazoned 
front and back. Two of the men wield LONG ELECTRIC CATTLE PRODS for 
use should the ZOMBIES misbehave, but the creatures, amazingly, are 
shambling along with the rest of the platoon voluntarily, co-
operatively, even somewhat excitedly....the kind of excitement seen 
in a puppy that's just learned a new trick.

46	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY

CHICO
It can't be. Are we truly in hell?

SARAH
Come on.

Stealthily the woman moves along the edge of the thicket, crouching 
all the while. CHICO hesitantly follows.

47	EXT. A CLEARING - DAY

The mysterious PLATOON begins "setting up" their equipment, which 
includes TRIPOD MACHINE GUNS. TWO MEN don BLACK RUBBER GLOVES AND 
LONG BLACK LABORATORY APRONS. They strap LARGE REFRIGERATED CARTONS 
around their necks and open the sealed lids. VAPOUR mushrooms out 
like dry-ice vapour out of Good Humour wagons on a hot day.

48	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

SARAH AND CHICO watch. Suddenly THE HUGE, FULL-THROATED SOUND OF A 
SIREN startles them. They look around, up into the trees. SARAH spots 
something and points.

CLOSE ON A SIREN HORN, high in the cypresses, its wires running down 
to the brush and disappearing under ground.

49	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY

First ONE comes....then TWO MORE....THREE MORE. ZOMBIES are shuffling 
out of the jungle and converging on the platoon.

They seem to come from everywhere. Soon there are twenty or more. 
Most are tattered and ragged but others wear vests, the same type as 
worn by the platoon. These are solid colours, some white, some blue. 
None are red and none have orange circles.

As THE ZOMBIES push in closer they seem to get agitated. They start 
growling and reaching out. THE MEN WITH THE CATTLE PRODS poke at the 
more unruly creatures and ZAPPING SOUNDS can be heard.

The creatures form a kind of ragged queue, lining up in front of the 
"Good Humour" men. From inside their freezer cartons those men 
produce GREAT BLOODY CHUNKS OF RAW MEAT. THE ZOMBIES docilely take 
the hand-outs and go lurching out of the queue, some starting to eat 
immediately, others retreating into the cool of the jungle to enjoy a 
more private supper.

50	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

SARAH
What is that? Could that be....?

Behind her, CHICO gets the dry heaves. He slams his hand into his 
mouth to keep from making noise.

SARAH
No. They must have gotten them to 
accept....other things. They wouldn't be 
feeding them with....they wouldn't...

51	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY

The man in command of the platoon is obvious, strutting around while 
others do the dirty work. This is CAPTAIN RHODES. He's 
conscienceless, the low of the low, and a weasely-looking guy, to 
boot. He watches the operation almost hoping for trouble. (He loves 
to torture disobedient zombies.)

Behind him, their AUTOMATICS ready, are SEVERAL TROOPERS especially 
assigned to protect the captain. One of these troopers is TOBY TYLER, 
a good guy. TOBY is revulsed by the scene in the clearing. He drops 
his head, almost gagging. RHODES notices.

RHODES
You'll get used to this, Tyler. It's the 
only way. They don't bite the hand that 
feeds.
	
TOBY looks up. He can't conceal his contempt for the captain. RHODES 
reads it in his eyes and is about to say something when a SOUND 
distracts him.

ONE OF THE RAG-TAG ZOMBIES is running amok. THE ZAPPERS poke at the 
creature but that just makes it angrier.

RHODES
GET THAT THING AWAY FROM THE OTHERS!
BRING IT HERE!

ONE TROOPER has A LONG POLE WITH A WIRE NOOSE ON THE END. He drops 
the noose over the wild zombie's head and the wire tightens, biting 
into the dead flesh on the thing's neck. The pole is long enough to 
control the creature while keeping it out of reach.

52	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

SARAH watches, repulsed but fascinated. CHICO is still fighting the 
heaves. Without warning, A ZOMBIE looms up directly behind CHICO. The 
man jumps forward, terrified. He crashes into SARAH who spins and 
sees the danger.

TWO MORE ZOMBIES appear. Then A THIRD. These have no vests. They're 
rag-tag, bad ass and hungry as hell. ONE OF THEM grabs SARAH. She 
manages to pull away but behind her CHICO panics. He raises his RIFLE 
and...RATTATATTATATT!

53	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY

RHODES hears the GUNFIRE. He seems pleased. He grins.

RHODES
We have visitors. Let's go men.

He moves slowly towards the thicket followed by TOBY TYLER AND 
SEVERAL OTHER SOLDIERS. He reaches down to his belt and pushes one of 
THREE BUTTONS on A UNIT that resembles a pager. ELECTRONIC BEEPS, 
like the ones we heard earlier, come from the unit, this time in a 
different pattern.

THE RED COAT ZOMBIES respond quickly. They draw their PISTOLS and go 
marching off after their leader, grunting and snorting like bull 
apes. RHODES' grin breaks into a wide-open laugh.

RHODES
Hah! If only the rest of you ladies would 
obey orders the way they do.

54	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

Their cover blown, SARAH now raises her RIFLE. BUDDABUDDA!!!

THE SECOND ZOMBIE'S HEAD TURNS TO RED PULP and the thing pitches 
forward, dead.

CHICO FIRES and THE THIRD ZOMBIE IS DESTROYED.

Suddenly there is DISTANT FIRE, from the clearing. BULLETS WHIZ 
through the brush. The guerilleros duck for cover.

55	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY

THE RED COAT ZOMBIES, shuffling forward abreast in a line, have 
OPENED FIRE. It's a grisly parody of foot-soldiering. The creatures 
are unsteady on their feet, their hands shake when they squeeze the 
stiff Army-issue triggers. BULLETS FLY this way and that, most of 
them grossly off target.

RHODES
THAT'S IT, YOU WORM-EATEN SLIME ! YOU FOUL-
SMELLING, PUSS-FACED MAGGOTS! I TOLD YOU 
I'D FIND YOU REAL ACTION, DIDN'T I? YOU 
CORRUPTION! YOU FILTH! YOU'RE LEARNING! 
YOU'RE GETTING BETTER....GETTING 
BETTER...GETTING BETTER, YOU SCUM!

The trooper beside TOBY is another young man whose nickname is 
TRICKS. He and TOBY exchange glances as they trudge along behind the 
captain and his zombie red coats. Their eyes tell us that they both 
think Rhodes to be insane, which of course he is.

56	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

SARAH moves to retreat but CHICO lifts his rifle and FIRES wildly 
into the clearing.

CHICO
NO! NOOOOO! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

57	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY

TWO OF THE RED COATS ARE HIT, but not in the head. Their brains keep 
functioning and they march on.
	
RHODES
SPREAD OUT, MEN! OPEN FIRE!

Whatever else he is, RHODES seems fearless. He stands in the open as 
his human soldiers fan out. He notices that the RED COATS are out of 
ammunition. He pushes another button on his belt unit and MORE BEEPS 
SOUND. THE RED COATS stop in their tracks. They dump the SPENT SHELLS 
from their weapons and reload using fresh rounds from their belts. 
Their fingers are stiff. Three bullets fall to the ground for every 
one that finds its way into a gun chamber.

The SOLDIERS HAVE OPENED FIRE NOW. They are closing in on the 
thicket.

58	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

CHICO IS HIT high on the right side of his chest. SARAH FIRES A QUICK 
BURST out into the clearing as she tries to pull the man deeper into 
the jungle.

Suddenly, from right behind SARAH's back, comes A BLOOD CURDLING 
SCREAM. A DARK FIGURE LOOMS UP startling us all.

MIGUEL
BURN THE CHURCH! KILL THE PRIEST!

It's MIGUEL, sweating, his eyes sunken into deep black sockets. He is 
charging toward the clearing with his AUTOMATIC BLAZING in his one 
good hand. He thunders right past SARAH almost knocking her down.

59	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY

MIGUEL breaks out of the thicket into clear view of the SOLDIERS. 
RHODES sees the one-armed wild man and his grin dissipated slightly. 
He draws his own PISTOL, an enormous Magnum, an elephant stopper.

SOLDIERS, taken by surprise, scatter, TOBY AND TRICKS among them. 
MIGUEL'S BULLETS DRAW A LINE ACROSS ONE SOLDIER'S CHEST. He dies 
instantly.

MIGUEL
KILL THE PRIEST! BURN THE CHURCH!
BURN! BURN! BURN! BURN! BURN!

NOW MIGUEL IS HIT but he keeps coming, his GUN SPITTING.

ANOTHER SOLDIER goes down, HIT IN THE MID SECTION.

THE PLATOON RETURNS FIRE.

MIGUEL IS HIT SQUARELY IN THE CHEST. He falls to his knees. His RIFLE 
FIRES A LINE OF BULLETS INTO THE EARTH and the kicking of the gun 
knocks him back on his ass. He sits there bewildered for a moment, 
then he looks up to find himself directly facing CAPTAIN RHODES.

RHODES lifts his MAGNUM but MIGUEL is faster with his RIFLE. In the 
next instant the muzzle is aiming straight for the captain's stomach. 
RHODES' smile disappears, re-placed by a sudden flush of fear. He 
freezes.

MIGUEL
Kill the priest.

MIGUEL squeezes the trigger and his weapon CLICKS sharply. It's 
empty.

The captain's smile slowly returns. He pushes the "Attack" button on 
his belt unit.

THE RED COATS advance, their PISTOLS reloaded. THEY FIRE, stiff-armed 
and fumble-fingered, at MIGUEL. He sees them moving towards him. 
Something in his mind clicks and he recognises the creatures for what 
they are...walking dead.

THE FIRST FEW BULLETS MISS. Then ONE HITS HIM IN HIS STUMP and 
reality gets even clearer. He starts to scream.

THE READ COATS walk closer, their dead eyes showing enjoyment of the 
sport. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!

ANOTHER ROUND HITS MIGUEL IN THE STOMACH. ANOTHER CREASES HIS HEAD. 
He tries to stand up but he's too weak. A BULLET IN THE NECK stops 
his screaming. Then HE'S HIT IN THE HEART. A BALL OF BLOOD PROJECTS 
OUT OF HIS MOUTH and he plops onto his back, dead.

THE READ COATS KEEP FIRING until their guns are empty again. RHODES 
calmly pushes the "Reload" signal and the creatures obey.

MIGUEL'S CORPSE twitches for a short time, then goes rigid.

60	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

SARAH sinks against a cypress when she sees MIGUEL die.

CHICO, in a state of blind panic, takes off along the edge of the 
thicket, his WOUND BLEEDING PROFUSELY.

61	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

CHICO breaks through some brush to find himself face-to-face with 
TOBY TYLER'S GROUP OF SOLDIERS. He stops, reverses course, and ducks 
into a cluster of palms. ONE OF THE SOLDIERS FIRES. 
RATTATATTATATTATATT!!!

BULLETS RIP THE PALM FRONDS APART. There's a scream and CHICO 
somersaults out into view. NEW WOUNDS BLEEDING ACROSS THE CENTER OF 
HIS CHEST.

62	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

SARAH realises that this is her last chance to escape. She takes 
advantage of the confusion and the NOISE and bolts into the jungle at 
a full run.

63	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

CHICO is still alive. He fumbles for his HOLSTERED PISTOL but before 
he can draw it THREE TROOPERS are on top of him. TRICKS tromps a boot 
on his hand. TOBY TYLER aims his RIFLE squarely at his sweating brow.

CHICO
Yes...yes, do it...please...you can't let 
me die this way...please. Destroy me. A 
bullet...in the head...I don't want to 
become...one of...one of them.

TOBY looks down at the man, at his TERRIBLE WOUNDS, clearly fatal 
ones. TOBY clicks a shell into the firing chamber of his RIFLE. His 
finger is just sliding under the trigger shield when CAPTAIN RHODES 
strides up behind him.

RHODES
Take his weapon, Tyler.

TOBY is startled by the voice at his back. He turns towards the 
captain, then he looks back down at the guerillero, hesitating..

RHODES
Take his gun, ass hole. He still has the 
strength to pull a trigger.

Reluctantly TOBY obeys, reaches down for CHICO'S PISTOL.

CHICO
Please...senor...destroy me...one 
bullet...please.
	
RHODES
Maybe. We'll have a little talk first. 
Then....maybe...I can help you out. String 
him up.

THE THIRD SOLDIER reaches down and grabs the wounded guerillero under 
the arms. TRICKS stoops to help. CHICO screams in agony when he is 
moved. TOBY lunges in to help the others, thinking to ease the man's 
pain.

RHODES
They can handle it, Tyler. You've been 
buckin' for a shit detail lately so here's 
one you're gonna love. We've got two dead. 
Cut the heads off and get the bodies 
underground to the refrigerators. Fast. 
It's a hot day.

TOBY grimaces but doesn't speak. He turns and moves briskly towards 
the clearing. RHODES watches him go.

64	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY

TOBY nears the spot where MIGUEL lies sprawled in A POOL OF BLOOD. 
RHODES calls from the edge of the thicket.

RHODES
Tyler. Just our men. Not him.

TOBY looks down at the remains of the one-armed guerillero.

RHODES
His head stays where it is. He and I never 
really had the chance to get acquainted. 
When he comes back...I'll get another shot 
at it... Ha ha ha ha...

65	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY

CLOSE ON CHICO. He's dangling from A ROPE which is tied over a tall 
tree, his feet ten feet off the ground.

ZOMBIES wander here and there. They've all received their rations. 
The picnic is breaking up now. Occasionally one of them gets surly 
but it doesn't amount to anything. SOLDIERS stand ready with ELECTRIC 
PRODS, OTHERS with GUNS.

PARAPHERNALIA is being packed away. MEN CARRY EQUIPMENT in the 
direction of the elevator.

RHODES walks up beneath where CHICO is hanging. He's careful not to 
step in too close. He doesn't want to get any DRIPPING BLOOD on his 
uniform.

CHICO
Please....shoot me.

RHODES
And if I don't? If I don't you'll come back 
after your death. You'll come back and find 
yourself hanging there...wanting to 
eat...needing to eat human flesh. You hate 
that thought, don't you? That's the 
ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't 
it?

CHICO is weeping now. With a found spurt of energy he struggles 
against the rope. No use. It only brings pain.

RHODES
After hanging up there a few days you will 
be mad for food...crazed! You will lust for 
it! YOU WILL BE WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM!

CHICO
NO...NOOOOOOO...SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! 
SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!!

RHODES
I'll bargain with you. How many of you are 
on the island?

CHICO
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
(He nods towards MIGUEL'S CORPSE.)

RHODES
I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your 
headquarters? On the mainland?

CHICO
The mainland...is dead...a dead 
place...nobody there...

RHODES
Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me 
or I'll let you hang there 
forever...FOREVER!

CHICO
There are no...headquarters. There are 
no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't 
you see. They have won.

RHODES
Then why did you come here?

CHICO
To look...look for a place...a place to 
live in...an empty place...a... 
new...place...

RHODES
How did you know we were on this island? Do 
others know? Will others come?

CHICO
Nooooo. Believe me. There are no 
others...no rebels...nobody...it's 
over...it's ooooo....

The man collapses, unconscious.

66	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY

CLOSE ON THE DISEMBODIED HEAD OF ONE OF THE DEAD SOLDIERS. TRICKS is 
dropping the thing into A LARGE PLASTIC BAG which obviously already 
contains THE SECOND HEAD. TOBY wraps the mouth of the bag and begins 
to walk off. RHODES stops him.

RHODES
Where are you going, Tyler?

TOBY
My..."detail", sir. We're going to bury the 
heads.

RHODES
No time for that. I'll take care of them.

TOBY
Just....following procedure, sir. They're 
entitled to burial.

RHODES
I said, I'll take care of them. Just leave 
them there. Go help with the rest of the 
gear.

RHODES has it in for TOBY (we'll find out why later), and of course 
the feeling is mutual. TOBY sets the bag down on the ground and, 
seething, he trots off towards the rest of the platoon. TRICKS 
follows.

After a moment, RHODES motions with his head. THE SOLDIER WITH THE 
LONG NOOSE POLE steps into view with the CAPTIVE ZOMBIE, the one that 
ran amok earlier. The man follows RHODES towards the jungle, dragging 
the gurgling creature along, the wire noose digging into the thing's 
neck.

67	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

CLOSE: as RHODES' GLOVED HAND jams A HAND GRENADE into THE CAPTIVE 
ZOMBIE'S gaping mouth. THE SOLDIER WITH THE POLE releases the noose 
and the two men take off, running.

68	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY

They run to the middle of the clearing where they turn around to 
watch. RHODES lifts A PAIR OF BINOCULARS that are strapped around his 
neck. He stares through the lenses, focusing, grinning.

69	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

THROUGH THE BINOCULARS: We see THE ZOMBIE staggering in the bush, 
clawing desperately at the thing jammed in its mouth.

70	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY

TOBY AND TRICKS are the only ones who seem to notice what RHODES has 
done. TOBY drops THE CRATE he was going to carry off. He stares in 
disbelief, hatred on his face.

71	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

WIDE SHOT as THE HEAD OF THE ZOMBIE DISINTEGRATES WHEN THE GRENADE 
EXPLODES.

72	EXT.	THE CLEARING - DAY

RHODES grins as he watches the spectacle.

Suddenly, A LOUD GUNSHOT startles the captain. He drops the 
binoculars and spins around. He sees...

...CHICO'S BODY DANGLING ON THE ROPE. CHICO'S HEAD IS BLOODY. He's 
dead...and won't come back to life. He's been shot through the brain.

RHODES
WHO FIRED THAT SHOT? WHO FIRED THAT SHOT?

SOLDIERS stand around dumbly. Those with RIFLES in their hands 
quickly sling them onto their shoulders. They're all afraid of the 
captain's wrath. RHODES walks towards the line of men with fury in 
his eyes.

RHODES
Goddammit, somebody's gonna tell me who 
fired that shot or I'll have every last one 
of you chopped up for feed!!!

His eyes spot TOBY, standing behind the crate he dropped earlier, his 
rifle slung.

RHODES
Step up here, Tyler.

TOBY
Sir!

TOBY shouts the word like a West Point cadet and he bravely steps 
forward. RHODES stares him down, his anger turning sinister.

RHODES
You fired that shot, didn't you?

TOBY
No, sir.

RHODES
Let me see your weapon.

TOBY hands over his rifle. RHODES feels the barrel, sniffs it.

RHODES
It's been fired.

TOBY
In the battle, sir.

RHODES is sure he's found the guilty man and he's glad it turned out 
to be his favourite whipping boy. His body relaxes visibly.

RHODES
It may be that none of these chicken-shits 
will talk while the whole troop is 
present...but I know some of these men 
well. I'm sure that a few private 
conversations will tell me what I already 
know. You may have earned yourself some 
time in the Stalag, Tyler.
(Rhodes glances over at CHICO'S body)
Cut him down. That's another head for you 
to chop off. Leave it with the others. Take 
the rest of his body down to the freezers. 
Move it, shit hill.

TOBY moves off. RHODES' grin returns.

CUT TO:

73	INT. THE CAVE ENTRANCE - EVENING

There's that GIANT SOUND again, the RUMBLE OF THE ELEVATOR. We're 
inside the place called THE CAVE, in a huge under-ground concrete 
bunker. TECHNICIANS AND ARMED GUARDS bustle around. Enormous 
hydraulic pistons are bringing the camouflaged iron plate down from 
the surface. Riding on board, RHODES AND HIS PLATOON prepare to 
unload their paraphernalia.

74	EXT. THE JUNGLE - EVENING

SARAH, sweating, exhausted, BLEEDING FROM CUTS made by jungle 
branches, wrings out a piece of cloth torn from her sleeve. She has 
dipped it into a jungle stream. Cautiously she tastes the water, 
decides to chance it and squeezes the cloth into her mouth.

The NIGHT BIRDS suddenly stop their singing and the quiet makes SARAH 
look up. Standing across the stream, only ten feet away, is A 
PARTICULARLY GROTESQUE ZOMBIE. VULTURES stand on the marshy ground 
beside the creature's legs, THEIR SHARP BEAKS PICKING BLOODY HOLES IN 
ITS ANKLES AND FEET.

SARAH jumps to her feet, fighting back exhaustion one more time. She 
unslings her RIFLE, aims it, then thinks better of firing. Grabbing 
up her SUPPLY PACK she runs into the darkening jungle.

75	EXT.	THE JUNGLE - EVENING

WHAM! TWO BIG HANDS GRAB SARAH by her shoulders. She starts to scream 
but one of those hands shoots up to cover her mouth.

JOHN
It's alright. It's alright. Don't be 
afraid. We're friends.

SARAH looks into the strong, good face of JOHN, a tall muscular man, 
a Caribbean Islander with shiny black skin and enormous brown eyes 
that seem instantly trustworthy.

JOHN
There are soldiers near here. Guards. I'll 
take my hand away if you won't scream.

SARAH nods and JOHN lets her go. There are two other humans standing 
behind the big man. There's BILL McDERMOTT, wearing the grease-
covered jump-suit of a mechanic and swilling generous shots of brandy 
from a hip flask, and there's a smallish woman with a sensitive face 
who, apparently out of character, is armed to the teeth. She's a deaf 
mute, nicknamed SPIDER, and she is urgently signing "Come on! Let's 
get outa here!" with her hands.

JOHN
Right. We better get away from that Bee. He 
might have friends.

THE GROUP starts moving. SARAH follows voluntarily. We notice that 
all three strangers are wearing the same pullover vests that we saw 
on the foot soldiers, the ones with big orange circles.

76	EXT. THE JUNGLE - EVENING

THE GROUP trudges through thick brushland, occasionally needing to 
chop a path with their blades. JOHN speaks in low tones as they move.

JOHN
Bees. That's what we call the dead... the 
walking dead...here on Gasparilla's island.

 SARAH
Gasparilla?

JOHN
He was a pirate who sailed these waters 
long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these 
days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.

SARAH
Governor Dickerson? Of Florida?

JOHN
That's the man. He's been holed up here 
ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and 
his family owned these islands 'round here. 
They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The 
whole underneath is dug out. There was 
missiles here and laboratories and bomb 
proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. 
Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... 
private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his 
cronies from all the best golf courses in 
Tallahassee...and his private army, of 
course.

SARAH
We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. 
There were actually walking dead...in 
uniform...with guns.

JOHN
Captain Rhodes and his Red Coat Bees. They 
could sting, sister. We know you came up 
against 'em. We been watchin' you since you 
landed. Couldn't help. I'm sorry for that. 
We ain't supposed to be outside. If we was 
spotted it could....well, it could be the 
end of everything.

SPIDER is signing for everyone to be quiet. They all stop in their 
tracks. BILL McDERMOTT swigs some more brandy. With the stealth of a 
Mohican SPIDER pushes aside the branches of a giant oleander and 
peers through.

77	EXT. ENTRANCE TWO - EVENING

There's A HATCHWAY in sight built into A CONCRETE, BUNKER LIKE 
STRUCTURE. FOUR OR FIVE SOLDIERS are coming up out of the ground. 
They're armed with PRODS AND RIFLES.

Behind the men, lurching on unsteady feet, come A HALF-DOZEN OF THE 
LIVING DEAD, all wearing vests of white and blue.

Behind the lumbering creatures come A WOMAN AND A MAN both wearing 
white laboratory coats and carrying clipboards. The woman is MARY 
HENRIED, one of the top behaviouralists in The Cave. (We'll learn a 
lot more about her later.)

THE ZOMBIES are pushing through the undergrowth right in the 
direction of SARAH and her friends. SARAH shows some alarm at this 
but JOHN calms her with a strong hand.

SPIDER has seen the approaching danger. She silently draws A FARMER'S 
SICKLE from her belt. (With her other hand she draws A PISTOL for 
good measure.) BILL McDERMOTT unarmed, nervously takes another 
swallow from his flask.

THE ZOMBIES are getting closer. Too close for comfort.

Finally, MARY HENRIED and THE OTHERS turn and disappear into the 
bunker. The last man down pulls the hatch shut.

The moment the coast is clear, SPIDER AND JOHN jump up from cover. 
THE OTHERS follow their lead. But it's too late. THE ZOMBIES have 
spotted them. The creatures begin to growl and make AGITATED, APE-
LIKE SOUNDS. SPIDER brings her BLADE up chest-high, ready to repel an 
attack. SARAH lifts her own MACHETE but JOHN reaches over and takes 
it away from her.

JOHN
Give that to me. Get behind me. Stay behind 
me.

(SARAH resists, not understanding, somewhat 
insulted.)

You ain't wearin' a vest. They been taught 
not to touch the ones with the circles. 
There ain't no hundred percent, all-a-time 
rules with the Bees, but most-a-time they 
leave us alone. The colour on their vests 
tell ya how much schoolin' they got. It's 
the ones without colours you gotta watch 
out for.

SARAH gets behind JOHN, his orange circle acting as her shield. He 
reaches around with one strong arm and pulls her in tight against his 
back.

THE ZOMBIES, snarling and showing teeth, move through the thicket. 
ONE shuffles right past SPIDER AND McDERMOTT. It gets stuck in the 
bramble, changes course and moves on without attacking.

ANOTHER ZOMBIE, a "white", trudges within arm's reach of JOHN, 
growling all the while. Suddenly it reaches its arms out and takes 
two angry steps towards the humans who back away.

THE ZOMBIES charges. Things happen quickly. JOHN pushes SARAH away 
and swings the MACHETE. THE BLADE SINKS INTO THE CREATURES SKULL. 
BLACKENED BLOOD FLIES. An instant later SPIDER'S SICKLE PUNCHES IN 
BESIDE THE BIG KNIFE. THE ZOMBIE twitches for a moment, its eyes 
rolling, then it falls, lifeless, to the ground.

McDERMOTT trots up beside SARAH. He takes a huge swallow from his 
flask then offers some to her. She puts the flask to her lips but 
nothing comes. She holds it out, neck down, to show that it's empty.

McDERMOTT
Sorry. Guess I don't know my own strength.

JOHN wipes SARAH'S MACHETE on some thick leaves, cleaning off most of 
the gore, then he returns the weapon to the woman.

SARAH
Thanks. I can fight my own battles.

JOHN
I know you can. Like I said, we been 
watchin' you.

McDERMOTT
We better get as far away from here as we 
can. We can work the other side of the 
island tonight.

JOHN
(explaining) We found nine entrances to the 
Cave so far, and we ain't got the whole 
thing near charted yet. That's what we was 
doin' out here today. Huntin' for 
entrances.

McDERMOTT
Come on. They find a Bee done like this and 
they'll know somebody's been out walkin' 
where they shouldn't have been.

JOHN bows his head over the downed ZOMBIE. He mumbles softly. We 
can't hear the words but we can tell that he's praying, reciting the 
good words over the corpse of the "white-coat".

SARAH
The man I was with...until today... 
believed that praying was for blind men who 
couldn't see the truth.

JOHN
How we gonna break the curse without a 
prayer or two.

SARAH
Curse?

JOHN
What is it if it ain't a curse?

SARAH
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite 
that infects the brain.

JOHN
That sounds like a curse to me.

SARAH
We thought we were escaping here. We 
thought we'd found an uninhabited island. 
Christ! This place is a worse nightmare 
than anything I've seen yet!

JOHN
I'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why 
we're doin' what we're doin'. What's 
happenin' underground here is just what 
Lucifer planned for this sinful race o' 
man. But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're 
gonna put an end to what's happenin' here.

SARAH
Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus 
nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a 
bullet from one of those storm troopers and 
prayer won't keep one of those monsters 
from eatin' your liver for lunch.

JOHN
That's why we didn't use prayers on this 
here white coat 'til after he was 
destroyed. We ready to fight when we have 
to. And we gotta fight now.

SARAH
Look. I BEEN fightin', mister. I been 
fightin' for what feels like a hundred 
years and I'm finished. I don't need 
religion. I don't need prayers. I need a 
couple guns and a couple hands. We can sail 
on outa here. Find another island where 
there ain't so much....traffic.

JOHN
You think you can find your boat? There's a 
thousand little inlets and backwaters all 
through here. You remember all the ways you 
turned to get where you are now? You leave 
yourself a trail?

SARAH is stopped by this. She stares at the big man suspiciously, not 
sure whether to believe him.

JOHN
We didn't see the exact spot but we know 
about where you landed. But we ain't ready 
to take you there. Not yet. You see...we 
need guns, too.

SARAH looks around her at the unlikely band of guerillas. She thinks 
for a moment...not very long...then she turns and starts off into the 
jungle.

SARAH
I can find it myself. I didn't come that 
far.

JOHN
Farther than you think. You'll get lost. 
You will. And there's Bees all through the 
jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos 
don't lie.

SARAH
No. They just try to hold you for ransom. 
Fuck you, Moses! I'm outa here!

SARAH plunges into the brush and without so much as a look back over 
her shoulder she disappears.

McDERMOTT
We can't let her go, John.

JOHN
We don't need her guns that bad. Billy boy. 
(He's joking.)

McDERMOTT
The hell we don't! But that's not what I 
mean. She'll be dead in ten minutes out 
there alone. That or she'll be firin' off 
her automatics and wakin' up the troops.

JOHN
We'll split up. Billy, you go with Spider. 
Just an hour or two tonight, that's all. 
Rhodes might have extra guards on after all 
the commotion. We'll meet up at number six 
and go back home together.

McDERMOTT
God save us. And me with me flask dry. I'll 
never make it.

THE GROUP splits up, moving off in two different directions through 
the darkening underbrush.

78	EXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE JUNGLE - NIGHT

DARKNESS has fallen. The jungle is as black as the background on a 
velvet painting.

SARAH is moving cautiously. She bumps into something, jumps back, her 
MACHETE high, and freezes. Cautiously she moves ahead...one 
step...another...another...

SPLASH!!! She steps down off a hidden ledge into A KNEE-DEEP RIVER. 
She manages to keep her balance but her MACHETE falls into the water 
and drops to the bottom invisible in the dark silt. Slowly she bends 
down and reaches into the water. A SNAKE swims past just inches away. 
SARAH recoils. Before she can reach down again she hears A LOUD, 
ANIMAL SNORT followed by A GREAT SPLASHING SOUND. Then ANOTHER. She 
squints to see.

SHAPES approach on the black water. ALLIGATORS, big ones, just their 
very tops showing as they move on a straight course toward the woman.

She backs up feeling for the shore, for the ledge behind her. THE 
FIRST ZOMBIE GRABS HER SHOULDERS. She spins and sees the thing. It 
has one eye dangling out of its socket and there's a broken-off 
length of wooden pole stuck clean through its torso just under the 
left breast.

SARAH smashes her RIFLE BUTT INTO THE THING'S HEAD. AGAIN. AGAIN. It 
keeps coming. (So do the gators. They're getting to within a few 
yards.) SARAH swings a fourth time. THE ZOMBIE grabs her rifle. She 
pulls with all her might and the creature, hanging on to the gun, 
topples off the ledge and into the water.

When SARAH starts to climb up on the ledge, ANOTHER ZOMBIE lurches 
towards her from dry land. She spins around, looking for options. The 
gators are just about close enough to bite her ass and THE ZOMBIE 
that fell into the river is rising up again, covered with moss and 
slime and looking pissed.

SARAH faces THE ZOMBIE on the bank. She has no choice. She aims her 
AUTOMATIC. She's just about to fire when SOMETHING FLASHES out of the 
darkness. It's A MACHETE. IT CLEAVES OPEN THE ZOMBIE'S SKULL. From 
out of the night big JOHN appears. He struggles to free his blade 
from the dead creature's head.

SARAH scrambles up onto the muddy ledge. THE GATORS are still moving 
in and THE ZOMBIE, its moss-covered arms reaching out rigidly like 
the arms of Frankenstein's monster, is growling ferociously (almost 
swallowing its own dangling eyeball in the process).

SARAH
Are you gonna pause to say words over the 
dead this time or can we be on our way?

Without answering, JOHN steams off through the bush pulling SARAH 
along behind him, his big hand tight around her arm.

79	INT. THE CAVE - NIGHT

CLOSE on: A TELEVISION SCREEN. First there is only VIDEO NOISE, then 
an image blinks onto the screen.

MONTAGE: OTHER VIDEO SCREENS on MONITORS in various places throughout 
the huge underground facility. ZOMBIES watch the screens gathered in 
groups of four, six and eight, like children in ranked classes.

The screens show scenes of ZOMBIES taking FOOD from humans in ORANGE 
CIRCLE VESTS. GUNS are pointed at ORANGE CIRCLES then lowered 
harmlessly. GUNS are pointed at HUMANS without orange circles and 
FIRED. The images repeat and repeat and repeat. THE ZOMBIES watch the 
scenes with dumb curiosity.

80	INT. COMMUNICATION CENTER IN THE CAVE - NIGHT

This is the central area for all varieties of communication. There 
are RADIO CONSOLES, both intercom and outgoing, there are VIDEO 
CONTROL PANELS and there are LARGE COMPUTER TERMINALS. Reflecting the 
panic to set up operations back when the disaster first struck, much 
of the equipment is placed haphazardly and not built in. WIRES run 
every which way, BARE ANTENNAS AND LOOSE CONNECTORS clutter the 
place. ENGINEERS scurry with TOOL BOXES constantly repairing, 
patching, trouble shooting.

Most of the personnel are TECHNICIANS but there is a group of 
SCIENTIFIC TYPES, obvious in their white lab coats. Among these is 
MARY HENRIED, who we caught a glimpse of outside Entrance Two.

At A SECURITY STATION, A GUARD notices something on one of his own 
VIDEO SCREENS which monitor key locations inside The Cave.

GUARD
There's activity in the dormitory!

MARY and one of her assistants, JULIE GRANT, a younger girl, move 
over to the video console. ONE SCREEN there shows what looks like a 
prison corridor. CELLS WITH HEAVILY BARRED DOORS run down both sides. 
We can see the distinct MOVEMENT OF SHADOWS in the corridor. MARY 
reacts instantly stepping over to AN INTERCOM and pressing A SEND-
BUTTON.

VOICE (o.s. - filter)
Gate twenty-three.

MARY
This is Mary Henried. Did anyone enter the 
dormitory?

VOICE (o.s. - filter)
Yes, ma'm. Captain Rhodes.

MARY clicks off, infuriated. She hurries towards AN EXIT followed by 
JULIE GRANT.

81	INT. THE DORMITORY IN THE CAVE - NIGHT

CLOSE ON: THE MOUTH OF A LARGE PLASTIC BAG. A HAND wearing A BLACK 
LEATHER GLOVE pulls A HUMAN HEAD out of a bag by its hair. It's the 
head of one of the dead soldiers from Rhode's platoon. The hand 
belongs to RHODES himself.

In the darkness of A CELL, A RED COAT ZOMBIES takes a hesitant step 
forward. RHODES tries to shove THE HEAD through the bars but IT 
STICKS. When RHODES lets go it stays there, wedged at shoulder 
height.

RHODES
Take it, friend. Take it. It's a present. 
From me to you.

THE RED COAT steps forward and lays its hand on THE HEAD.

RHODES
Just remember who gives you favours.

THE ZOMBIE pulls hard and THE HEAD pops through onto its side of the 
bars. The creature lurches off towards A COT in the shadows at the 
rear of the cell where it hunkers down and begins to RAVISH THE HEAD, 
TEARING FLESH OFF, EATING IT hungrily.

On the cell door we notice A PLAQUE with a number (5) and, written in 
marker, the Red Coat's nickname, "BLUTO".

RHODES moves past OTHER CELLS, each holding A NICKNAMED RED COAT. 
GRUMPY stands way back in the shadows. TONTO stands near the bars, 
growling. FATSO is swaying back and forth like a chubby five year old 
who needs to pee.

RHODES stops at A CELL marked "BUB!". Inside we see A SILHOUETTE, 
tall, erect, not moving a muscle. RHODES grins.

RHODES
Well, Bub. I've heard about you. Miss 
Henried's pride and joy.

RHODES steps closer and BUB snarls warningly.

RHODES
Surly sonofabitch. I want to make friends, 
Bub. Friends. I have one more goodie in my 
sack here.

A LOUD, CLANGING SOUND interrupts. RHODES turns to see.

82	INT. THE DORMITORY - NIGHT

MARY HENRIED AND JULIE GRANT have entered through A STEEL DOOR WITH 
ELECTRONIC LOCKS. THE ZOMBIES send up A CHORUS OF MOANS AND GROWLS. 
The women start down the corridor checking cells as they pass. 
Suddenly they stop in their tracks, their horrified eyes staring into 
A CELL marked "SAMSON!".

SAMSON is nibbling on ANOTHER HEAD. Much of the flesh is already 
gone, but we can still recognise...CHICO. The zombie turns the thing 
up-side-down, reaches way inside, through the neck, and pulls out 
grey matter.

JULIE backs away, fighting nausea. A spasm rises in MARY'S stomach as 
well and she reels away from the hideous sight.

RHODES
Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen 
worse.

MARY
God....damn you, Rhodes!

RHODES
God has damned us all. Are my atrocities 
worse than yours?

MARY
You have ruined weeks of work here! We've 
been trying to wean these specimens onto 
alligator meat!

RHODES
No wonder they're so....hungry.

Suddenly JULIE SCREAMS, her hands flying to her mouth.

THE PLASTIC BAG is still dangling from RHODES' GLOVED HAND. Inside, 
pressed into the thin plastic, we can see the rough outline of THE 
FINAL HEAD. THE THING IS SQUIRMING causing the whole bag to wiggle.

RHODES drops the bag instantly to the floor. Taking care, he grabs 
the bottom by a loose corner and pulls up hard. THE HEAD ROLLS OUT 
AND SETTLES AGAINST A WALL. IT'S EYES ARE OPEN AND DARTING CRAZILY, 
ITS MOUTH IS CHEWING, GROTESQUELY, ON THE AIR.

MARY stares in shock. JULIE runs towards the exit, trying to scream 
but gagging on her own acids. She's hysterical.

RHODES calmly draws his PISTOL, cocks, and FIRES. THE SQUIRMING HEAD 
IS SHATTERED by the powerful bullet.

83	INT. MARY'S OFFICE IN THE CAVE - NIGHT

A 9 BY 12 CUBICLE with A SMALL COMPUTER TERMINAL, A DESK AND THREE 
CHAIRS. There's A LIGHTBOX on the wall displaying GROUPS OF CRANIAL 
X-RAYS.

MARY guides JULIE GRANT into a chair. RHODES stands cockily in the 
open doorway.

JULIE
I didn't realise! Those were de-caps! I 
didn't know that....de-caps... revived!

RHODES
Any dead whose brains are intact will 
revive.

JULIE
But...we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must 
be torture for them!

RHODES
They are brutes without feeling. Though I 
admit that I've requested cremation for 
myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, 
even more ridiculous now than it ever was. 
To say nothing of the...spacing 
problem...on a small island like this.

JULIE
I thought the purpose of decapitation was 
to...to...

RHODES
The purpose of decapitation is to preserve 
as much...food...as possible. The purpose 
for feeding is to keep the beasts on our 
side. The fact that they can be taught to 
clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a 
convenient side benefit, not the primary 
goal. The primary goal is to keep ourselves 
from becoming their supper. Keep them fed 
and they behave. Keep them hungry and they 
revert back to being the animals that they 
have always been. You saw them in there.

MARY
You gave them a fresh taste of blood!

RHODES
They will never be satisfied with anything 
else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh. 
I'm prepared to take whatever steps are 
necessary to see to it they don't get mine! 
Not while I'm still using it!

JULIE has calmed herself down. Now she feels angry, betrayed. She 
looks at MARY accusingly.

JULIE
Did you know? About the de-caps?

MARY
I'd never seen it before.

JULIE
But you knew.

MARY nods in the affirmative. Tears form in JULIE'S eyes.

JULIE
What else is there, doctor? What else do 
you people know that the rest of us don't?

They stare at one another. Whatever bond once existed between them 
has been severed forever.

84	INT. A CONDITIONING ROOM IN THE CAVE - NIGHT

There are CARDIOGRAPHS, E.E.G. MONITORS, AND ALL SORT OF PHYSICAL 
CONDITIONING DEVICES. On TABLES lie SYMBOLOGY CARDS AND COLOURED 
BLOCKS for dexterity testing. There are LARGE CUT-OUT SHAPES on the 
walls, TRIANGLES, SQUARES and familiar ORANGE CIRCLES.

MARY storms into the room flinging the door shut behind her. RHODES 
catches it with his BLACK LEATHER GESTAPO BOOT.

RHODES
You can't run away from the planet, Miss 
Science. You can't even run away from the 
island, heh heh.

MARY
Leave me alone, you...COCKSUCKER!!!

RHODES laughs loudly. MARY faces him, hatred boiling away her 
vocabulary. She can't think of word that are adequate.

MARY
You're....you're disgusting! 
You're....FILTH!

RHODES
And you're the one who builds the bomb and 
they says, 'I hope it'll never actually be 
used'.

MARY is stopped...by her own guilt. She turns and busies herself 
gathering books and papers, then she CLICKS OFF A LIGHT and moves 
toward the doorway where RHODES stands.

MARY
(calmer, with method) Julie Grant is a 
behaviouralist. She's not medical. She 
hasn't been as...exposed to...to 
things...as some of the rest of us. She'll 
be alright. I'll talk to her. She'll be 
alright.

RHODES
Oh, I have no doubt.

MARY
(recognising threat in his voice) If you 
put her on the shit list because of her 
reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.

RHODES
Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to 
favour you lately. I understand he assigned 
you a roommate of your choice. The rest of 
us have to pick names out of a hat. 

MARY
(reading his jealousy) Rhodes, you and I 
had a roll in the hay together when I first 
got here. It was a wholly unsatisfying 
experience which I do not want to, and 
which I never will repeat! So give up, 
mister! I'm going home...to that roommate 
you mentioned.

MARY pushes past RHODES into the hallway.

85	INT. THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE CONDITIONING ROOM - NIGHT

MARY starts down the hall but RHODES grabs her from behind. He leans 
in close, lusting, pressing his lips against the back of her neck.

MARY
Take your hands off me! Right now!

An evil grin returns to RHODES' flushed face. He stares at the woman 
for a long moment, then he lets go. MARY walks away, bristling. 
RHODES calls after her.

RHODES
Maybe you'll change your mind when it 
starts getting too lonely for you.

MARY stops dead. She turns back to see him gloating.

RHODES
I'm not entirely without influence myself, 
Miss Science. I had your roommate 
assigned...by Gasparilla... to my platoon. 
What's his name? Tyler? Yes. Toby Tyler.

A bubble of fear pushes up in MARY'S throat but she is only letting 
her anger show. Her stare is fierce, her eyes daggers.

RHODES
I had an unfortunate little run-in with him 
today. In fact...you might say that Mr. 
Tyler is in big trouble with 
the...authorities.

MARY
You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd 
love to serve your balls to those Red Coats 
for lunch! Think about it!

RHODES
No, Miss Science. You're the one who needs 
to do some thinking.

He turns and walks away. MARY stands still for a time, THE SOUND OF 
RHODES' CLICKING BOOTHEELS surrounding her, swallowing her. In the 
DEEP BACKGROUND we can HEAR THE MOANS OF THE CAGED DEAD.

86	INT. THE CENTRAL CHAMBERS OF THE CAVE - NIGHT

MONTAGE: as MARY walks through HUGE OPEN AREAS CARVED OUT OF NATURAL 
ROCK. We are stunned at the enormity of the place. JEEPS AND TRUCKS 
RUMBLE back and forth. Storage areas hold MOUNTAINS OF CRATES, 
CARTONS, WATER AND GAS CANISTERS. FORK LIFTS shift loads from here to 
there.

MARY comes to a place where the natural rock surrenders to man-made 
walls. She enters past TWO SECURITY GUARDS, showing her I.D.

87	INT. THE RESIDENCE - NIGHT

MARY moves down A CORRIDOR with NUMBERED DOORS on both sides. We HEAR 
THE SOUND OF LIFE, MUSIC BLASTING, VOICES LAUGHING, ARGUING, CRYING. 
PEOPLE move by. A MAN AND A WOMAN are fighting. She slaps him, he 
punches her, she kicks him in the balls. THREE HOOKERS pound on a 
door. The door is opened by A NAKED MAN WEARING A DILDO on his nose. 
OTHER MEN, behind him, laugh wildly as the hookers enter their smoke-
filled room.

MARY stops in her tracks when she sees that outside A DOOR NUMBERED 
83 (the door to her quarters) there are TWO OF RHODES' SOLDIERS with 
RIFLES in hand. The door itself is open and SHADOWS move inside.

MARY turns quickly, before she is spotted, and starts back through 
the hallway. As she turns a corner she is grabbed by TOBY TYLER.

MARY
Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find 
out what's goin' on.

TOBY
Hey. Slow down. What is it?

MARY
Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.

TOBY
That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his 
move so fast.

MARY
It's because of me.

TOBY
Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is 
a prick.

MARY
I want you to leave. Then maybe...

TOBY
We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. 
I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we 
can smuggle out one of those inflatable 
rafts. They're crated up real small. 
They've got air canisters. There's food 
inside. Even a little motor.

MARY
I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm 
not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong 
that way. I need...

TOBY
Need what? Civilised order like we have 
down here? Christ!

MARY
I can work here. Maybe my work can 
help...help everyone. I can do more good 
with access to this equipment than I can 
off in some wasteland.

TOBY
For the good of mankind. That's what every 
monster-maker says.

MARY looks into TOBY'S eyes. She's hurt, yet angry. The kind of anger 
that comes involuntarily when somebody strikes an already sensitive 
guilt-nerve.

TOBY
We're gettin' out. Me and Tricks. I want 
you to come with us. I want that more than 
anything. I'll send word. I'll let you know 
a time and a place to meet. We probably 
won't be able to wait around so if you're 
not there on the dot...well...if you're not 
there, I'll know you're not comin'.

She grabs him, holding him tightly against her. They kiss, hard and 
long. TOBY pulls away, looks at her lovingly, then turns and starts 
toward the guarded apartment. MARY follows.

TOBY
(walking) I don't know what they're gonna 
do to me. I figure they'll just send me out 
to Stalag Seventeen but if...if it's worse 
than that...Tricks will know. Stay in touch 
with Tricks.

As they approach the door to number 83, THE SOLDIERS there raise 
their RIFLE to ready positions.

SOLDIER
You Tyler?

TOBY
Yes.

SOLDIER
You're under arrest. I'll take your weapon.

TOBY hands over his RIFLE and begins to unbuckle his PISTOL BELT. TWO 
MORE SOLDIERS appear from inside the open apartment.

MARY
What's he supposed to have done? What are 
the charges?

SOLDIER
Dunno, ma'm. We're on orders.

MARY
Look...I'm Mary Henried. I'm with the 
special conditioning center. I'm not 
without influence...

TOBY
(calmly) Mary.

MARY
I'll have somebody's ass for this. I'll 
have your ass, soldier. I'm not gonna stand 
here and...

TOBY
(more insistent) MARY!

She gives up. She looks into TOBY'S eyes.

TOBY
I'll be alright. Just remember the things I 
said. Take care of yourself.

THE SOLDIERS escort TOBY down the hall without force. MARY watches 
their backs for a time, then she flings her BOOKS AND PAPERS angrily 
into the open apartment. She begins to cry.

88	EXT. ENTRANCE NUMBER SIX - NIGHT

HATCHWAY NUMBER SIX is surrounded by PROTECTIVE FENCING and, from it, 
A FENCED ALLEYWAY runs off through the brush toward...we don't know 
what yet.

THE HATCH OPENS and TOBY, along with TWO OTHER PRISONERS, also 
disarmed troopers, is led down that alleyway by THREE GUARDS.

JOHN, SARAH AND BILL McDERMOTT peer out from nearby foliage. They 
watch the procession. John whispers.

JOHN
The fences make a safe pathway to Stalag 
Seventeen. That's where we live. That's 
where you gonna live, too. Hell's half 
acre. It's not a nice place. Them boys 
there is prisoners. What's their 
punishment? They sent out to the Stalag for 
a few weeks. That's punishment enough.

SPIDER seems to appear from nowhere. She motions and the others 
follow her through the thick jungle.

89	EXT. ENTRANCE TO STALAG SEVENTEEN - NIGHT

THE RUNNING FENCE LEADS TO A GATE IN A BIGGER FENCE. This one is 
ELECTRIFIED. We know this because we see A COLLECTION OF ZOMBIES, 
mostly "civilians" with no vests, clambering there, HANDS AND FACES 
SPARKING WHEN THEY TOUCH THE CHAIN LINKS.

THE ZOMBIES send up wild MOANS AND GURGLES when TOBY AND THE OTHER 
PRISONERS are led through the gate.

Inside the compound is A SCATTERING OF OPEN-SIDED MILITARY TENT-
BUILDINGS, resembling those on M*A*S*H. There's A DIN coming off the 
place, a mixture of MUSIC AND VOICES that forms a disturbed blanket 
of noise. The place seems to seethe like a hornets' next.

THE SOLDIERS head back for The Cave as POSTED GUARDS shut the gate 
behind THE PRISONERS. TOBY and the other captives move toward the 
"village".

90	EXT. STALAG SEVENTEEN MAIN STREET - NIGHT

PEOPLE wallow in the mud. ONE MAN has just taken a shit and is wiping 
his ass. Nearby A DRUNK lies unconscious. SEVERAL MEN are fighting. 
It's a brutal fight with BOTTLES AND PIPES AND LENGTHS OF CHAIN. The 
men are really hurting each other. PEOPLE SMOKE AND SNORT AND SHOOT 
UP in wide open disarray.

A HUGE PREGNANT WOMAN plants herself right in TOBY'S path.

PREGNANT WOMAN
How 'bout it, baby. I'm big but I'm 
beautiful.

TOBY pushes past her and bumps into A SURLY DRUNK.

DRUNK
HEY, YOU FUCK! YOU FUCK!

He grabs TOBY and flings him violently against an upright on one of 
the long huts. THE OTHER TWO PRISONERS move on, abandoning TOBY, 
disappearing into the crowd. THE DRUNK pulls A RUSTED, HOME-MADE 
KNIFE.

DRUNK
I OUGHTA SLICE YOU UP, YOU FUCK! YOU CAN'T 
PUSH ME AROUND LIKE... PUSH ME 
AROUND...LIKE...

Suddenly VOMIT rises in the man's throat and he doubles over. TOBY is 
aware of SOUNDS behind him. At his back, in the hut, A HAIRY FAT MAN, 
still wearing his boxer shorts and his muddy boots, is wham-bam-
bamming A WHORE, who is wearing everything but underwear and boots. 
There are needle tracks on the woman's arms and her face looks as 
though she's been beaten brutally. She purses her deep red, damaged 
lips and blows TOBY a kiss that's meant to be seductive.

TOBY moves on down the street. The place is a cesspool full of human 
dregs, stinking with refuse, filled with the fury and desperation of 
man in his last days.

91	EXT. ENTRANCE TO STALAG SEVENTEEN - NIGHT

JOHN leads his followers to within sight of the Stalag gates. ZOMBIES 
still claw at the ELECTRIFIED FENCE. BLUE-WHITE SPARKS fill the air 
like flashbulbs.

JOHN
This is home, darlin'. Home for us that 
don't make the grade. Us that ain't...good 
enough to live inside The Cave. We grow a 
little food, do a little light 
manufacturin'...like these here vests, we 
make these for the massers. We live in our 
own filth, with bugs and snakes and disease 
and jungle fever...all the time waitin' to 
become breakfast for the Bees.

JOHN is doing a sales job on SARAH but everything he says is truth. 
She hears it all, softening to JOHN'S cause.

SPIDER has silently lifted A LARGE WOODEN ROUND out of the weeds. 
It's a camouflaged tunnel entrance.

JOHN
It's a tunnel. It's a couple hundred yards. 
Just keep goin' 'til you reach the end. 
I'll be right behind you.

SARAH starts down into the hole. JOHN and the others prepare to 
follow. JUNGLE SOUNDS cover the noises they make.

92	INT. THE HOSPITAL IN STALAG SEVENTEEN - NIGHT

We see ROWS OF HOME-MADE COTS, each with A BODY lying on top. What 
faces we see are gaunt, showing the boils and lesions of consumptive 
diseases and tropical fever. INSECTS BUZZ and there is THUNDER in the 
air.

An Oriental orderly, LUKEY, moves through the maze of bodies. He 
lifts the wrist of A WOMAN WHO LOOKS DEAD and he discovers that she 
is dead indeed. He hurries off.

93	INT. HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

This is a room with walls, an operating room with JURY-RIGGED 
APPOINTMENTS. On A TABLE, under A HALF-DOZEN LIGHT BULBS, lies A 
CORPSE. Another orderly, a Nordic type names DIESEL, an enormous man, 
assists while DOCTOR LOGAN methodically SAWS OFF THE CORPSE'S HEAD.

LUKEY rushes in out of breath.

LUKEY
Doc Logan! Doc Logan! Dere's a lady dead 
out dere! Gotta hurry! Gotta hurry! Dunno 
how long she been dat way! Maybe she 
gettin' ready to come back.

THE CORPSE'S HEAD ROLLS AWAY FROM ITS BODY. DOC LOGAN picks up AN 
ELECTRIC DRILL WITH A LONG BIT. WHZZZZZZZZZ! HE DRIVES THE SPINNING 
BIT INTO THE DISEMBODIED HEAD, DEEP INTO ITS BRAIN. When he pulls it 
out, MATTER FLIES as the motor winds down.

LOGAN is a middle aged man. He looks exhausted, demoralised, a bit 
mad. And he looks as ill as some of his patients. There are OPEN 
SORES on his face and he hasn't shaved for days. He's covered with 
two week worth of BLOOD STAINS. He starts around the table leaving 
DIESEL to dispose of the "DE-CAP".

LOGAN
Bury the head. Call the guard for the rest. 
Get it off the table for now. We'll bring 
this new one in.

DIESEL doesn't respond right away. He's heard something.

LOGAN
What is it?

DIESEL
The tunnel.

LOGAN hears it now, A SCRATCHING, SCUFFLING SOUND. He looks at his 
watch.

LOGAN
God. It's almost sun-up.

LOGAN AND LUKEY move to a spot at the back of the room. They remove 
SEVERAL OF THE PLANKS in the floor. SARAH'S head pops out, gasping 
for air. Logan recoils, his eyes wide and frightened.

LOGAN
Who are you? Who are you?

He stands up too quickly. Dizziness makes him reel. He smashes into 
AN INSTRUMENT CART, comes up with A LONG-BLADED SCALPEL and holds the 
thing threateningly aimed at the stranger.

JOHN
It's OK. It's OK, Doc. She's with us.

In the next moment, SARAH and the others climb out of the tunnel.

JOHN
This here's the hospital. That's Diesel 
over there, the big guy. This here's Lukey 
and that's Doc Logan who's about to cut 
your tonsils out.

SPIDER, the last one to climb into the room, quickly begins 
collecting WEAPONS, what few the rebels have.

JOHN
This here's all the weapons we got. That's 
why your fancy automatic looks so good to 
us. We gotta stick it over here with the 
others for now. They catch us with any kind 
o' weapon and its death without even askin' 
your name.

SARAH lets SPIDER take her GUN. The deaf mute signs something which 
SARAH can't decipher.

JOHN
Ammunition. You got ammunition in your pack 
there? I hope you do or the gun ain't worth 
much.

SARAH roots through her SUPPLY PACK and produces THREE LOADED CLIPS 
AND SEVERAL BOXES OF LOOSE SHELLS. JOHN notices SOME TINS OF FOOD, 
MEDICINES, A KNIFE, A COMPASS...

JOHN
We better just hide the whole pack, 
darlin'. That stuff is just shoutin' out 
that it come from the mainland. The shit we 
get is all C.D. rations. Aspirins and 
crackers from 1958.

SPIDER snatches THE PACK away rather roughly. SARAH is a little 
disturbed by the action. THE MATERIAL is stashed under FLOOR BOARDS 
beside the tunnel entrance.

JOHN
Let's go. You look like you could use some 
shut eye. Me too. We can all get acquainted 
tomorrow.

LUKEY escorts JOHN AND SARAH out of the operating room into the main 
hospital area. BILL McDERMOTT pulls out his empty flask.

McDERMOTT
Doc, I need a fill up. I'll help m'self if 
it's alright with you.

LOGAN nods distractedly and BILL moves to A SUPPLY CABINET which 
contains, among other essentials, SEVERAL BOTTLES OF BRANDY. He fills 
his flask eagerly.

LOGAN
How do we know she's alright? How do we 
know?

McDERMOTT
She's alright. Christ, Rhodes and his 
cossacks wiped out her whole party. Dan 
near got her.

McDERMOTT pockets the refilled flask, takes a long slug from the 
cabinet bottle before putting it back, and moves out of the room. 
LOGAN is left alone with DIESEL AND SPIDER.

LOGAN
How do we know she's alright? How do we 
know?

LOGAN repeats his question, intoned identically as it was before. 
He's twitching slightly and sweat is pouring down his face. THE 
THUNDER suddenly seems LOUDER.

DIESEL
Are you alright, Doc? You look... you look 
real bad.

LOGAN
I have looked bad for four years. Everyone 
in the world has looked bad for four years. 
Thank God looks don't matter as much as 
they once did.

LOGAN, a wild gleam in his eye, moves out of the room, following 
where the others went, that LONG-BLADED SCALPEL still clutched in his 
hand. The others follow.

94	INT. THE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

JOHN, SARAH AND LUKEY are facing out across the compound. A TEEMING 
TROPICAL RAIN has started to fall.

JOHN
This just ain't your day, is it, darlin' 
Sarah.

SARAH can't help but snicker. Suddenly her head spins exhaustion is 
conquering her body as last. JOHN puts a big arm around her.

JOHN
Three more minutes. Then you can sleep. You 
gotta stay with it for three more minutes.

McDERMOTT joins them and the group moves out into the rain. LUKEY 
waddles back through the maze of cots.

LOGAN, SPIDER AND DIESEL have moved to about the center of the big 
room. The patients around them, their eyes bulging, look like lemurs.

LOGAN
How do we know she's alright? How do we 
know?

The same intonation again. This guy's wrapping is definitely coming 
loose.

THE ZOMBIE rises up behind LOGAN'S back. It's the woman whose wrist 
Lukey checked earlier. Its teeth are dripping with drool, its hands 
reaching out wantingly.

LOGAN turns around. Calmly, but with the swiftness of a rattlesnake, 
he shoots out the hand that's holding THE SCALPEL. THE BLADE SINKS 
DEEPLY INTO THE ZOMBIE'S FOREHEAD. LOGAN pulls it out and strikes 
again, and again, and again, like a swordsman thrusting, thrusting, 
thrusting. Finally the creature collapses. LOGAN wipes the scalpel on 
his already blood-covered apron. RAIN WATER drops onto him from holes 
in the roof above. He doesn't seem to notice.

95	EXT. STALAG SEVENTEEN MAIN STREET (RAIN) - NIGHT

THE STREET SCENE is toned down due to the late hour and the rain, but 
just as vile, just as vicious. JOHN AND McDERMOTT escort SARAH. JOHN 
speaks softly, and only when others on the street are far enough 
away.

JOHN
They supply us with disinfectant and dope. 
Sex, drugs and rock-and-roll. What more 
could anyone ask for? Most around here 
ain't interested in changin' their lives. 
The folks you met...me and them and a 
couple others is the whole rebel army. 
Nobody else gives a shit...and they're 
afraid o' Rhodes.

They pass A STRUCTURE WITH AN OVERHEAD SIGN that reads: JOE'S CORNER 
TAVERN. If there were walls they'd be pushed out by the MASS OF 
HUMANITY inside. MUSIC BLARES and VOICES form a wall of noise louder 
than the THUNDER. A FIGHT spills out onto the muddy street, PUSHERS 
selling all sort of delights accost JOHN and his group.
	
SARAH
They seem to be havin' a good time. Some 
punishment.

JOHN
You disappear in here, darlin'. You get a 
knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer 
veins. You get lost out here and nobody's 
gonna notice. Rhodes, he counts on that. It 
all makes for food in the freezers.

They come to A LONG HUT WITH A SIGN that reads: THE RITZ.

JOHN
This is your hotel. I'm not gonna stay here 
with you but I'll always be close. You 
gonna hafta take care o' yourself like you 
said you was able to do.

SARAH nods. JOHN smiles at her. His warm, trustworthy eyes seem to 
glow in the dark.

JOHN
Some may notice that you're new. Just deny 
it. You'll get away with it. Nobody really 
looks at each other around here. Go on in. 
Get some sleep.

He squeezes her hand tightly, then he turns away and moves off with 
McDERMOTT. SARAH moves into THE RITZ.

96	INT. THE RITZ (RAIN) - NIGHT

It resembles the hospital. There are ROWS AND ROWS OF COTS. SOME 
PEOPLE SLEEP, alone and in pairs. OTHERS are awake, drinking, 
screwing, shooting up. SARAH finds an empty cot and flops down. 
Beyond the open walls she can see THE BLUE-WHITE FLASHES coming from 
the electrified fence. RAIN LEAKS in on her but it doesn't keep her 
from falling asleep.

97	INT. THE CONDITIONING ROOM IN THE CAVE - MORNING

TECHNICIANS are working with ZOMBIES while ARMED GUARDS stand ready. 
We FOCUS ON A BLUE COAT. Under supervision, the thing is fumbling to 
tie a shoelace. It's failing miserably but trying hard. ANOTHER BLUE 
is busy placing LITTLE WOODEN SHAPES into their proper HOLES IN A 
BOARD.

TWO RED COATS sit at a table attended by HUMAN TECHNICIANS. We've 
seen these zombies before, in the dormitory. TONTO, is...or was...a 
native American, probably Seminole. In front of him is A PLATE 
containing SEVERAL BITS OF MEAT. He has A FORK in his hand and he is 
idly stabbing at the meat.

The other RED COAT, BLUTO, looks just like Bluto from Popeye, bulky 
with a thick, black beard. Tired of THE JIG SAW PUZZLE he's working 
on, he snarls and suddenly lunges for the meat on TONTO'S plate. He 
snatches a handful and stuffs it in his mouth. As soon as he tastes 
it, however, he pulls it back out, dribbling and spitting 
disgustedly.

FISHER (a technician)
They won't accept a substitute. They want 
their Alpo.

TONTO has succeeded in forking a piece of meat. He moves it to his 
mouth and pops it in.

FISHER
Alright! Way ta go, Kemosabe!

MARY HENRIED has entered the room. She pulls up and watches  TONTO 
with a kind of dubious interest. TONTO stops chewing. He looks up 
with exaggerated sadness on his face. Slowly his mouth opens and the 
chewed piece of meat slides out between his lips. He throws his fork 
down angrily.

MARY
They won't learn to use forks if they don't 
like the breakfast you're serving, Ted.

FISHER
The fork is like a game to them. If they 
get into the game maybe they'll learn to 
like the food.

MARY
It won't work.

Suddenly BLUTO jumps up from the table. He flings his chair aside and 
tromps right over to MARY. His arms are outstretched and he is making 
a pleading, Karloff-like SOUND. GUARDS come after him but MARY waves 
them off.

MARY
It's alright! Leave him alone!

MARY extends her right hand to meet BLUTO'S right and they shake 
vigorously. Then the dumb creature drops his arms and looks around. 
His brain sends no signal as to what he should do next. THE GUARDS 
lead him away.

98	INT. THE FIRING RANGE IN THE CAVE - MORNING

BLAM!!! A RED COAT is FIRING A PISTOL right AT THE LENS.

CLOSE ON: A TARGET, a flat, cut out silhouette of a man, BLACK 
TRIANGLES painted on the instant-kill-zones, brain, heart. BULLETS 
STRIKE the neck, the to torso, SOME RICOCHET off the wall behind. 
None hit the kill-zones.

MARY HENRIED enters. The place resembles a Police Department target 
range. RED COATS stand in stalls and FIRE down LONG ALLEYS at TARGETS 
which pop up against the opposite wall. THE NOISE is deafening. TWO 
TECHNICIANS are watching the shooters and keeping score. MARY walks 
up to one of them.

MARY
Have you seen Julie Grant this morning?

TECHNICIAN
She should be in the behaviour rooms.

MARY
She's not. Hasn't shown up yet.

There's AN OFF-SCREEN GROAN, the sound of a zombie trying to 
communicate. MARY turns and sees the tall RED COAT names BUB standing 
in the closest stall trying to attract MARY'S attention. (He was the 
one Rhodes referred to last night as "Mary's pride and joy".) He is 
wearing WESTERN-STYLE GUN BELTS, SIX-SHOOTER hang in HOLSTERS on both 
his hips. MARY faces BUB full with her body and delivers a military 
salute.

MARY
Good morning, Bub.

BUB replies with one of those pathetic sounds that obviously mean 
something to him. Then he, too, salutes. MARY pulls away, heading for 
AN EXIT, but BUB calls after her. He makes inarticulate sounds but we 
catch his drift.

TECHNICIAN
I think he wants you to watch.

MARY
OK, Bub. Do your stuff.

BUB turns towards the target wall looking like a gunfighter on a 
western street. There's A HUMMING MECHANICAL SOUND. KATCHUNG! A 
SILHOUETTE pops up. BUB slaps leather...fast... lighting fast. BOTH 
GUN come up. BLAM-KA-BLAM-KA-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM!!!

HOLES APPEARS IN THE TARGET...WOP-WOPPETY-WHUMP!!! All in the kill-
zones, or damn close.

BUB slaps ONE PISTOL back into its HOLSTER. He clicks open the shell-
chamber on THE OTHER, dumps the SPENT CARTRIDGES and begins to reload 
from his belt.

MARY stares at the creature's back, mixed emotions showing on her 
face. BUB turns to face her. Dropping a bullet, he salutes again. 
MARY hesitates, then salutes back.

MARY
Very good, Bub. That's....very good.

99	INT. A LOCKER ROOM IN THE CAVE - MORNING

PEOPLE are changing clothes, going on and off duty. JULIE GRANT 
rushes in and moves to a locker where she pulls out her LAB COAT. 
MARY HENRIED enters the room, spots JULIE, and rushes towards her.

MARY
Where the hell have you been?

JULIE doesn't respond. She buttons her coat never looking up.

MARY
Julie. Are you alright?
(still no response)
You were missed this morning. I need you. I 
don't want you getting your ass in hot 
water. I won't be able to help you if...

JULIE
I don't need any help from you!

JULIE slams the locker door and storms away toward the exit.

MARY
Julie...JULIE!

But she's gone. The locker door has bounced open. MARY slams it and 
it bounces again. She pounds it with her fist. Suddenly, A LOUD BELL 
SOUNDS. MARY looks at her watch then exits.

There are TWO WOMEN cleaning the locker room with MOPS AND PAILS. One 
of them turns to watch MARY HENRIED exit. We recognise her. It's 
SPIDER.

100	INT. THE COUNCIL CHAMBER IN THE CAVE - MORNING

This is a large Situations Room that is serving now as GOVERNMENT 
HEADQUARTERS. In A BIG, STUFFED OFFICE CHAIR behind A DESK FLANKED 
WITH FLAGS sits GOVERNOR HENRY DICKERSON (former of Florida, now of 
the world) A.K.A.... GASPARILLA.

At TABLES sit A DOZEN OR SO COUNCILMEN, Dickerson's cronies from the 
old Doral Country Club, close friends who were offered asylum in the 
private underground shelter. Now they sit in council, "yessing" 
everything the boss man says.

A STATE PROSECUTOR has a DESPERATE-LOOKING PRISONER on the floor, 
standing with his hands cuffed.

PROSECUTOR
He was found with a government-issue short-
wave transmitter in his quarters. He's 
charged with the theft of that equipment 
from a government installation and with 
possession of an illegal radio.

GASPARILLA munches on SOME FRUIT. He's a fat man with a handlebar 
moustache that makes him look like Pancho Villa. As an indication of 
rank we wears a military jacket but underneath is a Hawaiian shirt 
with a bold flamingo and palm tree pattern. Around his neck, nestled 
in the rolls of fat there, is enough gold to stake a small business.

PROSECUTOR
I can only suggest that the court rule in 
favour of the ultimate penalty for this 
traitor.

GASPARILLA
You always recommend the ultimate penalty, 
Tommy Lee. You and Rhodes.

We now see that RHODES is present, looking on with a smile.

GASPARILLA
All those...AGAINST...the ultimate penalty 
raise yer hands.

None of THE COUNCILMEN move a muscle. GASPARILLA scans them slowly as 
he takes a big, wet bite out of a peach.

GASPARILLA
Ya mean ta say nobody's gonna object to the 
ultimate penalty in this here case? Well, 
what if I object? What if I object to the 
ultimate penalty.

THE COUNCILMEN look nervous, apprehensive. GASPARILLA'S flexing his 
power-muscles.

GASPARILLA
There's been a whole lotta swingin' 
influence and swingin' weight arountyere 
lately. Does anybody at all give two shits 
fer what I think any more? Well, I'm a-
gonna let this guy off. How d'yall like 
that? And I want the word ta git out I let 
'im off. I let 'im off. Not this council. 
Maybe I can improve my image rountyere.

THE PRISONER looks up at GASPARILLA, hatred boiling inside him. 
GASPARILLA meets his gaze with a power-mad sneer.

GASPARILLA
Yer sentenced ta hard labour. Stalag 
Seventeen. A year.

PRISONER
WHY DON'T YOU KILL ME! I PREFER TO DIE! I 
DON'T WANT TO LIVE WITH... WITH THIS KIND 
OF...SIN!

GASPARILLA
WELL, PISS ON YOU, MISTER! I JUST SAVED 
YOUR ASS! YOU DAMN WELL BETTER NOT GO 
HOLLERIN' LIKE THAT IN HERE!

PRISONER
I SPIT ON YOU! THE ULTIMATE PENALTY FOR 
YOU! BURN IN HELL...FOR THE ULTIMATE SIN! 
PIG! ALL OF YOU! PIGS!

GUARDS drag the screaming PRISONER from the room. GASPARILLA flops 
back in his chair, flustered but unscarred. His skin is about a foot 
thick. He pitches the peach and grabs up a mango. MARY HENRIED enters 
the chamber and rushes toward an empty chair. GASPARILLA checks THE 
DOCKET on his desk, smiles, and looks up at MARY.

GASPARILLA
Well, Miss Henried, what a coincidence. 
You're just in time fer a case that seems 
ta concern you. Guess you didn't care about 
the other proceedin's we been dealin' with 
here this mornin'.

MARY
I'm sorry. I was...busy. In the lab.

GASPARILLA
Well, you managed ta make it here jus' in 
time fer this case, didn't ya?

RHODES replaces THE PROSECUTOR on the floor. He smiles at MARY 
pointedly as he starts his speech.

RHODES
Sir. In the matter of the State versus 
Private Tyler, I don't want to...

MARY
(standing) Sir, Tyler is innocent of any 
crime against the State. Captain Rhodes 
is...

GASPARILLA
(with a mouthful of mango) Miss Henried, I 
think you better...

MARY
...Captain Rhodes is trying to...

GASPARILLA
(spitting a wad of chewed pulp into his 
hand) MISS HENRIED, SHUT THE HELL UP!!!

MARY'S eyes indicate her frustration and anger but she does shut up. 
GASPARILLA plops the handful of fruit pulp onto the floor wiping his 
fingers on his military jacket.

RHODES
I don't want to take up a lot of time with 
this. Mr Tyler shot a prisoner against 
orders. There are eyewitnesses. I've 
reprimanded Tyler and I've had him sent 
outside. It's as simple as that.

GASPARILLA
Ya had 'im sent ta the Stalag? That's all 
ya did to 'im?

RHODES
The prisoner was dying, sir. Tyler acted 
out of a sense of mercy. I don't believe 
Tyler to be dangerous, General. He just 
needs...discipline. Two or three months 
outside will teach him...discipline.

MARY
Sir. It's quite clear that...

GASPARILLA
SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE!

MARY
THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS...

GASPARILLA
SIDDOWN, YOUNG LADY! I DONE YUP A SHIT-LOAD 
O' FAVOURS AND I AIN'T NEVER YET ASKED FER 
NOTHIN' IN RETURN! NOW HOW'D YOU LIKE TA 
SPEND TWO WEEKS UP T'THE VEGETABLE FARM 
YERSELF? THAT'S WHAT IT'LL BE IF YA DON'T 
SIDDOWN AN' SHUT THE HELL UP!

MARY checks herself. There's a perverse air of danger fuming off the 
fat General. His attitude toward MARY has clearly changed. RHODES has 
been working on him. MARY seems to have lost this round. She can only 
hope that's all she's going to lose.

GASPARILLA
Now I think Captain's punishment is fair, 
considerin'. In fact I think you ain't got 
shit ta complain about.

MARY
(softly, carefully) I'm sorry, General, if 
I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr 
Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has 
no representation. I don't believe due 
process is being served by...

GASPARILLA
Listen, Missy. I am the only due process 
that has ta be served aroun' tyere and one 
of the people doin' the servin' from now on 
is gonna be you. Now you been prancin' 
aroun' the Cave like yer ass was glass fer 
long enough! All that's

GASPARILLA
gonna change, young lady. Now if you still 
got a statement you'd like ta make, you can 
jus' hold onto it 'til tonight.

MARY
Tonight?

GASPARILLA
That's right. 'Bout eight, if that suits. 
We'll start out in my gymnasium an' 
progress on from there...to various other 
forms o' physical therapy.

MARY shoots a hate-filled eye full at RHODES. THE CAPTAIN responds 
with a phoney look of sympathy.

101	INT. GASPARILLA'S GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

The place is full of EXERCISE EQUIPMENT, TREADMILLS, WEIGHTS, A 
NAUTILUS, ETC. There are other items which seem contradictory, PLUSH 
PILLOWS, A HUGE CIRCULAR BED SURROUNDED BY MIRRORS. Delicacies of 
FOOD AND DRINK lie about on LOW TABLES. The room is a cross between 
Elaine Powers and a harem chamber.

A HUGE COFFIN-SHAPED DEVICE opens and we see that the inside is lined 
with ULTRAVIOLET TUBES which are covered with plexiglass. GASPARILLA 
lounges inside the thing, sweating, having just taken a long dose of 
fake sunshine.

All around are THE COUNCILMEN, some with COUNTRY-CLUB TYPE WOMEN, 
conservatively dressed and wearing suitable jewellery (obviously 
wives left over from the good old days), and some with SCANTILY CLAD 
COURTESANS.

OTHER SCANTILY CLAD "BUNNY" TYPES are serving HORS-D'OEUVRES and 
pouring WINE, offering SMOKE AND SNORT.

MARY HENRIED is sitting on the floor, lost in fluffy pillows, her LAB 
COAT incongruous. RHODES watches her from nearby.

GASPARILLA
AWRITE. C'MON LADIES. OFF WITH IT... AND ON 
WITH IT...HA HA HA...

MUSIC BLARES and SEVERAL OF THE COURTESANS spring up, stripping off 
what few clothes they are wearing. Some strip naked, others down to 
panties. They hop onto various exercise machines and begin to 
"workout", tits flopping, thighs pumping...GASPARILLA'S kind of 
entertainment.

GASPARILLA
Oh, Lordy, Lordy...I'm drunk as a skunk. 
Look at this...will ya jus' loooooook at 
these lovelies! Say, Henried, you ever try 
it with another woman?

MARY looks up at the General, not knowing whether or not she should 
answer, afraid of what he might try to make her do.

GASPARILLA
I've tried it with boys. Too strenuous.

FOUR MORE WOMEN have brought in SILVER PLATTERS full of NEW HORS-
D'OEUVRES, prepared carefully and laid them out like sushi. They're 
distributed and people eat them

GASPARILLA
Folks...I just couldn't resist. How d'yall 
like those? How do those taste?

GUESTS look up, not knowing what to expect. MARY fears the worst. She 
looks around to see RHODES grinning. A knot comes up into her throat. 
She tries to swallow it down.

GASPARILLA
Fresh from the freezers, folks. It's 
what...THEY...EAT!

A FEW OF THE GUESTS are revulsed. ONE MAN starts to vomit and he runs 
from the room.

GASPARILLA
Just kiddin' folks. Just kiddin'. Would I 
do a thing like that? I ask ya now, would 
I? Hah ha ha ha ha...

Relief spreads and the bacchanalian atmosphere restores itself. 
GASPARILLA spills himself out of the tanning coffin and flops down on 
some pillows near MARY. He grabs up a goblet and swills red wine 
which runs down his front.

GASPARILLA
The great state of Florida. People came 
here fer years ta die. Retire and expire. 
The rest o' the country used ta think we 
was nothin' but a bunch o' farts and 
fogies. Hah! Now this here's the new 
Capital o' the World! Hah! They came 
here...died...went to hell...and the Devil 
sent 'em back as an army. Hah! General 
Gasparilla's army...MY ARMY!

MARY
We think there are other cities surviving. 
We think maybe Detroit... there's some 
signalling out of Philly.

GASPARILLA
There's no place like this place. Warm 
climate. This facility. Christ, there ain't 
nothin' like this no-damn-where! Even the 
Feds knew that. That's why they stored so 
much o' their shit down here. It's all mine 
now. All mine. Just let 'em try ta come 
after us down here, which they will some 
day...take a likin' ta what all we got an' 
come after us. They'll hafta get past my 
army! An army that ain't afraid ta die...ha 
ha ha...'cause it's awreddy DAID! HA HA HA 
HA....

MARY
It's not a very big army. And small as it 
is you won't be able to continue feeding it 
for very long. We've got to find ways of 
getting them to respond without relying 
on...

GASPARILLA
You'll find the ways, Miss Mary. And when 
ya do...we'll sail on over to the 
mainland...or any other damn mainland fer 
that matter...and start us a recruitin' 
program. There's millions o' Bees out there 
jus' waitin' fer' a General ta lead 'em on 
ta vict'ry!

GASPARILLA swallows another huge quantity of wine.

DISSOLVE TO:

102	INT. THE GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

The room is empty now. Remnants of food and drink clutter the place. 
THE FAT GENERAL is asleep, snoring loudly, one of his pudgy arms is 
draped across MARY HENRIED'S lap. She is trying to move out from 
under without waking the man. She slides on the floor...a few 
inches...a few inches more. GASPARILLA snorts and rolls over. His 
eyes pop open, focus on MARY, and a smile pushes his fat cheeks back.

GASPARILLA
Well, hi there, y'all.

Mary looks down at the man, repulsed and afraid. Suddenly he grabs 
her LAB COAT. She pulls away and he crawls after her, his belly 
bouncing along the floor. BUTTONS POP and the coat falls open. He 
reaches for her blouse. It tears away and for a moment he gets a 
chubby handful of bare breast. He dives into her but he's unconscious 
before his face reaches her chest.

MARY pulls herself out from under his dead weight. Shivering, she 
clutches her blouse together and hurries out of the room.

103	EXT. ENTRANCE TO STALAG SEVENTEEN - DAWN

Light is just breaking through the trees when THE GATES ARE OPENED 
admitting FIVE UNIFORMED MEN into the compound. Outside the fence 
ZOMBIES clamber excitedly as always.

104	INT. THE RITZ - DAWN

SARAH jumps, awakened by A VOICE AND THE LOUD POUNDING OF RIFLES 
against the upright of the sleeping hut.

RHODES
REVEILLE! REVEILLE! RISE AND SHINE!

RHODES is standing near the entrance. FOUR SOLDIERS are doing the 
pounding. Stunned, disease-ridden faces look up as CITIZENS are 
awakened from sleep. Fear sweeps through the place like a tropical 
wind.

RHODES
We found two white Bees in the jungle with 
their heads chopped open. I want to know 
who's going outside the compound. I want to 
know how they're going out. I want to know 
why they're going out. Until I get these 
answers...each morning...some of you will 
die.

Without warning RHODES draws his MAGNUM and...BLAM! BLAM! He shoots 
TWO COT PEOPLE who happen to be at close range. They tumble to the 
dirt floor, dead before they hit.

RHODES scans the rest of the hut. He spots a familiar face, THE 
PRISONER from the Council Room, the one Gasparilla saved from a death 
sentence. The man makes the sign of the cross, knowing what's coming. 
BLAM! BLAM! RHODES FIRES TWO RAPID ROUNDS and THE PRISONER'S CHEST 
TURNS RED. He flies off his cot into one adjacent, landing on top of 
a SCREAMING WOMAN.

RHODES AND HIS MEN leave as abruptly as they entered. SARAH is 
stunned. As PEOPLE around her react with sobs and more screams, she 
locks her eyes on RHODES.

He is moving authoritatively down the street just outside the open-
walled structure. He passes within inches of SARAH'S cot which is 
right against the outside rail. Her emotions well up inside her. She 
is about to jump out into the street when A BIG BLACK HAND grabs her 
arm. It's JOHN, who has pushed through the gathering crowd outside.

SARAH
Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is 
all happening because of me. If I turn 
myself in...

JOHN
He's just finding another reason for 
bumpin' us off. Don't ya see. He needs us 
ta die. He needs our bodies. 

Behind JOHN on the street TOBY TYLER is looking on. He has heard the 
conversation. JOHN turns and sees him. His eyes go dark with 
apprehension.

TOBY
It's alright. I'm a friend. I need help and 
so do you. What's a safe place to talk?

JOHN
Ain't no place safe.

TOBY
Look...I know you have no reason to trust 
me. I've got friends in the Cave. I got 
some stuff comin' out this mornin'. I'm 
gonna try to get off the island.

PEOPLE are pushing in closer attracted by the commotion inside the 
Ritz. TOBY has to make it fast. He whispers.

TOBY
I'm gonna have this stuff sent over to the 
hospital...

JOHN
The hospital? (surprised, worried)

TOBY
Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red 
crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me 
at the hospital after the supplies come in. 
Maybe we can find a place there to talk.

JOHN
Maybe.

TOBY drifts off into the crowd. JOHN AND SARAH exchange glances.

105	EXT. ENTRANCE TO STALAG SEVENTEEN - MORNING

SUPPLIES are being brought in through THE MAIN GATES, CRATES, 
CARTONS, BAGS OF GRAIN, SEED, FERTILISER.

TRICKS is in charge of the patrol from the Cave. He's checking items 
as they're picked up by WORKERS from the compound. TOBY TYLER sidles 
up to his friend.

TOBY
Hey, Tricks. Some detail they got you on.

TRICKS
Not as bad as yours, pal.

TOBY
(whispering) What'dya get?

TRICKS
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.

TOBY
We need fuel, and a couple automatics.

LUKEY, the orderly, picks up A DOLLY which is LOADED DOWN WITH CRATES 
MARKED WITH RED CROSSES.

TRICKS
Hey, you. Those two on the bottom. Don't 
open those yet. They might be from the 
wrong shipment. Just keep 'em around 'til I 
can check.

LUKEY
Yessir. I never open 'em. Nossir. I keep 
'em innaback for you.

106	EXT. FRONT STREET OF STALAG SEVENTEEN - MORNING

Watching from the shadows of A BUILDING are JOHN, SARAH AND DIESEL.

DIESEL
He's a spy. A spy for Rhodes.

JOHN
Give him a chance.

They see TOBY pull away from TRICKS and start down the street 
following LUKEY. They move out and catch up with TOBY, flanking him.

JOHN
What'dya tell that soldier, soldier? You 
tell him we was rebels?

TOBY
He's my contact for Chrissake! There's two 
crates. Can you get me into the hospital?

SHORT CUT TO:

107	INT. STORAGE BAY IN THE HOSPITAL - MORNING

CREAK! A CROWBAR pries open A CRATE. JOHN AND LUKEY guard the 
entrance while TOBY AND DIESEL work at opening the "Red Cross" boxes. 
SARAH stands nearby. THE LIDS LIFT and we see TWO ARMY-ISSUE LIFE 
RAFTS.

TOBY
There ya go. Complete with air 
canisters...little motors.

JOHN
We got a boat.

TOBY
What?

JOHN
I say we got a boat. Can you get other 
stuff?

TOBY
I got some fuel comin' out and, I hope, 
some automatic rifles.

DIESEL
He's just tryin' to win us over. This 
doesn't prove anything.

JOHN
I'm gonna trust him, Diesel. He already 
knows who we are and we ain't got a bunch 
o' time to mess around with Rhodes shootin' 
up the joint every mornin'.

TOBY, rooting through the open crates, finds THE PISTOLS TRICKS told 
him about and A FEW BOXES OF AMMO. He tosses one of the guns to JOHN. 
The big man walks over and puts the weapon back inside the crate.

JOHN
Can't walk around here with these. Let's 
just leave 'em here 'til we ready ta use 
'em.

108	INT. HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOM - DAY

CLOSE ON: HANDS carefully...very carefully...pouring DROPS OF CLEAR 
LIQUID INTO A TEST TUBE. The liquid is sweating slowly out of A 
MILDEWED AND ROTTING STICK OF DYNAMITE which has been softened to 
near-melting by jungle heat.

A DOZEN TEST TUBES stand in a rack, already filled. SPIDER, another 
woman, SALLY, and a man, JACK, each have their own DYNAMITE STICK. 
Each is transferring LIQUID SWEAT...which is, of course, nitro 
glycerine...into A GLASS TUBE. They work in tense silence on the 
operating table.

DOC LOGAN works with them, doing the same delicate procedure. 
Suddenly his hands starts to tremble.

LOGAN
Take it away from me. Quickly. Take it! 
Take it!

SPIDER reaches over and, as gently as possible, takes the VIAL and 
THE DYNAMITE out of the doctor's hands. She sets the tube in the rack 
and returns the dynamite to AN OPEN CRATE, years old and crusted with 
mildew and mud, still half-filled with sticks yet to be drained. The 
danger passed, they all breathe a sigh of relief. LOGAN wipes the 
river of sweat from his face. His hands are shaking quite violently 
now. He pops pills, dry, from his pocket.

LOGAN
Sorry. I'm sorry. I'll, er...I'll be 
alright...in a moment.

JOHN
You're sick, Doc. You been sick for a while 
now. Too sick to be workin' with us on this 
raid.

JOHN, SARAH AND DIESEL are standing in a corner of the room. TOBY 
TYLER is with them, sweating and obviously nervous.

JOHN
You've helped us enough, providin' cover, 
hidin' us out. Let the rest of us handle 
the physical stuff. It's too much for you.

LOGAN
It's my fight as much as yours. The things 
they made me do...the things they 
made...me...do. I want so see Rhodes 
destroyed. I want to see all of them, all 
of them destroyed. It's my duty...in the 
eyes of God. In the eyes of God.

LOGAN is really flipso now, over the edge into banana-land.

TOBY
It won't work. That's pure nitro you're 
dealin' with there. That stuff can blow if 
you look at is funny. What're you gonna do, 
walk into the Cave carryin' those tubes on 
feather pillows? You don't have a complete 
layout of the place. Even if you manage to 
avoid a fight you won't know where to go.

JOHN
We're hopin' you can show us where ta go, 
Toby.

TOBY
Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island 
alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not 
goin' in there on a suicide mission. What 
can you hope to accomplish? Some radios 
maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be 
killed and in a few weeks they'll be back 
to business as usual. That place was built 
to withstand nuclear attack! What are you 
gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few 
sticks of nitro?

JOHN
We're gonna blow up the powder magazine.

TOBY
What?

JOHN
We know what's down there. We did the 
loading' and unloadin' when the stuff came 
ashore in the early days. A direct hit 
oughta do more than a few weeks worth o' 
damage.

TOBY
A direct hit'll blow the top off this whole 
island! How're you gonna fuse the stuff? 
How're you gonna leave yourself time to get 
out?

LOGAN
If we don't get out it's a small price to 
pay.

TOBY
You're fuckin' out of your minds! There's 
two hundred people down there. You gonna 
murder two hundred people?

LOGAN
Sinners! Animals! Filth! Doing the work of 
the Devil!

TOBY
What about the people here in the camp? If 
they don't get blown to kingdom come their 
food'll be destroyed, their water, medical 
supplies. They won't have any more power. 
This island can't support them all, they'll 
be doomed. Count me out, friends. I'm gonna 
get my ass outa here. Anybody wants to come 
along is welcome.

Silence falls over the room. Finally JOHN moves towards the door. 
TOBY follows but before exiting he turns back to face the group once 
more.

TOBY
I wanna see Rhodes burn just a much as you 
do...but all those people. We don't have 
the right to be their judges... just like 
they don't have the right to be our judges.

JOHN opens the door and TOBY exits. SARAH follows. JOHN looks around 
at the faces in the group, then he leaves, shutting the door behind 
him. There's a long silence, then LOGAN speaks.

LOGAN
We know what we must do. It's written for 
us in the Bible. "They shall be driven from 
the land of the living down to the world of 
the dead. That is the fate of those who 
care nothing for God."

109	INT. STORAGE BAY IN THE HOSPITAL - DAY

LUKEY stands guard. McDERMOTT has joined SARAH AND JOHN in a strategy 
huddle. TOBY stands nearby, feeling strangely guilty.

SARAH
Toby's right. They're not gonna sit around 
with their fingers up their asses while we 
bust up their toys.

JOHN
Datura.

SARAH
What?

JOHN
Datura Metel. The Devil's Trumpet. Don't 
worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's 
a flower that grows on these islands. Where 
I come from the voodoo priests used it 
whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's 
toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink 
or inject it...or...in a sealed area it 
might be introduced through the ventilation 
system.

SARAH
Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was 
shouting! Datura Metel!

JOHN
We always planned to use it. We got some 
ground up already...but we could never find 
enough.

SARAH
There's hundreds of 'em. Right where we 
landed our boat.

TOBY
This stuff really works? No shit?

JOHN
Quicker than gas. And it smells a lot 
prettier. It usually don't kill but it puts 
ya under fer a good night's sleep.

TOBY
If you could knock out the central 
communications room you could foul up their 
whole intercom system. Then, if you move 
fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without 
bein' able to signal each other, they might 
have a hard time catchin' you.

JOHN
I say it's poetic. Pure calypso, brother. 
The Devil's Trumpet blowin' the notes o' 
doom for the Devil's troops. Ha ha ha ha 
ha...

110	EXT. THE BACKWATER - NIGHT

THE FISHING BOAT that bought SARAH and her friends to the island sits 
still in the channel. There are SOLDIERS ABOARD, two of Rhodes' men, 
pacing the deck, passing a bottle back and forth.

JOHN (o.s.)
Well, we found yer boat, lady, but so did 
they.

JOHN, SARAH AND TOBY are huddled behind green cover peering out at 
the boat.

SARAH
Looks like just two. We can take 'em when 
the time comes.

JOHN
We're only about a quarter-mile from Cave 
entrance number five.

TOBY
That entrance is closest to the labs and 
the Bee cages.

JOHN
Come on. Let's go.

They move off stealthily.

They enter the clearing with the spectacular PLANTS that Miguel 
discovered. Six feet tall, their red-gold blossoms like trumpets with 
their bells down, these are Daturas, nightshades indigenous to 
southern Florida and parts of the Caribbean.

SALLY AND JACK, who we saw working on the nitro sticks, are chopping 
off the eighteen-inch blossom and stuffing them into LARGE LEAF BAGS. 
They're wearing HOSPITAL MASKS over their mouth and noses. JOHN moves 
in to help. TOBY AND SARAH follow but JOHN stops them.

JOHN
Just stand guard for now. Spell us after a 
while. Can't breathe this grass too long or 
somebody hafta carry you home.

Work goes on in silence.

111	EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE THE RITZ - NIGHT

MUSIC ROCKS AND VOICES SHOUT. The street scene is as wild as ever. 
HOOKERS, PUSHERS AND DRUNKS pack the hot darkness.

112	INT. THE RITZ - NIGHT

At A COT near the open wall, in DIM LIGHT FROM AN OVERHEAD BULB 
OUTSIDE, SARAH, JOHN AND TOBY huddle. The DIN from the street makes 
it impossible for others to hear them. TOBY is drawing A MAP.

TOBY
Maintenance shafts run behind all the main 
rooms. Nobody's in those at night. You can 
use them to get around in. Hit the power 
governors first. Kick a surge into their 
computer network and you erase everything 
stored in the memory. Then...over in 
here...that's where the cages are...

On the street outside, a puffing BILL McDERMOTT pushes through the 
unruly crowd, his face showing alarm.

McDERMOTT
The Doc's gone. Diesel and Jack and Spider 
with him. They took the guns... and the 
nitro.

CUT TO:

113	INT. HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE ON: LUKEY, beside himself, almost to the point of tears.

LUKEY
I coulden stop 'em, boss. No way I coulda 
stop 'em, I sweah. They tie me up and stick 
dis...
(He's waving a pillowcase in his hand, the 
action accentuating his frenzied state.)
...they stick dis in my mouf. You b'lieve 
dis?

JOHN is in the room with SARAH, TOBY, SALLY AND BILL McDERMOTT. This 
is now the entire rebel force. THE FLOORBOARDS TO THE TUNNEL have 
been thrown aside. The weapons are gone.

McDERMOTT
I was in the Cave yesterday workin' 
repairs. Spider was in on clean up. I seen 
her talkin' ta some insiders... well, she 
was scribblin', they was talkin'...mighty 
palsy.

 TOBY
Jesus! They're gonna try to do it! They're 
goin' in! They got somebody to help 'em 
from the inside!

LUKEY
They din' get da pistols. You know dem 
pistols you buddy send in widda raffs.

TOBY
I gotta get Mary out. Tricks. We gotta go 
now! Tonight! Right away!

McDERMOTT
Oh, Lord! (He polishes of what's left in 
his flask and moves to refill it from the 
bottles in Logan's cabinet.)

SALLY
We're not ready.	

JOHN
Well...if ya think about it...we as ready 
as we ever gonna be. How was they carryin' 
the nitro, Lukey?

LUKEY
Oh, me. You ain't gonna b'lieve dis, 
neider. You ain't, I sweah. They put it 
inta Spidah's body.

TOBY
They what?

LUKEY
De Doc. He cut up Spidah here and here and 
here...all ovah. He stick dem tubes in 
dere, like undah da skin...an' den he sews 
'em all up. I sweah. I sweah, sweah, sweah!

114	EXT. THE JUNGLE - NIGHT

JACK AND DIESEL are chopping a path through the undergrowth with 
MACHETES. Behind them DOC LOGAN is walking slowly along with SPIDER, 
guiding her carefully around obstacles. SPIDER is in major pain. 
She's sweating rivers, her fists are clenched, she's biting her lover 
lip so that it bleeds.

LOGAN
I know it hurts. But it won't be long. Then 
all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you 
could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER THE EARS TO 
HEAR ME SO SHE KNOWS I DON'T WANT HER TO 
HURT SO!

DIESEL
Quiet!

LOGAN
Oh, yes. Quiet. Yes. We must be quiet.

Suddenly, A ZOMBIE lunges from the underbrush, its FACE BADLY 
DETERIORATED and one of its hands; lost during its human life, 
replaced by A MECHANICAL HOOK. SPIDER stumbles. She holds her breath 
and stiffens all her muscles. Miraculously the nitro vials inside her 
do not explode. LOGAN throws himself quixotically in front of THE 
ZOMBIE.

LOGAN
FALLEN ANGEL! THIS IS THE JUDGEMENT DAY 
WHEN YOU WILL BURN FOR YOUR SINS! THE LORD 
WILL CAST YOU DOWN TO THE LOWER REACHES AND 
YOU SHALL FOREVER KNOW....

THWOK!!! THE ZOMBIE'S STEEL HOOK SINKS DEEPLY INTO LOGAN'S UPPER 
CHEST. The man's eyes reflect no immediate sensation. His speech 
falters but only slightly.

LOGAN
...YOU SHALL FOREVER KNOW THE PAIN... THE 
PAIN...

THE ZOMBIE pulls LOGAN towards its DROOLING, WIDE OPEN MOUTH. It's 
just about to bite when DIESEL CHOPS HIS MACHETE INTO THE CENTER OF 
THE CREATURE'S SKULL. The thing falls, pulling LOGAN, still hooked, 
to the ground with it.

LOGAN
YOU SHALL FOREVER KNOW THE PAIN OF HELL... 
THE PAIN OF HELL.

DIESEL frees the doctor's shoulder from the hook. BLOOD FLOWS FREELY. 
DIESEL grabs a handful of DRESSINGS from LOGAN'S PACK and goes to 
work on the wound.

LOGAN
...the pain of Hell...the pain...the 
pain...

115	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE VENTS - NIGHT

SARAH, SALLY, LUKEY AND McDERMOTT stand by while JOHN AND TOBY swing 
open THE RUSTED GRILLWORK OF AN AIR-VENT in the ground. TOBY is able 
to swing his upper torso completely down inside.

116	INT. THE VENT - NIGHT

TOBY hangs up-side-down in A RUSH OF AIR. He tightens A HOSPITAL MASK 
over his nose and mouth.

TOBY
Okay. Lemme have 'em.

A LEAF BAG is passed in from above. TOBY flags the bag open and BITS 
OF FLOWER AND POLLEN DUST FLY through the tight space, sucked off 
into the duct.

117	INT. THE COMMUNICATION ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE ON: A GRILL NEAR THE CEILING. BITS OF TOXIC POLLEN and AN 
OCCASIONAL PIECE OF FLOWER blow into the room.

There are SIX TECHNICIANS AND TWO SECURITY GUARDS posted at various 
stations. A RADIO MAN looks up.

RADIO MAN
What's that? Smell it?

TECHNICIAN
Dunno. Must be comin' from outside. Kinda 
nice.

118	INT. ENTRANCE NUMBER SEVEN - NIGHT

There are only TWO GUARDS posted at the sealed entrance. One is 
eating from A CAN OF SPAM. The other is reading an old, dog-eared 
PLAYBOY. A RIFLE BARREL jabs suddenly into "Playboy's" back.

JULIE
Don't move!

It's JULIE GRANT, Mary's disgruntled assistant. A YOUNG MAN, another 
behaviouralist in a WHITE LAB COAT is with her. They both have 
RIFLES.

JULIE
Open the outer door. Move it!

"Playboy" slowly gets up and starts towards A CONTROL PANEL. At the 
last minute, he spins around, grabbing JULIE'S GUN BARREL and pushing 
it away. JULIE'S YOUNG ACCOMPLICE swings his RIFLE BUTT and knocks 
"Playboy" cold. Then he trains the weapon on "Spam man" again.

JULIE moves to the controls, examines them, trips A TOGGLE marked 
"LOCK" and pushes A LARGE GREEN BUTTON.

THE DOOR TO THE OUTSIDE SWINGS OPEN. Beyond is blackness with an 
occasional patch of MOONLIGHT ON JUNGLE GROWTH. JULIE walks slowly, 
carefully toward the opening. Just as she is about to cross the 
threshold into the night, A HUGE FIGURE leaps at her, grabbing her 
RIFLE and enclosing her in a strangle hold. It's DIESEL. Behind him, 
comes JACK, his RIFLE (Sarah's rifle) levelled off at JULIE'S YOUNG 
FRIEND.

"Spam man" makes a break for it down the hall. Reacting nervously, 
too quickly, JACK FIRES. "SPAM MAN" IS HIT SQUARELY IN THE BACK. He 
pitches forward, dead.

THE YOUNG SCIENTIST raises his gun.

YOUNG MAN
Hey! What the hell.....?

JACK FIRES ANOTHER BURST and the ORANGE CIRCLE ON THE YOUNG MAN'S 
CHEST SHOW A DOTTED LINE OF RED. He flies back, a surprised 
expression on his face, and he flops, dead, right on top of the 
"Playboy" guard who is lying near the control booth.

LOGAN
ENOUGH! ENOUGH! ENOUGH! ENOUGH!

THE DOC comes slowly out of the night guiding SPIDER over the 
threshold and into the hall. LOGAN reminds us of a crazy John 
Houston, floating on air in a madman's bubble.

JULIE
What...what is this? Who...?

LOGAN
It's alright, it's alright, my dear. You've 
simply helped us do the Lord's work.

LOGAN'S SHOULDER WOUND IS BLEEDING THROUGH ITS DRESSINGS but the 
doctor, on a holy mission, seems to feel no pain. He guides SPIDER 
into the light and opens her shirt. DIESEL shoves JULIE against a 
wall. JACK covers her with his AUTOMATIC.

LOGAN removes RED-SOAKED DRESSING from SPIDER'S skin. All over her 
bare chest and upper belly we see LONG, EIGHT-INCH SCARS, HASTILY 
STITCHED WITH SUTURE SHOWING. Beneath each is A CIGAR-SHAPED BULGE 
where a vial of nitro has been implanted. The woman stands on 
crumbling legs, her arms open outward, a grotesque lampoon of a 
stigmatic.

JULIE
What...what have you done to her?

LOGAN
God forgive us. Forgive us the pain we 
inflict as surgeons. We'll be in Heaven, 
child. Soon. We'll be with Him in Heaven.

SPIDER
Na...na...ak...aaaaaaaaaa...

SPIDER is trying to signal something. She has seen that "PLAYBOY" is 
crawling into the control booth. LOGAN follows her alarmed gaze.

LOGAN
NO YOU DON'T I CAN'T LET YOU DO THAT! I 
CAN'T!

LOGAN charges toward the booth. THE GUARD is half-in-half-out of the 
glass chamber, his hands reaching for the control panel inside. LOGAN 
starts to kick him, again and again.

JACK
Outa the way, Doc! Outa the way!

There's vengeance on LOGAN'S face. He's kicking THE GUARD brutally, 
but that doesn't stop the man from reaching the controls. He hits A 
RED ALARM BUTTON. THE PANEL BUZZES AND COLOURED LIGHTS BLINK. THE 
DOOR to the jungle starts to swing closed. DIESEL dives at it but 
can't stop the steel slab. It slams with A LOUD THUNNNNNG!

JACK swings into another position to get a clear shot and he FIRES A 
LONG BURST into the control booth. "PLAYBOY" IS STRUCK BY SEVERAL 
ROUNDS. He bounces around in the booth and collapses to the floor, 
dead.

LOGAN, his SHOULDER WOUND POURING BLOOD, aggravated by his physical 
exertion, falls to floor himself, in a faint.

JACK
Shit!

DIESEL
Keep the woman covered.

JACK levels off on JULIE again. DIESEL moves over to SPIDER. Pulling 
FRESH DRESSING from LOGAN'S BAG, the big man begins to pack them onto 
SPIDER'S BLEEDING CHEST.

119	INT. THE COMMUNICATION ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE ON: A BLINKING RECTANGLE OF RED LIGHT. Written on its face is: 
ALARM - GATE 7. A BELL RINGS LOUDLY in the room. THE SHOT WIDENS and 
we see FIVE MEN, all slumped, unconscious, none able to react to the 
alarm.

ONE OF THE SECURITY GUARDS has made it to THE EXIT. He manages to 
push the door open, but then he falls in a heap.

A RADIO MAN staggers into A WEBBING OF WIRES, then he too falls.

THE OTHER SECURITY GUARD inches his hand towards A LEVER WITH A 
PROTECTIVE COVER. He flips the cover up, then collapses. The falling 
action causes his fingers to trip the lever. A HUGE KLAXON SOUNDS. A 
BLINKING RECTANGLE, huge over the doors, reads: GENERAL ALERT!

120	INT. GASPARILLA'S GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

The usual scene here, GASPARILLA AND HIS COURTESANS entertaining THE 
COUNCILMEN AND THEIR LADIES. THE KLAXON SOUNDS over THE LOUD ROCK 
MUSIC. MARY HENRIED, a prisoner for the evening again, hears THE 
SOUND. Her eyes widen. She looks over at RHODES, who jumps to his 
feet. The party gradually goes silent.

RHODES
Don't be alarmed. We're impregnable. Stay 
where you are. Nothing will happen to any 
of you. You're safe here. Men.

This last word to A SMALL UNIT OF FOUR TROOPERS standing guard at THE 
EXIT. RHODES goes steaming through the doors. TWO OF THE TROOPERS 
FOLLOW, THE OTHER TWO unsling their RIFLES and take up posts just 
outside in the corridor. THE STEEL DOOR SLIDES SHUT locking 
GASPARILLA AND HIS COURT inside the gymnasium...MARY HENRIED with 
them.

GASPARILLA
Well, c'mon, ladies and gents. Who says we 
gotta let our evenin' get spoiled? Simon 
sez...GET DOWN!!!

MOST OF THE GUESTS are willing to let the party get back to full 
swing. GASPARILLA grabs A TOPLESS COURTESAN and rocks his fat belly 
around in an attempted dance. MARY seems to be the only one concerned 
about the alarm.

121	EXT. THE JUNGLE - NIGHT

Even outside THE KLAXON CAN BE HEARD. TOBY AND THE REBELS stop in 
their tracks.

TOBY
That's the general alarm. Jesus! They musta 
got in!

JOHN
What you wanna do?

TOBY
Come on!

THE GROUP moves out urgently.

122	INT. ENTRANCE NUMBER TWO - NIGHT

A CIRCULAR LIGHT BLINKS GREEN with A BUZZING SOUND. THE TWO INSIDE 
GUARDS punch up A VIDEO MONITOR. The screen shows TOBY TYLER AND 
LUKEY holding PISTOLS on SALLY AND BILL McDERMOTT.

GUARD
(into intercom) What's goin' on?

TOBY (filter)
(on video) LET US IN. THERE'S BEEN A 
REVOLT...AT STALAG SEVENTEEN...THERE'S 
REBELS CRAWLIN' EVERYWHERE!

GUARD #2
I know him. That's Tyler.

TOBY (filter)
(on video) FER CHRISSAKE! LEMME IN, DAMMIT! 
LEMME IN!

THE FIRST GUARD HITS A BUTTON AND THE BIG STEEL ENTRANCE DOOR SWINGS 
OPEN. THE REBELS storm in like an ocean wave taking the hapless 
GUARDS completely by surprise. They knock them unconscious and take 
their WEAPONS. TOBY pushes A BUTTON which causes the outer door to 
swing shut, then he leads the band down the corridor.

They go through A DOOR about a hundred yards from the entrance.

123	INT. MAINTENANCE SHAFT - NIGHT

This is one of the WORK CORRIDORS that TOBY mentioned earlier. THE 
REBELS run, single-file, deep into the Cave.

124	INT. ENTRANCE SEVEN - NIGHT

JULIE GRANT has been ROPE-TIED to an eyelet in the wall. DIESEL sets 
down A PISTOL AND A BOX OF AMMO beside DOC LOGAN who is sitting on 
the floor beside the control booth. He's having trouble catching his 
breath. His WOUND has turned his ENTIRE FRONT RED.

DIESEL
You'd hold us back. We have to go on.

LOGAN
Hmmmmmm? Oh, yes. Go on.

SPIDER, her shirt buttoned again over her new dressings, is carefully 
signing something. DIESEL reads her fingers.

DIESEL
Maps. Yes. She was supposed to bring us 
maps.

JACK steps over to JULIE. He frisks her pockets and finds TWO HAND-
DRAWN MAPS showing complete layouts of the Cave.

DIESEL
Alright. Let's go.

They move out, DIESEL supporting SPIDER, JACK with his RIFLE ready.

125	INT. A SUPPLY CLOSET - NIGHT

TOBY breaks open A CARTON and pulls GAS MASKS out. He passes them 
back to BILL McDERMOTT AND SARAH.

126	INT. THE COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT

THE REBELS, all wearing GAS MASKS, burst into the room. TOBY moves 
right toward AN INTERCOM. He punches in a code and waits while the 
INTERCOM BUZZES.

TOBY
Come on, Mary. Answer. ANSWER!

Nothing. Toby punches up another code while the others drag THE 
UNCONSCIOUS GUARD out of the doorway, letting the doors shut behind 
them. A VOICE comes over the speakers.

TRICKS (o.s. - filter)
Yeah.

TOBY
Tricks, it's Tyler. We're inside.

TRICKS (o.s. - filter)
What? Was that you that set off the alarms?

TOBY
No. There's some loonies from outside. 
They're gonna try to blow the powder 
magazine.

TRICKS (o.s. - filter)
Where are you? What's the plan?

TOBY
Find Mary. If you can get help do it. We're 
gonna hit the power station and haul-ass 
outa here. We'll be at exit five...that's 
exit five in exactly ten minutes.

TRICKS (o.s. - filter)
I think I can get a couple guys.

TOBY
And Mary! You gotta find Mary!

TRICKS (o.s. - filter)
I'll try, Tob. I'm gone.

TRICKS clicks off. TOBY levels his AUTOMATIC at the RADIO CONSOLE and 
FIRES. SPARKS FLY, CHUNKS OF WOOD AND METAL SHOOT OFF IN EVERY 
DIRECTION.

McDERMOTT
HOLD ON! HOLD ON! Yer wastin' yer 
ammunition. Hit 'er in here...then around 
back in the circuit boards.

TOBY levels off again, this time at the "kill-zones". BULLETS FLY. 
MORE SPARKS DANCE as THE UNIT BREAKS APART.

McDERMOTT
(shouting) AND OVER HERE. THE ALARM 
SYSTEMS. THESE CENTRAL PANELS HERE. THESE 
CIRCUITS.

SARAH AND SALLY step up and start BLASTING. A PROFUSION OF SPARKS 
this time as THE ALARM SYSTEMS SEEM TO EXPLODE.

Suddenly A COLLECTION OF RED LIGHTS START BLINKING URGENTLY. A BELL 
SOUNDS. THE LARGE RECTANGLE OVER THE EXIT IS FLASHING A NEW WORD: 
EVACUATE! EVACUATE! EVACUATE!

McDERMOTT
Jesus, Mary and Joseph! (he slugs from his 
flask) By blowin' the alarm panels...we 
signalled an Evac!

127	INT. CORRIDORS IN THE CAVE - NIGHT

MONTAGE: A LOUD BUZZING IS HEARD as DOORS OPEN everywhere, some 
sliding, some swinging back, some rolling into the walls. TROOPERS 
caught trotting through halls are taken by surprise. CITIZENS spill 
out of apartment doors that have opened electronically.

128	INT. ENTRANCE SEVEN - NIGHT

THE DOOR TO THE JUNGLE SWING OPEN. JULIE GRANT looks over at DOC 
LOGAN. The madman struggles to his feet. Supporting himself against 
the wall of the control booth, he reaches inside and starts pushing 
buttons.

JULIE
Those buttons won't work! The evacuation 
command overrides them.

JULIE looks through the open entranceway. Barely visible in the DIM 
BLUE MOONLIGHT are the hulking shapes of TWO...NO THREE ZOMBIES, 
approaching the open hatch.

129	INT. THE COMMUNICATION ROOM - NIGHT

McDERMOTT is explaining to the others.

McDERMOTT
All the doors in the Cave have been sprung 
open...all the ones that work on electric. 
It's so nobody'll get trapped anywhere.

130	INT. ENTRANCE SEVEN - NIGHT

LOGAN stares dumbly, without comprehending, at THE ZOMBIES which are 
lurching forward out of the night.

JULIE
CUT ME LOOSE! PLEASE! CUT ME LOOSE!

131	INT. THE DORMITORY - NIGHT

THE LATCHES ON THE CELL DOOR CLICK. With BUZZING, MOTOR NOISES, THE 
DOORS OPEN OUTWARD. THE ARMY OF RED COATS marches out into the hall. 
We might recognise TONTO, BLUTO, SAMSON....we certainly recognise big 
Bub.

132	INT. A HOLDING PEN IN THE CAVE - NIGHT

We see A LARGE PEN, its GATE SWINGING OPEN. From inside, MOANING 
HUNGRILY, come FORTY OR FIFTY ZOMBIES, BLUE COATS AND WHITE.

GUARDS outside the pen start to panic. They OPEN FIRE. A FEW ZOMBIES 
ARE HIT but there are too many, way too many. THE GUARDS turn tail 
and retreat off into the Cave.

THE ZOMBIES are out! Free to find their own suppers!

133	INT. THE GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

THE DOORS have opened here, too. THE CROWD, having heard the 
EVACUATION SIGNAL, is panicking. MANY are running out past THE GUARDS 
and into the hallway. GASPARILLA is trying to reinstate calm.

GASPARILLA
STAY HERE! STAY PUT! WE'LL BE ALRIGHT! 
WE'RE SAFE HERE! JUST AS SAFE AS ANYWHERE 
'TIL WE FIND OUT WHAT'S GOIN' ON!

MARY HENRIED takes advantage of the confusion. She slips out behind 
TWO COUNCILMEN AND THEIR LADY-FRIENDS.

134	INT. NURSERY CORRIDOR - NIGHT

THE HALLWAY is in chaos. TROOPERS run by, CRAZED CITIZENS flee in 
both directions. MARY HENRIED is stopped by A NURSE standing in AN 
OPEN DOORWAY.

NURSE
What is it? What's happening?

MARY
It's an evacuation signal. The radios are 
out. People are panicking.

NURSE
What should we do?

MARY looks past THE NURSE into A ROOM where A GROUP OF CHILDREN, a 
dozen or so, ranging from twelve-years-old down to infancy, are 
huddled. Some are crying.

MARY
God. I, er...I dunno what to say. It could 
be a real evacuation or it could just be a 
glitch in the system. Wait here for now. 
I'll...I'll make sure you get the word what 
to do, okay?

NURSE
Please...hurry...

MARY takes off down the hall.

135	INT. ENTRANCE SEVEN - NIGHT

CLOSE ON: JULIE GRANT'S FACE, screaming, in agony, on the brink of 
insanity. THE ZOMBIES have reached her. They're started to pull at 
her arms, her legs. ONE BITES HER HAND, ANOTHER HER ARM, ANOTHER HER 
CALF.

DOC LOGAN is watching from the control booth, all the while fiddling 
with BUTTONS, DIALS, LEVERS.

LOGAN
We'll be in Heaven soon. We'll all be in 
Heaven soon.
(Julie's screams penetrate the fog in his 
brain. He frowns.)
Pain. God forgive the pain inflicted by 
surgeons. We must atone. We must atone for 
our sins.

His eye is attracted to A LARGE LEVER seemingly separate from 
everything else. It's marked: SIREN. He pulls it.

LOGAN
We must...atone. We must.

136	EXT. THE SIREN HORN - NIGHT

Slowly, THE THROATY WAIL RISES and calls out over the jungle. It's 
the "Feeding Signal" we heard earlier.

137	EXT. THE JUNGLE - NIGHT

MONTAGE: as everywhere in the jungle ZOMBIES turn toward the call of 
THE SIREN. They start to walk...toward the SOUND, toward the place 
where there is food.

138	INT. ENTRANCE SEVEN - NIGHT

JULIE is still screaming wildly. THE ZOMBIES ARE TEARING HER APART, 
LITERALLY.

DOC LOGAN inadvertently kicks THE PISTOL left by DIESEL and is 
skitters across the floor. He flops down on his knees.

LOGAN
WE WILL ATONE. WE WILL BE THE 
SACRIFICE...THE COMMUNION...WE OFFER 
OURSELVES UP...OUR SOUL...AND OUR BODIES...

JULIE GRANT finally loses consciousness. MANY MORE ZOMBIES are 
pressing in through the entrance now. They reach LOGAN and start to 
tear at him. Something clicks in his brain and he realises what's 
happening. He starts to scream. His hands find THE PISTOL on the 
floor.

ONE ZOMBIE TAKES A BITE OUT OF HIS LEFT ARM. He shrieks and brings up 
THE PISTOL, FIRING. THE FIRST SHOT RIPS OPEN THE CREATURE'S SKULL. 
The next FIVE SHOTS are wasted, FIRED WILDLY. The GUN CLICKS emptily 
as THE ZOMBIES engulf him, TEARING, BITING, EATING HIM ALIVE.

MORE ZOMBIES come out of the jungle...a lot more...called by the 
SIREN. In waves they enter the Cave looking for food.

139	INT. A CORRIDOR IN THE CAVE - NIGHT

TRICKS is running through the hall with TWO BUDDIES. MARY HENRIED 
jumps out of the crowd.

MARY
Tricks! What's going on?

TRICKS
Toby's in the Cave. We're gonna make our 
move. There's rebels out to blow the powder 
magazine. Come on. Come with us.

MARY
Where are you goin' out?

TRICKS
Exit five.

MARY
See ya there.

She turns away and starts back in the direction she came from. TRICKS 
calls after her.

TRICKS
SEVEN MINUTES, MARY. EXACTLY SEVEN MINUTES!

140	INT. THE MAIN CHAMBER OF THE CAVE - NIGHT

RHODES AND EIGHT TROOPERS turn a corridor and there, before them, is 
a sight out of Dracula's tomb. Moving through the lava-stone arches, 
between the giant earthen pillars, is THE ARMY OF BLUE AND WHITE 
ZOMBIES. RHODES and his men can't possibly fight them, there are too 
many. RHODES spots A DOOR WITH A CAGED RED LIGHT OVERHEAD. They can 
get to it by slicing through only A FEW OF THE ADVANCING GHOULS.

RHODES
THIS WAY. OVER HERE! SHOOT! SHOOT THEM! 
SHOOT TO KILL! IN THE HEAD!

Their RIFLES BLAZE as they drive through the edge of THE ZOMBIE 
HORDE. SEVERAL OF THE CREATURES GO DOWN, THEIR HEADS BLASTED OPEN BY 
RAPID-FIRE ROUNDS.

ONE grabs RHODES by the sleeve of his jacket. The captain turns on 
his heels and stares at the thing with outraged disbelief. He raises 
his MAGNUM and pumps TWO QUICK SHELLS INTO THE CREATURE'S BRAIN.

THE PLATOON finally reaches the door. RHODES holds it open while his 
MEN run inside. He holsters his PISTOL and unslings his AUTOMATIC. 
THE ZOMBIES press towards him. He selects A FEW OF THE CLOSEST ONES, 
aims, and FIRES, with a look of enjoyment on his face. For a moment 
he resembles Doc Logan, madness bristling inside him.

THE ZOMBIES fall, THEIR HEADS SHATTERED, ONE OF RHODES' MEN calls 
from inside the doorway.

TROOPER
Captain...CAPTAIN!

RHODES FIRES ANOTHER QUICK BURST, then he turns and moves through the 
doorway.

141	INT. A CORRIDOR IN THE CAVE - NIGHT

SPIDER is walking along, careful to avoid jolts, support-under her 
arms by the giant DIESEL. JACK walks with them, his nervousness 
irritated by the need to move slowly. CITIZENS run past, none of them 
paying attention to the desperadoes.

Suddenly they encounter A TROOP OF SOLDIER who come trotting around a 
corner. Nervous JACK OPENS FIRE. TWO SOLDIER GO DOWN. A gunfight 
erupts as the rest of the TROOPS scatter in the hallway, CIVILIANS 
are caught in the crossfire. TWO ARE HIT.

DIESEL manages to steer SPIDER around a corner to safety. JACK keeps 
FIRING but he's trapped in A HAIL OF BULLETS. A RED LINE CUTS ACROSS 
HIS CHEST and he flies back, dead, his GUN STILL FIRING.

Out of the Troopers' sight, DIESEL checks his map and moves into A 
DOORWAY, one of several on the area, guiding SPIDER through beside 
him.

142	INT. ANOTHER MAINTENANCE SHAFT - NIGHT

They find themselves in one of those work corridors. The giant man 
shoulder his RIFLE and gently lifts SPIDER into his arms. He moves, 
as smoothly as he can, down the shaft and around a bend.

143	INT. A CORRIDOR IN THE CAVE - NIGHT

TOBY leads JOHN AND THE REBELS out into A HALLWAY. They break across 
to an opposite door. Before they can escape, A TROOP OF SOLDIERS 
appears. A GUNFIGHT ENSUES.

TWO SOLDIERS GO DOWN. JOHN IS WOUNDED IN THE SHOULDER but he stays on 
his feet. THE SOLDIERS have them divided in the two opposite 
doorways.

Suddenly, TRICKS AND HIS BUDDIES come charging around a corner. THEY 
OPEN FIRE. THE SOLDIERS RESPOND. TWO MORE SOLDIERS GO DOWN. ONE OF 
TRICKS' MEN IS KILLED. TRICKS himself IS WOUNDED BADLY IN THE 
STOMACH.

Caught in a crossfire, THE LAST FOUR TROOPERS throw down their guns. 
They flee wildly down the corridor. THE REBELS pick up and file 
through one of the doors. TOBY rushes to aid his BADLY WOUNDED BUDDY.

TOBY
Tricks...Jesus...

TRICKS
I'm alright. Let's go.

They follow after the others.

144	INT. THE GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

A SCREAM GOES UP! A WOMAN near the exit has spotted something 
terrifying in the hallway. THE GUARDS panic. ONE OF THEM OPENS FIRE.

145	INT. THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

A MASS OF ZOMBIES COME SHUFFLING DOWN THE CORRIDOR. Their VOICES ECHO 
IN GROTESQUE HARMONY, the song of the living dead that we've heard 
before.

146	INT. THE GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

THE GUARDS are trying to close the entrance doors manually. The big 
slabs won't budge. Suddenly GASPARILLA appears. Drawing A PISTOL from 
A HOLSTER he wears, without warning he SHOOTS ONE OF THE GUARDS. THE 
OTHER GUARD flees.

GASPARILLA falls onto the dead man and rips off his ORANGE-CIRCLE 
VEST. THE ZOMBIES are pressing in now, into the gymnasium. GASPARILLA 
AND SEVERAL REMAINING PARTY-GOERS (none with vests) are trapped.

147	INT. A CORRIDOR NEAR THE DORMITORY - NIGHT

MARY is running along with THE NURSE AND THE CHILDREN. Suddenly, from 
out of a doorway, comes CAPTAIN RHODES WITH HIS STORM TROOPERS.

RHODES
HENRIED! WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

Without answering, MARY leads her band through A MANUAL DOOR that 
leads to the Dormitory.

RHODES
STOP THEM! SHOOT!

SOLDIER
The...the children, sir.

RHODES
After them then! I want them stopped! That 
woman is dangerous!

148	INT. THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE DORMITORY - NIGHT

MARY AND HER REFUGEES are stopped in their tracks by BUB AND HIS 
CADRE OF RED COATS. THE NURSE screams and tries to back away. THE 
CHILDREN cling to her, petrified, shrieking, starting to cry.

BUB lumbers up to MARY and...salutes. MARY returns the formality.

MARY
It's alright. I don't think they'll hurt 
us. Try to stay calm.

149	INT. THE OUTER CORRIDOR - NIGHT

THE MANUAL DOOR has been locked from inside.

RHODES
SHOOT IT OPEN!

THE SOLDIERS follow orders, TWO OF THEM FIRING AT THE LOCK.

150	INT. THE FIRING RANGE - NIGHT

MARY is at A CABINET pulling out PISTOLS AND RIFLES, passing the 
weapons around to TONTO, BLUTO, SAMSON. BUB is strapping on his TWO-
GUN HOLSTER SET all by himself, fumbling a little, but succeeding.

151	INT. THE CORRIDOR WITH RHODES - NIGHT

RHODES' MEN kick open the door and charge into the Dormitory 
corridor.

152	INT. THE FIRING RANGE - NIGHT

THE NURSE slams ANOTHER MANUAL DOOR, locking and bolting it.

NURSE
They're coming! They're coming!

She hurries along the caged alley behind the firing stalls guiding 
THE CHILDREN to an opposite exit.

BLAM! BLAM! MARY IS FIRING at AN ORANGE CIRCLE VEST on one of the cut 
out target figures in the range. THE RED COATS are watching with 
curiosity, cocking their heads.

MARY moves to fire again but BLUTO grabs her hand.

MARY
NO...BLUTO...I'M TRYING TO...

The dumb creature keeps his grip. MARY has to appease to him. She 
grasps his hand and shakes vigorously. When he finally lets go, she 
aims her PISTOL again and FIRES AT THE VEST SEVERAL MORE TIMES.

MARY
Look. It's good to shoot the circles. Good. 
Good.

THE ZOMBIES are confused. Exasperated, MARY tears off her own vest 
and tosses it down the alley. THE RED COATS look befuddled, and a 
little angry. MARY FIRES at the vest she threw down. TWO BULLETS HIT 
IT before MARY'S PISTOL CLICKS...empty.

There's A POUNDING AT THE DOOR. It's RHODES AND HIS TROOP.

Suddenly BUB steps into position. WHAP! One of his famous quick 
draws! BLAM!!! HE FIRES. THE VEST ON THE FLOOR, MARY'S VEST, IS HIT. 
BUB FIRES AGAIN, the other gun this time. THE VEST ON THE TARGET IS 
HIT squarely in the center of its orange circle.

TONTO now turns. He lifts his PISTOL and FIRES. THE VEST ON THE 
TARGET IS HIT AGAIN, off center, but hit.

MARY
THAT'S IT! THAT'S IT!

Suddenly THE DOOR AT THE END OF THE RANGE FLIES OPEN. THREE OF 
RHODES' MEN RUSH IN, wearing, of course, orange circles. THE RED 
COATS OPEN FIRE. THE TROOPERS ARE CUT TO RIBBONS. Others outside the 
door duck back behind the walls.

THE ZOMBIES lumber toward the open doorway, STILL FIRING AS THEY GO. 
MARY is backing away through the opposite exit. BUB sees her leaving. 
He calls to her with a deep, pleading moan. MARY stops and looks at 
him sadly. He shoots off a military salute. MARY salutes him back. 
There are tears in her eyes.

She turns and hurries off. BUB joins his fellows in pursuit of 
Rhodes' and his men.

153	INT. THE GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

A WOMAN'S FACE IS FULL SCREEN. She is screaming in agony as she is 
TORN APART BY ZOMBIES. The creatures have invaded the gymnasium. 
They're CLAWING AT THE FAT-CAT COUNCILLORS, MAULING THEIR WOMEN.

GASPARILLA AND TWO OTHER MEN are rolling around crazily, bumping into 
exercise machines, knocking over wine bottles and tables full of 
hors-d'oeuvres. The single vest they are fighting over rips apart 
into two pieces, its orange circle severed into two useless halves.

GASPARILLA backs across the floor, his blubber bouncing. He has a 
tattered piece of the vest clutched in his hands. He tries to spread 
it out on his chest but it's too late... and THE ZOMBIES are too 
hungry...much too hungry.

MONTAGE: as ALL OVER THE ROOM THEY STRIKE. This is it, gore fans. The 
gross finale. The intestine-tugger. THE ZOMBIES GET THEIR SUPPER. 
THEY FEAST AMONG THE PILLOWS, like Romans at an orgy. MUSIC still 
plays over the gymnasium speakers, rock-a-billy in a gleeful tempo.

GASPARILLA has retreated into his tanning-coffin but a pudgy arm and 
a leg are dangling outside. ZOMBIES CHEW HUNGRILY on the juicy 
morsels. From inside the coffin, where ultraviolet glows brightly, 
come the piercing, agonised screams of the fat General.

154	INT. THE MAIN CHAMBER OF THE CAVE - NIGHT

DIESEL guides SPIDER through the huge earthen archways. ZOMBIES here 
are scattered now, but they provide for delays. DIESEL FIRES and 
ZOMBIES ARE HIT but few are hit fatally. DIESEL'S free arm can't fire 
accurately while he's trying to support the walking bomb beside him.

DIESEL stops to check his map. A ZOMBIE looms up behind him and takes 
a HUGE BITE OUT OF HIS SHOULDER. DIESEL screams. He lets go of SPIDER 
who stumbles away from him, almost falling but saving herself. Her 
eyes are bugging with pain.

DIESEL FIRES POINT BLANK AT THE ZOMBIE, BLOWING ITS HEAD TO BITS. 
MORE CREATURES are pressing in close. DIESEL bats at one, kicks 
another, punches a third. Then he rushes to SPIDER'S side and scoops 
her into his arms again. Wincing in pain from THE BLEEDING WOUND IN 
HIS SHOULDER he manages to move out of immediate danger.

THE ZOMBIES lumber after the two, groaning in chorus as they walk.

155	INT. THE CORRIDOR AT EXIT FIVE - NIGHT

MARY, THE NURSE AND THE CHILDREN come charging down the hall. TOBY, 
SARAH, AND JOHN are waiting for them near the open door which leads 
out into the jungle. TOBY AND MARY rush into each other's arms and 
they flee, with the others, out into the night.

156	INT. A CORRIDOR NEAR THE DORMITORY - NIGHT

RHODES AND HIS MEN rush into another corridor where they are met by a 
crowd of DROOLING ZOMBIES. THE MEN OPEN FIRE but the ZOMBIES are too 
close in. They get the upper hand.

RHODES FIRES HIS MAGNUM, his eyes insane, his face boiling red with 
disbelief. After TWO SHOTS BLAST OPEN THE HEADS OF THE CLOSEST 
ZOMBIES, THE MAGNUM just CLICK-CLICK-CLICKS! RHODES is out of lead.

He's grabbed by ONE ZOMBIE, then ANOTHER. He fights to free himself 
but HE'S BITTEN ONCE...TWICE...

BLEEDING, he fights on. He struggles to a doorway and pushes through.

157	INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR - NIGHT

RHODES comes face-to-face with...you guessed it...big BUB. THE ZOMBIE 
faces off, ready to draw those SIX-GUNS that hang at his hips. RHODES 
turns and runs.

WHAP! BUB slaps leather. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! RHODES turns a corner but 
ONE BULLET BITES HIM ON THE BACK OF HIS SHOULDER. Terrified, fighting 
pain, he staggers on with the gun-totin' RED COAT following behind.

158	EXT. THE JUNGLE - NIGHT

THE REBELS lead MARY, THE NURSE AND THE CHILDREN through the 
underneath. TRICKS is bleeding badly. TOBY helps him along. Suddenly, 
as they break into a clearing, SARAH stops cold. There on the ground, 
lying where we last saw it, is THE CORPSE OF MIGUEL.

JOHN
What is it?

SARAH
It's...he was...one who came to the island 
with me.

TOBY
Come on. No time.

SARAH
He was killed...five days ago.

MARY
Maybe...maybe he wasn't dead. Are you sure 
he was dead when you left him?

SARAH
Look at him. A hundred bullets. You tell 
me. Was he dead?

There are tears in SARAH'S eyes.

SARAH
Five days...and he hasn't...risen. He 
hasn't risen.

TOBY
Come on. There's no time. There's no time 
to lose.

THE GROUP pushes ahead. SARAH kneels. She blesses herself and makes 
the sign of the cross over the corpse. Then she stands to see that 
JOHN is waiting for her. He holds out his hand, she takes it and 
follows the others.

159	EXT. THE BACKWATER - NIGHT

THE SOLDIERS aboard THE FISHING BOAT hear NOISES coming from the 
surrounding jungle.

SOLDIER
WHO IS IT? WHO'S OUT THERE?

JOHN (o.s.)
WE WANT THE BOAT! DROP YER GUNS OR WE'LL 
BLAST YOU!

THE SOLDIERS hesitate, looking around at the dark jungle.

TOBY (o.s.)
WE GOT YOU SURROUNDED!

A SUDDEN BURST OF AUTOMATIC FIRE LIGHTS UP THE BLACK FOLIAGE. THE 
SOLDIERS react, flinging their WEAPONS over the side into the water.

THE REFUGEES spill out of the undergrowth and scramble over to the 
boat, lifting THE CHILDREN and THE WOUNDED TRICKS on board carefully.

JOHN pauses to look back into the jungle.

JOHN
Damn you, island. Damn you ta Hell and 
worse!

McDERMOTT
We ain't outa here yet. Get yer ass movin' 
ya dumb bastard.

McDERMOTT tries to slug from his flask, finds it empty. With a shrug 
he tosses the thing into the backwater. THE ENGINE STARTS as JOHN 
climbs aboard, SARAH AND TOBY giving him their hands.

160	INT. THE MAIN CHAMBER WITH DIESEL AND SPIDER - NIGHT

161	INT. THE LABORATORY AREA WITH RHODES AND BUB - NIGHT

(These two sequences will be intercut for parallel action)

ZOMBIES are crawling all over DIESEL now. He fights them off 
valiantly but his super strength is waning. HE IS BITTEN AGAIN AND 
AGAIN but he tries to keep himself between THE CLUTCHING CREATURES 
AND THE LITTLE DEAF MUTE who is stumbling along ahead. She's getting 
very close to a huge SET OF CONCRETE SLABS...THE DOORS TO THE POWDER 
MAGAZINE.

Meanwhile RHODES approaches another corner in the hallway near the 
Conditioning Room. BUB follows, his boot heels CLICKING the way 
RHODES' own heels once clicked.

RHODES dives for the corner. BUB slaps leather and FIRES OFF ALL 
TWELVE. RHODES rolls on the ground crazily. HE'S HIT SEVERAL 
TIMES...but he's still alive. He pulls himself, in agony, out of 
range. Calmly, BUB dumps out his spent shells and starts to reload.

IN THE MAIN CHAMBER, DIESEL IS OVERCOME, DRAGGED DOWN BY A MOB OF 
ZOMBIES. THEY START TO TEAR HIM APART BIT BY BIT.

SPIDER walks on alone. She is just a few feet from the POWDER 
MAGAZINE now. A ZOMBIE grabs her from behind but just gets a handful 
of shirt. SPIDER reaches forward but the creature holds her back. Her 
SHIRT IS RUNNING RIVERS OF BLOOD NOW where the vials are implanted 
underneath.

RHODES crashes through a doorway into THE CONDITIONING ROOM. He 
realises, too late, that there's no exit. BUB'S BOOTHEELS are getting 
LOUDER. RHODES crawls around behind THE TABLES FULL OF TESTING 
EQUIPMENT, WOODEN SHAPES, FLASH CARDS SCATTER. Over near the LARGE 
COLOURED SYMBOLS which are mounted on the wall there's A WEAPONS 
CABINET. RHODES grabs a chair and smashes open the glass.

BUB steps into the open doorway, still reloading his PISTOLS. He 
stands there, a golem, his fingers slowly, calmly working. He drops a 
shell or two but soon the barrels are filled with fresh loads.

RHODES reaches in through the broken glass and pulls out AN 
AUTOMATIC.

BUB slaps his PISTOLS back into their HOLSTERS and face off.

RHODES lifts the AUTOMATIC...aims...

BUB DRAWS! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! 
BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! EACH ONE OF THE TWELVE BULLETS HITS RHODES 
SOMEWHERE, many of them in the "kill-zones". He screams when the 
first few rounds hit, but his screaming stops about halfway through 
the barrage. That's when he dies. His leg bones support his corpse 
long enough for the last six bullets to reach him. Then, as THE SOUND 
OF BUB'S GUN ECHOES AWAY down the corridors, RHODES BODY slides down 
the wall and crumples to the floor in a heap, leaving MUCH OF HIS 
BLOOD on the ORANGE CIRCLE that's mounted behind him.

IN THE MAIN CHAMBER, A ZOMBIE TAKES A BITE OUT OF SPIDER'S SHOULDER. 
IT PULLS OUT A BIG CHUNK OF FLESH, AND WITH IT, STUCK IN THE 
CREATURE'S TEETH, COMES ONE OF THE NITRO VIALS.

SEVERAL ZOMBIES are pulling at the woman. She is still reaching for 
the POWDER MAGAZINE DOORS but the ghouls are pulling her away.

THE CREATURE WITH THE TEST TUBE IN ITS MOUTH pulls the bothersome 
thing out from between its teeth. It studies the vial curiously for a 
moment, then it tosses it angrily towards SPIDER, toward THE MAGAZINE 
DOOR...

KA-BLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!

162	INT. THE MAIN CHAMBER (EFX) - NIGHT

A HALLACIOUS FIREBALL RIPS THROUGH THE CAVE.

163	INT. THE CONDITIONING ROOM - NIGHT

BUB stands in the open doorway staring at RHODES' still twitching 
corpse. He slaps his SIX-GUNS back into their leather HOLSTERS, then 
he shoots off one of those military salutes of his....just as the 
walls fall in on him.

164	EXT. THE FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

THE REFUGEES stare toward the island as A HUGE BOOOOOM FILLS THE 
NIGHT. Some of the YOUNGER CHILDREN start to cheer as though watching 
fireworks on the Fourth of July.

165	EXT. GASPARILLA'S ISLAND (THEIR P.O.V.) - NIGHT

THE TOP BLOWS OFF THE ISLAND, just as TOBY predicted is would. It's 
as though an enormous underground volcano is exploding. It's a 
frightening...yet beautiful sight.

166	EXT. THE FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

TOBY looks back over his shoulder. THE NURSE is kneeling beside the 
body of TRICKS. He's dead. The woman pulls a blanket up over his 
head. TOBY steps forward, his PISTOL drawn. He pulls the hammer back 
and aims at TRICKS' head.

SARAH
No. Don't. Wait. Wait to see if... wait 
until it's necessary.

TOBY turns and looks at MARY. She nods. He releases the PISTOL HAMMER 
without firing.

DISSOLVE TO:

167	EXT. ANOTHER ISLAND (WIDE EST.) - MORNING

Gorgeous, a paradise. BIRDSONG fills the air.

168	EXT. A RIVER ON THE ISLAND - MORNING

THE REGUGEES are all gathered. THE CHILDREN walk, one by one, through 
the shallows as JOHN baptises them. SARAH, MARY AND THE NURSE carry 
the infants. When the infant in SARAH'S arms has been touched by 
JOHN'S hand, SARAH doesn't move on. Instead, she looks up into the 
big man's warm eyes.

SARAH
Me too...please.

JOHN gently cups a handful of river water and pours it on the woman's 
forehead.

THE OTHER ADULTS, led by LUKEY, file into the river, all lining up 
before the baptist, waiting their turns to be blessed into this tiny 
new society.

169	EXT. A BEACH ON THE ISLAND - MORNING

TRICKS' BODY lies covered in the sand. THE REFUGEES are gathered 
again, heads bowed, while JOHN speaks.

JOHN
Satan ain't sent this man back. Not yet, 
anyway. So we all hopin' that maybe he's up 
there with you, Lord. This might be the 
first decent soul we been able ta offer ya 
in quite a few years. That's a fact. We 
just gonna... pray, Lord. We gonna pray 
that what seems ta be happenin' here...is 
really happenin'...and I'm gonna take the 
chance and speak these words that I ain't 
been able ta speak for so long...

May he rest in peace

THE OTHERS
Amen.

170	EXT. THE BEACH - NIGHT

THE CORPSE lies in the MOONLIGHT. NIGHT CRITTERS SCREECH AND BURBLE 
in the jungle behind the sand. It's an eerie scene.

SARAH is sitting up, her RIFLE ready in her lap, watching the body. 
JOHN steps in behind and she startles.

JOHN
Just me. I'll take the next shift.

He settles easily down beside the woman. The two stare together at 
the shrouded corpse.

SARAH
How long do we have to watch him?

JOHN
Forever, darlin'. Forever. 'Til he turns ta 
dust and blows away on the wind.

THE BODY lies silent, rigid under the KHAKI ARMY BLANKET that rises 
and falls, rises and falls with the Gulf breeze.

Suddenly...A LOUD MUSIC CHORD! A SUDDEN MOVEMENT!

It's the movement of RED LETTERS that spin up off the head of the 
corpse and settle before our eyes.

The letters read: "THE END (I PROMISE)"
THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL

 
                             "THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL"

               EXT. BEACH - PACIFIC ISLAND - MED. SHOT - DAY

               Backgrounded by palm trees and rolling surf, an American 
               army radar operator sits at his huge instrument, intently 
               tracking a target. Without interrupting this, he speaks with 
               tense excitement into a telephone transmitter strapped to 
               his chest. (It is 8:00 a.m.)

               (In this and the subsequent scenes, music and cutting build 
               to an exciting crescendo).

               EXT. FIELD - HONG KONG - MED. SHOT - DAY

               A group of British soldiers, in shorts and tropical gear, 
               are gathered tensely around a piece of radar equipment, which 
               is tracking a target. The radar operator says something to 
               another soldier, who turns and speaks excitedly into a field 
               telephone. (It is 5:00 a.m.)

               INT. INDIAN RADIO STATION - NIGHT

               The microphone bears the word CALCUTTA. An Indian announcer, 
               his expression one of excitement and terror, jabbers into 
               the mike in a native tongue. A clock on the wall indicates 
               that it is 2:26

               EXT. RUSSIAN BOMBER IN FLIGHT - (STOCK) - NIGHT

               The plane is identified by a red star on the fuselage.

               INT. RUSSIAN BOMBER - NIGHT

               The radioman is tracking an object on his radar scope. He 
               points it out excitedly to the pilot. The pilot adjusts his 
               microphone and starts making a report back to his base in 
               Russian.

               EXT. FRENCH VILLAGE - STREET CORNER - MED. CLOSE SHOT - 
               NIGHT

               A group of French farmers is collected around a radio, 
               listening wide-eyed to the keyed-up voice which is telling 
               them, in French, of a strange object that has been seen in 
               the sky. They exchange uneasy glances. One old man crosses 
               himself.

               SPLIT SCREEN SHOT

               RIGHT SECTION OF SCREEN SHOWS INT. AMERICAN RADIO STATION - 
               DAY

               A breathless American radio reporter is speaking into his 
               mike, but we can't hear what he's saying. On the wall behind 
               him is a clock which reads 3:32.

               LEFT SECTION OF SCREEN SHOWS INT. BRITISH RADIO STATION - 
               NIGHT

               A clock shows the time to be 8:32. The British announcer 
               tries to maintain his traditional BBC calm, but finds it 
               almost impossible to control his excitement.

                                     BRITISH ANNOUNCER
                         Reports are coming in from all over 
                         the Empire -- from all over the world. 
                         The Government have not yet issued a 
                         statement, but there seems to be no 
                         question that there actually is a 
                         large, unidentified object circling 
                         the earth at incredible speed.

               This announcer keeps talking, but his voice fades out, and 
               now we hear the words the American announcer is saying...

                                     AMERICAN ANNOUNCER
                              (staccato with 
                              excitement)
                         We still don't know what it is or 
                         where it's from - but we do know 
                         there's something there. It's been 
                         tracked around the world by radar 
                         traveling at a rate of four thousand 
                         miles an hour.

               INT. NEW YORK TAXI - DRIVER AND FARE  DAY

               The driver and his fare are listening intently to the radio, 
               as we hear the voice of another radio reporter.

                                     2ND RADIO REPORTER
                              (voice off scene)
                         This is not another "flying saucer" 
                         scare. Scientists and military men 
                         have already agreed on that. Whatever 
                         this is -- it's something real.

               EXT. SUBURBAN GAS STATION

               The attendant, who is filling a car with gas, leans around 
               to hear the car's radio, oblivious to the fact that the car's 
               tank is overflowing.

                                     3RD RADIO REPORTER

                         you a bulletin just received from 
                         one of our naval units at sea. "A 
                         large object, traveling at supersonic 
                         speed, is headed over the North 
                         Atlantic toward the east coast of 
                         the United States."

               Music builds to a climax and ends.

                              (with deliberately 
                              controlled calm)
                         Here in the nation's capital, there 
                         is anxiety and concern, but no outward 
                         sign of panic. As a matter of fact, 
                         there are signs of normalcy that 
                         seem strangely out of place; the 
                         beautiful spring weather, the tourist 
                         crowds at the various monuments and 
                         public buildings...

               EXT. LINCOLN MEMORIAL - LONG SHOT (STOCK)

               A small crowd of tourists is climbing the steps to the 
               columned entrance.

               EXT. WASHINGTON MONUMENT - LONG SHOT (STOCK)

               Under this shot a barely audible, distant hum is heard. It 
               grows in volume so imperceptibly in this and the next two 
               shots that we are unconscious of it.

               EXT. JEFFERSON MEMORIAL - LONG SHOT (STOCK)

               EXT. THE MALL - LONG SHOT

               Crowds are strolling on the Mall and across the well-kept 
               lawns in front of the Smithsonian Institution with the 
               leisurely, meandering quality that distinguishes sight-seers.

               MED. SHOT

               Including several small groups of people moving toward the 
               Smithsonian. Their attention is attracted as the hum off 
               scene becomes a roar. The sound is unearthly in its intensity 
               and almost unbearable in its swiftly increasing volume. The 
               people stop in their tracks and look up in the sky in terror.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               Several people on the steps of the Smithsonian have turned 
               to look. There is cold, frozen fear in their eyes. The awful 
               sound keeps increasing in volume.

               CLOSE SHOT

               A man, following the progress of a huge object in the sky 
               with his eyes. He is held terror-stricken.

               LONG SHOT INTO SKY (SERSEN SHOT)

               A giant shape, still at some distance, is approaching the 
               earth at incredible speed.

               LONG SHOT ON GROUND

               A group of people run wildly across a large expanse of lawn. 
               A huge shadow cast from above onto the grass seems to be 
               pursing them.

               LONG SHOT INTO SKY (SERSEN SHOT)

               The great shape is considerably nearer now.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Of a woman, thoroughly shaken, held immobile by what she 
               sees and hears.

               LONG SHOT

               People scatter madly in all directions as the huge spaceship 
               comes in for a landing on a smooth, grassy area. The 
               tremendous roar of its motors is suddenly cut off and the 
               great ship settles gently to a perfect landing.

               MED. SHOT - THE SHIP

               The gleaming surface of the ship shows no break of any kind -- 
               no windows, no ports, not even the outline of a hatch. It is 
               a fearsome, terrifying object, giving no evidence of its 
               source or its intention.

               LONG SHOT - (FROM PARALLEL)

               Shooting down on a section of lawn, showing the varying 
               reactions of people to the landing. Some are still running 
               madly away; others, singly and in little groups, stand as 
               though rooted, staring at the ship from a respectful distance.

               CLOSE SHOT - MAN

               As he stares at the ship with fascination and horror. He'd 
               like to run but he can't. His mouth twitches and he emits a 
               nervous little laugh.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               A woman is holding a two-year-old child by the hand as she 
               watches the ship, awe-struck. Several people run past them. 
               Suddenly the woman grabs up the child with a little sob, 
               turns and runs away.

               MED. SHOT

               A middle-aged man runs up to a group of several people, 
               pointing wildly toward the ship and yelling irrationally:

                                     MAN
                         They're here! They're here!

               He runs off toward another group as we--

               MONTAGE

               A series of short DISSOLVES showing:

               1. A man dashing up to a crowded Washington street corner 
               shouting wildly and gesticulating in the direction from which 
               he came.

               2. Policemen piling into squad cars, which roar out of their 
               garage.

               3. Soldiers rushing out of a barracks at Fort Myer, with 
               rifles and side arms, to form up on their company street.

               4. Newspaper presses rolling at high speed.

               5. Newscasters chattering excitedly into their microphones.

               6. A large telephone switchboard with the girls in a frenzy 
               of activity as they try to handle the calls pouring in.

               EXT. BASEBALL STADIUM - LONG SHOT

               The players are standing on the field in the crowded stadium, 
               but the game has been interrupted and everyone is listening 
               to the voice on the loudspeaker system. (Actual stock shot 
               would be coverage of some dedication or ceremonial.)

               A Brigadier General speaks in clipped tones into the 
               telephone. There are a couple of other officers in the room.

                                     BRIGADIER GENERAL
                              (into phone)

               INT. OFFICE - CLOSE SHOT

               A distinguished-looking government official speaks into the 
               phone with a sense of subdued urgency.

                                     GOVERNMENTAL OFFICIAL
                         I want to speak to the President.
                              (listens for a moment)
                         I'm sorry -- you'll have to interrupt 
                         him.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. RADIO AND TELEVISION STUDIO - MED. SHOT

               A nationally known news commentator -- for purposes of this 
               script let's say Drew Pearson -- is seated before a radio 
               mike. He is also being photographed by TV cameras. In a wall 
               near him is a TV screen which shows what is going out on the 
               air. During the ensuing speech, a man comes in a hands him a 
               sheaf of news bulletins.

                                     PEARSON
                         Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, 
                         this is Drew Pearson. We bring you 
                         this special radio-television 
                         broadcast to give you the latest 
                         information on the landing of the 
                         "space ship" in Washington.

               CLOSE SHOT - PEARSON

                                     PEARSON
                         Government and Defense Department 
                         officials are concerned by reports 
                         of panic in several large Eastern 
                         cities. I am authorized to assure 
                         you that so far there is no reasonable 
                         cause for alarm. The rumors of 
                         invading armies and mass destruction 
                         are based on hysteria and are 
                         absolutely false. I repeat -- these 
                         rumors are absolutely false!

               ANOTHER ANGLE

                                     PEARSON
                         The ship, designed for travel outside 
                         the earth's atmosphere, landed in 
                         Washington today at 3:47 p.m., Eastern 
                         Standard Time. We still don't know 
                         where it came from, but I can reveal 
                         that military leaders are considering 
                         two possibilities; that it came from 
                         some unfriendly power here on earth -- 
                         or that it actually arrived from 
                         another planet.

               CAMERA PANS to and DOLLIES IN on the TV screen in the wall. 
               On the screen is a shot of the space ship.

                              (over scene)
                         The ship is resting exactly where it 
                         landed two hours ago, and there has 
                         been no sign of life from inside it.

               OUR CAMERAL HOLDS on the TV screen. The cuts that follow are 
               inside the frame of the screen:

               EXT. THE MALL - MED. SHOT

               Two platoons of infantry soldiers surround the ship, their 
               rifles at the ready.

                                     PEARSON'S VOICE
                              (over scene)
                         Troops have been rushed from Fort 
                         Myer and they have formed a cordon 
                         around the ship.

               MED. SHOT

               showing two machine guns, two Sherman tanks and two 75MM 
               guns. The gun crews are posted for action and all weapons 
               are trained on the space ship.

                                     PEARSON'S VOICE
                              (over scene)
                         They are supported by machine guns, 
                         tanks and artillery.

               MED. SHOT - POLICE CORDON

               Cops are holding back a section of a large crowd, some 
               distance away from the ship. The people are wide-eyed and 
               tense with excitement.

                                     PEARSON'S VOICE
                              (over scene)
                         Behind police lines, there is a large 
                         crowd of curiosity seekers.

               SERIES OF INDIVIDUAL CUTS

               1. Civilians in the crowd, their eyes and nerves taut with 
               suspense.

               2. A young soldier, who grips his rifle and moistens his 
               lips nervously, his eyes never leaving the ship.

               3. A tank commander blinks from the tension of staring at an 
               unmoving object.

               4. The last cut is of the ship itself.

                              (over scene)
                         As you can see for yourself, the 
                         Army has taken every precaution to 
                         meet whatever the situation may 
                         require. Every eye -- every weapon -- 
                         is trained on the ship. It's been 
                         this way for two hours and the tension--

               CLOSE SHOT - PEARSON

               as he interrupts himself excitedly, his attention riveted on 
               the TV screen.

                                     PEARSON
                         Just a minute, ladies and gentlemen! 
                         I think I see something moving!

               EXT. THE MALL - MED. LONG SHOT - DAY

               We are at the actual location now, not looking at TV. We see 
               the ship surrounded by soldiers, two medium tanks, two 
               artillery pieces, and a couple of machine guns. Some distance 
               away is a suggestion of the crowd of civilians, held back by 
               police. Prominent in the scene are newsreel and television 
               cameras. OUR CAMERA MOVES IN to MED. SHOT. As it does so, we 
               see a couple of metal objects rising slowly from the top of 
               the ship. One, which is an oddly-designed coil of wire, slides 
               up and revolves slowly. The other is a section of vented 
               pipe with a convex cap on it.

               REVERSE ANGLE

               on the soldiers, their eyes glued to this first sign of 
               activity from the ship. They shift uneasily, gripping their 
               rifles more firmly.

               MED. SHOT - THE SHIP

               After a long, tense moment, a ramp appears silently out of 
               the side of the ship and slides down to the ground. There is 
               an audible gasp as a man appears at the top of the ramp. He 
               looks around at the crowd with cool and imperturbable dignity. 
               This is KLAATU. He is completely human in appearance. The 
               only unearthly thing about him is his clothing. He wears a 
               tunic that is very good looking, but at the same time 
               thoroughly comfortable and practical. On his head is a metal 
               helmet that obscures most of his face. (It would be impossible 
               to identify him later.) The design of this helmet gives the 
               impression that it is more a formal headdress than for 
               protection. Klaatu is above all an impressive man -- a man 
               of tremendous dignity and presence. He has the tolerant 
               superiority that comes with absolute knowledge.

               INDIVIDUAL REACTION CUTS

               of soldiers, people in the crowd, and policemen. The newsreel 
               and TV men are busy at their cameras.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               After an impressive moment, he raises his arms in the 
               universal gesture of neutrality. Then he speaks, in perfect 
               English, his voice amplified as though through an enunciator.

                                     KLAATU
                         We have come to visit you in peace -- 
                         and with good will.

               Klaatu walks slowly down the ramp toward the soldiers. As he 
               does so, he draws from inside his tunic a strange looking 
               object, longish and tubular. It might be a a telescope -- or 
               it might be some strange kind of weapon.

               MED. SHOT

               shooting from the side, showing Klaatu advancing slowly toward 
               the line of soldiers. He holds out the mysterious object in 
               front of him in a gesture that is actually one of offering 
               but could be misinterpreted as menacing. There is a growing, 
               uneasy rumble of muttering among the soldiers as Klaatu 
               advances. They are clearly frightened of what he may do.

               CLOSE SHOT - PLATOON LEADER

               A young second lieutenant, standing in front of his platoon. 
               As Klaatu advances, the lieutenant unslings his carbine.

               MED. SHOT

               Klaatu starts toward the platoon leader, raising the object 
               he holds toward the man, trying to make clear his intentions. 
               Misinterpreting this as a menacing gesture, the platoon leader 
               raises his carbine to his shoulder.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               of one of the tank commanders in the turret of his tank. He 
               is watching Klaatu advancing toward the platoon leader and 
               he has drawn his pistol. Convinced that the lieutenant is in 
               jeopardy, the tank commander aims at Klaatu and fires.

               MED. SHOT

               as Klaatu falls to the ground wounded. The object he was 
               holding has dropped from his hand and smashed. The soldiers 
               start to gather around Klaatu excitedly when suddenly there 
               appears in the entrance to the space ship a huge robot. There 
               is a gasp of amazement from the crowd and the solders draw 
               back at sight of him. The robot is ten feet tall, is made in 
               the almost-perfect image of a man. He is to be played by an 
               actor and his flesh appears to be made of a greenish metal. 
               His eyes flash as though lighted internally. His perfectly-
               fashioned, muscular body is covered only with a loincloth. 
               This is GORT.

               There are cries of amazement as Gort walks slowly ponderously, 
               down the ramp to the ground. As he does so, the ramp closes 
               behind him. Gort's face is, and always remains, utterly 
               expressionless. He stops to look at Klaatu, lying on the 
               ground. Then he looks around at the soldiers, the tanks and 
               guns. All the guns have been traversing to follow him.

               CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               From inside him there comes an ominous crackling sound, as 
               though power were being generated within him. His eyes flash 
               toward the tank from which Klaatu was shot.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - TANK

               There is a great metallic clatter and the Sherman tank is 
               suddenly reduced to a pile of junk metal, its parts completely 
               disintegrated. Only a piece of tank track and twisted gun 
               barrel emerge from the heap on the ground to identify what 
               had been there. The tank's crew has remained unharmed.

               CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               The crackling sound continues as his eyes start to sweep in 
               a semicircle taking in all the troops.

               MED. SHOT - THE TROOPS

               SHOOTING FROM BEHIND Gort, with the back of his head in f.g., 
               CAMERA PANS to follow Gort's sweeping gaze. In a growing 
               crash and clatter of metal, every weapon in sight is 
               destroyed. The two machine guns are little heaps of junk. 
               The 75's are larger heaps. The second tank, like the first, 
               is a three-foot pile of scrap. Rifles have dropped from the 
               soldier's hands and lie on the ground as little mounds of 
               wood and metal. None of the men has been harmed, but their 
               faces show the utter terror of what they have experienced.

               ANOTHER ANGLE - THE TROOPS

               as they react to the full shock of what has happened. Most 
               of them stand rooted to the ground. Several laugh 
               hysterically. A few break and run wildly.

               MED. SHOT - CROWD OF CIVILIANS

               Sudden pandemonium breaks out. Utterly terrified by what 
               they have witnessed, the crowd becomes a wild, milling, 
               screaming mob, concerned only with escape.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               He is walking slowly, deliberately, menacingly toward the 
               tank commander who fired on Klaatu. Standing by the debris 
               of his tank, the man is immobilized with terror. The robot 
               starts to reach out to grab him.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               lying on the ground. He speaks to Gort sharply, in a strange 
               language.

                                     KLAATU
                         Gort! Deglet ovrosco!

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               He pauses obediently in the act of reaching out for the tank 
               commander. Dropping his arms, he stands motionless and remains 
               that way.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               He has raised himself to a sitting position on the ground, 
               his wounded shoulder giving him considerable pain. The two 
               platoon leaders come into scene hesitantly, badly shaken by 
               the awesome demonstration of power they have seen. They are 
               uncertain as to what they should do. The platoon leader eyes 
               the smashed object on the ground curiously and turns 
               questioningly to Klaatu. With great dignity, Klaatu picks up 
               the broken object, which we see well for the first time. It 
               is a delicately-made tubular telescope, badly smashed. On it 
               are indications of small electronic gadgets.

                                     KLAATU
                         It was a gift. For your President.
                              (glances at the broken 
                              object ruefully)
                         With this he could have studied life 
                         on other planets.

               Klaatu lets the object drop with a shrug of mild exasperation. 
               The two lieutenants exchange a helpless look of bewilderment. 
               Then Klaatu raises himself to his feet painfully, holding 
               his wounded shoulder. As he does so, a colonel and a captain 
               come into scene.

                                     COLONEL
                              (to the lieutenants)
                         Is he all right?

                                     FIRST PLATOON LEADER
                         Got hit in the shoulder, sir.

               The three junior officers exchange ineffectual glances and 
               look to the colonel, who thinks for a moment before making 
               his decision.

                                     COLONEL
                         Send for an ambulance. Get him to 
                         Walter Reed Hospital right away.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Yes, sir.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. SITTING ROOM - WALTER REED HOSPITAL - NIGHT

               There is a door to the corridor and a door to Klaatu's room. 
               In the small sitting room, talking in tones of hushed concern, 
               is a group of men. There's a Major General, a likable man 
               with a chest full of ribbons. There are also a Colonel in 
               command of the hospital, a high-ranking police officer, a 
               couple of medical officers and two civilians. The conversation 
               is interrupted by the entrance from Klaatu's room of a Medical 
               Corps Major, followed by an Army Nurse.

                                     GENERAL
                              (to Major)
                         How is he?

                                     MAJOR WHITE
                         He's all right, General... Blood 
                         pressure's a little high, but it 
                         could be aggravation.

                                     GENERAL
                              (wryly)
                         Can't blame him. I always get mad 
                         when somebody shoots me.

                                     MAJOR WHITE
                         He still wants to see the President.

                                     COLONEL
                              (to General)
                         We informed the White House over an 
                         hour ago.

                                     GENERAL
                              (to Major)
                         Didn't drop any hints about where 
                         he's from, did he?

                                     MAJOR WHITE
                         No, sir, he didn't.

               The door to the corridor opens and a worried young Captain 
               enters.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Excuse me.
                              (to the Colonel)
                         What about the reporters, Colonel? 
                         They're swarming all over the lobby.

               The Colonel turns, in deference, to the General.

                                     GENERAL
                              (quietly)
                         Tell them there won't be any statement 
                         tonight.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Yes, sir.
                              (glancing down the 
                              corridor)
                         Mr. Harley's here from the White 
                         House.

               Harley appears in the doorway, a brief case under his arm. 
               He's a dignified, intelligent member of the White House 
               secretariat. He proceeds uninterruptedly into the room, 
               nodding cordially to the General.

                                     HARLEY
                         General --

                                     GENERAL
                              (indicating Klaatu's 
                              room)
                         Right in there, Mr. Harley.

               Harley proceeds in businesslike fashion to the door. He knocks 
               and then enters.

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - FULL SHOT

               as Harley enters, closing the door behind him. Klaatu no 
               longer wears his helmet and we see his face clearly for the 
               first time. Even sitting up in bed, with his shoulder strapped 
               in bandages, he is a figure of great authority. His face 
               reflects inner dignity and assurance. Harley, who is a 
               hardened diplomatist, can't help being impressed by his 
               present assignment and a little awed by Klaatu. Harley 
               obviously has been sent by the President to find out what he 
               can. Klaatu's eyes study him, cool, penetrating, reserved.

                                     HARLEY
                         My name is Harley -- Secretary to 
                         the President
                              (Klaatu continues to 
                              study him silently)
                         I've been told that you speak our 
                         language -- that your name is Mr. 
                         Klaatu.

                                     KLAATU
                              (coolly)
                         Just Klaatu.

                                     HARLEY
                         The President asked me to convey his 
                         deepest apologies for what has 
                         happened. We all feel--

                                     KLAATU
                              (evenly)
                         Sit down, Mr. Harley.

               Somewhat relieved, Harley seats himself. He speaks with a 
               half smile, hoping to ease the tension.

                                     HARLEY
                         I'm sure I don't have to point out 
                         that your arrival was something of a 
                         surprise.
                              (getting a little 
                              smile from Klaatu, 
                              he is encouraged to 
                              do some fishing)
                         Had you been traveling long?

                                     KLAATU
                         About five months -- your months.

                                     HARLEY
                         You must have come a long way.

                                     KLAATU
                         About 250 million of your miles.

               Harley glances at him quickly to be sure he's not joking. 
               He's not.

                                     HARLEY
                         Naturally we're very curious to know 
                         where it is you come from.

                                     KLAATU
                              (easily; he's a 
                              diplomat, too)
                         From another planet. Let's just say 
                         that we're neighbors.

               Harley reacts, as his wildest assumptions are so blandly 
               corroborated.

                                     HARLEY
                         It's rather difficult for us to think 
                         of another planet as a neighbor.

                                     KLAATU
                         I'm afraid, in the present situation 
                         you'll have to learn to think that 
                         way.

                                     HARLEY
                              (eyebrows raised)
                         The present situation?

                                     KLAATU
                         I mean the reasons for my coming 
                         here.

                                     HARLEY
                              (his eagerness apparent)
                         We're very curious about that, too. 
                         Would you care to talk about it?

                                     KLAATU
                         I'd be glad to.
                              (noticing that Harley 
                              is settling himself 
                              expectantly)
                         Not now, of course -- with you alone.

                                     HARLEY
                         Perhaps you'd rather discuss it 
                         personally with the President--

                                     KLAATU
                              (somewhat sharply)
                         This is not a personal matter, Mr. 
                         Harley. It concerns all the people 
                         on your planet.

                                     HARLEY
                              (Startled by the scope 
                              of this statement)
                         I -- I'm not sure I understand--

                                     KLAATU
                         I want to meet with representatives 
                         from all the nations of the Earth.

                                     HARLEY
                              (shocked and perturbed 
                              by this notion)
                         I'm afraid that would be a little 
                         awkward. It's -- it's completely 
                         without precedent. And there are 
                         practical considerations -- the time 
                         involved -- the enormous distances.

                                     KLAATU
                              (coolly)
                         I traveled 250 million miles. What 
                         about your United Nations?

                                     HARLEY
                              (Surprised and a little 
                              puzzled)
                         You know about the United Nations?

                                     KLAATU
                         We've been monitoring your radio 
                         broadcasts for a good many years. 
                         That's how we learned your languages. 
                         Lately, we've been getting your 
                         television also.

                                     HARLEY
                              (wryly)
                         You must have a rather strange 
                         impression of us.

                                     KLAATU
                              (smiling)
                         The first two years of television we 
                         were convinced that all you did was 
                         wrestle.

               Harley smiles. Then his mind reverts to the seriousness of 
               the situation and he speaks gravely.

                                     HARLEY
                         I'm sure you recognize from our broad-
                         casts the evil forces that have 
                         produced the tension in our world. 
                         Surely you would agree--

                                     KLAATU
                              (evenly)
                         I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with 
                         the internal affairs of your planet. 
                         I consider that to be your business -- 
                         not mine.

                                     HARLEY
                         I was only hoping to make you 
                         understand.

                                     KLAATU
                              (sternly, impressively)
                         My mission here is not to solve your 
                         petty squabbles. It concerns the 
                         existence of every last creature who 
                         lives on Earth.

                                     HARLEY
                              (uncomfortably)
                         Perhaps if you could explain a little--

                                     KLAATU
                         I intend to explain. To all the 
                         nations -- simultaneously.
                              (his manner precludes 
                              opposition)
                         How do we proceed, Mr. Harley?

               Harley is thoroughly shaken. The tremendous force and power 
               implicit in Klaatus's manner preclude the possibility of 
               argument.

                                     HARLEY
                              (after a long 
                              thoughtful moment)
                         We could call a special meeting of 
                         the General Assembly... But of course 
                         the UN doesn't represent all of the 
                         nations.

                                     KLAATU
                         Then why not a meeting of all the 
                         Chiefs of State?

                                     HARLEY
                              (helplessly, but 
                              patiently)
                         Believe me, you don't understand. 
                         They wouldn't sit down at the same 
                         table.

               Growing a little impatient with such nonsense, Klaatu eyes 
               him evenly, speaks with Jovian authority.

                                     KLAATU
                         I don't want to resort to threats, 
                         Mr. Harley. I simply tell you bluntly 
                         that the future of your planet is at 
                         stake... I suggest you transmit that 
                         message to the nations of the Earth.

               The eyes of the two men meet for a long, silent moment. Then 
               Harley rises quietly.

                                     HARLEY
                         I will make that recommendation to 
                         the President.
                              (he picks up his brief 
                              case and hat)
                         I must tell you in all honesty that 
                         I'm extremely dubious about the 
                         results.

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a half-smile)
                         Apparently I'm not as cynical about 
                         Earth's people as you are.

                                     HARLEY
                         I've been dealing in Earth's politics 
                         a good deal longer than you have.
                              (he bows)
                         Goodnight, sir.

               He turns and goes out.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               He stares after Harley for a moment, puzzled by this strange 
               and apparently unreasoning world he has come to. He shakes 
               his head in thoughtful, tolerant bewilderment.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. SPACE SHIP - LONG SHOT - NIGHT

               Searchlights have lighted up up the eerie shapes of the space 
               ship and Gort. A circle of soldiers guard the area, while a 
               crew of men can be seen working around the ship.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - AT SHIP

               A Master Sergeant of Engineers, dressed in fatigues, is 
               inspecting the side of the ship carefully. He has an acetylene 
               torch in his had and a welding helmet over his face. The 
               Major General, previously seen in the hospital sitting room, 
               enters and speaks to the Sergeant.

                                     GENERAL
                         Getting any place, Sergeant?

                                     SERGEANT
                              (raising his helmet)
                         No, sir.
                              (shaking his head in 
                              annoyance)
                         Beats me, General. I saw that ramp 
                         come out of the side of the ship -- 
                         right here. Now I can't even find a 
                         crack!

               A man named Carlson, a civilian metallurgical expert, comes 
               into scene. The General nods to him.

                                     GENERAL
                         What's the report, Carlson?

                                     CARLSON
                              (discouraged)
                         We've tried everything from a 
                         blowtorch to a diamond drill.

                                     GENERAL
                              (nodding toward Gort)
                         What about him?

                                     CARLSON
                         He's made out of the same stuff.

               THREE SHOT  GENERAL, CARLSON AND SERGEANT

                                     GENERAL
                         Has he moved?

                                     SERGEANT
                         No sir. Not an inch

                                     CARLSON
                         This is the toughest material I ever 
                         saw, General. For hardness and 
                         strength, it's out of this world.

                                     GENERAL
                              (with a wry half-smile)
                         I can tell you officially - that's 
                         where it came from.

               The two men exchange an uneasy glance, then turn to look at 
               the ship.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. SITTING ROOM  WALTER REED HOSPITAL

               Two Medical Corps officers, a Captain and a Major are 
               interestedly studying a series of X-ray films.

                                     MAJOR
                         The skeletal structure is completely 
                         normal.
                              (pointing)
                         Same for the major organs - heart, 
                         liver, spleen, kidneys.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         And the lungs are the same as ours. 
                         Must mean a similar atmosphere -- 
                         similar pressure.
                              (nodding, toward 
                              Klaatu's room)
                         How old do you think he is?

                                     MAJOR
                         Oh, I'd say forty-five.

                                     CAPTAIN
                              (smiling)
                         He told me this morning when I 
                         examined him. He's seventy-eight.

                                     MAJOR
                         I don't believe it.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Their life expectancy is a hundred 
                         and thirty.

                                     MAJOR
                         How does he explain that?

                                     CAPTAIN
                         He says their medicine is that much 
                         more advanced.
                              (the major stares at 
                              him blankly)
                         He was very nice about it. But he 
                         made me feel like a third-class witch 
                         doctor.

               The door to Klaatu's rooms opens and Major White appears. 
               He's the man who attended Klaatu the day before. He closes 
               the door behind him and stands motionless facing the other 
               two, his face wearing a blank expression.

                                     MAJOR WHITE
                         I took a bullet out of that man's 
                         arm yesterday.

                                     FIRST MAJOR
                         What about it?

                                     MAJOR WHITE
                              (utterly bewildered)
                         I just examined the wound and it's 
                         all healed.

                                     FIRST MAJOR
                         What does he say about it?

                                     MAJOR WHITE
                         Said he put some salve on it -- some 
                         stuff he had with him.
                              (shows them a small, 
                              odd-looking tube in 
                              his hand)

                                     CAPTAIN
                         What are you going to do with it?

                                     MAJOR WHITE
                         Take it downstairs and have it 
                         analyzed.
                              (on his way to the 
                              door, shaking his 
                              head)
                         Then I don't know whether I'll just 
                         get drunk or give up the practice of 
                         medicine.

               As he starts out the door to the corridor, he passes Mr. 
               Harley, who is on his way in, carrying his ever-present brief 
               case. Harley is accompanied by an enlisted M.P.

                                     FIRST MAJOR
                         Afternoon, Mr. Harley.

                                     HARLEY
                         Afternoon, gentlemen.

               Harley goes to the door of Klaatu's room, a businesslike 
               expression on his face. He knocks on the door, then enters. 
               The M.P. remains in the sitting room.

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - FULL SHOT - DAY

               as Harley enters. Klaatu is up out of bed, walking around in 
               a Medical Corps robe and pajamas. He appears to be completely 
               recovered.

                                     HARLEY
                         Good afternoon.
                              (surprised not to 
                              find him in bed)
                         I'm glad to see you up and around.

                                     KLAATU
                         Thank you... Have you any news?

                                     HARLEY
                         Not very good news, I'm afraid.
                              (digs into his 
                              briefcase for some 
                              papers)
                         The President accepted your suggestion 
                         and cabled the invitations for a 
                         meeting last night.
                              (grimly)
                         Let me read you some of the replies.
                              (he selects a cable 
                              and reads)
                         "The Premier wishes to inform the 
                         Government of the United States that 
                         it will be impossible for him to 
                         attend the meeting suggested by the 
                         President unless the meeting is held 
                         in Moscow."
                              (with a grimly-pointed 
                              glance at Klaatu, 
                              Harley reads another 
                              cable)
                         "The suggestion of the President 
                         regarding the possibility of a meeting 
                         in Moscow would be unacceptable to 
                         Her Majesty's Government at the 
                         present time. Representation could 
                         be sent only if the meeting were 
                         held in Washington."
                              (he looks up at Klaatu 
                              and shrugs)
                         Well -- there you have it.

               Harley extends a sheaf of cables for Klaatu's inspection, 
               but he ignores them. Klaatu has listened to this recital, 
               first incredulously, then with mounting indignation. Conscious 
               of his quiet, Olympian wrath, Harley continues uncomfortably.

                                     HARLEY
                         I tried to make you understand. The 
                         suspicions -- the jealousies -- the 
                         mistrust--
                              (uneasily, under 
                              Klaatu's level gaze)
                         Surely you realize that my government 
                         has done everything in its power--

                                     KLAATU
                         It's not your government I'm thinking 
                         about. It's your world.

                                     HARLEY
                         Now that you understand the situation 
                         more clearly, perhaps you'd like to 
                         discuss the matter with the President

                                     KLAATU
                              (sternly)
                         I will not speak to any one nation 
                         or group of nations.
                              (sharply, bitterly)
                         I don't intend to add my contribution 
                         to your childish jealousies and 
                         suspicions.

                                     HARLEY
                         Our problems are very complex, Mr. 
                         Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too 
                         harshly.

                                     KLAATU
                         I can judge only by what I see.

                                     HARLEY
                         Your impatience is quite 
                         understandable.

                                     KLAATU
                              (sharply)
                         I am impatient with stupidity. My 
                         people have learned to live without 
                         it.

                                     HARLEY
                              (ruefully)
                         I'm afraid my people haven't.
                              (with real sincerity)
                         I'm very sorry -- I wish it were 
                         otherwise.

               Reluctantly Harley has picked up his hat and brief case. He 
               finds Klaatu staring out the window.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               As he looks out the window thoughtfully. What he sees has 
               given him an idea.

               MED. SHOT - HOSPITAL GROUNDS

               shooting down, from Klaatu's viewpoint, at people strolling 
               about the hospital grounds. Most of them are civilian 
               visitors, but there is a sprinkling of nurses and ambulatory 
               patients.

               FULL SHOT - HOSPITAL ROOM

               As Klaatu turns back to Harley, he speaks thoughtfully, 
               incisively.

                                     KLAATU
                         Before making any decisions, I think 
                         I should get out among your people -- 
                         become familiar with the basis for 
                         these strange, unreasoning attitudes.

                                     HARLEY
                         Under the circumstances I'm afraid 
                         that will be impossible.

               Harley has paused near the door, a little embarrassed by 
               Klaatu's level gaze.

                                     HARLEY
                         I must ask that you don't attempt to 
                         leave the hospital. Our military 
                         people have insisted on this. I'm 
                         sure you'll understand.

               With a polite nod, he goes out. Klaatu stares after him as 
               he realizes that he is in effect a prisoner. He shakes his 
               head slowly, thoughtfully. The ways of this planet are strange 
               indeed.

               INT. SITTING ROOM - MED CLOSE SHOT - AT DOOR

               Harley has paused to watch as the M.P. takes out a key and 
               inserts it in the lock of Klaatu's door.

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               As he hears the click of the lock, he turns toward the door. 
               Realizing they've locked him in, he smiles with tolerant 
               amusement.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. HOSPITAL SITTING ROOM - MED CLOSE SHOT - NIGHT

               In the dim light of one lamp, the door to the corridor opens 
               and a nurse enters carrying a tray of medication. She is 
               accompanied by the same M.P. as previously seen. The nurse 
               pauses as the M.P. takes out a key and inserts it in the 
               lock of Klaatu's door. To his surprise he finds that the 
               door is not locked. He exchanges a glance with the nurse, 
               then pulls the door open and hurries inside.

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM

               as the M.P. crosses the unlighted room toward the bed. The 
               only light cones from the open door to the sitting room. The 
               M.P.'s eyes go wide as he looks at the bed. It is unmade and 
               unoccupied. Terrified, the M.P. turns to the nurse, who is 
               standing in the doorway.

               M.P.  He's gone!

               The M.P. dashes out of the room, through the doorway past 
               the nurse. She turns to follow him as we--

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               MONTAGE - NIGHT

               A series of short DISSOLVES, showing:

               1. The M.P. excitedly reporting Klaatu's disappearance to 
               the Officer of the Day.

               2. The hospital guard detail hurrying out of the guardhouse 
               to form up in front of the Sergeant of the guard.

               3. A high-level military conference gathered at a table, 
               discussing the matter with great concern.

               4. A street corner newsstand, with people eagerly grabbing 
               papers. The headline reads: "MAN FROM MARS" ESCAPES FROM 
               ARMY HOSPITAL!

               5. Radio announcers chattering excitedly into their 
               microphones

               6. A series of close-ups of people listening to the radio. 
               Their faces reveal their awestruck terror.

               7. A terrified mother drags her two children in from the 
               street through the front door, slams the door and bolts it.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - MED. CLOSE SHOT - NIGHT

               CAMERA is on the back of a man dressed in a business suit, 
               who is walking along the sidewalk of a dimly lighted, almost 
               deserted, middle-class street. He carries a suitcase and he 
               glances idly at the drab-looking stone facades of the old 
               two-story houses. As he passes, from the open windows of the 
               houses come the voices of radio announcers. We get a sentence 
               or two from one house and then, as the man and our CAMERA 
               pass on, this voice fades and another is picked up. We get 
               the impression that everyone is glued to his radio.

                                     RADIO VOICES
                              (over scene)
                         --authorities at Walter Reed Hospital 
                         refused to comment on how he managed 
                         to escape, or what measures might be 
                         taken to apprehend him.

               --these fantastic descriptions of the creature are denounced 
               as rumor by police Chief Walter Baxter. He is not eight feet 
               tall, as reported -- nor does he have tentacles in place of 
               arms--

               --there's no denying that there is a monster at large -- 
               that we are dealing with forces beyond our knowledge and 
               power. The public is urged to take ordinary precautions and 
               to remain calm, as we await further developments--

               --three separate reports of people who claim to have seen 
               the "space man" in the past hour. One from Des Moines, Iowa; 
               one from a village in northern Florida; and one from Chicago.

               CAMERA OVERTAKES the man as he pauses under the light of a 
               street lamp, and reveals that it is Klaatu. He has stopped 
               to look at something out of scene.

               CLOSE SHOT

               from Klaatu's viewpoint, of a sign on one of the houses, 
               reading: ROOM FOR RENT

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               He seems to hesitate, debating a plan he has in mind. He 
               raises his right arm to scratch his head thoughtfully, and 
               notices for the first time a small tag, or ticket, attached 
               to the inside of the right forearm of the coat he is wearing. 
               Puzzled, he pulls off the ticket and looks at it.

               INSERT - TICKET

               It is the sort of tag a cleaning establishment attaches to 
               clothing. Printed on it is the legend: CAPITOL DRY CLEANING 
               SERVICE. Scrawled in a penciled hand is the notation: Dr. 
               Carpenter, Bldg. A - Walter Reed Hospital. Cl. & pr. $1.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               He smiles wryly at this reminder of where he got the suit, 
               and he destroys the ticket. He glances down at the suitcase 
               beside him.

               CLOSE SHOT - SUITCASE

               It bears the initials L.M.C. Klaatu's hand comes into scene 
               and lifts up the suitcase. CAMERA HOLDS as Klaatu carries 
               the bag toward the house and mounts the stone steps to the 
               entrance.

               INT. BOARDINGHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               There 's no light in the room except what splashes in from 
               the hall. Gathered around a television set are five adults 
               and a little boy, their faces eerie in the reflected light 
               from the screen. The room is done in average boardinghouse 
               style -- antimacassars and all. The attention of the people 
               is riveted on the television screen, where a newscaster is 
               reading a bulletin.

                                     TELEVISION COMMENTATOR
                         --while the President made no effort 
                         to minimize the crisis, he urged 
                         people all over the country to remain 
                         calm. He said the entire facilities 
                         of FBI and other federal agencies 
                         are being bought to bear. He pointed 
                         out, however, that this is no ordinary 
                         man hunt. He warned we may be up 
                         against powers that are beyond our 
                         control.

               FULL SHOT

               The landlady, a stern-faced woman of middle age, named MRS. 
               CROCKETT, rises nervously and crosses to the television set.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                              (tensely)
                         I can't stand any more of this. It's 
                         enough to drive a person crazy.

               She snaps off the set sharply.

               TWO SHOT

               BOBBY BENSON, a bright-eyed, eleven-year-old, is seated beside 
               his mother, HELEN BENSON, an attractive girl of thirty. 
               Disappointed that the set has been turned off, Bobby's roving 
               eye has fallen on something in the doorway to the hall... 
               Wide-eyed, he nudges his mother and points.

                                     BOBBY
                         Hey, Mom -- who's that?

               FULL SHOT

               including the doorway to the hall. Silhouetted motionless 
               against the light from the hall is the figure of a man. All 
               eyes follow Hobby's pointed finger, and there is a stifled 
               gasp as they are startled out of their preoccupation. One of 
               the men turns on the lights and Klaatu is revealed standing 
               calmly in the doorway. There is a shocked silence for a 
               moment, then Mrs. Crockett speaks.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                              (apologizing nervously 
                              for the tension in 
                              the room)
                         I -- I'm sorry. What is it you want?

                                     KLAATU
                         My name is Carpenter. I'm looking 
                         for a room.

               There is a noticeable letdown in the general tension, during 
               which Booby has been studying Klaatu, his imagination working 
               overtime.

                                     BOBBY
                         Are you an FBI man?

                                     KLAATU
                         No -- I'm afraid not.

               Helen has stepped forward to make Bobby desist.

                                     BOBBY
                         Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking 
                         for that space man.

                                     HELEN
                              (with an apologetic 
                              smile at Klaatu)
                         I think we've all been hearing too 
                         much about "space men."

               Mrs. Crockett reverts to her role as landlady. She likes to 
               think of her house as a home.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                              (starting the 
                              introductions with 
                              Helen)
                         This is Mrs. Benson, Mr. Carpenter.
                              (with a smile that 
                              would split a brick)
                         And little Bobby.
                              (indicating a middle-
                              aged couple and a 
                              younger but more 
                              wizened man)
                         Mr. and Mrs. Barley -- and Mr. 
                         Krull... I'm Mrs. Crockett.

               There are polite noddings and how-do-you-do's. Mrs. Crockett 
               is satisfied that she's established a cozy atmosphere.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                              (pleased to the point 
                              of challenge)
                         Well -- this is our little family.
                              (then, getting down 
                              to business)
                         I have a very nice room on the second 
                         floor.

               She leads the way toward the hall and Klaatu starts to follow, 
               picking up his suitcase, when he is intercepted by Bobby.

                                     BOBBY
                         Can I help you look for the space 
                         man? Can I?
                              (excitedly)
                         I know what he looks like! He's got 
                         a square head -- and, three great 
                         big eyes!

                                     HELEN
                              (good-naturedly, 
                              calming him down)
                         That's enough, Bobby. I think it's 
                         time you went to bed.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                              (to Bobby, with a 
                              prop smile)
                         We mustn't annoy Mr. Carpenter -- or 
                         he won't want to stay here. She goes 
                         on into the hall, followed by Klaatu, 
                         who has exchanged a polite smile 
                         with Helen.

               INT. HALLWAY

               as Mrs. Crockett leads the way up the stairs.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                         He's really a dear little boy -- and 
                         quiet as a mouse.
                              (with a shrewd, chatty 
                              smile)
                         You're a long way from home, aren't 
                         you, Mr. Carpenter?

                                     KLAATU
                         How did you know?

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                              (pleased with her 
                              cleverness)
                         Oh, I can tell a New England accent 
                         a mile away.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BOARDINGHOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

               Five of the boarders -- Mr. and Mrs. Barley, Mr. Krull, Helen 
               Benson and Klaatu - are finishing their Sunday morning 
               breakfast. Mrs. Barley is a middle-class Helen Hokinson lady, 
               form and unrelenting. Her husband is a born complainer. Mr. 
               Krull is a shriveled little accountant, precise and finicky. 
               As they finish their coffee, all except Helen are immersed 
               in the Sunday papers. Helen seems preoccupied with her own 
               thoughts. From a portable radio on the table comes Gabriel 
               Heater's voice.

                                     GABRIEL HEATER'S VOICE
                         --and so, this Sunday morning, we 
                         ask the question that's been plaguing; 
                         the entire nation for two days now: 
                         "Where is this creature and what is 
                         he up to?" If he can build a space 
                         ship that can fly to Earth -- and a 
                         robot that can destroy our tanks and 
                         guns -- what other terrors can he 
                         unleash at will? ...Obviously we 
                         must find this monster. We must track 
                         him down like a wild animal and 
                         destroy him.

               INSERT - NEWSPAPER PAGE IN MRS. BARLEY'S HANDS

               It is a full page layout, in the style of the American Weekly, 
               showing a demented artist's conception of a mass invasion of 
               space ships. Weird-looking creatures are slaughtering Earth 
               people with ray guns. The caption at the top of the image 
               reads: "Are We Long For This World?" (Gabriel Heater's voice 
               continues uninterruptedly over this and the next two scenes.)

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               He is reading his paper with considerable interest.

               INSERT - NEWSPAPER STORY

               The third-page story reads: SAVANT CALLS MEETING TO STUDY 
               SPACE SHIP. Professor Jacob Barnhardt, world-famous scientist 
               and Nobel Prize winner, has invited fellow scientists from 
               all over the world to meet with him in Washington and study 
               the recently landed "Space Ship."

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               His face is thoughtful as he finishes reading. This story 
               seems to impress and interest him. Then suddenly he finds 
               his attention caught at what the Radio Voice is saying.

                                     GABRIEL HEATER'S VOICE
                         But where would such a creature hide 
                         himself? Would he disappear into the 
                         north woods? Or would he slither off 
                         into the sewers of some great city?

               Klaatu has a reaction of affronted dignity at this monstrously 
               distasteful idea.

               GROUP SHOT

               AS THE RADIO VOICE CONTINUES:

                                     GABRIEL HEATER'S VOICE
                         There is grave danger -- everyone 
                         agrees to that. The question is what 
                         can we do to protect ourselves? What 
                         measures can we take that will--

               During the above, Mrs. Barley has turned to her husband in 
               sharp annoyance.

                                     MRS. BARLEY
                         George, I wish you'd turn that radio 
                         off. I'm trying to concentrate.

               Mr. Barley reaches out and snaps off the radio.

                                     MR. BARLEY
                              (snorting, he tosses 
                              his paper down)
                         Why doesn't the Government do 
                         something -- that's what I want to 
                         know.

                                     MR. KRULL
                              (mildly)
                         What can they do? They're only people -- 
                         Just like us.

                                     MR. BARLEY
                         People my foot! They're Democrats!

                                     MR. KRULL
                         It's enough to give you the shakes. 
                         He's got that robot standing there -- 
                         ten-foot tall -- just waiting for 
                         orders to destroy us.

                                     HELEN
                              (thoughtfully)
                         This space man -- or whatever he is. 
                         We automatically assume he's a 
                         menace... Maybe he isn't at all.

                                     MR. BARLEY
                              (glaring at her for 
                              this silly notion)
                         Then what's he hiding for? Why doesn't 
                         he come out in the open?

                                     MR. KRULL
                         Yeah.
                              (indicating the radio)
                         Like the fella says: "What's he up 
                         to?"

                                     HELEN
                         Maybe he's afraid.

                                     MRS. BARLEY
                              (with a derisive snort)
                         He's afraid!

                                     HELEN
                         After all, he was shot the moment he 
                         landed here.
                              (she pauses for a 
                              moment thoughtfully)
                         I was just wondering what I would 
                         do.

                                     KLAATU
                              (to Helen, helpfully)
                         Perhaps before deciding on a course 
                         of action, you'd want to know more 
                         about the people here -- to orient 
                         yourself in a strange environment.

                                     MRS. BARLEY
                              (sharply)
                         There's nothing strange about 
                         Washington, Mr. Carpenter.

                                     KLAATU
                              (quietly, tongue in 
                              cheek)
                         A person from another planet might 
                         disagree with you.

                                     MRS. BARLEY
                         If you want my opinion, he came from 
                         right here on Earth.
                              (with significant 
                              emphasis)
                         And you know where I mean.

                                     MR. KRULL
                         They wouldn't come in a space ship. 
                         They'd come in airplanes.

                                     MRS. BARLEY
                              (as though with 
                              superior knowledge)
                         I wouldn't be so sure about that.

                                     MR. BARLEY
                              (delivering the final 
                              word)
                         Stands to reason that fella wants 
                         some thing or he wouldn't be here.
                              (facing Klaatu)
                         That make sense, Carpenter?

               Klaatu pauses for a moment, then recites pleasantly.

                                     KLAATU
                         I must admit I'm a little confused.

               Mrs. Crockett enters and speaks to Helen.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                         Mrs. Benson -- Mr. Stevens is here 
                         to see you.

                                     HELEN
                         Oh -- thank you.

               She rises and goes out.

                                     MRS. BARLEY
                         Finish your coffee, George. I told 
                         the Carsons we'd be there at eleven.

               INT. BOARDINGHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MED. CLOSE SHOT

               as Helen crosses the room to greet TOM STEVENS. He's a 
               personable young man with a breezy manner and considerable 
               charm. There is between them an easy air of Intimacy.

                                     HELEN
                              (smiling warmly)
                         Good morning.

               Tom kisses her.

                                     TOM
                         We're all set. I picked up some 
                         sandwiches and put gas in the car. 
                         And the radio's still busted, so me 
                         can forget about the space man for 
                         today.

                                     HELEN
                              (a little disturbed)
                         There's only one thing -- I haven't 
                         been able to arrange for anyone to 
                         stay with Bobby.
                              (tentatively)
                         I don't suppose we could take him 
                         with us?

                                     TOM
                              (understandably 
                              unenthusiastically)
                         Well, we could--

                                     HELEN
                         There's always somebody here, but 
                         today of course they've all got plans.

                                     KLAATU'S VOICE
                         I haven't any plans.

               Helen and Tom turn in surprise.

               THREE SHOT

               including Klaatu, who has wandered in from the dining room, 
               unnoticed by Tom and Helen. Klaatu continues, with an air of 
               wanting to be helpful without wanting to interfere.

                                     KLAATU
                         I'd be glad to spend the day with 
                         him -- if you'd let me.

                                     TOM
                              (impulsively)
                         Say, that'll be great! Wouldn't it, 
                         Helen.

                                     HELEN
                              (hesitating, a little 
                              confused, by the 
                              offer)
                         It's awfully nice of you to suggest 
                         it.
                              (remembering the two 
                              men haven't met)
                         I'm sorry Mr. Carpenter -- this is 
                         Tom Stevens.

               The two men shake hand's and exchange how-do-you-do's. Then 
               Klaatu turns back to Helen.

                                     KLAATU
                         Bobby and I had a fine time yesterday 
                         afternoon. We talked -- and listened 
                         to the radio.
                              (smiling at Helen)
                         I thought today he might show me 
                         around the city.

               Helen is debating the matter in her mind, concerned about 
               leaving Bobby with a comparative stranger, but tempted because 
               of her favorable impression of Klaatu.

                                     KLAATU
                              (easily)
                         Suppose I ask Bobby how he feels 
                         about it.

               He turns, with a little smile, and starts out of the room. 
               Helen, still not quite decided, turns to Tom with a 
               questioning look. Tom nods.

               DISSOLVE T0:

               INT. LINCOLN MEMORIAL - FULL SHOT - DAY (STOCK)

               The great seated, brooding figure of Lincoln is at the far 
               end of the impressive main hall. A few tourists are moving 
               about the place.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY

               They are in the south hall, on the wall of which is inscribed 
               the Gettysburg Address. They stand silently, side by side, 
               reading the inscription.

               INSERT - GETTYSBURG ADDRESS (STOCK)

               Featuring the last part of the Address. It reads: "--and 
               that government of the people, by the people, for the people, 
               shall not perish from the earth."

               TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY

                                     KLAATU
                              (visibly impressed)
                         Those are great words.
                              (with an air of 
                              discovery)
                         He must have been a great man.

               Bobby is impressed by the depth and sincerity of Klaatu's 
               tribute, but a little confused by his air of having discovered 
               Lincoln. Hobby watches Klaatu with a puzzled expression, 
               then follows as Klaatu moves off slowly.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. LINCOLN MEMORIAL - MED. CLOSE SHOT - DAY

               shooting against one of the huge fluted columns as Klaatu 
               and Bobby come out of the building. Deeply preoccupied, Klaatu 
               speaks with impatient urgency.

                                     KLAATU
                         That's the kind of man I'd like to 
                         talk to.

               Bobby looks up at him in bewilderment. After a moment Klaatu 
               speaks slowly, thoughtfully.

                                     KLAATU
                         Bobby -- who's the greatest man in 
                         America today?

                                     BOBBY
                              (puzzling it over)
                         Gee -- I don't know... The space 
                         man, I guess.

                                     KLAATU
                              (secretly amused)
                         I was speaking of earth men. I meant 
                         the greatest philosopher -- the 
                         greatest thinker.

                                     B0BBY
                         You mean the smartest man in the 
                         whole world?

                                     KLAATU
                         Yes -- that would do nicely.

                                     BOBBY
                              (after a moments 
                              thought)
                         Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. 
                         He's the greatest scientist in the 
                         world.

                                     KLAATU
                              (he pauses 
                              thoughtfully, speaks 
                              slowly, as he recalls 
                              the newspaper story 
                              he read)
                         He lives here in Washington, doesn't 
                         he?

                                     BOBBY
                         Sure. Right near where my mother 
                         works.

                                     KLAATU
                         Where is that?

                                     BOBBY
                         Department of Commerce. She's a 
                         secretary.
                              (Klaatu nods)
                         They have a man they call the 
                         Secretary, but he isn't at all. My 
                         mother's a real secretary.
                              (after a moment; 
                              eagerly)
                         Mr. Carpenter -- now can we go see 
                         the space ship?

               EXT. THE MALL - LONG SHOT - SPACE SHIP AND GORT - DAY

               A crew of Army engineers is in process of erecting a temporary 
               structure such as a large Quonset hut or B29 hanger to enclose 
               the space ship and Gort. The walls are partially up and 
               already have concealed part of the ship. The area is roped 
               off and there are Army guards to keep the sightseers back. 
               There is a crowd of people behind the ropes, watching. CAMERA 
               MOVES IN to reveal the backs of Bobby and Klaatu.

               TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY

               Bobby is studying the ship and Gort eagerly, his imagination 
               thoroughly aroused. Klaatu is watching the men at work with 
               mild, quiet amusement.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               from Bobby's viewpoint.

               TWO SHOT - BOBBY AND KLAATU

               Bobby's eyes are wide with awe as he watches the giant robot.

                                     BOBBY
                         Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he 
                         could knock down a whole building.

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a quizzical 
                              smile)
                         I shouldn't be at all surprised.

               Bobby's attention shifts to the ship.

               MED. SHOT - SPACE SHIP

               From Bobby's viewpoint.

               TWO SHOT - B0BBY AND KLAATU

                                     BOBBY
                              (excitedly, indicating 
                              the ship)
                         Gee, I'd like to get inside and see 
                         how it works. What do you think makes 
                         it go?

                                     KLAATU
                              (quietly, after a 
                              glance around)
                         Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.

                                     BOBBY
                              (looking at Klaatu 
                              incredulously)
                         I thought that was only for bombs.

                                     KLAATU
                         No. It's for a lot of other things, 
                         too.

                                     BOBBY
                         You think it can go faster than an F-
                         36?

                                     KLAATU
                         Yes -- I think so.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT KLAATU AND BOBBY

               shooting from a side angle to include a couple of men who 
               are listening to Klaatu's conversation. They are nudging 
               each other, amused at the way this man is pretending to 
               explain things to the little boy.

                                     BOBBY
                         About a thousand miles an hour?

               Klaatu has noticed the two men, who have edged a little closer 
               to listen. He is not perturbed by them, but he lowers his 
               voice a bit.

                                     KLAATU
                         Maybe four thousand miles an hour. 
                         And outside the Earth's atmosphere a 
                         good deal faster.

                                     BOBBY
                              (excitedly)
                         Gee! How could they make a landing?

                                     KLAATU
                         Well -- there are several ways to 
                         reduce landing speed. You see, the 
                         velocity--

               Klaatu interrupts himself as he realizes that he may be going 
               too far. The two men have moved closer, listening and 
               grinning. One of them whispers to the other behind the back 
               of his hand. Then the man realizes that Klaatu has stopped 
               speaking and is looking at him.

                                     MAN
                              (grinning)
                         Keep goin', Mister. He was fallin' 
                         for it.

               The two men burst out laughing and move off together. Bobby, 
               who has missed the point of this by-play, looks at Klaatu, 
               then after the men. As they move out of scene they laugh 
               loudly at the little boy's confusion. Klaatu takes Bobby's 
               hand to lead him away from the roped-off area.

               TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY

               CAMERA FOLLOWS them as they move away through the crowd.

               As they do so, several newsboys are working their way through 
               the crowd with newly arrived extras. The boys are calling 
               out the extras: "Police under fire!" "Army put in charge!" 
               "Space man still at large!" etc. People are eagerly buying 
               the papers. Klaatu and Booby watch this as they pass through 
               the crowd.

               CLOSE SHOT - EXTRA

               In newsboy's hand. The headline reads: SPACE MAN ELUDES POLICE

               TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY

               as they move on away from the excited crowd of people. 
               Klaatu's reaction has been one of mild curiosity. Bobby looks 
               up at him.

                                     BOBBY
                         You think they'll ever find him?

                                     KLAATU
                              (alter a moment's 
                              pause)
                         I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to 
                         doubt it.

                                     BOBBY
                              (as they continue 
                              walking)
                         Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity 
                         mean?

                                     KLAATU
                              (preoccupied)
                         Velocity is the time rate of change 
                         of position.

               This explanation misses Bobby by several light years. He 
               glances up at Klaatu blankly.

                                     BOBBY
                         I'll bet that's the way Professor 
                         Barnhardt talks.

               Pulled out of his reverie, Klaatu glances down at Bobby and 
               smiles apologetically. Bobby grins back at him. Then, as 
               they walk on a few more steps, Klaatu stops and speaks 
               thoughtfully.

                                     KLAATU
                         Bobby -- I have an idea. Let's go 
                         see Professor Barnhardt and find out 
                         how he talks.

                                     BOBBY
                              (with a half-smile of 
                              accusation)
                         You're just kidding, aren't you?

                                     KLAATU
                         Wouldn't you like to meet him?

                                     BOBBY
                         Well, sure I would, but --
                              (he's to be not going 
                              taken in)
                         Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a private smile)
                         We can scare him more than he can 
                         scare us.

               Bobby stares up at him and his face breaks into a broad 
               admiring grin.

                                     BOBBY
                         I like you, Mr. Carpenter. You're a 
                         real screwball.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. BARNHARDT'S HOUSE - MED. SHOT - DAY

               The house is an unimposing old-fashioned structure, shouldered 
               on either side by similar one-family dwellings. There is a 
               flight of stone steps leading up to the entrance and a large 
               porch across the front of the house. Klaatu and Bobby walk 
               into scene and pause, Klaatu glances at Bobby and Bobby nods 
               toward the house. They move on up the steps to the entrance.

               MED. CHOOSE SHOT - AT FRONT DOOR

               Bobby, all eagerness and excitement, presses the bell. They 
               wait a moment and there is no answer.

                                     BOBBY
                              (disappointed at the 
                              thought)
                         Gee -- maybe he isn't home.

               Bobby wanders down the porch and looks into a window. 
               Fascinated by what he sees, he gestures to Klaatu.

                                     BOBBY
                         Betcha this is where he works--

               After a glance at the front door, Klaatu joins Bobby at the 
               window and looks in.

               FULL SHOT - BARNHARDT'S STUDY

               SHOOTING through the window, over the heads of Klaatu and 
               Bobby. The room is more of a workroom than a study. It is in 
               comfortably shabby disarray, with papers and books everywhere. 
               There's a battered old desk and a day bed. One wall is solid 
               bookshelves and on the other two are blackboards covered 
               with a fantastic array of complex equations, graphs and 
               diagrams.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               His attention has been caught by one of the blackboards and 
               he studies it with great interest and curiosity.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - SECTION OF BLACKBOARD

               It is covered with a particularly complicated series of 
               equations in a chalky scrawl, involving angles of vector, 
               Keplerian ellipses, etc. The final equations are unsolved; 
               they have no answers after the "equals" sign. Across are 
               little printed signs tacked to the blackboard reading: "Don't 
               erase!" and "Don't touch!"

               TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY

               Bewildered, Bobby looks from the blackboard up at Klaatu. 
               Still studying the blackboard, Klaatu is shaking his head 
               and clucking his tonsure as one might at the attempts of a 
               child to solve a problem in arithmetic.

                                     BOBBY
                              (indicating the 
                              equations)
                         What does that mean?

                                     KLAATU
                         It's a problem in celestial mechanics.

                                     BOBBY
                         Bet he's the only one in the world 
                         knows the answer.

                                     KLAATU
                              (he shakes his head, 
                              smiling)
                         He doesn't know the answer. And he'll 
                         never get it that way.

               Bobby moves over to a pair of French doors beyond the window 
               and tries to peer in through the curtained doors. He absently 
               tries the doors and finds them locked. Then he turns away 
               with a disappointed but philosophical shrug.

                                     BOBBY
                         We probably couldn't get to see him 
                         even if he was home.

               As Bobby moves away from the doors dejectedly, Klaatu puts 
               his hand on the knob.

               CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

               He's watching Klaatu and his eyes widen at what he sees.

                                     BOBBY
                              (in complete surprise)
                         Hey -- where you going?

               CHOOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               He has opened the door and is standing in the doorway, his 
               hand, still on the knob. He is smiling at Bobby with secret 
               amusement. He's got an idea.

                                     KLAATU
                         If he's that difficult to see, perhaps 
                         we ought to leave a calling card.

               Klaatu disappears into the study. Amazed, Bobby follows.

               INT. BARNHARDT'S STUDY

               Bobby watches as Klaatu walks to the blackboard and picks up 
               a piece of chalk. As though correcting a schoolboy's work, 
               he makes large check marks at several points in each equation.

               EXT. PORCH - BARNHARDT'S HOUSE

               An efficient-looking middle-aged woman is mounting the steps 
               to the entrance, getting her front door key out of her purse, 
               when her eye falls on the French doors, which are standing 
               ajar. Puzzled, she starts down the porch toward the doors. 
               This woman is Barnhardt's secretary and her name is HILDA.

               Bobby is watching as Klaatu writes across the blackboard in 
               a bold hand: Differentiate the equation ( ).

               Klaatu underlines this comment with a sharp stroke, when a 
               stern voice is heard off screen.

                                     HILDA'S VOICE
                         What are you doing in here?

               FULL SHOT

               as Klaatu and Bobby turn in surprise. Standing in the open 
               French doors is Hilda, eyeing them with stern suspicion.

                                     HILDA
                              (outraged by Klaatu's 
                              desecration of the 
                              sacred blackboard)
                         How dare you write on that blackboard!
                              (Klaatu eyes her mildly)
                         Do you realize the Professor has 
                         been working on that problem for 
                         weeks?

                                     KLAATU
                              (pleasantly)
                         He'll catch on to it in no time now.

                                     HILDA
                              (controlling herself 
                              with an effort)
                         How did you get in here? And what do 
                         you want?

                                     KLAATU
                         We came to see Professor Barnhardt.

                                     HILDA
                         Well, he's not here. And he won't be 
                         back till this evening.
                              (sternly)
                         I think you'd better leave now. 
                         Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk 
                         and scribbles something on a scratch 
                         pad. He tears off the piece of paper 
                         and hands it to Hilda.

                                     KLAATU
                         You might keep this.
                              (with easy assurance)
                         I think the professor will want to 
                         get in touch with me.

               With a polite nod he goes out the French doors, followed by 
               Bobby. Hilda eyes the door for a moment, then glances down 
               at the paper in her hand, disturbed and puzzled by this 
               stranger. Her glance wanders to the blackboard and she picks 
               up an eraser, debating whether to erase Klaatu's corrections. 
               At that moment the French door opens and Klaatu sticks his 
               head in. Startled, Hilda drops the eraser.

                                     KLAATU
                              (pointing to the 
                              blackboard)
                         I wouldn't erase that. The Professor 
                         needs it very badly.

               And he disappears, leaving Hilda to glare after him in 
               impotent rage. Deciding that this man is either a crackpot 
               or a menace, she goes to the telephone on the desk and starts 
               dialing a number.

               EXT. BARNHARDT'S HOUSE - MED. SHOT

               as Klaatu and Bobby come down the steps and turn into the 
               sidewalk. They are talking and laughing together, but we 
               can't hear their conversation. CAMERA PANS with them as they 
               move on up the sidewalk, revealing two kids playing hopscotch. 
               Klaatu watches, fascinated, as he walks by. Then, having 
               passed the kids, he tries the one-footed, then two-footed 
               hop that characterizes the game.

               INT. BARNHARDT'S STUDY

               Hilda is talking on the phone.

                                     HILDA
                         --no, Sergeant, there was no 
                         classified material around, but I 
                         have instructions to report anything 
                         unusual to the police... Yes -- I'm 
                         Professor Barnhardt's secretary.
                              (consulting the paper 
                              in her hand)
                         The man's name is Carpenter -- and 
                         he lives at 1615 St. Street, N.W... 
                         Yes, that's right--

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - LONG SHOT - DAY

               Bobby and Klaatu come out of a wooded path into a section of 
               the cemetery where the myriad crosses seem to reach into 
               infinity. They pause for a moment, then Bobby leads the way 
               through one of the rows.

               EXT. ARLINGTON CEMETERY - CLOSE SHOT

               in one of the many rows are crosses that extend beyond CAMERA 
               RANGE. CAMERA MOVES IN on one of the crosses. It bears the 
               name LT. ROBERT BENSON.

               TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND B0BBY

               as they come into scene and look down at the grave.

                                     BOBBY
                         That's my father.
                              (Klaatu glances at 
                              the boy, then nods 
                              understandingly)
                         He was killed at a place called Anzio.

               Klaatu's glance roves out thoughtfully to the infinite rows 
               of crosses, and his eyes are sad as they return to Bobby.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. ARLINGTON CEMETERY - MED. SHOT - DAY

               Klaatu and Bobby are approaching a bench beside a pathway 
               overhung with trees. Bobby leads the way to the bench and 
               they sit down. Klaatu's eyes stray out to the myriad crosses.

                                     KLAATU
                              (Reflectively)
                         Did all these people die in wars?

                                     BOBBY
                              (somewhat surprised)
                         Sure. Didn't you ever hear of 
                         Arlington Cemetery?

                                     KLAATU
                         No -- I'm afraid not.

                                     BOBBY
                              (very serious)
                         Mr. Carpenter" -- you don't seem to 
                         know about anything.

                                     KLAATU
                              (Amused)
                         I'll tell you, Bobby -- I've been 
                         away for a long time. Very far away.

                                     BOBBY
                         Is it different where you've been?
                              (indicating the 
                              cemetery)
                         Don't they have places like this?

                                     KLAATU
                              (slowly)
                         They have cemeteries. But not like 
                         this one... You see, they don't have 
                         any wars.

               Bobby looks at him, puzzled and impressed by this 
               incomprehensible notion.

                                     BOBBY
                         Gee -- that's a good idea.

               His eyes are drawn subconsciously out to the rows of crosses. 
               Then he turns back to Klaatu with a slow-dawning look of 
               curiosity, and Klaatu deliberately changes the subject.

                                     KLAATU
                         What would you like to do this 
                         afternoon?

               After a moment Bobby's expression changes and he breaks into 
               a broad grin.

                                     BOBBY
                         Go to the movies.

                                     KLAATU
                         All right.

                                     BOBBY
                              (he didn't dare hope 
                              for this)
                         No foolin'? Will you?

                                     KLAATU
                         Certainly.
                              (then he hesitates)
                         Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to 
                         have money to go there?

               Bobby gives him a look of amazement, then grins, assuming 
               Klaatu was kidding and simply hasn't any money.

                                     BOBBY
                              (eagerly)
                         I've got some money. My mother gave 
                         me two dollars.

                                     KLAATU
                         No -- I want to take you to the 
                         movies.
                              (he takes some objects 
                              out of his pocket)
                         Do you think they'd accept these?

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU'S HAND

               Sparkling in his palm are eight or ten cut diamonds of various 
               sizes.

               TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY

               The boy is staring at the stones in wide-eyed amazement.

                                     BOBBY
                         Gee -- those look like diamonds!

                                     KLAATU
                         Some places that's what people use 
                         for money. They're easy to carry -- 
                         and they don't wear out.

                                     BOBBY
                              (staring at them 
                              fascinated)
                         Bet they're worth about a million 
                         dollars.

                                     KLAATU
                         Would you give me your two dollars 
                         for a couple of them?

                                     BOBBY
                              (with a nervous, unsure 
                              smile)
                         Well, sure, but--

               The boy studies Klaatu's face to see if he's kidding. 
               Realizing that he's not, Bobby's face takes on a childishly 
               shrewd expression -- as though he were about to trade a 
               jackknife for an ocean liner.

                                     BOBBY
                              (slowly)
                         Okay.

               The boy takes out two dollar bills and offers them almost 
               challengingly. Klaatu takes the bills and hands Bobby two 
               good-sized Diamonds. They study their new acquisitions with 
               interest. Bobby looks up from his diamonds to steal a guilty 
               glance at Klaatu.

                                     BOBBY
                         Let's not say anything to my mother 
                         about this, Mr. Carpenter.

                                     KLAATU
                              (mildly curious)
                         Why not, Bobby?

                                     BOBBY
                              (gravely)
                         She doesn't like me to steal from 
                         people.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. BOARDINGHOUSE STREET - MED. SHOT - NIGHT

               Shooting toward the curb as a police prowl car drives up and 
               stops in front of the boardinghouse. A Detective in 
               plainclothes gets out and gestures to the uniformed Driver 
               to pull up the street a way and wait. The Driver nods and 
               the car moves off as the Detective crosses the sidewalk to 
               the boardinghouse.

               EXT. BOARDINGHOUSE - MED. CLOSE SHOT

               As the Detective mounts the steps he glances through a window 
               into the living room. Klaatu can be seen reading to Bobby, 
               who is perched happily on the arm of Klaatu's chair. The 
               Detective moves to the front door ant rings the bell. There 
               is the sound of running feet and in a moment the door is 
               opened and Bobby appears.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         Mr. Carpenter come home yet?

                                     BOBBY
                              (studying the man 
                              curiously)
                         Yeah -- he's right inside.

               INT. DOWNSTAIRS - BOARDINGHOUSE

                                     DETECTIVE
                         Tell him I'd like to see him.

                                     BOBBY
                              (calling out)
                         Mr. Carpenter--!
                              (to the Detective)
                         Come on in.

               The Detective steps inside and Bobby closes the door, as 
               Klaatu appears from the living room.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         Your name Carpenter?

                                     KLAATU
                              (puzzled that anyone 
                              should know him)
                         Yes.
                              (then recalling, with 
                              a smile of 
                              satisfaction)
                         Oh -- I suppose Professor Barnhardt's 
                         looking far me.

                                     DETECTIVE
                              (dryly, with grim 
                              emphasis)
                         I been looking for you all afternoon.

               EXT. BOARDINGHOUSE STREET - MED. SHOT - NIGHT

               An inexpensive convertible -- a 1948 Ford, or Chevrolet -- 
               drives up and stops in front of the house. Helen and Tom are 
               in it.

               INT. CONVERTABLE - TW0 SHOT - HELEN AND TOM

               You get the feeling that Helen and Ton have spent a very 
               enjoyable day together and are reluctant to say goodnight. 
               Tom puts his arm around her and kisses her.

                                     HELEN
                              (fondly)
                         It was a wonderful day.

                                     TOM
                         You still haven't answered my 
                         question.

                                     HELEN
                              (warmly sincere)
                         You know how I feel, Tom. I just 
                         want to think it over.

                                     TOM
                         The boss is leaving for Chicago 
                         tomorrow. If I could tell him I was 
                         getting married -- with two dependents--

                                     HELEN
                              (smiling)
                         You're a good salesman -- but I've 
                         got to think about it.

                                     TOM
                         A good insurance salesman wouldn't 
                         give you time to think.

               With a smile and, a quick kiss, Helen gets out of the car.

                                     HELEN
                         'Night.

               MED. SHOT

               as Helen turns and hurries across the sidewalk to the house. 
               In the entrance she turns and waves to Tom. He waves back 
               and drives off slowly. Helen lets herself in with her key.

               INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL - BOARDINGHOUSE

               The Detective is putting on his hat and preparing to leave 
               with Klaatu as Helen enters. There is a moment of awkwardness 
               and confusion as she glances, puzzled, at the Detective. 
               Bobby runs to her and greets her excitedly.

                                     BOBBY
                         Hi Mom!

                                     HELEN
                         Hello, darling.
                              (she kisses Bobby, 
                              then turns 
                              questioningly to 
                              Klaatu and the 
                              Detective)
                         Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.

               Klaatu is uneasy but tries not to show it as he smiles in 
               greeting and introduces the Detective.

                                     KLAATU
                         Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady.

                                     BOBBY
                              (Impressively)
                         Mr. Brady's a cop.

               Helen glances quickly at the Detective, then at Klaatu, 
               surprised and troubled. She turns to Bobby to cover her 
               confusion.

                                     HELEN
                              (to Bobby)
                         Did you have a nice day, dear?

                                     BOBBY
                              (enthusiastically)
                         Boy, we had a swell time. Didn't we, 
                         Mr. Carpenter?

                                     KLAATU
                         We certainly did.

                                     BOBBY
                         We went to the movies -- and we had 
                         ice cream cones -- and we went to 
                         see Daddy--

                                     HELEN
                              (moved and grateful, 
                              she's uneasy and 
                              concerned as she 
                              turns to Klaatu)
                         I don't know how to thank you.

                                     KLAATU
                         I enjoyed every minute of it.

                                     DETECTIVE
                              (with quiet insistence)
                         We better get goin', Mr. Carpenter.

               As Klaatu nods and prepares to follow him, Bobby speaks to 
               Klaatu.

                                     BOBBY
                         Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.

                                     KLAATU
                         We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, 
                         Bobby.

                                     BOBBY
                              (reluctantly)
                         Goodnight.

               Klaatu and the Detective nod to Helen and they go out. Helen 
               watches the door close with real concern, wondering why the 
               police want Klaatu and hoping he hasn't done anything wrong. 
               Still disturbed, she turns to lead Bobby upstairs.

                                     HELEN
                         Come on, Bobby. Time to go to bed.

                                     BOBBY
                              (he followers her, 
                              then hesitates)
                         Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have 
                         to go down to the police station?

                                     HELEN
                         I -- I don't know, dear... Perhaps 
                         there's some mistake.

               This satisfies him for the moment -- even though it doesn't 
               satisfy Helen. He is climbing the stairs beside her.

                                     BOBBY
                         We sure had fun today. We saw the 
                         space ship and we went to see 
                         Professor Barnhardt -- and--

                                     HELEN
                              (flashing him a 
                              puzzled, incredulous 
                              look)
                         Professor Barnhardt.

                                     BOBBY
                              (almost ignoring the 
                              interruption)
                         Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to 
                         school tomorrow?

                                     HELEN
                         Of course, dear.

                                     BOBBY
                         Aw, gee, Mom -- I had plans to play 
                         with Mr. Carpenter.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. POLICE STATION - FULL SHOT - NIGHT

               The place is crowded and there is a feeling of feverish but 
               well-ordered activity. Unidentified people who have been 
               picked up in the search for the space man are being screened 
               by the police. They are all men -- all between forty and 
               sixty years old -- and they are from all walks of life. A 
               series of desks have been arranged in a row, with signs over 
               them reading IDENTIFICATION. At each desk is a team of cops 
               and before each desk is a line of men waiting to be screened. 
               At the far end of the room Klaatu can be seen at the desk of 
               a Police Lieutenant, with the detective who picked him up.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               Shooting over the shoulders of two cops at one of the desks, 
               toward the line of people they are screening. A nondescript, 
               middle-aged vagrant stands before the desk as one of the 
               cops flips through a card file.

                                     FIRST COP
                              (to the cop beside 
                              him)
                         B.M. Alberts -- no prior arrests.

                                     SECOND COP
                              (to the vagrant)
                         No identification?
                              (the man shakes his 
                              head dully)
                         Send him over to G-2.

               The man is taken out of the line as CAMERA MOVES ON to the 
               next desk, with another pair of cops and another line. A 
               rather distinguished-looking business man is placing a sheaf 
               of identification cards and papers on the desk.

                                     BUSINESSMAN
                         My wife just arrived with my 
                         identification.

               One of the cops at the desk glances over the papers and nods 
               to the man.

                                     THIRD COP
                         That'll be all, Mr. Baxter. Sorry to 
                         bother you... Next.

               CAMERA MOVES ON to a third desk where a small, rat-faced man 
               is standing uneasily before the two cops, one of whom is 
               flipping through a card file.

                                     FOURTH COP
                         Cappo, John C?
                              (the man nods)
                         Two priors -- one for petty theft -- 
                         one for shoplifting.

                                     FIFTH COP
                              (waving the man away)
                         Okay, Jonny -- you can go.

                                     MAN
                              (with a nervous grin)
                         Sometimes a record comes in handy.
                              (and he moves off)

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - AT LIEUTENANT'S DESK

               A Detective Lieutenant in plain clothes is questioning Klaatu, 
               who stands beside the Detective who brought him in. The 
               Lieutenant is a rugged but dignified man about fifty, 
               intelligent and businesslike.

                                     LIEUTENANT
                         The Professor's secretary says she 
                         found you in Barnhardt's room, making 
                         marks on his blackboard.

                                     KLAATU
                         I was only trying to be helpful. He 
                         was having difficulty with a problem.

               The Lieutenant exchanges a look with the Detective.

                                     LIEUTENANT
                              (sardonically)
                         Oh, I see. He was having trouble and 
                         you were helping him out.

                                     KLAATU
                              (pleasantly)
                         That's right.

                                     LIEUTENANT
                              (quietly sharp and 
                              accusing)
                         I suppose you know that Barnhardt 
                         does a lot of secret work for the 
                         Army.

                                     KLAATU
                         In this case the secret wouldn't be 
                         worth much. He doesn't know the answer 
                         himself.

                                     LIEUTENANT
                              (growing impatient)
                         But I suppose you know the answer.

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a deprecating 
                              shrug)
                         It's really quite simple... The three-
                         body problem, you know.

               The lieutenant shifts in his chair, annoyed that he has to 
               deal with this madman. He glances at a report on his desk, 
               trying to control his impatience.

                                     LIEUTENANT
                         Your name's Carpenter -- that right?
                              (Klaatu nods)
                         Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? 
                         Driver's license -- social security 
                         number?

                                     KLAATU
                         No -- I'm afraid not.

                                     LIEUTENANT
                         Well, how do I know who you are?

                                     KLAATU
                              (secretly amused)
                         You don't.

               The Lieutenant is turning away in exasperation as a uniformed 
               cop comes into the scene.

                                     COP
                         Excuse me, Lieutenant --
                              (pointing offscene)
                         The Doc says this man needs treatment 
                         right away.

               MED. SHOT

               A man about forty-five, bloodied and badly beaten, is being 
               supported and half-carried by two policemen. A police doctor 
               is guiding them to a doorway, near which is a sign INFIRMARY. 
               The man is almost unconscious, incapable even of holding up 
               his head.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - AT LIEUTENANT'S DESK

                                     LIEUTENANT
                         What's the story?

                                     COP
                         Some fella caught him lookin' in a 
                         window and figured he was the space 
                         man. The whole neighborhood went 
                         crazy and they ganged up on him. 
                         Would have killed him if we hadn't 
                         come along... Turns out he was just 
                         a prowler.

               The Lieutenant grimaces his disgust and impatience with mob 
               violence.

                                     LIEUTENANT
                         Okay -- book him and get him fixed 
                         up.
                              (the cops nods and 
                              goes, and the 
                              Lieutenant growls as 
                              he turns back to 
                              Klaatu and the 
                              Detective)
                         Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.

                                     KLAATU
                              (appalled by what he 
                              has seen and heard)
                         They would have killed this man?

                                     LIEUTENANT
                              (gruffly)
                         People get hysterical enough, they 
                         do anything.
                              (impatiently)
                         Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't 
                         identify yourself, I got to send you 
                         over to the Army.

                                     KLAATU
                              (pretending impatience, 
                              but actually growing 
                              concerned)
                         How long will that take?

                                     LIEUTENANT
                         They can tell right away. They've 
                         got a couple of doctors who saw this 
                         man in the hospital.
                              (to the Detective)
                         Take him over to G2.

               Really concerned now, Klaatu tries to find a way out. He 
               attempts an authoritative air.

                                     KLAATU
                         It's very important, Lieutenant, 
                         that I see Professor Barnhardt.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         Come on, Mr. Carpenter--

               Shaking off the Detective's hand, Klaatu speaks to the 
               Lieutenant.

                                     KLAATU
                         May I suggest that you call the 
                         Professor?

                                     LIEUTENANT
                              (all patience gone)
                         Get going, will you, Brady -- before 
                         I get mad!

               The Detective takes Klaatu's arm and leads him toward the 
               door. As they go they pass a Military Police Captain, who 
               makes his way straight to the Lieutenant's desk.

               EXT. POLICE STATION - TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND DETECTIVE

               as they come out of the station. Klaatu hesitates a moment, 
               looks around. His face reveals nothing, but he seems to be 
               momentarily considering the idea of making a break. The 
               Detective, sensitive to such a possibility, hooks his arm 
               under Klaatu's and nods his head toward the sidewalk in silent 
               command. Klaatu allows himself to be led off.

               MED. SHOT

               as the Detective leads Klaatu across the sidewalk to the 
               curb, where a police car is standing. Parked just behind it 
               is an Army staff car.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - ENTRANCE TO POLICE STATION

               as the M.P. Captain appears in the entrance, accompanied by 
               the Police Lieutenant. They see Klaatu and the Detective 
               approaching the police car and hurry out of scene after them.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - AT POLICE CAR

                                     LIEUTENANT
                              (to the Detective)
                         Wait a minute, Brady--
                              (indicating orders in 
                              his hand)
                         The Captain here's got orders from 
                         General Cutler to take this man over 
                         to Professor Barnhardt.

                                     M.P. CAPTAIN
                              (to Klaatu firmly but 
                              respectfully)
                         Will you come with me, Sir?

               MED. SHOT

               as Klaatu gets out of the police car and the Captain escorts 
               him toward the staff car. Passing the Lieutenant, Klaatu 
               speaks with a polite smile, a smile that might be one of 
               mild triumph.

                                     KLAATU
                         Sorry to trouble you, Lieutenant.

               The Lieutenant reacts with impatient exasperation as the 
               Captain holds the staff car door open for Klaatu, who steps 
               into the Army vehicle, as we--

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. HALLWAY - BARNHARDT'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               as the M.P. Captain and Klaatu enter the front door, which 
               is held open for then by Hilda. She gestures them toward the 
               half-open door of Barnhardt's study, where Barnhardt can be 
               seen puzzling over the problem on the blackboard. The Captain 
               knocks on the open door to attract his attention and enters 
               with Klaatu.

               INT. BARNHARDT'S STUDY

               Barnhardt turns from his deep preoccupation at the blackboard, 
               chalk in hand.

                                     M.P. CAPTAIN
                         This is the man you wanted to see, 
                         Professor.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (studying Klaatu 
                              curiously)
                         Thank you, Captain.

                                     M.P. CAPTAIN
                         I'll wait outside.

               He steps out into the hall, closing the door. Barnhardt 
               continues to study Klaatu for a moment, then points to the 
               notations he made on the blackboard. There is a controlled 
               but anxious excitement in Barnhardt's attitude.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         You wrote this?

                                     KLAATU
                              (nodding easily)
                         It was a clumsy way to introduce 
                         myself -- but I understand you're a 
                         difficult man to see.
                              (glancing at the 
                              blackboard 
                              reproachfully)
                         I thought you'd have the solution by 
                         this time.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Not yet. That's why I wanted to see 
                         you.

               Klaatu glances at the work Barnhardt has been doing on the 
               board. Then he points to one of the expressions in an 
               equation.

                                     KLAATU
                         All you have to do now is substitute 
                         this expression--
                              (pointing to a specific 
                              place)
                         --at this point.

               Impressed and interested, Barnhardt tugs at his chin as he 
               studies and weighs the results.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (slowly, thoughtfully)
                         Yes -- that will reproduce the first-
                         order terms. But what about the effect 
                         of the other terms?

                                     KLAATU
                         Almost negligible... With variation 
                         of parameters, this is the answer.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         How can you be so sure? Have you 
                         tested this theory?

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a slight smile)
                         I find it works well enough to get 
                         me from one planet to another.
                              (Barnhardt stares at 
                              him blankly)
                         I understand you've called a meeting 
                         to study our space ship.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         As though unsure of what he's heard) 
                         Yes -- yes, I have.

                                     KLAATU
                         My name is Klaatu.
                              (noting that 
                              Barnhardt's expression 
                              is changing from 
                              amazement to 
                              incredulity)
                         I spent two days at your Walter Reed 
                         Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name 
                         was Major White -- and I had a very 
                         attractive nurse called Ruth, who's 
                         getting married next Wednesday.
                              (Klaatu waits for 
                              this to sink in, 
                              then speaks with 
                              quiet authority)
                         If you are not interested -- or if 
                         you intend to turn me over to your 
                         Army -- we needn't waste any more 
                         time.

               Barnhardt hesitates for a long, thoughtful moment. Then he 
               goes to the door, opens it and speaks to the Captain outside.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (to the Captain, his 
                              voice a little 
                              unsteady)
                         You can go now, Captain. Please thank 
                         General Cutler and tell him -- tell 
                         him that I know this gentleman.

               Barnhardt closes the door and turns to find Klaatu watching 
               him with a faint smile. Barnhardt sinks into a chair, trying 
               to adjust his mind.

                                     KLAATU
                              (dryly)
                         You have faith, Professor Barnhardt

                                     BARNHARDT
                         It isn't faith that makes good 
                         science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.
                              (unable to conceal 
                              his interest)
                         Sit down, please. I have several 
                         thousand questions to ask you.

                                     KLAATU
                              (ignoring the 
                              invitation)
                         I would like to explain something of 
                         my mission here.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         That was my first question.

                                     KLAATU
                              (with some bitterness)
                         It was my intention to discuss this 
                         officially -- with all the nations 
                         of the Earth -- but I was not allowed 
                         the Opportunity. I have come to 
                         realize since that your mutual fears 
                         and suspicions are merely the normal 
                         reactions of a primitive society.
                              (gathering his thoughts)
                         We know from scientific observation 
                         that you have discovered a rudimentary 
                         kind of atomic energy. We also know 
                         that you are experimenting with 
                         rockets.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Yes -- that is true.

                                     KLAATU
                         In the hands of a mature civilization, 
                         these would not be considered weapons 
                         of aggression. But in the hands of 
                         your people--
                              (he shrugs and shakes 
                              his head)
                         We've observed your aggressive 
                         tendencies, and we don't trust you 
                         with such power.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (puzzled)
                         If you mean that you are afraid of 
                         us--

                                     KLAATU
                              (with cool impressive 
                              emphasis)
                         We want to be sure you don't make -- 
                         let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. 
                         We know the potentiality of these 
                         developments and we are disturbed to 
                         find them in the hands of children... 
                         You see, we've had atomic energy for 
                         five thousand of your years.
                              (indicating the 
                              telephone)
                         We discarded instruments like this 
                         many centuries ago.
                              (he paces thoughtfully)
                         So long as you were limited to 
                         fighting among yourselves -- with 
                         your primitive tanks and planes -- 
                         we were unconcerned. But soon you 
                         will apply atomic energy to space 
                         ships -- and then you become a threat 
                         to the peace and security of other 
                         planets. That, of course, we cannot 
                         tolerate.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (thoughtful and 
                              impressed)
                         These other planets -- do they have 
                         peace and security?

                                     KLAATU
                         We had our atomic wars -- thousands 
                         of years ago.
                              (he smiles wryly)
                         After that we fought with bows and 
                         arrows. Then, slowly, we learned 
                         that fighting is no solution -- that 
                         aggression leads to chaos.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (with deep conviction)
                         We scientists understand this. Even 
                         we primitive scientists.
                              (Straightforwardly)
                         What exactly is the nature of your 
                         mission, Mr. Klaatu?

                                     KLAATU
                         I came here to warn you that, by 
                         threatening danger, your planet faces 
                         danger -- very grave danger. I am 
                         prepared, however, to offer a 
                         solution.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Would you care to be more specific?

                                     KLAATU
                              (evenly)
                         What I have to say must be said to 
                         all concerned.
                              (with a suggestion of 
                              deference to Barnhardt)
                         It is too important to be entrusted 
                         to any individual.

               Barnhardt is forced reluctantly to accept Klaatu's refusal 
               to go any further. After a moment's thought, he speaks 
               seriously, but with a twinkle in his eye.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         I gather that your efforts on the 
                         official level were not entirely 
                         successful.

                                     KLAATU
                              (sternly, as this 
                              unpleasant episode 
                              is recalled)
                         I come to you as a last resort -- 
                         and I confess that my patience is 
                         wearing thin.
                              (with Jovian annoyance)
                         Must I take drastic action in order 
                         to get a hearing?

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (uneasily)
                         What -- what sort of action do you 
                         mean?

                                     KLAATU
                         Violent action -- since that seems 
                         to be the only thing you people 
                         understand.
                              (quietly)
                         Leveling the island of Manhattan, 
                         perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of 
                         Gibraltar into the sea.

               Barnhardt stands staring at him for a moment, passes his 
               hand across his brow. Then, as Klaatu watches, Barnhardt 
               paces the floor, trying to digest what he has heard. After a 
               moment, he turns to Klaatu.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Would you be willing to meet with 
                         the group of scientists I am calling 
                         together?. Perhaps you could explain 
                         your mission to them, and they in 
                         turn could present it to their various 
                         peoples.

                                     KLAATU
                              (quietly, evenly)
                         That's what I came to see you about.

               Barnhardt flings him a glance, then looks momentarily 
               sheepish. But his own eagerness carries him on. He paces the 
               floor thoughtfully.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         It is not enough to have men of 
                         science. We scientists are too easily 
                         ignored -- or misunderstood. We must 
                         get important men from every field. 
                         Educators -- philosophers -- church 
                         leaders -- men of vision and 
                         imagination -- the finest minds in 
                         the world.

                                     KLAATU
                         I leave that in your hands.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         You'd have no objection to revealing 
                         yourself at this meeting?

                                     KLAATU
                         No -- not at all.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         What about your personal safety in 
                         the meantime? What about the Army -- 
                         and the police?

                                     KLAATU
                         My name is Carpenter and I'm a very 
                         earthy character living in a 
                         respectable boarding house.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (smiling, but a little 
                              concerned)
                         I'm afraid I can't offer you any 
                         real protection. I have no influence 
                         in cases of inter-planetary 
                         conspiracy.

                                     KLAATU
                         I'm sure I'll be quite safe until 
                         the meeting.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (he suddenly pauses, 
                              thoughtfully)
                         One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this 
                         group should reject your proposals. 
                         What is the alternative?

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a sense of quiet, 
                              inescapable power)
                         I'm afraid you have no alternative. 
                         In such, a case the planet Earth 
                         would have to be--
                              (he looks for the 
                              right word)
                         --eliminated.

               The implications of this statement leave Barnhardt speechless, 
               his keen mind reeling.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Such power exists?

                                     KLAATU
                         I assure you such power exists.

               Barnhardt stands silent for a moment, trying to collect his 
               shattered thoughts. Klaatu watches him as he starts pacing 
               again.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         The people who came to the meeting 
                         must be made to realize this. They 
                         must understand what is at stake.
                              (after a thoughtful 
                              moment, he looks up)
                         You mentioned a demonstration of 
                         force--

                                     KLAATU
                         Yes.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Would such, a demonstration be 
                         possible before the meeting?

                                     KLAATU
                         Yes -- of course.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Something that would dramatize for 
                         them and for their people the 
                         seriousness of the situation. 
                         Something that would affect the entire 
                         planet.

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a nod)
                         That can easily be arranged.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (frightened by his 
                              easy assumption of 
                              infinite power)
                         I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- 
                         or destroy anything.

                                     KLAATU
                              (easily)
                         Why don't you leave it to me? I'll 
                         think of something.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (with a nervous half-
                              smile)
                         Maybe a little demonstration.

                                     KLAATU
                              (thinking about it)
                         Something dramatic -- but not 
                         destructive.
                              (intellectually amused)
                         It's quite an interesting problem.
                              (Barnhardt nods vaguely)
                         Would day after tomorrow be all right? 
                         Say about noon?

               Klaatu's bland manner leaves Barnhardt shaken, almost wishing 
               he'd never started this business.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               INT. LIVING ROOM - BOARDINGHOUSE - NIGHT

               It is about 3:30 the following evening. Helen is sitting in 
               a chair leafing through a magazine. She is dressed to go 
               out. A corner of the dining room can be seen, where Mr. and 
               Mrs. Barley are playing cards with Mr. Krull. Mrs. Crockett, 
               the landlady, enters from the hall on her way to the dining 
               room and notices Helen.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                         Going out, dear?

                                     HELEN
                         Yes, I'm waiting for Tom to pick me 
                         up.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                              (with a shudder)
                         Personally, I won't go out after 
                         dark these days.
                              (with an attempt at 
                              slyness)
                         But then -- I'm not courting, am I?

               She turns to go on into the dining room and as she does so 
               almost bumps into Klaatu who is coming out, having been 
               kibitzing the card game.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                              (thoroughly startled)
                         Oh -- Mr. Carpenter--!

               Klaatu steps aside as she hurries nervously into the dining 
               room. He turns, puzzled, to find Helen watching with a slight 
               smile.

                                     KLAATU
                         Everyone seems so--
                              (he shakes his hands 
                              to indicate 
                              nervousness)

                                     HELEN
                         Jittery is the word.

               Helen watches him, a little uneasy in his presence. She is 
               fond of him, and she can't help being curious and concerned 
               about his brush with the police.

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a contemplative 
                              smile)
                         Bobby's the only person I know who 
                         isn't -- Jittery.

                                     HELEN
                         He has his homework to keep him 
                         occupied.

                                     KLAATU
                              (fondly, sincerely)
                         He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.

                                     HELEN
                         Naturally I think so.

                                     KLAATU
                         Warm and friendly and intelligent--
                              (thoughtfully)
                         You know -- he's the only real friend 
                         I've made since I've been here.

               Helen is deeply moved by Klaatu's affection for the boy, She 
               tried to dismiss her curiosity about him, but she can't. She 
               decides to face it.

                                     HELEN
                              (hesitantly and with 
                              some difficulty)
                         Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my 
                         business, but -- why did that 
                         detective come here last night?

                                     KLAATU
                              (with easy frankness)
                         Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a 
                         few questions. Bobby and I tried to 
                         see Professor Barnhardt in the 
                         afternoon, but he wasn't in. 
                         Apparently they thought I was looking 
                         for secrets of some kind.

               Helen has reacted in puzzlement at this second mention of 
               Barnhardt. They are interrupted by the ringing of the 
               doorbell. Helen goes to answer it.

               INT. HALLWAY

               as Helen opens the front door to admit Tom. He appears 
               impatient, anxious to get going.

                                     HELEN
                         Hello--

                                     TOM
                         You ready?

                                     HELEN
                         I will be in just a minute.

                                     TOM
                              (a little annoyed 
                              that she hasn't her 
                              coat on, he consults 
                              his watch)
                         The picture starts at eight-fifty.

                                     HELEN
                              (in explanation)
                         I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.

                                     TOM
                              (lightly, but with 
                              real sarcasm 
                              underneath)
                         I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm 
                         intruding.

               Helen tries to shush him, to indicate Klaatu is in the next 
               room, when Klaatu appears in the doorway. He must have heard 
               Tom's remark, and there is an awkward moment. Klaatu is 
               completely unperturbed, but Helen is embarrassed.

                                     KLAATU
                         Excuse me. I was just going up to my 
                         room.

                                     HELEN
                              (guiltily)
                         Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.

               Klaatu stops and turns to face them pleasantly.

                                     KLAATU
                         Have a good time -- both of you.

               He goes on up the stairs. Helen steers Tom toward the living 
               room.

                                     HELEN
                         Why don't you wait in here while I 
                         get my things?

               INT. LIVING ROOM

               As they enter from the hall, Helen turns to Tom reproachfully.

                                     HELEN
                              (quietly)
                         Oh, Tom, that was awful.

                                     TOM
                              (momentary apologetic)
                         I'm sorry. I guess I'm just tired of 
                         hearing about Mr. Carpenter.
                              (Helen shushes him)
                         I don't like the way he's attached 
                         himself to you and Bobby. After all, 
                         what do you know about him?

               This touches on Helen's own private doubts, and she cannot 
               answer.

                                     HELEN
                         I'll go get my things.

               She turns quickly and goes into the hall and hurries up the 
               stairs. Tom looks after her, dismissing the matter with a 
               shake of the head and a philosophical sigh. Of such stuff 
               are women made.

               INT - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

               Helen reaches the top of the stairs, crosses to her room and 
               grabs a coat off the bed. She's putting it on as she moves 
               down the hall to Bobby's room, the door of which is open.

               INT. BOBBY'S ROOM

               Bobby is at a table doing his homework and Klaatu has just 
               finished explaining an arithmetic problem to him, as Helen 
               enters, still putting on her coat.

                                     KLAATU
                              (about to leave)
                         All you have to remember is, first 
                         find the common denominator -- then 
                         subtract.

                                     BOBBY
                         Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.

                                     KLAATU
                              (to Helen, pleasantly)
                         I'll say goodnight again.

               Helen is embarrassed. She would like to apologize for the 
               awkwardness downstairs but she doesn't quite know how to go 
               about it.

                                     HELEN
                         Mr. Carpenter, I--
                              (it's too complicated; 
                              she can't do it)
                         Goodnight.

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a warm smile of 
                              complete understanding 
                              and appreciation)
                         Goodnight, my dear.

               He turns and goes out, closing the door. A little distracted, 
               Helen turns to Bobby.

                                     HELEN
                         Go to bed, darling. You can finish 
                         that in the morning.

                                     BOBBY
                         Okay.

               Helen watches as he starts to put away his work. She wants 
               to tell him something, but finds it difficult to say.

                                     HELEN
                              (hesitantly, almost 
                              guiltily)
                         Bobby -- I think it would be better 
                         if we didn't see quite so much of 
                         Mr. Carpenter

                                     BOBBY
                              (shocked, and 
                              bewildered)
                         Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... 
                         And he's awful good in arithmetic. 
                         He even helps Professor Barnhardt.

                                     HELEN
                         Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go 
                         to see Professor Barnhardt?

                                     BOBBY
                         Sure we did! He wasn't there but we 
                         went to see him. And Mr. Carpenter 
                         showed him how to do his arithmetic.

               Helen is surprised to get this corroboration for Klaatu's 
               story. Sensing his mother's uneasiness, the boy looks for 
               something intriguing -- some deep, dark secret.

                                     BOBBY
                              (shrewdly)
                         Mom -- is there something wrong with 
                         Mr. Carpenter?

                                     HELEN
                         What do you mean, dear?

                                     BOBBY
                         I mean -- on account of that policeman 
                         last night.
                              (his eyes light up 
                              hopefully)
                         You think he's a bank robber, maybe? 
                         Or a gangster?

                                     HELEN
                         No, dear, of course not. He's a very 
                         nice man. I Just think he might prefer 
                         to be left alone. Now you get to bed 
                         and forget about it.
                              (she kisses him)
                         'Night, darling.

               With a reassuring smile, she starts for the door.

                                     BOBBY
                         Goodnight.
                              (stopping her in the 
                              doorway, his 
                              imaginative suspicions 
                              mounting)
                         Hey Mom -- why would he want to be 
                         alone?

               Not wanting to go into this any further, Helen blows him a 
               kiss and backs out, closing the door. Bobby stands thinking 
               for a moment, his mind still speculating on all sorts of 
               wonderful possibilities. Still preoccupied, he drifts over 
               to his bed and sits down to take of his shoes. He drops the 
               first one to the floor and is starting on the other, when 
               there is a light rap on his door. The door opens and Klaatu 
               appears.

                                     KLAATU
                         Bobby -- have you a flashlight?

                                     BOBBY
                              (surprised by his 
                              appearance and his 
                              request)
                         Yeah -- sure.
                              (he goes to a drawer 
                              and gets a large 
                              hand flashlight)
                         It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.

               Bobby hands him the light, studying his face with eager 
               curiosity.

                                     BOBBY
                         What do you want it for, Mr. 
                         Carpenter?

                                     KLAATU
                              (evasively)
                         Why -- the light in my room went 
                         out.
                              (cutting off further 
                              questions)
                         Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.

               Klaatu goes out, closing the door behind him. Bobby hesitates 
               a moment, puzzled and curious. Then he goes over to the door, 
               flips off the lights, and slowly, noiselessly opens the door 
               a crack so he can peer out into the hall.

               MED. SHOT

               shooting down the hall through the crack in Bobby's door.

               Klaatu's door is ajar and through it the lights in his room 
               can be seen burning brightly. Klaatu goes to his door, reaches 
               in and flips off the lights and closes the door. He then 
               scans the hall in both directions. Satisfied he isn't seen, 
               he moves surreptitiously down the hall toward the stairs, 
               still carrying the flashlight.

               MED CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

               as he closes his door carefully, an expression of intense 
               excitement on his face. What he has seem is certainly, 
               unmistakably suspicious. Why did Mr. Carpenter lie to him? 
               What does he want the flashlight for and where is he going? 
               Bobby decides he's got to find out. Hurriedly he laces on 
               the shoe he had taken off, and peers out the door to find 
               the hall clear. He slips out the door, closing it behind 
               him.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. STREET - MED. CLOSE SHOT - NIGHT

               Klaatu is walking down the dark, semi-deserted street with 
               the determined stride of a man with a definite objective.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

               Half a block behind, he's following Klaatu, eagerly, flushed 
               with a sense of excitement and adventure.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER - NIGHT

               Walking along the sidewalk, Klaatu turns into a side street, 
               disappearing from view around the corner. In a moment, Bobby 
               hurries into scene breathlessly. He pulls up for a moment to 
               rest. Then, getting his breath, he dashes on around the corner 
               after Klaatu.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. LARGE TEMPORARY BUILDING - LONG SHOT - NIGHT

               This is a temporary structure that has been erected to enclose 
               the space ship and Gort. In front of the one small door are 
               two soldiers, standing guard. Concealed in some foreground 
               foliage, studying the layout, is Klaatu. Nearby 's a sign 
               reading: KEEP OUT! This area OFF LIMITS to the public. U.S. 
               ARMY.

               CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

               He is a short distance away, watching Klaatu eagerly.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               as he studies the situation.

               MED. SHOT

               shooting over Klaatu's shoulder. As he watches, a Jeep filled 
               with armed soldiers -- apparently regular patrol -- drives 
               up to the entrance of the building. They stop for a moment 
               while their Sergeant checks with the guards. Assured that 
               everything is under control, the Sergeant signals his driver 
               and the Jeep moves off.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               Scanning the side of the building, he sees what he's looking 
               for. Waiting until the Jeep disappears, he starts toward one 
               side of the building, keeping himself concealed in the 
               foliage.

               CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

               puzzled and interested, as he watches Klaatu.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               The two sentries standing in front of the building.

               MED. SHOT

               as Klaatu maneuvers around the side of the building, where 
               there is a window. It has no glass in it but is heavily 
               barred.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               as he leaves the concealing foliage and crosses the clear, 
               grassy area surrounding the building. He stops and tries to 
               see through the window.

               MED. SHOT - GORT

               shooting through the barred window into the building. The 
               huge robot looms large and eerie in the shadows cast by a 
               couple of naked work-lights. His head is angled, away from 
               the window.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               as Klaatu approaches the window. Aiming his flashlight at 
               Gort, he flashes the light intermittently, as though 
               signaling. (This should not approximate any known code.)

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               As we watch, the intermittent flashes of Klaatu's light appear 
               on the wall ahead of Gort. Slowly, evenly, the robot's head 
               turns to face the window.

               MED. SHOT

               from Gort's viewpoint, of the window, with Klaatu's light 
               flashing its signals.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               shooting on his back, as he finishes signaling and cuts off 
               the flashlight. He turns ant starts back for the concealment 
               of the foliage.

               CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

               craning his neck to look for Klaatu, who has eluded his view. 
               Suddenly he sees Klaatu again.

               MED. SHOT - KLAATU

               making his way behind the foliage toward the front of the 
               building. Arriving at a point opposite the entrance, Klaatu 
               waits and watches.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - ENTRANCE TO BUILDING

               The two guards are standing in the doorway in positions of 
               relaxed alertness. Suddenly, inside the building behind them, 
               the giant figure of Gort looms silently in the doorway. His 
               two great arms reach out, grab the two guards and drag then 
               back inside the building.

               CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

               He lets out an inaudible gasp as he sees this. Bug-eyed, he 
               glances quickly to the point where he last saw Klaatu. He is 
               amazed at what he sees.

               MED. SHOT

               from Bobby's viewpoint. Klaatu has emerged from the 
               concealment of the tree-lined path and is making his way 
               calmly toward the entrance of the building.

               CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

               As he watches Klaatu enter the building, his curiosity 
               conquers his fear and he starts tremblingly toward the 
               structure.

               INT. BUILDING - FULL SHOT

               as Klaatu enters. The huge shapes of the space ship and Gort 
               loom large and eerie. Klaatu starts across the barren 
               enclosure toward the ship.

               EXT. ENTRANCE TO BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT

               as Bobby approaches the door, fearful but fascinated. He 
               peers cautiously inside and his eyes grow wide as saucers.

               EXT. BUILDING - MED. SHOT

               In *f.g., near the door, the two guards lie unconscious. As 
               Klaatu walks toward the ship Gort slowly turns his head to 
               follow him with him with eyes. Klaatu touches a point on the 
               unbroken surface of the ship and the ramp silently swings 
               out and down to the ground. Klaatu mounts the ramp and 
               disappears inside the ship, whereupon the ramp silently 
               closes.

               CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

               as he watches this; his eyes bulging. He can scarcely believe 
               what he has seen. Suddenly a wave of sheer terror sweeps 
               over him. Scrambling to his feet, he turns and runs wildly 
               away.

               INT. SMALL CORRIDOR - SPACE SHIP

               CAMERA FOLLOWS Klaatu as he moves down the tiny, dimly lighted 
               entrance corridor. He steps into the main cabin of the ship 
               and flips a switch which bathes the cabin in a diffused, 
               shadowless light. The walls are lined with a complex of 
               mysterious gadgetry -- knobs, dials, indicators, etc. All of 
               this should be as imaginative and unorthodox as possible, 
               while still retaining a feeling of sound but highly advanced 
               engineering.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               as Klaatu moves to the communications panel, flipping switches 
               and turning dials. Indicators light up. There are crackling, 
               whirring and buzzing sounds. Klaatu starts speaking into a 
               built-in microphone in his own strange language. He speaks 
               in rapid-fire explanation, continuing to talk, as we--

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BUILDING - MED. SHOT - NIGHT

               as Klaatu walks calmly away from the ship, past the two 
               unconscious guards and disappears out of the door.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT THE TWO GUARDS

               as one of them slowly regains consciousness. Looking around, 
               he sees the great figure of Gort and is terror-stricken. He 
               shakes his companion frantically in an effort to bring him 
               to.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. LIVING ROOM BOARDINGHOUSE NIGHT

               Bobby is curled up in a chair waiting for his mother to come 
               home. He's sleepy, but the excitement of what he has seen 
               precluded any such possibility. From the hall we hear the 
               front door opening as Helen and Tom come in.

                                     HELEN'S VOICE
                              (off scene)
                         Why don't you come on in for a minute?

               Helen and Tom appear in the doorway, Helen is startled to 
               see Bobby, who has Jumped up and run toward her.

                                     HELEN
                         Bobby--! What are you doing up at 
                         this hour?

                                     BOBBY
                              (excitedly)
                         I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had 
                         to tell you!

                                     HELEN
                         Tell me what?

                                     BOBBY
                              (the words tadpole 
                              out breathlessly)
                         I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right 
                         after you left -- and, gee, Mom, 
                         where do you think he went? Right 
                         into the space ship!

                                     HELEN
                              (patiently disbelieving)
                         Now, Bobby, just a minute--

                                     BOBBY
                         Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened 
                         up and he walked right in. And that 
                         great big iron man was moving around!

                                     HELEN
                         Bobby, you've been dreaming again.

                                     BOBBY
                              (desperately)
                         No, I haven't, Mom. I promise you... 
                         I saw it!

               Helen and Tom exchange a glance of tolerant amusement.

                                     TOM
                         Where did you see all this, Bobby?

                                     BOBBY
                         On the lawn down at the mall -- in 
                         that place with the soldiers out 
                         front.

                                     TOM
                              (trying to trap him)
                         Where were the soldiers all this 
                         time?

                                     BOBBY
                         That robot fella grabbed 'em and 
                         dragged 'em inside!
                              (his lips trembling)
                         I like Mr. Carpenter -- but I'm 
                         scared, Mom.

               He rushes into Helen's arms, clutching her desperately, trying 
               to hold back his tears.

                                     HELEN
                              (holding him close to 
                              her sympathetically)
                         Mustn't be frightened, darling -- It 
                         was just a bad dream. Here -- we'll 
                         prove it to you.
                              (with a look and a 
                              nod to Tom)
                         Tom, will you ask Mr. Carpenter if 
                         he'll come down for a minute.
                              (Tom turns to go)
                         The room right opposite mine.

               Nodding, Tom disappears into the hall and up the stairs. 
               Still holding Bobby, Helen tries to dispel his fears by an 
               appeal to logic.

                                     HELEN
                         Now think back hard. You didn't follow 
                         Mr. Carpenter at all, did you? You 
                         haven't even been out of the house.

                                     BOBBY
                         Yes, I have!

                                     HELEN
                              (determinedly)
                         You didn't really see the space ship. 
                         You just thought you did.

               Bitterly hurt, Bobby faces his mother gravely, accusingly.

                                     BOBBY
                         I'd never call you a liar.

               INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MED. CLOSE SHOT

               Tom is knocking softly at Klaatu's door. Getting no answer, 
               he tries the door, pushes it open and peers in. Then he steps 
               into the darkened room.

               INT. KLAATU'S ROOM - FULL SHOT

               Tom snaps on the light and looks around the empty room. The 
               bed is still made. Glancing around, Tom's eye is caught by a 
               flash of something bright on the floor below the dresser. He 
               stoops down and picks up a fair-sized diamond. Tom studies 
               the stone curiously, holding it up to the light. Thoroughly 
               puzzled, he keeps the stone in his hand, switches off the 
               light and goes out.

               UPSTAIRS HALL - MED. SHOT

               Closing the door, Tom hurries along the hall and down the 
               stairs

               INT. LIVING ROOM - FULL SHOT

               Through the hall door Tom can be seen coming down the stairs. 
               Helen and Bobby watch expectantly as he enters.

                                     TOM
                         He's not there.
                              (crossing to Helen)
                         But look what I found in his room

                                     HELEN
                              (takes the stone and 
                              studies it, amazed 
                              by its size)
                         Is it real?

                                     TOM
                              (with the shrug of an 
                              amateur)
                         Looks real to me.

                                     BOBBY
                         Mr. Carpenter's got a lot of diamonds.
                              (he digs into his 
                              pocket)
                         He gave me a couple of them.

               Helen takes the two diamonds Bobby holds out in his hand, 
               looking at them in amazement.

                                     HELEN
                         He gave these to you?

                                     BOBBY
                              (guilty for his own 
                              sharp dealing)
                         Well, not exactly. I gave him two 
                         dollars.

                                     TOM
                         This doesn't make sense... I think 
                         the guy's a crook. I never did trust 
                         him.

               Helen tries to shush Tom, not wanting to re-stimulate Bobby's 
               imagination, but it's too late.

                                     BOBBY
                         Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a 
                         diamond smuggler?

                                     HELEN
                              (firmly)
                         Come on, darling -- we're going up 
                         to bed.

                                     TOM
                         I wonder if we ought to--

                                     HELEN
                              (cutting him off with 
                              a look)
                         Bobby and I have had enough excitement 
                         for tonight.

                                     TOM
                              (seriously concerned)
                         You think it's all right for you to 
                         stay here?

                                     HELEN
                              (nods reassuringly)
                         I've got a good lock on my door.
                              (smiling at Bobby)
                         And Bobby's going to sleep in my 
                         room tonight.

                                     BOBBY
                         Oh, boy -- can I, Mom?

                                     HELEN
                         Yes, dear. Come on now.
                              (she happens to look 
                              down at his feet. 
                              Puzzled, and 
                              concerned, she feels 
                              his shoes)
                         Bobby, your shoes are soaking!

                                     BOBBY
                              (reluctantly, with 
                              childish guilt)
                         Yeah -- the grass was kind of wet.

               As the impact of this sinks in, Helen and Tom turn to stare 
               at each other in questioning consternation.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               INT. OFFICE - DEPT. OF COMMERCE BLDG. - MED. CLOSE SHOT DAY

               It is a typical government office, with lots of desks in it. 
               Helen is at her desk, straightening it up to go to lunch. 
               This done, she moves briskly to get her coat. CAMERA PANS to 
               follow her and suddenly, startlingly reveals Klaatu standing 
               near the clothes rack, as though he had materialized out of 
               thin air. Helen is thoroughly startled.

                                     HELEN
                              (unnerved)
                         Oh -- hello--

                                     KLAATU
                         May I see you for a minute?

                                     HELEN
                         I -- I was Just going to lunch.

                                     KLAATU
                              (quietly insistent)
                         May I walk out with you?

               She is nervous and uneasy but obviously can't refuse. The 
               telephone on her desk rings and Helen turns to answer it.

                                     HELEN
                              (into phone)
                         Mrs. Benson speaking.
                              (recognizing the voice, 
                              she glances nervously 
                              at Klaatu)
                         Oh, hello...

               INT. JEWELRY SHOP - MED. CLOSE SHOT

               It's a rather swank shop. Tom is standing at the counter 
               phoning. The Jeweler is behind the counter examining a stone 
               through his eyepiece.

                                     TOM
                              (into phone, cheerily)
                         I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal 
                         on that diamond. I thought we might 
                         have lunch together.

               INT. OFFICE - DEPT. OF COMMERCE - MED. CLOSE SHOT

                                     HELEN
                              (with a nervous glance 
                              at Klaatu)
                         I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right 
                         now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, 
                         that'll be fine. 'Bye.

               She hangs up and smiles uneasily as she rejoins Klaatu and 
               leads the way out into the corridor.

               INT. CORRIDOR - TWO SHOT

               CAMERA MOVES with Helen and Klaatu as they go down the 
               corridor. Klaatu's mood is one of quiet tension.

                                     KLAATU
                              (watching Helen's 
                              reaction)
                         I saw Bobby this morning before he 
                         went to school--

                                     HELEN
                              (glancing at him 
                              apprehensively)
                         Yes--?

                                     KLAATU
                         I want to know what he told you last 
                         night.

                                     HELEN
                              (nervous and evasive)
                         I -- I didn't really pay much 
                         attention--
                              (with a nervous little 
                              laugh)
                         Bobby has such an active imagination.

                                     KLAATU
                              (refusing to be put 
                              off)
                         Did you believe what he told you?
                              (Helen hesitates, 
                              trapped by uncertainty)
                         I have a reason for asking this -- a 
                         very important reason.

               MED. SHOT

               They are approaching the elevator at the end of the corridor. 
               There is a large crowd of lunch-goers milling around the 
               elevator, which is quickly filled. Half the crowd is left as 
               the elevator doors close and it descends.

               TWO SHOT - HELEN AND KLAATU

               Nervous and distracted, Helen doesn't want to get caught up 
               in this jam.

                                     HELEN
                         There's another elevator we can use--

               She nods toward a side corridor and starts for it, Klaatu 
               following.

               MED. SHOT

               CAMERA FOLLOWS them as they turn into the side corridor. 
               Helen leads the way to a small, automatic elevator. She 
               presses the button and the doors open. Klaatu follows her 
               in.

               INT. ELEVATOR

               As Helen presses the first floor button, the doors close and 
               the elevator starts down. She turns to face Klaatu.

                                     HELEN
                              (her nerves raw and 
                              edgy)
                         What is it you want?

                                     KLAATU
                         Before I ask you to be honest with 
                         me, perhaps I should be completely 
                         honest with you--

               Without warning the elevator comes to a jolting, jarring 
               stop as the power is cut off and the lights go out. The car 
               is illuminated faintly and eerily by light that seeps through 
               the ventilating grills from a skylight in the shaft. Helen 
               is terrified.

                                     HELEN
                              (gasping with fright)
                         What happened?

                                     KLAATU
                              (a moment's hesitation; 
                              then he remembers)
                         What time is it?

               Helen fumbles to get her wrist watch into a faint beam of 
               light.

                                     HELEN
                         Just twelve.

                                     KLAATU
                         We'll be stuck here for a little 
                         while -- about thirty minutes.

                                     HELEN
                              (preoccupied with her 
                              own thinking)
                         We could try pushing the other 
                         buttons.
                              (digging in her purse)
                         I have a flashlight in my purse.

                                     KLAATU
                         It won't work.

               Helen has the flashlight out and is snapping it on, but it 
               doesn't work. She looks up at him blankly.

                                     HELEN
                         Why not?

                                     KLAATU
                              (after a moment, 
                              quietly)
                         You see -- the electricity's been 
                         neutralized -- all over the world.

               The impact of this calm, quiet statement is shattering. Helen 
               stares at him awe-struck. Then she speaks numbly, almost 
               inaudibly.

                                     HELEN
                         Bobby was telling the truth -- wasn't 
                         he?

               Klaatu stares at her evenly, as we--

               MED. SHOT - STREET

               All vehicular traffic in the street is at a dead stop. 
               Automobiles, busses, trolley cars -- all are stalled. Drivers 
               and passengers are climbing out of the vehicles in utter 
               bewilderment. Except for the people, it is as though the 
               street had been frozen in motion.

               INT. CITY POWER PLANT

               The great generators and dynamos are silent and motionless 
               in the dim, unlighted plant.

               INT. FACTORY

               A huge automobile or airplane assembly line, with nothing 
               moving, no machinery going.

               INT. PRESSROOM - METROPOLITAN NEWSPAPER

               The giant presses are threaded with newsprint, but they are 
               silent and motionless.

               INT. CONTROL ROOM - RADIO STATION

               A couple of engineers are working feverishly over a huge and 
               complicated control panel. They are working by the light of 
               two incongruous and ineffectual candles.

               INT. NEW YORK SUBWAY KIOSK

               People carne pouring up the stairs wildly, feverishly anxious 
               to escape the darkness below. Their eyes blink weakly in the 
               unaccustomed sunlight.

               EXT. SHOT - NEW YORK STREET

               Cars, taxis and busses are stalled, their frenzied drivers 
               unable to figure out what's happened. A junk peddler with a 
               broken-down horse and wagon moves grandly and leisurely 
               through the stalled vehicles. The peddler bears a happy grin 
               of superiority. This is his moment of triumph over modern 
               civilization.

               of two cab drivers whose taxis have stalled beside each other 
               in traffic. One has gotten out of his cab. The other is seated 
               at his wheel, looking around in awe and terror, his tough 
               Manhattan heart shaken.

                                     CAB DRIVER
                         My ol' lady was right. We shoulda 
                         got a place in the country.

               standing on the sidewalk, awe-struck at the weird sight before 
               them. One of them speaks in terror, hardly daring to 
               articulate his thoughts.

                                     COCKNEY
                         It's that space man -- that's wot it

               They are an elderly couple. Staring bug-eyed at the strange

               in Russian.

               She is middle-aged and there are tears of fright in her eyes. 
               She is mumbling a prayer in French.

               INT. BARNHARDT'S STUDY - DAY

               Barnhardt is seated comfortably at his desk with a book on 
               his lap. He has been interrupted by the entrance of Hilda, 
               his secretary. At the moment she`s beside herself with 
               excitement. Barnhardt watches her with a half-smile of secret 
               amusement. He has already deduced the cause of what's 
               happening.

                                     HILDA
                         You should see it, Professor 
                         Barnhardt! You should go out and see 
                         it for yourself!

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here.

                                     HILDA
                         The whole city has stopped. People 
                         are running around like ants!

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (musing admiringly on 
                              Klaatu's cleverness)
                         What a brilliant idea. I never would 
                         have thought of it.

               Hilda flings him a questioning look, annoyed that he won't 
               share her excitement.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         What about the people who are coming 
                         to the meeting tonight? Have they 
                         all arrived?

                                     HILDA
                              (nodding)
                         I talked to most of them this 
                         morning... They were all very curious 
                         about the meeting.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Good. Did you speak to our friend 
                         Mr. Carpenter?

                                     HILDA
                              (nodding)

                         Tell me, Hilda -- does all this 
                         frighten you -- does it make you 
                         feel insecure?

                                     HILDA
                         Yes, sir -- it certainly does!

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (nodding with a bland 
                              little smile)
                         That's good, Hilda. I'm glad.

               The poor woman flings him a look of shocked amazement as we--

               INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - PENTAGON BLDG. - DAY

               Seated at a conference table are high-ranking officers of 
               the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps. There is the 
               uneasy tension of people dealing with unknown forces. An 
               Army Major General, who's Chairman of the meeting, is 
               speaking.

                                     GENERAL
                         --as far as we can tell, all power's 
                         been cut off everywhere -- with a 
                         few exceptions: hospitals, planes in 
                         flight -- that sort of thing. I wish 
                         I could be more specific but, as you 
                         now, all communications are out 
                         telephone, radio, cable -- everything.
                              (gravely)
                         I can tell you that the President is 
                         prepared to declare a state of 
                         national emergency.
                              (pausing to let this 
                              sink in)
                         Before we start discussing plans, I 
                         want a report from Colonel Ryder. 
                         What about the robot, Colonel?

               Ryder is a Colonel of engineers, a man about forty-five.

                                     COLONEL RYDER
                         When it was discovered last night 
                         that the robot had moved, I was 
                         directed by the Joint Chiefs to find 
                         a means of immobilizing him. We 
                         accomplished that this morning by 
                         encasing him in a block of KL 93.
                              (he hands a small 
                              block of plastic to 
                              the General)
                         It's a new plastic material -- 
                         stronger than steel.

                                     GENERAL
                         Is it possible that he's broken out 
                         of this stuff?

                                     COLONEL
                         No, sir. I've Just checked on that. 
                         He's locked up tight as a drum.

                                     GENERAL
                         All right -- that means we concentrate 
                         on the man.
                              (to the group with 
                              force and authority)
                         Up till now we've agreed on the 
                         desirability of capturing this man 
                         alive. We can no longer afford to be 
                         so particular. We'll get him alive, 
                         if possible -- but we must get him!
                              (eyes the group sternly)
                         Is that clear?

               INT. JEWELRY SHOP - MED. CLOSE SHOT - TOM AND JEWELER

               The shop and its glittering display cases, which were 
               brilliantly lighted in the previous scene, are now gloomy 
               and dim. All artificial light is off. The Jeweler is a bright-
               eyed old man of seventy with a middle European accent. He is 
               completely fascinated as he examines the diamond Tom has 
               given him, and is annoyed by the lack of light. He speaks 
               impatiently to one of the girls in the shop who happens to 
               pass by.

                                     JEWELER
                         Eleanor, did you call the electrician?

                                     GIRL
                              (she's not too bright)
                         I tried, Mr. Bleeker. But the phone 
                         doesn't work, either.

                                     JEWELER
                              (absently, as he 
                              studies the stone)
                         Well, call the phone company.

                                     GIRL
                              (plaintively)
                         But the phone doesn't work.

               The Jeweler gives her a preoccupied glance of annoyance and 
               turns back to the stone.

                                     TOM
                         Is it worth anything?

                                     JEWELER
                         I have never seen such a stone. Will 
                         you please tell me where it came 
                         from?

                                     TOM
                         That's what I wanted you to tell me.

                                     JEWELER
                              (overwhelmed and 
                              absorbed by the stone, 
                              he shakes his head, 
                              bewildered)
                         There are no diamonds like this -- 
                         any place in the world.

               Impressed by the import of what the man is saying, Tom's 
               mind is racing wildly.

                                     TOM
                         You sure about that?

                                     JEWELER
                              (eagerly, shrewdly)
                         Would you like to sell it?

                                     TOM
                              (picking up the stone)
                         No -- no, thanks.

                                     JEWELER
                         I'd give you a very good price.

               Preoccupied with his own excited thoughts, Tom has already 
               started for the door.

               INT. ELEVATOR - TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND HELEN

               In the dim light of the stalled elevator, Klaatu is finishing 
               explaining to Helen the story of his mission. Overwhelmed by 
               the staggering import of what he has told her, Helen is 
               listening with great interest and concern.

                                     KLAATU
                              (speaking gravely)
                         --I've already told you more than I 
                         told Professor Barnhardt, because my 
                         life, in a sense, is in your hands. 
                         I thought if you knew the facts you'd 
                         appreciate the importance of my not 
                         being -- apprehended, -- before the 
                         meeting tonight.

               Helen is staring at him in awe, but also in complete 
               admiration and sympathy.

                                     HELEN
                         Yes, of course. Of course I do.

               Klaatu smiles at her warmly and she manages to return the 
               smile. Their relationship is further cemented by the sharing 
               of this vital secret.

                                     HELEN
                              (studying his face 
                              anxiously)
                         You hold great hope for this meeting.

                                     KLAATU
                         I can see no other hope for your 
                         planet. If the meeting should fail, 
                         then I'm afraid there is no hope.

               Suddenly and without warning, the elevator starts moving and 
               the lights go on. Startled, Helen looks at him.

                                     KLAATU
                              (calmly)
                         It must be twelve-thirty.

                                     HELEN
                              (looks at her watch, 
                              then back at him, 
                              awe-struck)
                         Yes -- Just exactly.

               STREET - MED. SHOT - DAY

               Showing a section of street traffic as it comes back to life. 
               From everywhere comes the sound of self-starters. Trolley 
               bells start clanging. Then automobile horns. People climb 
               back into there vehicles and traffic starts to move.

               SERIES OF CUTS

               of other streets, as the strident sounds of traffic build up 
               and normalcy is regained.

               INT. LOBBY - DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE BLDG - MED. SHOT - DAY

               as Helen and Klaatu come out of the elevator and start across 
               the lobby, CAMERA HOLDING ON THEM. Helen is preoccupied with 
               concern for Klaatu's safety.

                                     HELEN
                         Where are you going now?

                                     KLAATU
                         Back to the boardinghouse. I'll be 
                         safe there for the afternoon -- and 
                         I can keep an eye on Bobby. He's the 
                         only other person who knows anything 
                         about--

               This recalls to Helen something she had forgotten and she 
               stops in sudden concern.

                                     HELEN
                         No, wait a minute -- there's someone 
                         else.

                                     KLAATU
                         Who?

                                     HELEN
                         Tom... He was there last night when 
                         Bobby told me what he saw.

               The look of concern on Klaatu's face heightens Helen's 
               overwhelming fear and uncertainty.

                                     HELEN
                              (worriedly)
                         Of course, he doesn't know anything 
                         definite. He'd talk to me first, 
                         anyway, before--
                              (interrupting herself 
                              in sudden decision)
                         We can't take that chance. I'll get 
                         in touch with him right away and 
                         make sure.

               Helen turns and starts determinedly for the lobby door, 
               followed by Klaatu, as we--

                              (into phone)
                         --But I've got to talk to him. It's 
                         terribly important. When is he coming 
                         back?

               Tom's secretary has not yet recovered from the shock of what 
               has happened to the world.

                                     SECRETARY
                         I don't know, Mrs. Benson. He left 
                         before noon -- before that awful 
                         electric business. I'm scared to 
                         death, Mrs. Benson. I -- No, he 
                         wouldn't tell me where he was gong. 
                         Said it was something personal.

                                     HELEN
                         Tell him I want to see him the minute 
                         he gets in... No, I'll call back.

               Helen hangs up, thoroughly worried and distraught now.

               at passenger loading gate. A group of passengers is held 
               back as soldiers close the gate to the runway, preventing 
               their boarding their plane. The passengers mill about in 
               consternation as a voice is heard over a p.a. system.

               INT. RAILROAD STATION - MED. SHOT AT TRAIN GATE - DAY

               M.P.'s are blocking the gates leading to trains and ticket 
               takers are busy explaining matters and remonstrating with 
               irate ticket holders.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. BUS DEPOT - MED. SHOT - DAY

               Passengers are being herded off a loaded bus that was 
               preparing to leave the depot.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. ROADBLOCK ON HIGHWAY - MED. SHOT

               The Army has thrown a roadblock across a main highway on the 
               outskirts of the city and is permitting no one to leave. 
               From the line of halted cars we see and the insistent honking 
               of horns we hear, we get the impression of hundreds of cars 
               stacked up.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. TOM'S OUTER OFFICE - FULL SHOT - DUSK

               It is 6:00 P.M. and growing dark outside, but the lights are 
               not on. The office is small and unpretentious, the business 
               habitat of a man who works in a big insurance agency. Tom's 
               secretary is on the phone, reflecting the world-wide terror 
               of the moment.

                                     SECRETARY
                              (into phone, nervous 
                              and jittery)
                         --Honest, Mary, I'm so scared I can't 
                         sit still. I'd like to run some place, 
                         but I don't know where to go--
                              (hearing the door 
                              open, she cuts off)
                         'Bye now.

               The corridor door opens and Tom enters with an air of urgency.

                                     TOM
                         Call the Pentagon and find out who's 
                         in charge of this space man business. 
                         Whoever it is I want to talk to him.

               The secretary has a reaction of surprise, but she manages to 
               stop Tom at his door. He has flipped on the lights in passing.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Mrs. Benson's been trying to get you 
                         all afternoon. She says it's 
                         important.

                                     TOM
                         Get this other call first.

               Tom disappears into his office, closing the door. The 
               secretary is getting out a telephone directory when the 
               corridor door opens and Helen enters, tense and nervous.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Oh, Mrs. Benson -- He just walked 
                         in.
                              (misery loves company)
                         Are you nervous, too?

                                     HELEN
                         Yes, I am, Margaret.

               The secretary buzzes the intercom and speaks into it.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Mrs. Benson is here.
                              (turning to Helen)
                         Go on in.

               Helen is starting for the door when it opens and Tom appears.

                                     HELEN
                         Tom -- I've been trying to get you 
                         all afternoon--

                                     TOM
                              (preoccupied with his 
                              own excitement)
                         Come on in.

               INT. TOM'S PRIVATE OFFICE - FULL SHOT

               as Tom follows Helen inside and closes the door. He turns to 
               her, his voice tense with excitement.

                                     TOM
                         I've got some terrific news about 
                         your friend, Mr. Carpenter.

                                     HELEN
                              (trying to appear 
                              calm)
                         What about him?

                                     TOM
                         Helen, he's the man from the space 
                         ship!
                              (she eyes him evenly, 
                              apprehensively, as 
                              he hurries on)
                         I had that diamond checked at three 
                         different places. Nobody on earth's 
                         ever seen a stone like that! After 
                         what Bobby told us, that's enough 
                         for me. Why is it nobody knows 
                         anything about him? Why hasn't he 
                         got any money?

                                     HELEN
                              (evenly, with quiet 
                              tension)
                         All right, Tom -- it's true. I know 
                         it's true.

                                     TOM
                         How do you know?

                                     HELEN
                         Never mind about that.
                              (urgently, with great 
                              concern)
                         You've got to promise me you won't 
                         say a word to anybody.

                                     TOM
                         Are you crazy? After what happened 
                         today?

                                     HELEN
                         You don't understand. You don't 
                         realize how important it is.

                                     TOM
                              (impatiently)
                         Important? Of course it's important. 
                         The point is we can do something 
                         about it.

                                     HELEN
                         That's what I'm trying to tell you. 
                         We mustn't do anything about it. 
                         Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm 
                         talking about.

                                     TOM
                              (irritated by her 
                              opposition)
                         He's a menace to the whole world! 
                         It's our duty to turn him in.

                                     HELEN
                              (desperately)
                         But he isn't a menace! He told me 
                         what he came here for.

                                     TOM
                              (dismissing this with 
                              annoyed contempt)
                         He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- 
                         just because you like the guy.
                              (busy with his own 
                              thoughts)
                         You realize what this'd mean for us? 
                         I'd be the biggest man in the country. 
                         I could write my own ticket.

                                     HELEN
                              (eyeing him coldly)
                         Is that what you're thinking about?

                                     TOM
                              (guiltily, defensive)
                         Why not? Somebody's got to get rid 
                         of him.

               They are interrupted by the sharp sound of the interoffice 
               buzzer.

                                     HELEN
                         I'm not going to let you do it, Tom.
                              (with deep personal 
                              urgency)
                         Believe me, this is literally the 
                         most important thing in the world.

               Tom picks up the phone and answers it.

                                     TOM
                              (into phone)
                         Yes?... What's his name, Margaret? 
                         General Cutler?
                              (disappointed that 
                              the connection isn't 
                              completed)
                         All right, I'll hold on.

               Realizing what he's doing, Helen crosses to him, pleading 
               wildly, desperately.

                                     HELEN
                         Tom, you mustn't -- ! You don't know 
                         what you're doing! It isn't just you 
                         and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the 
                         world, is involved!

                                     TOM
                              (exasperated)
                         I don't care about the rest of the 
                         world!

               It is as though he had slapped her across the face. Suddenly 
               he has revealed himself, naked and distasteful. Feeling guilty 
               as he sees the contempt and revulsion in her eyes, he tries 
               the old charm, holding his hand over the phone.

                                     TOM
                         You'll feel different when you see 
                         my picture in the papers.

                                     HELEN
                              (staring at him starkly)
                         I feel different right now.

                                     TOM
                              (uneasily)
                         You wait and see. You're going to 
                         marry a big hero!

                                     HELEN
                         I'm not going to marry anybody.

               She turns and runs quickly out of the room. Tom's inclination 
               is to follow her, when his connection is completed.

                                     TOM
                              (into phone)
                         Hello, General Cutler?
                              (irritated)
                         No, I don't want to speak to his 
                         aide. I want to speak to the General. 
                         Tell him it's about the space man... 
                         My name is Tom Stevens. S-t-e-v-e-n-
                         s.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - MED. SHOT - DUSK

               Helen hurries out of the building, hails a cab, gets into it 
               and the cab drives off.

               INT. TOM'S OFFICE - CLOSE SHOT - TOM

               Tom now has General Cutler on the phone.

                                     TOM
                              (into phone)
                         That's right, General. That's where 
                         he's staying... Yes, of course I'm 
                         sure.

               INT. GENERAL CUTLER'S OFFICE - PENTAGON BLDG.

               The General is on the phone and is making notes. There are a 
               couple of officers standing near his desk, a Colonel and a 
               Lieutenant Colonel.

                                     GENERAL CUTLER
                              (after listening for 
                              a moment)
                         Thank you very much, Mr. Stevens. 
                         I'll want to talk to you further but 
                         I haven't time now.
                              (hangs up and turns 
                              to Colonel)
                         Deploy all Zone 5 units according to 
                         Plan B -- immediately.

               The Colonel nods and starts out of the room, as we--

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. TAXI - MED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN - NIGHT

               The cab is traveling through city traffic. Nervous and edgy, 
               Helen glances at her watch impatiently.

               A jeep filled with armed soldiers is moving down the street 
               at a fast clip. Behind the jeep is an Army staff car.

               MED. CLOSE- SHOT - STAFF CAR

               shooting from outside into the car. In the front seat beside 
               the driver is a full Colonel, wearing helmet and side-arms. 
               The car is moving swiftly through traffic as the Colonel 
               speaks into the transmitter of a radio.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - COMMAND AND RECONNAISSANCE CAR

               It is filled with soldiers wearing helmets and carrying rifles 
               and Tommy guns. It is traveling quite fast. A soldier with a 
               handy-talkie transmits an order to the driver.

               MED. LONG SHOT - STREET

               The C. and R. car is seen to be at the head of a convoy of 
               eight Army vehicles which are moving swiftly down the street. 
               The trucks are filled with armed soldiers.

               MED. LONG SHOT - ANOTHER STREET

               On this street also an armed convoy is racing by, headed by 
               a Jeep mounting a .30 caliber machine gun.

               MED. LONG SHOT - ANOTHER STREET

               On this street also a convoy rolls by.

               EXT. STREET CORNER - MED. SHOT

               Helen's cab rounds the corner into the boardinghouse street. 
               CAMERA PANS with cab as it draws up in front of the 
               boardinghouse. The cab waits as Helen jumps out and runs up 
               the steps to the front door. A couple of children are playing 
               jump-rope in the light of a street lamp.

               EXT. MOVING - STAFF CAR - MED. CLOSE SHOT

               shooting in at the Colonel as he issues an order into the 
               radio.

               MED. SHOT - ARMY CONVOY

               CAMERA FOLLOWS the rear of the convoy as it races down a 
               main thoroughfare. As the convoy reaches each intersection, 
               the last vehicle peels off the column and, turns into the 
               side street.

               MED. SHOT ANOTHER CONVOY

               racing down another street, the rear vehicles peeling off at 
               the intersections as in previous scene.

               MED. SHOT - INTERSECTION

               Following one of the vehicles after it has peeled off into a 
               side street. It turns around in the side street and draws up 
               facing the intersection, its motor still running. We get the 
               impression of a methodical plan to block off each street.)

               EXT. BOARDINGHOUSE - MED. SHOT

               as Klaatu and Helen come hurrying down the steps and pile 
               into the waiting taxi. The kids playing Jump-rope stop and 
               watch as the door is closed and the cab pulls out, 
               disappearing as it makes a right turn at the end of the 
               street.

               EXT. STREET CORNER NEAR BOARDINGHOUSE - MED. SHOT

               (This is opposite end of street from last shot.) Barreling 
               across the intersection into the boardinghouse street is the 
               jeep followed by the Colonel's staff car.

               EXT. BOARDINGHOUSE STREET - MED. SHOT

               As the Jeep and staff car pull up in front of the boarding 
               house, the soldiers in the jeep pile out and cover the 
               entrance to the house. Meanwhile the Colonel, still in the 
               staff car, is talking to the two kids playing out front. 
               They chatter excitedly, pointing in the direction taken by 
               the cab.

               INT. STAFF CAB - CLOSE SHOT - COLONEL

               He speaks into his radio in tones of clipped and quiet 
               efficiency. The car remains standing at the curb.

                                     COLONEL
                              (into radio)

                         license number and report.

               INT. TAXI - FULL SHOT

               The cab 's moving through traffic at a normal speed. Klaatu 
               and Helen are tense and nervous.

               INT. TAXI - FULL SHOT

               The cab's moving through traffic at a normal speed. Klaatu 
               and Helen are tense and nervous.

                                     KLAATU
                         I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to 
                         hide me until the meeting.

                                     HELEN
                         Where is the meeting going to be?

                                     KLAATU
                         At the ship.

               CLOSE SHOT - CAB DRIVER

               as he looks out to his left, approaching an intersection.

               From driver's viewpoint. A C. and R. car is parked in the 
               side street, facing the intersection, its occupants armed 
               and helmeted.

               CLOSE SHOT - CAB DRIVER

               Abreast of the intersection now, he looks to his right.

               EXT. STREET INTERSECTION - MED. SHOT

               shooting over the rear of a jeep which is halted in a side 
               street facing the intersection. The cab crosses the 
               intersection and the jeep driver squints to catch its number. 
               Then he picks up his radio and speaks into the transmitter.

               INT. STAFF CAR - CLOSE SHOT - COLONEL

               (The car is still in front of the boardinghouse.) The Colonel 
               listens to his radio for a moment, then speaks into his 
               transmitter.

                                     COLONEL
                              (into radio)

                         of target vehicle is W 4936... All 
                         vehicles maintain your positions -- 
                         and hold your fire.

               INT. TAXI - MED. CLOSE SHOT

               shooting at the driver, over the shoulders of Klaatu and 
               Helen, as he turns and points out the Army vehicles to them 
               with a shrug of bewilderment. They look ahead at the 
               intersection they are approaching.

               CLOSE SHOT - HELEN

               looking ahead out of her side of the cab, at the intersection.

               MED. SHOT - INTERSECTION

               from Helen's viewpoint. There is an Army vehicle waiting in 
               the side street.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               as he looks out of his side of the cab.

               MED. SHOT - INTERSECTION

               In this side street, too, an Army vehicle is standing.

               TWO SHOT - HELEN AND KLAATU

               Their eyes meet for a moment, neither willing to conjecture 
               what this might mean. The very quietness of the operation is 
               ominous and menacing. Their faces show grave concern.

               INT. STAFF CAR - CLOSE SHOT - COLONEL

                                     COLONEL
                              (into radio)
                         Attention, Zone 5 -- report when 
                         target vehicle passes your position.

               EXT. TAXI MED. CLOSE SHOT

               shooting through the window at Helen and Klaatu, who are 
               growing more tense and nervous.

               MED. SHOT - INTERSECTION

               shooting over the back of a jeep mounting a machine gun as 
               the cab passes the intersection. The driver picks up his 
               radio and reports into it.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - WEAPONS CARRIER

               shooting through the windshield as the driver reports by 
               radio, his eyes shifting to follow the moving cab.

               INT. TAXI - TWO SHOT - HELEN AND KLAATU

               Helen is biting her lips nervously. She steals a sidelong 
               glance at Klaatu to find him staring ahead, deeply preoccupied 
               and concerned.

                                     HELEN
                              (trying to give him 
                              encouragement)
                         It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's.

                                     KLAATU
                         I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid 
                         of what he might do -- if anything 
                         should happen to me.

                                     HELEN
                         Gort?
                              (puzzled)
                         But he's a robot. I mean -- without 
                         you, what could he do?

                                     KLAATU
                              (slowly)
                         There's no limit to what he could 
                         do. He could destroy the Earth.
                              (with great urgency)
                         If anything should happen to me, you 
                         must go to Gort. You must give him 
                         this message: "Klaatu barada nikto." 
                         Please repeat that.

                                     HELEN
                              (shocked and 
                              bewildered, she 
                              repeats nervously)
                         "Klaatu barada nikto."

                                     KLAATU
                              (gravely)
                         Remember those words.

               Helen nods, repeating the words soundlessly.

               SERIES OF CUTS

               of vehicle drivers reporting by radio as their eyes follow 
               the progress of the taxi. (These should be shot so we don't 
               hear what is said.)

               CLOSE SHOT - COLONEL IN STAFF CAR

               listening to these reports. Then he speaks into his 
               transmitter with quiet tension.

                                     COLONEL
                              (into radio)
                         Attention, Zone 5... Section number 
                         2 -- block off Tenth Street at 
                         Massachusetts. All vehicles close 
                         in.

               The Colonel motions to his driver and the staff car pulls 
               out.

               EXT. STREET - MED. SHOT

               as a convoy of eight vehicles moves down the street going 
               very fast and swings around a corner.

               SERIES OF CUTS

               of individual vehicles that have been waiting at 
               intersections, as they pull out and down the main streets to 
               converge on the taxi.

               MED. SHOT

               at a major intersection, as the convoy of eight vehicles 
               previously seen dashes through the intersection and stops. 
               The cars quickly arrange themselves so that they form a 
               roadblock, completely sealing off the street.

               INT. TAXI

               shooting over the driver's shoulder. The cab is proceeding 
               down the street. When the road block comes into range of its 
               headlights. The driver, who has been getting uneasy, turns 
               to face his fares accusingly.

                                     DRIVER
                         Hey, what's this all about?

               As he slows his cab down, Helen leans forward into scene. 
               Frenzied, she is about to urge the driver on when Klaatu 
               puts a restraining hand on her shoulder.

               EXT. STREET - MED. SHOT

               shooting down the street from the barricade, as the taxi 
               stops. Army cars are closing in behind the taxi, so it is 
               trapped. The cab door ovens and Klaatu steps out, making a 
               run for the entrance to a pedestrian underpass.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - JEEP

               It is one of the lead vehicles in the group coming up behind 
               the taxi. It mounts a .30 caliber machine gun and, with the 
               Jeep still moving, the gunner fires a burst at Klaatu.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - RIFLEMAN

               He's on one of the vehicles that form the barricade. He takes 
               a bead on the running figure of Klaatu and fires.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               He has almost reached the underpass. His hand is on the 
               railing when he slumps to the ground, badly hit. In a moment, 
               Helen rushes into scene, dropping down to hold Klaatu's head 
               in her arms. He looks up at her with a feeble smile. Then 
               his face takes on an expression of urgency.

                                     KLAATU
                              (weakly, insistently)
                         Get that message to Gort. Right away--

               Klaatu is unable to say any more. He is dead. Helen looks 
               around wildly, helplessly, with tears and terror in her eyes.

               MED. SHOT

               as the soldiers pile out of their vehicles and close in on 
               the place where Klaatu lies. He is their first and all-
               important concern, and Helen finds herself pushed out of the 
               way, toward the edge of the growing crowd of soldiers.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Shocked and, staggered by what's happened, she realizes she 
               must get to Gort. Taking advantage of the milling confusion 
               in the dark, she edges toward the pedestrian underpass until 
               she can slip into its entrance without being noticed. And 
               she disappears.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BUILDING ENCLOSING SPACE SHIP - MED. SHOT - GORT - 
               NIGHT

               In the eerie light of the huge building, the great robot 
               stands encased in a solid block of clear, transparent plastic. 
               As CAMERA MOVES IN slowly, we hear a low whirring sound, as 
               of power being generated. A faint glow, visible through the 
               plastic, emanates from Gort's body. His eyes, which seem to 
               express rage, shifts as though he were straining to break 
               out. As the whirring sound and the glow of Gort's body 
               increase in intensity, the sharp edges at the top of the ice-
               like block melt into roundness and the plastic starts to 
               drip away. (About 150 folding chairs are arranged on the 
               floor near the space ship for the meeting tonight.)

               EXT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - TWO SOLDIERS

               The whirring sound can be heard faintly from inside. The two 
               soldiers standing guard at the door hear the sound and listen 
               apprehensively. The two men exchange an uneasy glance. After 
               hesitating a moment, one of them decides to investigate. He 
               turns and goes inside the door.

               INT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE SOLDIER

               As he stops and looks up at the robot, his eyes go wide with 
               terror.

               CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               Gort is an awesome and terrifying sight. His head is free 
               now and he seems to be straining against the plastic, which 
               is dripping down the sides of the block.

               CLOSE SHOT - SOLDIER

               He glances around nervously to see that his companion has 
               entered the building and is staring up at the robot, bug-
               eyed. Slowly the second soldier moves up beside the first. 
               Wordlessly, they bring their rifles up to the ready and click 
               them off safety. In spite of their terror, they advance slowly 
               toward the robot.

               CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               The whirring sound is ominous and his body glows brightly. 
               And his eyes are fixed on the two advancing figures.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - TWO SOLDIERS

               as they move toward Gort.

               CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               From inside him comes a new and terribly sharp crackling. 
               sound. And from his eyes two pencils of light dart out. After 
               a moment the crackling sound stops and the light goes off.

               REVERSE SHOT

               from same angle as scene before last. But the two soldiers 
               have utterly disappeared.

               FULL SHOT

               as Gort resumes breaking out of the plastic. There is no 
               sign of the two soldiers.

               EXT. MALL - MED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN - NIGHT

               Hurrying along a footpath, nervous and distraught, she pauses 
               for a moment, looking at the entrance of the building. Then 
               she starts determinedly across the grass toward the entrance.

               MED. SHOT

               PANNING with Helen as she approaches the entrance fearfully. 
               Rallying all her courage and determination, she forces herself 
               to step inside.

               INT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN

               as she enters the huge, weirdly lighted building. She stops 
               short as her glance falls on the awesome figure of Gort. 
               Loneliness and terror grip her and she wants to run -- but 
               she realizes she can't.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT -GORT

               He has seen Helen and his flashing eyes bore into her. His 
               upper body and arms are free now, and the plastic is rapidly 
               melting away.

               CLOSE SHOT - HELEN

               She is held fascinated by the robot's staring eyes. For 
               another moment it looks as if she would, break and run. But 
               she summons all her courage, and moves slowly toward Gort, 
               whose legs are still held captive.

               MED. SHOT - HELEN AND GORT

               as she moves slowly, fearfully toward him.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               The plastic is dripping off his legs now. With great effort, 
               he pulls his legs free and steps out of the stuff. A huge 
               figure in the heavy shadows, he moves slowly and menacingly 
               toward Helen.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN

               as she stops advancing, rooted to the spot in fear. Then she 
               starts backing away, keeping her eyes on him.

               MED. SHOT - HELEN AND GORT

               As the great, hulking figure approaches, Helen can't stand 
               her ground. She turns and runs wildly toward the far end of 
               the building. Gort follows her with unhurried, inescapable 
               strides. Unwittingly, Helen has run into a corner, and the 
               robot is closing in on her.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN

               Her eyes go wide with terror as she realizes she's trapped. 
               In a wild effort to run around him, she stumbles and falls 
               to the floor. Immobilized with fright, she lies breathless, 
               looking up at him. Then she gives a piercing scream.

               TWO SHOT - HELEN AND GORT

               as the great robot bends over her menacingly, arms 
               outstretched as though to grab or smash her.

               CLOSE SHOT - HELEN

               All hope gone, she is blessed with a moment of lucidity, and 
               she remembers the message Klaatu told her to deliver.

                                     HELEN
                         Gort--!
                              (with desperate clarity)
                         Klaatu -- barada -- nikto.

               CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               He pauses as he hears the words. His face doesn't change 
               expression, but the words obviously have an effect on him. 
               He hesitates thoughtfully for a moment.

               TWO SHOT - HELEN AND GORT

               Helen watches him in an agony of suspense. Then the robot 
               slowly bends down, picks her up in his arms and starts walking 
               toward the space ship.

               MED. SHOT

               PANNING with Gort as he carries Helen, speechless with fright, 
               to the side of the ship. He touches the side, and the ramp 
               moves slightly out. He mounts the ramp, still carrying Helen, 
               and disappears into the ship with her. And the ramp closes 
               silently behind them.

               INT. SMALL CORRIDOR - SPACE SHIP

               CAMERA FOLLOWS as Gort carries Helen through the dimly lighted 
               corridor into the main cabin, where he flips a switch that 
               lights up the cabin. The robot proceeds to a small door 
               leading off the main cabin and disappears with Helen inside 
               it.

               INT. SMALL CABIN - FULL SHOT

               This is revealed as a weirdly equipped laboratory, the walls 
               of which are lined with the most complex array of mechanical 
               and electronic apparatus. Gort sets Helen down on a stool 
               and indicates for her to stay there. Too terrified to move, 
               Helen watches as he busies himself with the apparatus. He 
               starts flipping switches and turning dials. As a result, 
               lights begin to flash and there's a strange series of 
               mechanical noises.

               CLOSE SHOT - HELEN

               Unable to guess the reason for these preparations, she is 
               gripped with a terrible fear.

               FULL SHOT

               Ignoring Helen completely, Gort finishes his work. Then he 
               moves to the door and goes out, closing the door behind him. 
               Helen rushes to the door and searches frantically for the 
               knob -- only to find, to her terror, that there is none. 
               Frenziedly she beats on the solid metal door.

               EXT. SPACE SHIP - MED. SHOT

               as the ramp comes down and Gort steps out. With grim, 
               determined strides he starts toward the entrance of the 
               building as the ramp silently closes.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. POLICE PRECINCT STATION - NIGHT

               The Colonel who was in charge of Klaatu's apprehension is 
               speaking into a phone at the desk of the Police Sergeant. 
               Standing by are three or four Army officers, among them a 
               Captain and a Lieutenant.

                                     COLONEL
                              (into phone)
                         Yes, sir, we've got the body here 
                         now. Downstairs in a cell... No 
                         question about it, General -- he's 
                         dead all right... Yes, sir. Yes -- I 
                         understand.

               The General has apparently hung up and the Colonel does 
               likewise, turning to the officers in the room.

                                     COLONEL
                         General Cutler's coming down here 
                         right away.
                              (to the Lieutenant)
                         Take a squad of men, Lieutenant, and 
                         post a guard around that cell.
                              (to Captain)
                         Captain, don't let anyone in or out 
                         of the building.

               The two officers mutter their "yes, sirs" and start off about 
               their business.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. JAIL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               A squad of armed soldiers, led by the lieutenant, is admitted 
               to the corridor by a Police guard and they start marching 
               down the corridor toward a cell at the far end.

               INT. CELL - POLICE STATION

               This is a cell on the ground floor. In the far wall is a 
               heavily barred window, beyond which is as alley. In f.g. are 
               Klaatu's feet, stretched out on a crude table. As CAMERA 
               HOLDS, the huge figure of Gort appears outside the barred 
               window, Seeing Klaatu, he reaches up and yanks out the steel 
               bars as though they were chicken wire. With a crushing blow 
               of his knee he crumbles the brick and mortar below the window 
               and steps inside the cell. He moves without interruption 
               toward the body of Klaatu.

               INT. JAIL CORRIDOR

               Hearing the sounds of clattering metal and mortar, the 
               soldiers race down the corridor toward the cell.

               MED. SHOT

               shooting over the backs of the soldiers as they reach the 
               cell and look inside. There they see the giant robot picking 
               up the body of Klaatu and starting deliberately toward the 
               gaping hole in the side of the building. They raise their 
               weapons and fire at Gort, but the bullets have no effect on 
               him. Continuing uninterruptedly, he steps over the debris 
               and disappears, carrying Klaatu in his arms.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. SPACE SHIP BUILDING - MED. SHOT

               as Gort enters the empty building, still carrying the body 
               of Klaatu. CAMERA PANS with him as he strides over to the 
               ship. The ramp opens and Gort goes inside. Then the ramp 
               closes after him.

               INT. LABORATORY CABIN IN SPACE SHIP

               Alone in the cabin, Helen is still terrified. She looks up, 
               startled as the door opens and Gort enters, carrying Klaatu's 
               body over to a long counter. Once again he starts fiddling 
               with knobs, switches and dials. As Helen watches, speechless, 
               he starts to fasten strange-looking electrodes to Klaatu's 
               wrist and ankle.

               EXT. POLICE PRECINCT STATION - NIGHT

               shooting from the outside, near the front entrance to the 
               building, through a window into the main room where the Police 
               Sergeant's desk is. The Lieutenant who was ordered to guard 
               Klaatu's cell is excitedly reporting to the Colonel how Gort 
               broke in and took Klaatu's body. Considerably agitated, the 
               Colonel snaps orders to the other officers, glances at his 
               watch and motions for the Lieutenant to follow him. He and 
               the Lieutenant cross to the door and CAMERA PANS with them 
               as they come outside the building, hurry down the steps and 
               get into a staff car. Several other Army vehicles join the 
               staff car as it roars away from the curb.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. SPACE SHIP BUILDING - MED. SHOT - NIGHT

               A good many of the 150 chairs are filled, and more guests 
               are still arriving. There is no one to greet them at the 
               door, so they wander in and seat themselves.

               INT. LABORATORY IN SPACE SHIP

               Gort is still working over the body of Klaatu. From a socket 
               in the wall he pulls a strange-looking hypodermic needle on 
               the end of a cord or tube and gives Klaatu a shot in the 
               arm.

               CLOSE SHOT - HELEN

               as she watches, fascinated in spite of her terror.

               FULL SHOT

               Gort fiddles with the dials again and there are electrical 
               cracklings and sputterings. Suddenly he flips a switch and 
               all sound ceases. Gort removes the electrodes and watches 
               Klaatu. CAMERA MOVES IN on Klaatu and we see him start to 
               breathe. In a moment his eyelids flutter. Then his eyes open 
               and he looks around.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               as Klaatu slowly lifts himself to a sitting position. Helen 
               watches breathlessly as he glances around the room, as though 
               to orient himself. Then he lowers his feet to the floor and 
               stands up. He blinks uncertainly, then smiles at them.

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a grateful glance 
                              at Gort, he turns to 
                              Helen)
                         Hello.

                                     HELEN
                              (staring at him)
                         I -- I thought you were--

                                     KLAATU
                              (nodding, with a smile)
                         I was.

                                     HELEN
                              (looking at Gort in 
                              awe)
                         You mean he has the power of life 
                         and death?

                                     KLAATU
                         No -- that is a power reserved to 
                         the Almighty Spirit.

                                     KLAATU
                              (indicating the 
                              equipment Gort used)
                         This technique, in certain cases, 
                         can re-stimulate life for a limited 
                         period. It's a refinement of 
                         scientific principles known to your 
                         own people.

                                     HELEN
                              (concerned for him)
                         But how -- how long--?

                                     KLAATU
                         How long will I live?
                              (he shrugs)
                         That no one can say.

               Klaatu moves one of the sliding panels and reaches for a 
               suit of his "other world" clothing from behind the panel. 
               With a nod of apology, he steps behind the panel to change.

               EXT. BUILDING - MED. SHOT - NIGHT

               shooting from the door. In f.g. Barnhardt, who has just 
               arrived, is greeting several friends outside the door. In 
               b.g. a staff car and three or four other Army vehicles are 
               driving up.

               MED. SHOT - ARMY VEHICLES

               As the convoy pulls up to a halt in front of the building, 
               the Colonel hurries out of the staff car and moves over to 
               Barnhardt. Barnhardt is motioning his friends into the 
               building as the Colonel comes up to him.

               TWO SHOT - COLONEL AND BARNHARDT

               The Colonel speaks to Barnhardt with deference but with 
               unyielding authority.

                                     COLONEL
                         I'm sorry, Professor Barnhardt -- I 
                         have to ask you to call off this 
                         meeting.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Call it off? I... But I had permission 
                         from the Army--

                                     COLONEL
                         I know you did. But the robots on 
                         the loose now and it isn't safe around 
                         here. You'll have to get your friends 
                         out of that building.

               INT. SPACE SHIP - TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND HELEN

               as Klaatu steps out from behind the sliding panel where he 
               has changed into his "other world" tunic.

                                     KLAATU
                         Gort and I will be leaving soon.

               Helen is genuinely upset at the thought of his leaving and 
               the knowledge that he is to die. There is a compelling warmth 
               of feeling between these two.

                                     HELEN
                              (simply, sincerely)
                         We'll miss you very much -- Bobby 
                         and I.
                              (smiling to conceal 
                              her real feelings)
                         He won't have anyone to play with.

                                     KLAATU
                         He'll have you -- and Tom.

                                     HELEN
                              (quietly -- definitely)
                         No. That's all finished.

                                     KLAATU
                         I'm sorry.

                                     HELEN
                              (she is sensible and 
                              objective, but not 
                              unfeeling)
                         I think I'm very lucky. You don't 
                         always get a chance to recognize a 
                         mistake before you make it.

               Klaatu looks at her in warm, considered admiration. Then he 
               moves to one side of the cabin and flips a switch. Suddenly 
               an entire section of the side wall is made transparent. 
               Through it, as through a screen, we can see out into the 
               building. Most of the chairs are already occupied, and 
               latecomers are still moving in through the door. Facing the 
               group, on a little dais, is Barnhardt. As Klaatu and Helen 
               watch, Barnhardt raps for order and begins to speak. His 
               voice comes in the ship through a speaker.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Ladies and Gentlemen--

               INT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - BARNHARDT

               He addresses them gravely, with a note of terrible 
               disappointment in his voice.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         I called you from your work and from 
                         your homes all over the world because 
                         we were to meet here tonight with a 
                         man from another planet -- the man 
                         who came here in this ship.
                              (there are audible 
                              exclamations of 
                              surprise and 
                              disappointment)
                         As you all know, this is no longer 
                         possible. I can only say that I share 
                         the bitterness of your disappointment.

               INTERCUT with the above are group and individual shots of 
               the people in the meeting. They are the cream of Earth's 
               intellectuals -- scientists, churchmen, educators, leaders 
               of social and political thought. There are several women 
               among them. There are turbaned Indians, Chinese, Japanese, 
               several Negroes. All religions are represented. Every 
               important world power is represented.

               INT. MAIN CABIN - SPACE SHIP

               Klaatu and Helen are watching and listening, as the last 
               sentence of Barnhardt's speech above comes over the speaker. 
               Klaatu flips off the switch, which cuts off the view of the 
               meeting and also Barnhardt's voice. At this moment Gort moves 
               across the cabin and Klaatu speaks to him.

                                     KLAATU
                         Gort -- berengo.

               Gort moves off obediently.

               INT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - BARNHARDT

               Full of chagrin, he continues addressing the meeting.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         --under the circumstances, the Army 
                         people have asked us to leave the 
                         building. And, since their concern 
                         is for our safety, I can do nothing 
                         but suggest that we comply--

               Barnhardt is interrupted by the sudden and unexpected 
               appearance of the ramp, silently opening out of the side of 
               the space ship.

               MED. SHOT - BARNHARDT'S AUDIENCE

               as they react in startled amazement to the mysterious 
               appearance of the ramp. Then, as they watch, there is a sudden 
               gasp of terror.

               MED. SHOT - AT SHIP

               as Gort appears on the ramp and walks slowly down to the 
               ground. In a moment, Klaatu and Helen appear at the entrance 
               of the ship. Helen comes down the ramp to join Barnhardt, 
               while Klaatu remains at the head of the ramp.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT COLONEL AND SOLDIERS

               The Colonel stands near the door, flanked by a group of 
               soldiers, their rifles at the ready. The Colonel is startled 
               by what he sees. His eyes are on the revered figure of Klaatu 
               and he's debating what he should do.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               He is a figure of intense dignity in his impressive otherworld 
               tunic. He stares with even defiance at the armed soldiers, 
               as though holding them off by sheer weight of his personality. 
               He turns to look out at the audience, which is held 
               spellbound. Then, after a breathless moment, he speaks.

                                     KLAATU
                              (straightforwardly, 
                              with almost stern 
                              authority)
                         I am leaving soon and you will forgive 
                         me if I speak bluntly.
                              (he pauses, studying 
                              the faces)
                         The Universe grows smaller every day -- 
                         and the threat of aggression by any 
                         group -- anywhere -- can no longer 
                         be tolerated.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - IN AUDIENCE

               of three of the delegates, listening intently. (These three 
               are from Russia, India and France.)

                                     KLAATU'S VOICE
                              (over scene)
                         There must be security for all -- or 
                         no one is secure... This does not 
                         mean giving up any freedom except 
                         the freedom to act irresponsibly.

               CLOSE SHOT - A DELEGATE

               He is an American.

                                     KLAATU'S VOICE
                              (over scene)
                         Your ancestors knew this when they 
                         made laws to govern themselves -- 
                         and hired policemen to enforce them.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

                                     KLAATU
                         We of the other planets have long 
                         accepted this principle. We have an 
                         organization for the mutual protection 
                         of all planets -- and for the complete 
                         elimination of aggression. A sort of 
                         United Nations on the Planetary 
                         level... The test of any such higher 
                         authority, of course, is the police 
                         force that supports it. For our 
                         policemen, we created a race of robots--
                              (indicating Gort)
                         Their function is to patrol the 
                         planets -- in space ships like this 
                         one -- and preserve the peace. In 
                         matters of aggression we have given 
                         them absolute power over us.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               emphasizing his great size and inscrutable expression. The 
               normal blinking of his piercing eyes as he gazes imperturbably 
               at the audience is his only movement.

                                     KLAATU'S VOICE
                              (over scene)
                         At the first sign of violence they 
                         act automatically against the 
                         aggressor. And the penalty for 
                         provoking their action is too terrible 
                         to risk.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

                                     KLAATU
                         The result is that we live in peace, 
                         without arms or armies, secure in 
                         the knowledge that we are free from 
                         aggression and war -- free to pursue 
                         more profitable enterprises.
                              (after a pause)
                         We do not pretend to have achieved 
                         perfection -- but we do have a system -- 
                         and it works.
                              (with straightforward 
                              candor)
                         I came here to give you the facts. 
                         It is no concern of ours how you run 
                         your own planet -- but if you threaten 
                         to extend your violence, this Earth 
                         of yours will be reduced to a burned-
                         out cinder.

               QUICK REACTION CUTS

               of four delegates, reflecting their stark terror and 
               bewilderment. And a cut of the Colonel and the soldiers, 
               impressed and held by what Klaatu is saying.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY as he concludes quietly, incisively.

                                     KLAATU
                         Your choice is simple. Join us and 
                         live in peace. Or pursue your present 
                         course -- and face obliteration.
                              (after a pause)
                         We will be waiting for your answer. 
                         decision rests with you.

               By the time he reads the last line, the CAMERA HAS MOVED 
               INTO a BIG HEAD CLOSEUP.

               MED. SHOT - THE DELEGATES

               CAMERA MOVES along a row of their faces, stunned and silent, 
               their minds unable to cope with the enormity of what they 
               have heard.

               MED. SHOT

               CAMERA MOVES IN on Klaatu as he is saying goodbye to Barnhardt 
               and Helen. He turns then and speaks to Gort, glancing up at 
               the building as he does so.

                                     KLAATU
                         Gort -- veracto.

               CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               He looks up at the roof of the building, and once again we 
               hear the peculiar generating sound from within him.

               MED. LONG SHOT

               including the delegates, the space ship, everything that is 
               inside the building. As we watch, the roof and walls of the 
               temporary structure suddenly disintegrate as the tanks did 
               in the opening. The entire layout -- delegates, space ship 
               and all -- remain exactly as they were except that instead 
               of being under a roof they are out in the open Mall under a 
               starry sky. The area is ringed with the debris of the 
               building.

               MED. SHOT AT SHIP

               Klaatu is standing at the head of the ramp as Gort comes up 
               the ramp and disappears inside the ship. Klaatu is nodding 
               goodbye to Barnhardt and Helen.

               TWO SHOT - BARNHARDT AND HELEN

               as they wave to Klaatu. Barnhardt is moved and impressed, 
               and Helen's face shows her emotions at this strange parting.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               He nods and smiles at them with warm affection. Then he turns 
               and disappears into the ship, and the ramp closes behind 
               him.

               MED. SHOT - THE SPACE SHIP

               From inside the ship comes the muffled roar of great power 
               generating -- not the sound of earthly motors, but of a 
               tremendous dynamo.

               MED. SHOT - THE DELEGATES

               watching breathless, stunned by what they have heard and 
               seen.

               MED. LONG SHOT - THE SHIP

               As the sound from inside it builds to a climax, the great 
               ship takes off with a tremendous roar.

               REACTION CUTS OF DELEGATES

               All are deeply moved and impressed. In the mind of each is 
               the burning question that Klaatu has posed for them.

               LONG SHOT - THE SHIP

               as it soars away into the inky blackness of the outer spaces 
               from which it came.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                    February 21, 1951

                

               EXT. BEACH - PACIFIC ISLAND - MED. SHOT - DAY

               Backgrounded by palm trees and rolling surf, an American 
               army radar operator sits at his huge instrument, intently 
               tracking a target. Without interrupting this, he speaks with 
               tense excitement into a telephone transmitter strapped to 
               his chest. (It is 8:00 a.m.)

               (In this and the subsequent scenes, music and cutting build 
               to an exciting crescendo).

               EXT. FIELD - HONG KONG - MED. SHOT - DAY

               A group of British soldiers, in shorts and tropical gear, 
               are gathered tensely around a piece of radar equipment, which 
               is tracking a target. The radar operator says something to 
               another soldier, who turns and speaks excitedly into a field 
               telephone. (It is 5:00 a.m.)

               INT. INDIAN RADIO STATION - NIGHT

               The microphone bears the word CALCUTTA. An Indian announcer, 
               his expression one of excitement and terror, jabbers into 
               the mike in a native tongue. A clock on the wall indicates 
               that it is 2:26

               EXT. RUSSIAN BOMBER IN FLIGHT - (STOCK) - NIGHT

               The plane is identified by a red star on the fuselage.

               INT. RUSSIAN BOMBER - NIGHT

               The radioman is tracking an object on his radar scope. He 
               points it out excitedly to the pilot. The pilot adjusts his 
               microphone and starts making a report back to his base in 
               Russian.

               EXT. FRENCH VILLAGE - STREET CORNER - MED. CLOSE SHOT - 
               NIGHT

               A group of French farmers is collected around a radio, 
               listening wide-eyed to the keyed-up voice which is telling 
               them, in French, of a strange object that has been seen in 
               the sky. They exchange uneasy glances. One old man crosses 
               himself.

               DAY

               A breathless American radio reporter is speaking into his 
               mike, but we can't hear what he's saying. On the wall behind 
               him is a clock which reads 3:32.

               LEFT SECTION OF SCREEN SHOWS INT. BRITISH RADIO STATION - 
               NIGHT

               A clock shows the time to be 8:32. The British announcer 
               tries to maintain his traditional BBC calm, but finds it 
               almost impossible to control his excitement.

                                     BRITISH ANNOUNCER
                         Reports are coming in from all over 
                         the Empire -- from all over the world. 
                         The Government have not yet issued a 
                         statement, but there seems to be no 
                         question that there actually is a 
                         large, unidentified object circling 
                         the earth at incredible speed.

               This announcer keeps talking, but his voice fades out, and 
               now we hear the words the American announcer is saying...

                                     AMERICAN ANNOUNCER
                              (staccato with 
                              excitement)
                         We still don't know what it is or 
                         where it's from - but we do know 
                         there's something there. It's been 
                         tracked around the world by radar 
                         traveling at a rate of four thousand 
                         miles an hour.

               INT. NEW YORK TAXI - DRIVER AND FARE  DAY

               The driver and his fare are listening intently to the radio, 
               as we hear the voice of another radio reporter.

                              (voice off scene)
                         This is not another "flying saucer" 
                         scare. Scientists and military men 
                         have already agreed on that. Whatever 
                         this is -- it's something real.

               EXT. SUBURBAN GAS STATION

               The attendant, who is filling a car with gas, leans around 
               to hear the car's radio, oblivious to the fact that the car's 
               tank is overflowing.

                         We interrupt this program to give 
                         you a bulletin just received from 
                         one of our naval units at sea. "A 
                         large object, traveling at supersonic 
                         speed, is headed over the North 
                         Atlantic toward the east coast of 
                         the United States."

               Music builds to a climax and ends.

                              controlled calm)
                         Here in the nation's capital, there 
                         is anxiety and concern, but no outward 
                         sign of panic. As a matter of fact, 
                         there are signs of normalcy that 
                         seem strangely out of place; the 
                         beautiful spring weather, the tourist 
                         crowds at the various monuments and 
                         public buildings...

               EXT. LINCOLN MEMORIAL - LONG SHOT (STOCK)

               A small crowd of tourists is climbing the steps to the 
               columned entrance.

               EXT. WASHINGTON MONUMENT - LONG SHOT (STOCK)

               Under this shot a barely audible, distant hum is heard. It 
               grows in volume so imperceptibly in this and the next two 
               shots that we are unconscious of it.

               EXT. JEFFERSON MEMORIAL - LONG SHOT (STOCK)

               EXT. THE MALL - LONG SHOT

               Crowds are strolling on the Mall and across the well-kept 
               lawns in front of the Smithsonian Institution with the 
               leisurely, meandering quality that distinguishes sight-seers.

               MED. SHOT

               Including several small groups of people moving toward the 
               Smithsonian. Their attention is attracted as the hum off 
               scene becomes a roar. The sound is unearthly in its intensity 
               and almost unbearable in its swiftly increasing volume. The 
               people stop in their tracks and look up in the sky in terror.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               Several people on the steps of the Smithsonian have turned 
               to look. There is cold, frozen fear in their eyes. The awful 
               sound keeps increasing in volume.

               CLOSE SHOT

               A man, following the progress of a huge object in the sky 
               with his eyes. He is held terror-stricken.

               LONG SHOT INTO SKY (SERSEN SHOT)

               A giant shape, still at some distance, is approaching the 
               earth at incredible speed.

               LONG SHOT ON GROUND

               A group of people run wildly across a large expanse of lawn. 
               A huge shadow cast from above onto the grass seems to be 
               pursing them.

               LONG SHOT INTO SKY (SERSEN SHOT)

               The great shape is considerably nearer now.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Of a woman, thoroughly shaken, held immobile by what she 
               sees and hears.

               LONG SHOT

               People scatter madly in all directions as the huge spaceship 
               comes in for a landing on a smooth, grassy area. The 
               tremendous roar of its motors is suddenly cut off and the 
               great ship settles gently to a perfect landing.

               MED. SHOT - THE SHIP

               The gleaming surface of the ship shows no break of any kind -- 
               no windows, no ports, not even the outline of a hatch. It is 
               a fearsome, terrifying object, giving no evidence of its 
               source or its intention.

               LONG SHOT - (FROM PARALLEL)

               Shooting down on a section of lawn, showing the varying 
               reactions of people to the landing. Some are still running 
               madly away; others, singly and in little groups, stand as 
               though rooted, staring at the ship from a respectful distance.

               CLOSE SHOT - MAN

               As he stares at the ship with fascination and horror. He'd 
               like to run but he can't. His mouth twitches and he emits a 
               nervous little laugh.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               A woman is holding a two-year-old child by the hand as she 
               watches the ship, awe-struck. Several people run past them. 
               Suddenly the woman grabs up the child with a little sob, 
               turns and runs away.

               MED. SHOT

               A middle-aged man runs up to a group of several people, 
               pointing wildly toward the ship and yelling irrationally:

                                     MAN
                         They're here! They're here!

               He runs off toward another group as we--

               shouting wildly and gesticulating in the direction from which 
               he came.

               2. Policemen piling into squad cars, which roar out of their 
               garage.

               3. Soldiers rushing out of a barracks at Fort Myer, with 
               rifles and side arms, to form up on their company street.

               4. Newspaper presses rolling at high speed.

               5. Newscasters chattering excitedly into their microphones.

               6. A large telephone switchboard with the girls in a frenzy 
               of activity as they try to handle the calls pouring in.

               A nationally known news commentator -- for purposes of this 
               script let's say Drew Pearson -- is seated before a radio 
               mike. He is also being photographed by TV cameras. In a wall 
               near him is a TV screen which shows what is going out on the 
               air. During the ensuing speech, a man comes in a hands him a 
               sheaf of news bulletins.

                         Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, 
                         this is Drew Pearson. We bring you 
                         this special radio-television 
                         broadcast to give you the latest

                         "space ship" in Washington.

                                     PEARSON
                         Government and Defense Department 
                         officials are concerned by reports 
                         of panic in several large Eastern 
                         cities. I am authorized to assure 
                         you that so far there is no reasonable 
                         cause for alarm. The rumors of 
                         invading armies and mass destruction 
                         are based on hysteria and are 
                         absolutely false. I repeat -- these 
                         rumors are absolutely false!

                         The ship, designed for travel outside 
                         the earth's atmosphere, landed in

                         Standard Time. We still don't know 
                         where it came from, but I can reveal 
                         that military leaders are considering 
                         two possibilities; that it came from 
                         some unfriendly power here on earth -- 
                         or that it actually arrived from 
                         another planet.

               On the screen is a shot of the space ship.

                         The ship is resting exactly where it 
                         landed two hours ago, and there has 
                         been no sign of life from inside it.

               EXT. THE MALL - MED. SHOT

               Two platoons of infantry soldiers surround the ship, their 
               rifles at the ready.

                         Myer and they have formed a cordon 
                         around the ship.

               MED. SHOT

               showing two machine guns, two Sherman tanks and two 75MM 
               guns. The gun crews are posted for action and all weapons 
               are trained on the space ship.

                         tanks and artillery.

               MED. SHOT - POLICE CORDON

               Cops are holding back a section of a large crowd, some 
               distance away from the ship. The people are wide-eyed and 
               tense with excitement.

                         Behind police lines, there is a large 
                         crowd of curiosity seekers.

               SERIES OF INDIVIDUAL CUTS

               1. Civilians in the crowd, their eyes and nerves taut with 
               suspense.

               2. A young soldier, who grips his rifle and moistens his 
               lips nervously, his eyes never leaving the ship.

               3. A tank commander blinks from the tension of staring at an 
               unmoving object.

               4. The last cut is of the ship itself.

                              (over scene)
                         As you can see for yourself, the 
                         Army has taken every precaution to 
                         meet whatever the situation may 
                         require. Every eye -- every weapon -- 
                         is trained on the ship. It's been 
                         this way for two hours and the tension--

               CLOSE SHOT - PEARSON

               as he interrupts himself excitedly, his attention riveted on 
               the TV screen.

                                     PEARSON
                         Just a minute, ladies and gentlemen! 
                         I think I see something moving!

               EXT. THE MALL - MED. LONG SHOT - DAY

               We are at the actual location now, not looking at TV. We see 
               the ship surrounded by soldiers, two medium tanks, two 
               artillery pieces, and a couple of machine guns. Some distance 
               away is a suggestion of the crowd of civilians, held back by 
               police. Prominent in the scene are newsreel and television 
               cameras. OUR CAMERA MOVES IN to MED. SHOT. As it does so, we 
               see a couple of metal objects rising slowly from the top of 
               the ship. One, which is an oddly-designed coil of wire, slides 
               up and revolves slowly. The other is a section of vented 
               pipe with a convex cap on it.

               REVERSE ANGLE

               on the soldiers, their eyes glued to this first sign of 
               activity from the ship. They shift uneasily, gripping their 
               rifles more firmly.

               MED. SHOT - THE SHIP

               After a long, tense moment, a ramp appears silently out of 
               the side of the ship and slides down to the ground. There is 
               an audible gasp as a man appears at the top of the ramp. He 
               looks around at the crowd with cool and imperturbable dignity. 
               This is KLAATU. He is completely human in appearance. The 
               only unearthly thing about him is his clothing. He wears a 
               tunic that is very good looking, but at the same time 
               thoroughly comfortable and practical. On his head is a metal 
               helmet that obscures most of his face. (It would be impossible 
               to identify him later.) The design of this helmet gives the 
               impression that it is more a formal headdress than for 
               protection. Klaatu is above all an impressive man -- a man 
               of tremendous dignity and presence. He has the tolerant 
               superiority that comes with absolute knowledge.

               INDIVIDUAL REACTION CUTS

               of soldiers, people in the crowd, and policemen. The newsreel 
               and TV men are busy at their cameras.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               After an impressive moment, he raises his arms in the 
               universal gesture of neutrality. Then he speaks, in perfect 
               English, his voice amplified as though through an enunciator.

                                     KLAATU
                         We have come to visit you in peace -- 
                         and with good will.

               Klaatu walks slowly down the ramp toward the soldiers. As he 
               does so, he draws from inside his tunic a strange looking 
               object, longish and tubular. It might be a a telescope -- or 
               it might be some strange kind of weapon.

               MED. SHOT

               shooting from the side, showing Klaatu advancing slowly toward 
               the line of soldiers. He holds out the mysterious object in 
               front of him in a gesture that is actually one of offering 
               but could be misinterpreted as menacing. There is a growing, 
               uneasy rumble of muttering among the soldiers as Klaatu 
               advances. They are clearly frightened of what he may do.

               CLOSE SHOT - PLATOON LEADER

               A young second lieutenant, standing in front of his platoon. 
               As Klaatu advances, the lieutenant unslings his carbine.

               MED. SHOT

               Klaatu starts toward the platoon leader, raising the object 
               he holds toward the man, trying to make clear his intentions. 
               Misinterpreting this as a menacing gesture, the platoon leader 
               raises his carbine to his shoulder.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               of one of the tank commanders in the turret of his tank. He 
               is watching Klaatu advancing toward the platoon leader and 
               he has drawn his pistol. Convinced that the lieutenant is in 
               jeopardy, the tank commander aims at Klaatu and fires.

               MED. SHOT

               as Klaatu falls to the ground wounded. The object he was 
               holding has dropped from his hand and smashed. The soldiers 
               start to gather around Klaatu excitedly when suddenly there 
               appears in the entrance to the space ship a huge robot. There 
               is a gasp of amazement from the crowd and the solders draw 
               back at sight of him. The robot is ten feet tall, is made in 
               the almost-perfect image of a man. He is to be played by an 
               actor and his flesh appears to be made of a greenish metal. 
               His eyes flash as though lighted internally. His perfectly-
               fashioned, muscular body is covered only with a loincloth. 
               This is GORT.

               There are cries of amazement as Gort walks slowly ponderously, 
               down the ramp to the ground. As he does so, the ramp closes 
               behind him. Gort's face is, and always remains, utterly 
               expressionless. He stops to look at Klaatu, lying on the 
               ground. Then he looks around at the soldiers, the tanks and 
               guns. All the guns have been traversing to follow him.

               CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               From inside him there comes an ominous crackling sound, as 
               though power were being generated within him. His eyes flash 
               toward the tank from which Klaatu was shot.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - TANK

               There is a great metallic clatter and the Sherman tank is 
               suddenly reduced to a pile of junk metal, its parts completely 
               disintegrated. Only a piece of tank track and twisted gun 
               barrel emerge from the heap on the ground to identify what 
               had been there. The tank's crew has remained unharmed.

               CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               The crackling sound continues as his eyes start to sweep in 
               a semicircle taking in all the troops.

               MED. SHOT - THE TROOPS

               SHOOTING FROM BEHIND Gort, with the back of his head in f.g., 
               CAMERA PANS to follow Gort's sweeping gaze. In a growing 
               crash and clatter of metal, every weapon in sight is 
               destroyed. The two machine guns are little heaps of junk. 
               The 75's are larger heaps. The second tank, like the first, 
               is a three-foot pile of scrap. Rifles have dropped from the 
               soldier's hands and lie on the ground as little mounds of 
               wood and metal. None of the men has been harmed, but their 
               faces show the utter terror of what they have experienced.

               ANOTHER ANGLE - THE TROOPS

               as they react to the full shock of what has happened. Most 
               of them stand rooted to the ground. Several laugh 
               hysterically. A few break and run wildly.

               MED. SHOT - CROWD OF CIVILIANS

               Sudden pandemonium breaks out. Utterly terrified by what 
               they have witnessed, the crowd becomes a wild, milling, 
               screaming mob, concerned only with escape.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               He is walking slowly, deliberately, menacingly toward the 
               tank commander who fired on Klaatu. Standing by the debris 
               of his tank, the man is immobilized with terror. The robot 
               starts to reach out to grab him.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               lying on the ground. He speaks to Gort sharply, in a strange 
               language.

                                     KLAATU
                         Gort! Deglet ovrosco!

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               He pauses obediently in the act of reaching out for the tank 
               commander. Dropping his arms, he stands motionless and remains 
               that way.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               He has raised himself to a sitting position on the ground, 
               his wounded shoulder giving him considerable pain. The two 
               platoon leaders come into scene hesitantly, badly shaken by 
               the awesome demonstration of power they have seen. They are 
               uncertain as to what they should do. The platoon leader eyes 
               the smashed object on the ground curiously and turns 
               questioningly to Klaatu. With great dignity, Klaatu picks up 
               the broken object, which we see well for the first time. It 
               is a delicately-made tubular telescope, badly smashed. On it 
               are indications of small electronic gadgets.

                                     KLAATU
                         It was a gift. For your President.
                              (glances at the broken 
                              object ruefully)
                         With this he could have studied life 
                         on other planets.

               Klaatu lets the object drop with a shrug of mild exasperation. 
               The two lieutenants exchange a helpless look of bewilderment. 
               Then Klaatu raises himself to his feet painfully, holding 
               his wounded shoulder. As he does so, a colonel and a captain 
               come into scene.

                                     COLONEL
                              (to the lieutenants)
                         Is he all right?

                                     FIRST PLATOON LEADER
                         Got hit in the shoulder, sir.

               The three junior officers exchange ineffectual glances and 
               look to the colonel, who thinks for a moment before making 
               his decision.

                                     COLONEL
                         Send for an ambulance. Get him to 
                         Walter Reed Hospital right away.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Yes, sir.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. SITTING ROOM - WALTER REED HOSPITAL - NIGHT

               There is a door to the corridor and a door to Klaatu's room. 
               In the small sitting room, talking in tones of hushed concern, 
               is a group of men. There's a Major General, a likable man 
               with a chest full of ribbons. There are also a Colonel in 
               command of the hospital, a high-ranking police officer, a 
               couple of medical officers and two civilians. The conversation 
               is interrupted by the entrance from Klaatu's room of a Medical 
               Corps Major, followed by an Army Nurse.

                                     GENERAL
                              (to Major)
                         How is he?

                                     MAJOR WHITE
                         He's all right, General... Blood 
                         pressure's a little high, but it 
                         could be aggravation.

                                     GENERAL
                              (wryly)
                         Can't blame him. I always get mad 
                         when somebody shoots me.

                                     MAJOR WHITE
                         He still wants to see the President.

                                     COLONEL
                              (to General)
                         We informed the White House over an 
                         hour ago.

                                     GENERAL
                              (to Major)
                         Didn't drop any hints about where 
                         he's from, did he?

                                     MAJOR WHITE
                         No, sir, he didn't.

               The door to the corridor opens and a worried young Captain 
               enters.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Excuse me.
                              (to the Colonel)
                         What about the reporters, Colonel? 
                         They're swarming all over the lobby.

               The Colonel turns, in deference, to the General.

                                     GENERAL
                              (quietly)
                         Tell them there won't be any statement 
                         tonight.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Yes, sir.
                              (glancing down the 
                              corridor)
                         Mr. Harley's here from the White 
                         House.

               Harley appears in the doorway, a brief case under his arm. 
               He's a dignified, intelligent member of the White House 
               secretariat. He proceeds uninterruptedly into the room, 
               nodding cordially to the General.

                                     HARLEY
                         General --

                                     GENERAL
                              (indicating Klaatu's 
                              room)
                         Right in there, Mr. Harley.

               Harley proceeds in businesslike fashion to the door. He knocks 
               and then enters.

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - FULL SHOT

               as Harley enters, closing the door behind him. Klaatu no 
               longer wears his helmet and we see his face clearly for the 
               first time. Even sitting up in bed, with his shoulder strapped 
               in bandages, he is a figure of great authority. His face 
               reflects inner dignity and assurance. Harley, who is a 
               hardened diplomatist, can't help being impressed by his 
               present assignment and a little awed by Klaatu. Harley 
               obviously has been sent by the President to find out what he 
               can. Klaatu's eyes study him, cool, penetrating, reserved.

                                     HARLEY
                         My name is Harley -- Secretary to 
                         the President
                              (Klaatu continues to 
                              study him silently)
                         I've been told that you speak our 
                         language -- that your name is Mr. 
                         Klaatu.

                                     KLAATU
                              (coolly)
                         Just Klaatu.

                                     HARLEY
                         The President asked me to convey his 
                         deepest apologies for what has 
                         happened. We all feel--

                                     KLAATU
                              (evenly)
                         Sit down, Mr. Harley.

               Somewhat relieved, Harley seats himself. He speaks with a 
               half smile, hoping to ease the tension.

                                     HARLEY
                         I'm sure I don't have to point out 
                         that your arrival was something of a 
                         surprise.
                              (getting a little 
                              smile from Klaatu, 
                              he is encouraged to 
                              do some fishing)
                         Had you been traveling long?

                                     KLAATU
                         About five months -- your months.

                                     HARLEY
                         You must have come a long way.

                                     KLAATU
                         About 250 million of your miles.

               Harley glances at him quickly to be sure he's not joking. 
               He's not.

                                     HARLEY
                         Naturally we're very curious to know 
                         where it is you come from.

                                     KLAATU
                              (easily; he's a 
                              diplomat, too)
                         From another planet. Let's just say 
                         that we're neighbors.

               Harley reacts, as his wildest assumptions are so blandly 
               corroborated.

                                     HARLEY
                         It's rather difficult for us to think 
                         of another planet as a neighbor.

                                     KLAATU
                         I'm afraid, in the present situation 
                         you'll have to learn to think that 
                         way.

                                     HARLEY
                              (eyebrows raised)
                         The present situation?

                                     KLAATU
                         I mean the reasons for my coming 
                         here.

                                     HARLEY
                              (his eagerness apparent)
                         We're very curious about that, too. 
                         Would you care to talk about it?

                                     KLAATU
                         I'd be glad to.
                              (noticing that Harley 
                              is settling himself 
                              expectantly)
                         Not now, of course -- with you alone.

                                     HARLEY
                         Perhaps you'd rather discuss it 
                         personally with the President--

                                     KLAATU
                              (somewhat sharply)
                         This is not a personal matter, Mr. 
                         Harley. It concerns all the people 
                         on your planet.

                                     HARLEY
                              (Startled by the scope 
                              of this statement)
                         I -- I'm not sure I understand--

                                     KLAATU
                         I want to meet with representatives 
                         from all the nations of the Earth.

                                     HARLEY
                              (shocked and perturbed 
                              by this notion)
                         I'm afraid that would be a little 
                         awkward. It's -- it's completely 
                         without precedent. And there are 
                         practical considerations -- the time 
                         involved -- the enormous distances.

                                     KLAATU
                              (coolly)
                         I traveled 250 million miles. What 
                         about your United Nations?

                                     HARLEY
                              (Surprised and a little 
                              puzzled)
                         You know about the United Nations?

                                     KLAATU
                         We've been monitoring your radio 
                         broadcasts for a good many years. 
                         That's how we learned your languages. 
                         Lately, we've been getting your 
                         television also.

                                     HARLEY
                              (wryly)
                         You must have a rather strange 
                         impression of us.

                                     KLAATU
                              (smiling)
                         The first two years of television we 
                         were convinced that all you did was 
                         wrestle.

               Harley smiles. Then his mind reverts to the seriousness of 
               the situation and he speaks gravely.

                                     HARLEY
                         I'm sure you recognize from our broad-
                         casts the evil forces that have 
                         produced the tension in our world. 
                         Surely you would agree--

                                     KLAATU
                              (evenly)
                         I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with 
                         the internal affairs of your planet. 
                         I consider that to be your business -- 
                         not mine.

                                     HARLEY
                         I was only hoping to make you 
                         understand.

                                     KLAATU
                              (sternly, impressively)
                         My mission here is not to solve your 
                         petty squabbles. It concerns the 
                         existence of every last creature who 
                         lives on Earth.

                                     HARLEY
                              (uncomfortably)
                         Perhaps if you could explain a little--

                                     KLAATU
                         I intend to explain. To all the 
                         nations -- simultaneously.
                              (his manner precludes 
                              opposition)
                         How do we proceed, Mr. Harley?

               Harley is thoroughly shaken. The tremendous force and power 
               implicit in Klaatus's manner preclude the possibility of 
               argument.

                                     HARLEY
                              (after a long 
                              thoughtful moment)
                         We could call a special meeting of 
                         the General Assembly... But of course 
                         the UN doesn't represent all of the 
                         nations.

                                     KLAATU
                         Then why not a meeting of all the 
                         Chiefs of State?

                                     HARLEY
                              (helplessly, but 
                              patiently)
                         Believe me, you don't understand. 
                         They wouldn't sit down at the same 
                         table.

               Growing a little impatient with such nonsense, Klaatu eyes 
               him evenly, speaks with Jovian authority.

                                     KLAATU
                         I don't want to resort to threats, 
                         Mr. Harley. I simply tell you bluntly 
                         that the future of your planet is at 
                         stake... I suggest you transmit that 
                         message to the nations of the Earth.

               The eyes of the two men meet for a long, silent moment. Then 
               Harley rises quietly.

                                     HARLEY
                         I will make that recommendation to 
                         the President.
                              (he picks up his brief 
                              case and hat)
                         I must tell you in all honesty that 
                         I'm extremely dubious about the 
                         results.

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a half-smile)
                         Apparently I'm not as cynical about 
                         Earth's people as you are.

                                     HARLEY
                         I've been dealing in Earth's politics 
                         a good deal longer than you have.
                              (he bows)
                         Goodnight, sir.

               He turns and goes out.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               He stares after Harley for a moment, puzzled by this strange 
               and apparently unreasoning world he has come to. He shakes 
               his head in thoughtful, tolerant bewilderment.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. SPACE SHIP - LONG SHOT - NIGHT

               Searchlights have lighted up up the eerie shapes of the space 
               ship and Gort. A circle of soldiers guard the area, while a 
               crew of men can be seen working around the ship.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - AT SHIP

               A Master Sergeant of Engineers, dressed in fatigues, is 
               inspecting the side of the ship carefully. He has an acetylene 
               torch in his had and a welding helmet over his face. The 
               Major General, previously seen in the hospital sitting room, 
               enters and speaks to the Sergeant.

                                     GENERAL
                         Getting any place, Sergeant?

                                     SERGEANT
                              (raising his helmet)
                         No, sir.
                              (shaking his head in 
                              annoyance)
                         Beats me, General. I saw that ramp 
                         come out of the side of the ship -- 
                         right here. Now I can't even find a 
                         crack!

               A man named Carlson, a civilian metallurgical expert, comes 
               into scene. The General nods to him.

                                     GENERAL
                         What's the report, Carlson?

                                     CARLSON
                              (discouraged)
                         We've tried everything from a 
                         blowtorch to a diamond drill.

                                     GENERAL
                              (nodding toward Gort)
                         What about him?

                                     CARLSON
                         He's made out of the same stuff.

               THREE SHOT  GENERAL, CARLSON AND SERGEANT

                                     GENERAL
                         Has he moved?

                                     SERGEANT
                         No sir. Not an inch

                                     CARLSON
                         This is the toughest material I ever 
                         saw, General. For hardness and 
                         strength, it's out of this world.

                                     GENERAL
                              (with a wry half-smile)
                         I can tell you officially - that's 
                         where it came from.

               The two men exchange an uneasy glance, then turn to look at 
               the ship.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. SITTING ROOM  WALTER REED HOSPITAL

               Two Medical Corps officers, a Captain and a Major are 
               interestedly studying a series of X-ray films.

                                     MAJOR
                         The skeletal structure is completely 
                         normal.
                              (pointing)
                         Same for the major organs - heart, 
                         liver, spleen, kidneys.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         And the lungs are the same as ours. 
                         Must mean a similar atmosphere -- 
                         similar pressure.
                              (nodding, toward 
                              Klaatu's room)
                         How old do you think he is?

                                     MAJOR
                         Oh, I'd say forty-five.

                                     CAPTAIN
                              (smiling)
                         He told me this morning when I 
                         examined him. He's seventy-eight.

                                     MAJOR
                         I don't believe it.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Their life expectancy is a hundred 
                         and thirty.

                                     MAJOR
                         How does he explain that?

                                     CAPTAIN
                         He says their medicine is that much 
                         more advanced.
                              (the major stares at 
                              him blankly)
                         He was very nice about it. But he 
                         made me feel like a third-class witch 
                         doctor.

               The door to Klaatu's rooms opens and Major White appears. 
               He's the man who attended Klaatu the day before. He closes 
               the door behind him and stands motionless facing the other 
               two, his face wearing a blank expression.

                                     MAJOR WHITE
                         I took a bullet out of that man's 
                         arm yesterday.

                                     FIRST MAJOR
                         What about it?

                                     MAJOR WHITE
                              (utterly bewildered)
                         I just examined the wound and it's 
                         all healed.

                                     FIRST MAJOR
                         What does he say about it?

                                     MAJOR WHITE
                         Said he put some salve on it -- some 
                         stuff he had with him.
                              (shows them a small, 
                              odd-looking tube in 
                              his hand)

                                     CAPTAIN
                         What are you going to do with it?

                                     MAJOR WHITE
                         Take it downstairs and have it 
                         analyzed.
                              (on his way to the 
                              door, shaking his 
                              head)
                         Then I don't know whether I'll just 
                         get drunk or give up the practice of 
                         medicine.

               As he starts out the door to the corridor, he passes Mr. 
               Harley, who is on his way in, carrying his ever-present brief 
               case. Harley is accompanied by an enlisted M.P.

                                     FIRST MAJOR
                         Afternoon, Mr. Harley.

                                     HARLEY
                         Afternoon, gentlemen.

               Harley goes to the door of Klaatu's room, a businesslike 
               expression on his face. He knocks on the door, then enters. 
               The M.P. remains in the sitting room.

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - FULL SHOT - DAY

               as Harley enters. Klaatu is up out of bed, walking around in 
               a Medical Corps robe and pajamas. He appears to be completely 
               recovered.

                                     HARLEY
                         Good afternoon.
                              (surprised not to 
                              find him in bed)
                         I'm glad to see you up and around.

                                     KLAATU
                         Thank you... Have you any news?

                                     HARLEY
                         Not very good news, I'm afraid.
                              (digs into his 
                              briefcase for some 
                              papers)
                         The President accepted your suggestion 
                         and cabled the invitations for a 
                         meeting last night.
                              (grimly)
                         Let me read you some of the replies.
                              (he selects a cable 
                              and reads)
                         "The Premier wishes to inform the 
                         Government of the United States that 
                         it will be impossible for him to 
                         attend the meeting suggested by the 
                         President unless the meeting is held 
                         in Moscow."
                              (with a grimly-pointed 
                              glance at Klaatu, 
                              Harley reads another 
                              cable)
                         "The suggestion of the President 
                         regarding the possibility of a meeting 
                         in Moscow would be unacceptable to 
                         Her Majesty's Government at the 
                         present time. Representation could 
                         be sent only if the meeting were 
                         held in Washington."
                              (he looks up at Klaatu 
                              and shrugs)
                         Well -- there you have it.

               Harley extends a sheaf of cables for Klaatu's inspection, 
               but he ignores them. Klaatu has listened to this recital, 
               first incredulously, then with mounting indignation. Conscious 
               of his quiet, Olympian wrath, Harley continues uncomfortably.

                                     HARLEY
                         I tried to make you understand. The 
                         suspicions -- the jealousies -- the 
                         mistrust--
                              (uneasily, under 
                              Klaatu's level gaze)
                         Surely you realize that my government 
                         has done everything in its power--

                                     KLAATU
                         It's not your government I'm thinking 
                         about. It's your world.

                                     HARLEY
                         Now that you understand the situation 
                         more clearly, perhaps you'd like to 
                         discuss the matter with the President

                                     KLAATU
                              (sternly)
                         I will not speak to any one nation 
                         or group of nations.
                              (sharply, bitterly)
                         I don't intend to add my contribution 
                         to your childish jealousies and 
                         suspicions.

                                     HARLEY
                         Our problems are very complex, Mr. 
                         Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too 
                         harshly.

                                     KLAATU
                         I can judge only by what I see.

                                     HARLEY
                         Your impatience is quite 
                         understandable.

                                     KLAATU
                              (sharply)
                         I am impatient with stupidity. My 
                         people have learned to live without 
                         it.

                                     HARLEY
                              (ruefully)
                         I'm afraid my people haven't.
                              (with real sincerity)
                         I'm very sorry -- I wish it were 
                         otherwise.

               Reluctantly Harley has picked up his hat and brief case. He 
               finds Klaatu staring out the window.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               As he looks out the window thoughtfully. What he sees has 
               given him an idea.

               MED. SHOT - HOSPITAL GROUNDS

               shooting down, from Klaatu's viewpoint, at people strolling 
               about the hospital grounds. Most of them are civilian 
               visitors, but there is a sprinkling of nurses and ambulatory 
               patients.

               FULL SHOT - HOSPITAL ROOM

               As Klaatu turns back to Harley, he speaks thoughtfully, 
               incisively.

                                     KLAATU
                         Before making any decisions, I think 
                         I should get out among your people -- 
                         become familiar with the basis for 
                         these strange, unreasoning attitudes.

                                     HARLEY
                         Under the circumstances I'm afraid 
                         that will be impossible.

               Harley has paused near the door, a little embarrassed by 
               Klaatu's level gaze.

                                     HARLEY
                         I must ask that you don't attempt to 
                         leave the hospital. Our military 
                         people have insisted on this. I'm 
                         sure you'll understand.

               With a polite nod, he goes out. Klaatu stares after him as 
               he realizes that he is in effect a prisoner. He shakes his 
               head slowly, thoughtfully. The ways of this planet are strange 
               indeed.

               INT. SITTING ROOM - MED CLOSE SHOT - AT DOOR

               Harley has paused to watch as the M.P. takes out a key and 
               inserts it in the lock of Klaatu's door.

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               As he hears the click of the lock, he turns toward the door. 
               Realizing they've locked him in, he smiles with tolerant 
               amusement.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. HOSPITAL SITTING ROOM - MED CLOSE SHOT - NIGHT

               In the dim light of one lamp, the door to the corridor opens 
               and a nurse enters carrying a tray of medication. She is 
               accompanied by the same M.P. as previously seen. The nurse 
               pauses as the M.P. takes out a key and inserts it in the 
               lock of Klaatu's door. To his surprise he finds that the 
               door is not locked. He exchanges a glance with the nurse, 
               then pulls the door open and hurries inside.

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM

               as the M.P. crosses the unlighted room toward the bed. The 
               only light cones from the open door to the sitting room. The 
               M.P.'s eyes go wide as he looks at the bed. It is unmade and 
               unoccupied. Terrified, the M.P. turns to the nurse, who is 
               standing in the doorway.

               M.P.  He's gone!

               The M.P. dashes out of the room, through the doorway past 
               the nurse. She turns to follow him as we--

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               MONTAGE - NIGHT

               A series of short DISSOLVES, showing:

               1. The M.P. excitedly reporting Klaatu's disappearance to 
               the Officer of the Day.

               2. The hospital guard detail hurrying out of the guardhouse 
               to form up in front of the Sergeant of the guard.

               3. A high-level military conference gathered at a table, 
               discussing the matter with great concern.

               4. A street corner newsstand, with people eagerly grabbing 
               papers. The headline reads: "MAN FROM MARS" ESCAPES FROM 
               ARMY HOSPITAL!

               5. Radio announcers chattering excitedly into their 
               microphones

               6. A series of close-ups of people listening to the radio. 
               Their faces reveal their awestruck terror.

               7. A terrified mother drags her two children in from the 
               street through the front door, slams the door and bolts it.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - MED. CLOSE SHOT - NIGHT

               CAMERA is on the back of a man dressed in a business suit, 
               who is walking along the sidewalk of a dimly lighted, almost 
               deserted, middle-class street. He carries a suitcase and he 
               glances idly at the drab-looking stone facades of the old 
               two-story houses. As he passes, from the open windows of the 
               houses come the voices of radio announcers. We get a sentence 
               or two from one house and then, as the man and our CAMERA 
               pass on, this voice fades and another is picked up. We get 
               the impression that everyone is glued to his radio.

                                     RADIO VOICES
                              (over scene)
                         --authorities at Walter Reed Hospital 
                         refused to comment on how he managed 
                         to escape, or what measures might be 
                         taken to apprehend him.

               --these fantastic descriptions of the creature are denounced 
               as rumor by police Chief Walter Baxter. He is not eight feet 
               tall, as reported -- nor does he have tentacles in place of 
               arms--

               --there's no denying that there is a monster at large -- 
               that we are dealing with forces beyond our knowledge and 
               power. The public is urged to take ordinary precautions and 
               to remain calm, as we await further developments--

               --three separate reports of people who claim to have seen 
               the "space man" in the past hour. One from Des Moines, Iowa; 
               one from a village in northern Florida; and one from Chicago.

               CAMERA OVERTAKES the man as he pauses under the light of a 
               street lamp, and reveals that it is Klaatu. He has stopped 
               to look at something out of scene.

               CLOSE SHOT

               from Klaatu's viewpoint, of a sign on one of the houses, 
               reading: ROOM FOR RENT

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               He seems to hesitate, debating a plan he has in mind. He 
               raises his right arm to scratch his head thoughtfully, and 
               notices for the first time a small tag, or ticket, attached 
               to the inside of the right forearm of the coat he is wearing. 
               Puzzled, he pulls off the ticket and looks at it.

               INSERT - TICKET

               It is the sort of tag a cleaning establishment attaches to 
               clothing. Printed on it is the legend: CAPITOL DRY CLEANING 
               SERVICE. Scrawled in a penciled hand is the notation: Dr. 
               Carpenter, Bldg. A - Walter Reed Hospital. Cl. & pr. $1.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               He smiles wryly at this reminder of where he got the suit, 
               and he destroys the ticket. He glances down at the suitcase 
               beside him.

               CLOSE SHOT - SUITCASE

               It bears the initials L.M.C. Klaatu's hand comes into scene 
               and lifts up the suitcase. CAMERA HOLDS as Klaatu carries 
               the bag toward the house and mounts the stone steps to the 
               entrance.

               INT. BOARDINGHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               There 's no light in the room except what splashes in from 
               the hall. Gathered around a television set are five adults 
               and a little boy, their faces eerie in the reflected light 
               from the screen. The room is done in average boardinghouse 
               style -- antimacassars and all. The attention of the people 
               is riveted on the television screen, where a newscaster is 
               reading a bulletin.

                                     TELEVISION COMMENTATOR
                         --while the President made no effort 
                         to minimize the crisis, he urged 
                         people all over the country to remain 
                         calm. He said the entire facilities 
                         of FBI and other federal agencies 
                         are being bought to bear. He pointed 
                         out, however, that this is no ordinary 
                         man hunt. He warned we may be up 
                         against powers that are beyond our 
                         control.

               FULL SHOT

               The landlady, a stern-faced woman of middle age, named MRS. 
               CROCKETT, rises nervously and crosses to the television set.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                              (tensely)
                         I can't stand any more of this. It's 
                         enough to drive a person crazy.

               She snaps off the set sharply.

               TWO SHOT

               BOBBY BENSON, a bright-eyed, eleven-year-old, is seated beside 
               his mother, HELEN BENSON, an attractive girl of thirty. 
               Disappointed that the set has been turned off, Bobby's roving 
               eye has fallen on something in the doorway to the hall... 
               Wide-eyed, he nudges his mother and points.

                                     BOBBY
                         Hey, Mom -- who's that?

               FULL SHOT

               including the doorway to the hall. Silhouetted motionless 
               against the light from the hall is the figure of a man. All 
               eyes follow Hobby's pointed finger, and there is a stifled 
               gasp as they are startled out of their preoccupation. One of 
               the men turns on the lights and Klaatu is revealed standing 
               calmly in the doorway. There is a shocked silence for a 
               moment, then Mrs. Crockett speaks.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                              (apologizing nervously 
                              for the tension in 
                              the room)
                         I -- I'm sorry. What is it you want?

                                     KLAATU
                         My name is Carpenter. I'm looking 
                         for a room.

               There is a noticeable letdown in the general tension, during 
               which Booby has been studying Klaatu, his imagination working 
               overtime.

                                     BOBBY
                         Are you an FBI man?

                                     KLAATU
                         No -- I'm afraid not.

               Helen has stepped forward to make Bobby desist.

                                     BOBBY
                         Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking 
                         for that space man.

                                     HELEN
                              (with an apologetic 
                              smile at Klaatu)
                         I think we've all been hearing too 
                         much about "space men."

               Mrs. Crockett reverts to her role as landlady. She likes to 
               think of her house as a home.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                              (starting the 
                              introductions with 
                              Helen)
                         This is Mrs. Benson, Mr. Carpenter.
                              (with a smile that 
                              would split a brick)
                         And little Bobby.
                              (indicating a middle-
                              aged couple and a 
                              younger but more 
                              wizened man)
                         Mr. and Mrs. Barley -- and Mr. 
                         Krull... I'm Mrs. Crockett.

               There are polite noddings and how-do-you-do's. Mrs. Crockett 
               is satisfied that she's established a cozy atmosphere.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                              (pleased to the point 
                              of challenge)
                         Well -- this is our little family.
                              (then, getting down 
                              to business)
                         I have a very nice room on the second 
                         floor.

               She leads the way toward the hall and Klaatu starts to follow, 
               picking up his suitcase, when he is intercepted by Bobby.

                                     BOBBY
                         Can I help you look for the space 
                         man? Can I?
                              (excitedly)
                         I know what he looks like! He's got 
                         a square head -- and, three great 
                         big eyes!

                                     HELEN
                              (good-naturedly, 
                              calming him down)
                         That's enough, Bobby. I think it's 
                         time you went to bed.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                              (to Bobby, with a 
                              prop smile)
                         We mustn't annoy Mr. Carpenter -- or 
                         he won't want to stay here. She goes 
                         on into the hall, followed by Klaatu, 
                         who has exchanged a polite smile 
                         with Helen.

               INT. HALLWAY

               as Mrs. Crockett leads the way up the stairs.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                         He's really a dear little boy -- and 
                         quiet as a mouse.
                              (with a shrewd, chatty 
                              smile)
                         You're a long way from home, aren't 
                         you, Mr. Carpenter?

                                     KLAATU
                         How did you know?

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                              (pleased with her 
                              cleverness)
                         Oh, I can tell a New England accent 
                         a mile away.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BOARDINGHOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

               Five of the boarders -- Mr. and Mrs. Barley, Mr. Krull, Helen 
               Benson and Klaatu - are finishing their Sunday morning 
               breakfast. Mrs. Barley is a middle-class Helen Hokinson lady, 
               form and unrelenting. Her husband is a born complainer. Mr. 
               Krull is a shriveled little accountant, precise and finicky. 
               As they finish their coffee, all except Helen are immersed 
               in the Sunday papers. Helen seems preoccupied with her own 
               thoughts. From a portable radio on the table comes Gabriel 
               Heater's voice.

                                     GABRIEL HEATER'S VOICE
                         --and so, this Sunday morning, we 
                         ask the question that's been plaguing; 
                         the entire nation for two days now: 
                         "Where is this creature and what is 
                         he up to?" If he can build a space 
                         ship that can fly to Earth -- and a 
                         robot that can destroy our tanks and 
                         guns -- what other terrors can he 
                         unleash at will? ...Obviously we 
                         must find this monster. We must track 
                         him down like a wild animal and 
                         destroy him.

               INSERT - NEWSPAPER PAGE IN MRS. BARLEY'S HANDS

               It is a full page layout, in the style of the American Weekly, 
               showing a demented artist's conception of a mass invasion of 
               space ships. Weird-looking creatures are slaughtering Earth 
               people with ray guns. The caption at the top of the image 
               reads: "Are We Long For This World?" (Gabriel Heater's voice 
               continues uninterruptedly over this and the next two scenes.)

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               He is reading his paper with considerable interest.

               INSERT - NEWSPAPER STORY

               The third-page story reads: SAVANT CALLS MEETING TO STUDY 
               SPACE SHIP. Professor Jacob Barnhardt, world-famous scientist 
               and Nobel Prize winner, has invited fellow scientists from 
               all over the world to meet with him in Washington and study 
               the recently landed "Space Ship."

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               His face is thoughtful as he finishes reading. This story 
               seems to impress and interest him. Then suddenly he finds 
               his attention caught at what the Radio Voice is saying.

                                     GABRIEL HEATER'S VOICE
                         But where would such a creature hide 
                         himself? Would he disappear into the 
                         north woods? Or would he slither off 
                         into the sewers of some great city?

               Klaatu has a reaction of affronted dignity at this monstrously 
               distasteful idea.

               GROUP SHOT

               AS THE RADIO VOICE CONTINUES:

                                     GABRIEL HEATER'S VOICE
                         There is grave danger -- everyone 
                         agrees to that. The question is what 
                         can we do to protect ourselves? What 
                         measures can we take that will--

               During the above, Mrs. Barley has turned to her husband in 
               sharp annoyance.

                                     MRS. BARLEY
                         George, I wish you'd turn that radio 
                         off. I'm trying to concentrate.

               Mr. Barley reaches out and snaps off the radio.

                                     MR. BARLEY
                              (snorting, he tosses 
                              his paper down)
                         Why doesn't the Government do 
                         something -- that's what I want to 
                         know.

                                     MR. KRULL
                              (mildly)
                         What can they do? They're only people -- 
                         Just like us.

                                     MR. BARLEY
                         People my foot! They're Democrats!

                                     MR. KRULL
                         It's enough to give you the shakes. 
                         He's got that robot standing there -- 
                         ten-foot tall -- just waiting for 
                         orders to destroy us.

                                     HELEN
                              (thoughtfully)
                         This space man -- or whatever he is. 
                         We automatically assume he's a 
                         menace... Maybe he isn't at all.

                                     MR. BARLEY
                              (glaring at her for 
                              this silly notion)
                         Then what's he hiding for? Why doesn't 
                         he come out in the open?

                                     MR. KRULL
                         Yeah.
                              (indicating the radio)
                         Like the fella says: "What's he up 
                         to?"

                                     HELEN
                         Maybe he's afraid.

                                     MRS. BARLEY
                              (with a derisive snort)
                         He's afraid!

                                     HELEN
                         After all, he was shot the moment he 
                         landed here.
                              (she pauses for a 
                              moment thoughtfully)
                         I was just wondering what I would 
                         do.

                                     KLAATU
                              (to Helen, helpfully)
                         Perhaps before deciding on a course 
                         of action, you'd want to know more 
                         about the people here -- to orient 
                         yourself in a strange environment.

                                     MRS. BARLEY
                              (sharply)
                         There's nothing strange about 
                         Washington, Mr. Carpenter.

                                     KLAATU
                              (quietly, tongue in 
                              cheek)
                         A person from another planet might 
                         disagree with you.

                                     MRS. BARLEY
                         If you want my opinion, he came from 
                         right here on Earth.
                              (with significant 
                              emphasis)
                         And you know where I mean.

                                     MR. KRULL
                         They wouldn't come in a space ship. 
                         They'd come in airplanes.

                                     MRS. BARLEY
                              (as though with 
                              superior knowledge)
                         I wouldn't be so sure about that.

                                     MR. BARLEY
                              (delivering the final 
                              word)
                         Stands to reason that fella wants 
                         some thing or he wouldn't be here.
                              (facing Klaatu)
                         That make sense, Carpenter?

               Klaatu pauses for a moment, then recites pleasantly.

                                     KLAATU
                         I must admit I'm a little confused.

               Mrs. Crockett enters and speaks to Helen.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                         Mrs. Benson -- Mr. Stevens is here 
                         to see you.

                                     HELEN
                         Oh -- thank you.

               She rises and goes out.

                                     MRS. BARLEY
                         Finish your coffee, George. I told 
                         the Carsons we'd be there at eleven.

               INT. BOARDINGHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MED. CLOSE SHOT

               as Helen crosses the room to greet TOM STEVENS. He's a 
               personable young man with a breezy manner and considerable 
               charm. There is between them an easy air of Intimacy.

                                     HELEN
                              (smiling warmly)
                         Good morning.

               Tom kisses her.

                                     TOM
                         We're all set. I picked up some 
                         sandwiches and put gas in the car. 
                         And the radio's still busted, so me 
                         can forget about the space man for 
                         today.

                                     HELEN
                              (a little disturbed)
                         There's only one thing -- I haven't 
                         been able to arrange for anyone to 
                         stay with Bobby.
                              (tentatively)
                         I don't suppose we could take him 
                         with us?

                                     TOM
                              (understandably 
                              unenthusiastically)
                         Well, we could--

                                     HELEN
                         There's always somebody here, but 
                         today of course they've all got plans.

                                     KLAATU'S VOICE
                         I haven't any plans.

               Helen and Tom turn in surprise.

               THREE SHOT

               including Klaatu, who has wandered in from the dining room, 
               unnoticed by Tom and Helen. Klaatu continues, with an air of 
               wanting to be helpful without wanting to interfere.

                                     KLAATU
                         I'd be glad to spend the day with 
                         him -- if you'd let me.

                                     TOM
                              (impulsively)
                         Say, that'll be great! Wouldn't it, 
                         Helen.

                                     HELEN
                              (hesitating, a little 
                              confused, by the 
                              offer)
                         It's awfully nice of you to suggest 
                         it.
                              (remembering the two 
                              men haven't met)
                         I'm sorry Mr. Carpenter -- this is 
                         Tom Stevens.

               The two men shake hand's and exchange how-do-you-do's. Then 
               Klaatu turns back to Helen.

                                     KLAATU
                         Bobby and I had a fine time yesterday 
                         afternoon. We talked -- and listened 
                         to the radio.
                              (smiling at Helen)
                         I thought today he might show me 
                         around the city.

               Helen is debating the matter in her mind, concerned about 
               leaving Bobby with a comparative stranger, but tempted because 
               of her favorable impression of Klaatu.

                                     KLAATU
                              (easily)
                         Suppose I ask Bobby how he feels 
                         about it.

               He turns, with a little smile, and starts out of the room. 
               Helen, still not quite decided, turns to Tom with a 
               questioning look. Tom nods.

               DISSOLVE T0:

               INT. LINCOLN MEMORIAL - FULL SHOT - DAY (STOCK)

               The great seated, brooding figure of Lincoln is at the far 
               end of the impressive main hall. A few tourists are moving 
               about the place.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY

               They are in the south hall, on the wall of which is inscribed 
               the Gettysburg Address. They stand silently, side by side, 
               reading the inscription.

               INSERT - GETTYSBURG ADDRESS (STOCK)

               Featuring the last part of the Address. It reads: "--and 
               that government of the people, by the people, for the people, 
               shall not perish from the earth."

               TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY

                                     KLAATU
                              (visibly impressed)
                         Those are great words.
                              (with an air of 
                              discovery)
                         He must have been a great man.

               Bobby is impressed by the depth and sincerity of Klaatu's 
               tribute, but a little confused by his air of having discovered 
               Lincoln. Hobby watches Klaatu with a puzzled expression, 
               then follows as Klaatu moves off slowly.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. LINCOLN MEMORIAL - MED. CLOSE SHOT - DAY

               shooting against one of the huge fluted columns as Klaatu 
               and Bobby come out of the building. Deeply preoccupied, Klaatu 
               speaks with impatient urgency.

                                     KLAATU
                         That's the kind of man I'd like to 
                         talk to.

               Bobby looks up at him in bewilderment. After a moment Klaatu 
               speaks slowly, thoughtfully.

                                     KLAATU
                         Bobby -- who's the greatest man in 
                         America today?

                                     BOBBY
                              (puzzling it over)
                         Gee -- I don't know... The space 
                         man, I guess.

                                     KLAATU
                              (secretly amused)
                         I was speaking of earth men. I meant 
                         the greatest philosopher -- the 
                         greatest thinker.

                                     B0BBY
                         You mean the smartest man in the 
                         whole world?

                                     KLAATU
                         Yes -- that would do nicely.

                                     BOBBY
                              (after a moments 
                              thought)
                         Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. 
                         He's the greatest scientist in the 
                         world.

                                     KLAATU
                              (he pauses 
                              thoughtfully, speaks 
                              slowly, as he recalls 
                              the newspaper story 
                              he read)
                         He lives here in Washington, doesn't 
                         he?

                                     BOBBY
                         Sure. Right near where my mother 
                         works.

                                     KLAATU
                         Where is that?

                                     BOBBY
                         Department of Commerce. She's a 
                         secretary.
                              (Klaatu nods)
                         They have a man they call the 
                         Secretary, but he isn't at all. My 
                         mother's a real secretary.
                              (after a moment; 
                              eagerly)
                         Mr. Carpenter -- now can we go see 
                         the space ship?

               EXT. THE MALL - LONG SHOT - SPACE SHIP AND GORT - DAY

               A crew of Army engineers is in process of erecting a temporary 
               structure such as a large Quonset hut or B29 hanger to enclose 
               the space ship and Gort. The walls are partially up and 
               already have concealed part of the ship. The area is roped 
               off and there are Army guards to keep the sightseers back. 
               There is a crowd of people behind the ropes, watching. CAMERA 
               MOVES IN to reveal the backs of Bobby and Klaatu.

               TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY

               Bobby is studying the ship and Gort eagerly, his imagination 
               thoroughly aroused. Klaatu is watching the men at work with 
               mild, quiet amusement.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               from Bobby's viewpoint.

               TWO SHOT - BOBBY AND KLAATU

               Bobby's eyes are wide with awe as he watches the giant robot.

                                     BOBBY
                         Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he 
                         could knock down a whole building.

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a quizzical 
                              smile)
                         I shouldn't be at all surprised.

               Bobby's attention shifts to the ship.

               MED. SHOT - SPACE SHIP

               From Bobby's viewpoint.

               TWO SHOT - B0BBY AND KLAATU

                                     BOBBY
                              (excitedly, indicating 
                              the ship)
                         Gee, I'd like to get inside and see 
                         how it works. What do you think makes 
                         it go?

                                     KLAATU
                              (quietly, after a 
                              glance around)
                         Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.

                                     BOBBY
                              (looking at Klaatu 
                              incredulously)
                         I thought that was only for bombs.

                                     KLAATU
                         No. It's for a lot of other things, 
                         too.

                                     BOBBY
                         You think it can go faster than an F-
                         36?

                                     KLAATU
                         Yes -- I think so.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT KLAATU AND BOBBY

               shooting from a side angle to include a couple of men who 
               are listening to Klaatu's conversation. They are nudging 
               each other, amused at the way this man is pretending to 
               explain things to the little boy.

                                     BOBBY
                         About a thousand miles an hour?

               Klaatu has noticed the two men, who have edged a little closer 
               to listen. He is not perturbed by them, but he lowers his 
               voice a bit.

                                     KLAATU
                         Maybe four thousand miles an hour. 
                         And outside the Earth's atmosphere a 
                         good deal faster.

                                     BOBBY
                              (excitedly)
                         Gee! How could they make a landing?

                                     KLAATU
                         Well -- there are several ways to 
                         reduce landing speed. You see, the 
                         velocity--

               Klaatu interrupts himself as he realizes that he may be going 
               too far. The two men have moved closer, listening and 
               grinning. One of them whispers to the other behind the back 
               of his hand. Then the man realizes that Klaatu has stopped 
               speaking and is looking at him.

                                     MAN
                              (grinning)
                         Keep goin', Mister. He was fallin' 
                         for it.

               The two men burst out laughing and move off together. Bobby, 
               who has missed the point of this by-play, looks at Klaatu, 
               then after the men. As they move out of scene they laugh 
               loudly at the little boy's confusion. Klaatu takes Bobby's 
               hand to lead him away from the roped-off area.

               TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY

               CAMERA FOLLOWS them as they move away through the crowd.

               As they do so, several newsboys are working their way through 
               the crowd with newly arrived extras. The boys are calling 
               out the extras: "Police under fire!" "Army put in charge!" 
               "Space man still at large!" etc. People are eagerly buying 
               the papers. Klaatu and Booby watch this as they pass through 
               the crowd.

               CLOSE SHOT - EXTRA

               In newsboy's hand. The headline reads: SPACE MAN ELUDES POLICE 
               ARMY PUT IN CHARGE.

               CLOSE SHOT - ANOTHER EXTRA

               In another newsboy's hand. This headline reads: DISTRICT 
               UNDER MARTIAL LAW. CONGRESS ACTS AS POLICE CHIEF REIGNS.

               TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY

               as they move on away from the excited crowd of people. 
               Klaatu's reaction has been one of mild curiosity. Bobby looks 
               up at him.

                                     BOBBY
                         You think they'll ever find him?

                                     KLAATU
                              (alter a moment's 
                              pause)
                         I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to 
                         doubt it.

                                     BOBBY
                              (as they continue 
                              walking)
                         Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity 
                         mean?

                                     KLAATU
                              (preoccupied)
                         Velocity is the time rate of change 
                         of position.

               This explanation misses Bobby by several light years. He 
               glances up at Klaatu blankly.

                                     BOBBY
                         I'll bet that's the way Professor 
                         Barnhardt talks.

               Pulled out of his reverie, Klaatu glances down at Bobby and 
               smiles apologetically. Bobby grins back at him. Then, as 
               they walk on a few more steps, Klaatu stops and speaks 
               thoughtfully.

                                     KLAATU
                         Bobby -- I have an idea. Let's go 
                         see Professor Barnhardt and find out 
                         how he talks.

                                     BOBBY
                              (with a half-smile of 
                              accusation)
                         You're just kidding, aren't you?

                                     KLAATU
                         Wouldn't you like to meet him?

                                     BOBBY
                         Well, sure I would, but --
                              (he's to be not going 
                              taken in)
                         Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a private smile)
                         We can scare him more than he can 
                         scare us.

               Bobby stares up at him and his face breaks into a broad 
               admiring grin.

                                     BOBBY
                         I like you, Mr. Carpenter. You're a 
                         real screwball.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. BARNHARDT'S HOUSE - MED. SHOT - DAY

               The house is an unimposing old-fashioned structure, shouldered 
               on either side by similar one-family dwellings. There is a 
               flight of stone steps leading up to the entrance and a large 
               porch across the front of the house. Klaatu and Bobby walk 
               into scene and pause, Klaatu glances at Bobby and Bobby nods 
               toward the house. They move on up the steps to the entrance.

               MED. CHOOSE SHOT - AT FRONT DOOR

               Bobby, all eagerness and excitement, presses the bell. They 
               wait a moment and there is no answer.

                                     BOBBY
                              (disappointed at the 
                              thought)
                         Gee -- maybe he isn't home.

               Bobby wanders down the porch and looks into a window. 
               Fascinated by what he sees, he gestures to Klaatu.

                                     BOBBY
                         Betcha this is where he works--

               After a glance at the front door, Klaatu joins Bobby at the 
               window and looks in.

               FULL SHOT - BARNHARDT'S STUDY

               SHOOTING through the window, over the heads of Klaatu and 
               Bobby. The room is more of a workroom than a study. It is in 
               comfortably shabby disarray, with papers and books everywhere. 
               There's a battered old desk and a day bed. One wall is solid 
               bookshelves and on the other two are blackboards covered 
               with a fantastic array of complex equations, graphs and 
               diagrams.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               His attention has been caught by one of the blackboards and 
               he studies it with great interest and curiosity.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - SECTION OF BLACKBOARD

               It is covered with a particularly complicated series of 
               equations in a chalky scrawl, involving angles of vector, 
               Keplerian ellipses, etc. The final equations are unsolved; 
               they have no answers after the "equals" sign. Across are 
               little printed signs tacked to the blackboard reading: "Don't 
               erase!" and "Don't touch!"

               TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY

               Bewildered, Bobby looks from the blackboard up at Klaatu. 
               Still studying the blackboard, Klaatu is shaking his head 
               and clucking his tonsure as one might at the attempts of a 
               child to solve a problem in arithmetic.

                                     BOBBY
                              (indicating the 
                              equations)
                         What does that mean?

                                     KLAATU
                         It's a problem in celestial mechanics.

                                     BOBBY
                         Bet he's the only one in the world 
                         knows the answer.

                                     KLAATU
                              (he shakes his head, 
                              smiling)
                         He doesn't know the answer. And he'll 
                         never get it that way.

               Bobby moves over to a pair of French doors beyond the window 
               and tries to peer in through the curtained doors. He absently 
               tries the doors and finds them locked. Then he turns away 
               with a disappointed but philosophical shrug.

                                     BOBBY
                         We probably couldn't get to see him 
                         even if he was home.

               As Bobby moves away from the doors dejectedly, Klaatu puts 
               his hand on the knob.

               CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

               He's watching Klaatu and his eyes widen at what he sees.

                                     BOBBY
                              (in complete surprise)
                         Hey -- where you going?

               CHOOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               He has opened the door and is standing in the doorway, his 
               hand, still on the knob. He is smiling at Bobby with secret 
               amusement. He's got an idea.

                                     KLAATU
                         If he's that difficult to see, perhaps 
                         we ought to leave a calling card.

               Klaatu disappears into the study. Amazed, Bobby follows.

               INT. BARNHARDT'S STUDY

               Bobby watches as Klaatu walks to the blackboard and picks up 
               a piece of chalk. As though correcting a schoolboy's work, 
               he makes large check marks at several points in each equation.

               EXT. PORCH - BARNHARDT'S HOUSE

               An efficient-looking middle-aged woman is mounting the steps 
               to the entrance, getting her front door key out of her purse, 
               when her eye falls on the French doors, which are standing 
               ajar. Puzzled, she starts down the porch toward the doors. 
               This woman is Barnhardt's secretary and her name is HILDA.

               Bobby is watching as Klaatu writes across the blackboard in 
               a bold hand: Differentiate the equation ( ).

               Klaatu underlines this comment with a sharp stroke, when a 
               stern voice is heard off screen.

                                     HILDA'S VOICE
                         What are you doing in here?

               FULL SHOT

               as Klaatu and Bobby turn in surprise. Standing in the open 
               French doors is Hilda, eyeing them with stern suspicion.

                                     HILDA
                              (outraged by Klaatu's 
                              desecration of the 
                              sacred blackboard)
                         How dare you write on that blackboard!
                              (Klaatu eyes her mildly)
                         Do you realize the Professor has 
                         been working on that problem for 
                         weeks?

                                     KLAATU
                              (pleasantly)
                         He'll catch on to it in no time now.

                                     HILDA
                              (controlling herself 
                              with an effort)
                         How did you get in here? And what do 
                         you want?

                                     KLAATU
                         We came to see Professor Barnhardt.

                                     HILDA
                         Well, he's not here. And he won't be 
                         back till this evening.
                              (sternly)
                         I think you'd better leave now. 
                         Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk 
                         and scribbles something on a scratch 
                         pad. He tears off the piece of paper 
                         and hands it to Hilda.

                                     KLAATU
                         You might keep this.
                              (with easy assurance)
                         I think the professor will want to 
                         get in touch with me.

               With a polite nod he goes out the French doors, followed by 
               Bobby. Hilda eyes the door for a moment, then glances down 
               at the paper in her hand, disturbed and puzzled by this 
               stranger. Her glance wanders to the blackboard and she picks 
               up an eraser, debating whether to erase Klaatu's corrections. 
               At that moment the French door opens and Klaatu sticks his 
               head in. Startled, Hilda drops the eraser.

                                     KLAATU
                              (pointing to the 
                              blackboard)
                         I wouldn't erase that. The Professor 
                         needs it very badly.

               And he disappears, leaving Hilda to glare after him in 
               impotent rage. Deciding that this man is either a crackpot 
               or a menace, she goes to the telephone on the desk and starts 
               dialing a number.

               EXT. BARNHARDT'S HOUSE - MED. SHOT

               as Klaatu and Bobby come down the steps and turn into the 
               sidewalk. They are talking and laughing together, but we 
               can't hear their conversation. CAMERA PANS with them as they 
               move on up the sidewalk, revealing two kids playing hopscotch. 
               Klaatu watches, fascinated, as he walks by. Then, having 
               passed the kids, he tries the one-footed, then two-footed 
               hop that characterizes the game.

               INT. BARNHARDT'S STUDY

               Hilda is talking on the phone.

                                     HILDA
                         --no, Sergeant, there was no 
                         classified material around, but I 
                         have instructions to report anything 
                         unusual to the police... Yes -- I'm 
                         Professor Barnhardt's secretary.
                              (consulting the paper 
                              in her hand)
                         The man's name is Carpenter -- and 
                         he lives at 1615 St. Street, N.W... 
                         Yes, that's right--

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - LONG SHOT - DAY

               Bobby and Klaatu come out of a wooded path into a section of 
               the cemetery where the myriad crosses seem to reach into 
               infinity. They pause for a moment, then Bobby leads the way 
               through one of the rows.

               EXT. ARLINGTON CEMETERY - CLOSE SHOT

               in one of the many rows are crosses that extend beyond CAMERA 
               RANGE. CAMERA MOVES IN on one of the crosses. It bears the 
               name LT. ROBERT BENSON.

               TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND B0BBY

               as they come into scene and look down at the grave.

                                     BOBBY
                         That's my father.
                              (Klaatu glances at 
                              the boy, then nods 
                              understandingly)
                         He was killed at a place called Anzio.

               Klaatu's glance roves out thoughtfully to the infinite rows 
               of crosses, and his eyes are sad as they return to Bobby.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. ARLINGTON CEMETERY - MED. SHOT - DAY

               Klaatu and Bobby are approaching a bench beside a pathway 
               overhung with trees. Bobby leads the way to the bench and 
               they sit down. Klaatu's eyes stray out to the myriad crosses.

                                     KLAATU
                              (Reflectively)
                         Did all these people die in wars?

                                     BOBBY
                              (somewhat surprised)
                         Sure. Didn't you ever hear of 
                         Arlington Cemetery?

                                     KLAATU
                         No -- I'm afraid not.

                                     BOBBY
                              (very serious)
                         Mr. Carpenter" -- you don't seem to 
                         know about anything.

                                     KLAATU
                              (Amused)
                         I'll tell you, Bobby -- I've been 
                         away for a long time. Very far away.

                                     BOBBY
                         Is it different where you've been?
                              (indicating the 
                              cemetery)
                         Don't they have places like this?

                                     KLAATU
                              (slowly)
                         They have cemeteries. But not like 
                         this one... You see, they don't have 
                         any wars.

               Bobby looks at him, puzzled and impressed by this 
               incomprehensible notion.

                                     BOBBY
                         Gee -- that's a good idea.

               His eyes are drawn subconsciously out to the rows of crosses. 
               Then he turns back to Klaatu with a slow-dawning look of 
               curiosity, and Klaatu deliberately changes the subject.

                                     KLAATU
                         What would you like to do this 
                         afternoon?

               After a moment Bobby's expression changes and he breaks into 
               a broad grin.

                                     BOBBY
                         Go to the movies.

                                     KLAATU
                         All right.

                                     BOBBY
                              (he didn't dare hope 
                              for this)
                         No foolin'? Will you?

                                     KLAATU
                         Certainly.
                              (then he hesitates)
                         Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to 
                         have money to go there?

               Bobby gives him a look of amazement, then grins, assuming 
               Klaatu was kidding and simply hasn't any money.

                                     BOBBY
                              (eagerly)
                         I've got some money. My mother gave 
                         me two dollars.

                                     KLAATU
                         No -- I want to take you to the 
                         movies.
                              (he takes some objects 
                              out of his pocket)
                         Do you think they'd accept these?

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU'S HAND

               Sparkling in his palm are eight or ten cut diamonds of various 
               sizes.

               TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY

               The boy is staring at the stones in wide-eyed amazement.

                                     BOBBY
                         Gee -- those look like diamonds!

                                     KLAATU
                         Some places that's what people use 
                         for money. They're easy to carry -- 
                         and they don't wear out.

                                     BOBBY
                              (staring at them 
                              fascinated)
                         Bet they're worth about a million 
                         dollars.

                                     KLAATU
                         Would you give me your two dollars 
                         for a couple of them?

                                     BOBBY
                              (with a nervous, unsure 
                              smile)
                         Well, sure, but--

               The boy studies Klaatu's face to see if he's kidding. 
               Realizing that he's not, Bobby's face takes on a childishly 
               shrewd expression -- as though he were about to trade a 
               jackknife for an ocean liner.

                                     BOBBY
                              (slowly)
                         Okay.

               The boy takes out two dollar bills and offers them almost 
               challengingly. Klaatu takes the bills and hands Bobby two 
               good-sized Diamonds. They study their new acquisitions with 
               interest. Bobby looks up from his diamonds to steal a guilty 
               glance at Klaatu.

                                     BOBBY
                         Let's not say anything to my mother 
                         about this, Mr. Carpenter.

                                     KLAATU
                              (mildly curious)
                         Why not, Bobby?

                                     BOBBY
                              (gravely)
                         She doesn't like me to steal from 
                         people.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. BOARDINGHOUSE STREET - MED. SHOT - NIGHT

               Shooting toward the curb as a police prowl car drives up and 
               stops in front of the boardinghouse. A Detective in 
               plainclothes gets out and gestures to the uniformed Driver 
               to pull up the street a way and wait. The Driver nods and 
               the car moves off as the Detective crosses the sidewalk to 
               the boardinghouse.

               EXT. BOARDINGHOUSE - MED. CLOSE SHOT

               As the Detective mounts the steps he glances through a window 
               into the living room. Klaatu can be seen reading to Bobby, 
               who is perched happily on the arm of Klaatu's chair. The 
               Detective moves to the front door ant rings the bell. There 
               is the sound of running feet and in a moment the door is 
               opened and Bobby appears.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         Mr. Carpenter come home yet?

                                     BOBBY
                              (studying the man 
                              curiously)
                         Yeah -- he's right inside.

               INT. DOWNSTAIRS - BOARDINGHOUSE

                                     DETECTIVE
                         Tell him I'd like to see him.

                                     BOBBY
                              (calling out)
                         Mr. Carpenter--!
                              (to the Detective)
                         Come on in.

               The Detective steps inside and Bobby closes the door, as 
               Klaatu appears from the living room.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         Your name Carpenter?

                                     KLAATU
                              (puzzled that anyone 
                              should know him)
                         Yes.
                              (then recalling, with 
                              a smile of 
                              satisfaction)
                         Oh -- I suppose Professor Barnhardt's 
                         looking far me.

                                     DETECTIVE
                              (dryly, with grim 
                              emphasis)
                         I been looking for you all afternoon.

               EXT. BOARDINGHOUSE STREET - MED. SHOT - NIGHT

               An inexpensive convertible -- a 1948 Ford, or Chevrolet -- 
               drives up and stops in front of the house. Helen and Tom are 
               in it.

               INT. CONVERTABLE - TW0 SHOT - HELEN AND TOM

               You get the feeling that Helen and Ton have spent a very 
               enjoyable day together and are reluctant to say goodnight. 
               Tom puts his arm around her and kisses her.

                                     HELEN
                              (fondly)
                         It was a wonderful day.

                                     TOM
                         You still haven't answered my 
                         question.

                                     HELEN
                              (warmly sincere)
                         You know how I feel, Tom. I just 
                         want to think it over.

                                     TOM
                         The boss is leaving for Chicago 
                         tomorrow. If I could tell him I was 
                         getting married -- with two dependents--

                                     HELEN
                              (smiling)
                         You're a good salesman -- but I've 
                         got to think about it.

                                     TOM
                         A good insurance salesman wouldn't 
                         give you time to think.

               With a smile and, a quick kiss, Helen gets out of the car.

                                     HELEN
                         'Night.

               MED. SHOT

               as Helen turns and hurries across the sidewalk to the house. 
               In the entrance she turns and waves to Tom. He waves back 
               and drives off slowly. Helen lets herself in with her key.

               INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL - BOARDINGHOUSE

               The Detective is putting on his hat and preparing to leave 
               with Klaatu as Helen enters. There is a moment of awkwardness 
               and confusion as she glances, puzzled, at the Detective. 
               Bobby runs to her and greets her excitedly.

                                     BOBBY
                         Hi Mom!

                                     HELEN
                         Hello, darling.
                              (she kisses Bobby, 
                              then turns 
                              questioningly to 
                              Klaatu and the 
                              Detective)
                         Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.

               Klaatu is uneasy but tries not to show it as he smiles in 
               greeting and introduces the Detective.

                                     KLAATU
                         Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady.

                                     BOBBY
                              (Impressively)
                         Mr. Brady's a cop.

               Helen glances quickly at the Detective, then at Klaatu, 
               surprised and troubled. She turns to Bobby to cover her 
               confusion.

                                     HELEN
                              (to Bobby)
                         Did you have a nice day, dear?

                                     BOBBY
                              (enthusiastically)
                         Boy, we had a swell time. Didn't we, 
                         Mr. Carpenter?

                                     KLAATU
                         We certainly did.

                                     BOBBY
                         We went to the movies -- and we had 
                         ice cream cones -- and we went to 
                         see Daddy--

                                     HELEN
                              (moved and grateful, 
                              she's uneasy and 
                              concerned as she 
                              turns to Klaatu)
                         I don't know how to thank you.

                                     KLAATU
                         I enjoyed every minute of it.

                                     DETECTIVE
                              (with quiet insistence)
                         We better get goin', Mr. Carpenter.

               As Klaatu nods and prepares to follow him, Bobby speaks to 
               Klaatu.

                                     BOBBY
                         Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.

                                     KLAATU
                         We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, 
                         Bobby.

                                     BOBBY
                              (reluctantly)
                         Goodnight.

               Klaatu and the Detective nod to Helen and they go out. Helen 
               watches the door close with real concern, wondering why the 
               police want Klaatu and hoping he hasn't done anything wrong. 
               Still disturbed, she turns to lead Bobby upstairs.

                                     HELEN
                         Come on, Bobby. Time to go to bed.

                                     BOBBY
                              (he followers her, 
                              then hesitates)
                         Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have 
                         to go down to the police station?

                                     HELEN
                         I -- I don't know, dear... Perhaps 
                         there's some mistake.

               This satisfies him for the moment -- even though it doesn't 
               satisfy Helen. He is climbing the stairs beside her.

                                     BOBBY
                         We sure had fun today. We saw the 
                         space ship and we went to see 
                         Professor Barnhardt -- and--

                                     HELEN
                              (flashing him a 
                              puzzled, incredulous 
                              look)
                         Professor Barnhardt.

                                     BOBBY
                              (almost ignoring the 
                              interruption)
                         Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to 
                         school tomorrow?

                                     HELEN
                         Of course, dear.

                                     BOBBY
                         Aw, gee, Mom -- I had plans to play 
                         with Mr. Carpenter.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. POLICE STATION - FULL SHOT - NIGHT

               The place is crowded and there is a feeling of feverish but 
               well-ordered activity. Unidentified people who have been 
               picked up in the search for the space man are being screened 
               by the police. They are all men -- all between forty and 
               sixty years old -- and they are from all walks of life. A 
               series of desks have been arranged in a row, with signs over 
               them reading IDENTIFICATION. At each desk is a team of cops 
               and before each desk is a line of men waiting to be screened. 
               At the far end of the room Klaatu can be seen at the desk of 
               a Police Lieutenant, with the detective who picked him up.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               Shooting over the shoulders of two cops at one of the desks, 
               toward the line of people they are screening. A nondescript, 
               middle-aged vagrant stands before the desk as one of the 
               cops flips through a card file.

                                     FIRST COP
                              (to the cop beside 
                              him)
                         B.M. Alberts -- no prior arrests.

                                     SECOND COP
                              (to the vagrant)
                         No identification?
                              (the man shakes his 
                              head dully)
                         Send him over to G-2.

               The man is taken out of the line as CAMERA MOVES ON to the 
               next desk, with another pair of cops and another line. A 
               rather distinguished-looking business man is placing a sheaf 
               of identification cards and papers on the desk.

                                     BUSINESSMAN
                         My wife just arrived with my 
                         identification.

               One of the cops at the desk glances over the papers and nods 
               to the man.

                                     THIRD COP
                         That'll be all, Mr. Baxter. Sorry to 
                         bother you... Next.

               CAMERA MOVES ON to a third desk where a small, rat-faced man 
               is standing uneasily before the two cops, one of whom is 
               flipping through a card file.

                                     FOURTH COP
                         Cappo, John C?
                              (the man nods)
                         Two priors -- one for petty theft -- 
                         one for shoplifting.

                                     FIFTH COP
                              (waving the man away)
                         Okay, Jonny -- you can go.

                                     MAN
                              (with a nervous grin)
                         Sometimes a record comes in handy.
                              (and he moves off)

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - AT LIEUTENANT'S DESK

               A Detective Lieutenant in plain clothes is questioning Klaatu, 
               who stands beside the Detective who brought him in. The 
               Lieutenant is a rugged but dignified man about fifty, 
               intelligent and businesslike.

                                     LIEUTENANT
                         The Professor's secretary says she 
                         found you in Barnhardt's room, making 
                         marks on his blackboard.

                                     KLAATU
                         I was only trying to be helpful. He 
                         was having difficulty with a problem.

               The Lieutenant exchanges a look with the Detective.

                                     LIEUTENANT
                              (sardonically)
                         Oh, I see. He was having trouble and 
                         you were helping him out.

                                     KLAATU
                              (pleasantly)
                         That's right.

                                     LIEUTENANT
                              (quietly sharp and 
                              accusing)
                         I suppose you know that Barnhardt 
                         does a lot of secret work for the 
                         Army.

                                     KLAATU
                         In this case the secret wouldn't be 
                         worth much. He doesn't know the answer 
                         himself.

                                     LIEUTENANT
                              (growing impatient)
                         But I suppose you know the answer.

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a deprecating 
                              shrug)
                         It's really quite simple... The three-
                         body problem, you know.

               The lieutenant shifts in his chair, annoyed that he has to 
               deal with this madman. He glances at a report on his desk, 
               trying to control his impatience.

                                     LIEUTENANT
                         Your name's Carpenter -- that right?
                              (Klaatu nods)
                         Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? 
                         Driver's license -- social security 
                         number?

                                     KLAATU
                         No -- I'm afraid not.

                                     LIEUTENANT
                         Well, how do I know who you are?

                                     KLAATU
                              (secretly amused)
                         You don't.

               The Lieutenant is turning away in exasperation as a uniformed 
               cop comes into the scene.

                                     COP
                         Excuse me, Lieutenant --
                              (pointing offscene)
                         The Doc says this man needs treatment 
                         right away.

               MED. SHOT

               A man about forty-five, bloodied and badly beaten, is being 
               supported and half-carried by two policemen. A police doctor 
               is guiding them to a doorway, near which is a sign INFIRMARY. 
               The man is almost unconscious, incapable even of holding up 
               his head.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - AT LIEUTENANT'S DESK

                                     LIEUTENANT
                         What's the story?

                                     COP
                         Some fella caught him lookin' in a 
                         window and figured he was the space 
                         man. The whole neighborhood went 
                         crazy and they ganged up on him. 
                         Would have killed him if we hadn't 
                         come along... Turns out he was just 
                         a prowler.

               The Lieutenant grimaces his disgust and impatience with mob 
               violence.

                                     LIEUTENANT
                         Okay -- book him and get him fixed 
                         up.
                              (the cops nods and 
                              goes, and the 
                              Lieutenant growls as 
                              he turns back to 
                              Klaatu and the 
                              Detective)
                         Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.

                                     KLAATU
                              (appalled by what he 
                              has seen and heard)
                         They would have killed this man?

                                     LIEUTENANT
                              (gruffly)
                         People get hysterical enough, they 
                         do anything.
                              (impatiently)
                         Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't 
                         identify yourself, I got to send you 
                         over to the Army.

                                     KLAATU
                              (pretending impatience, 
                              but actually growing 
                              concerned)
                         How long will that take?

                                     LIEUTENANT
                         They can tell right away. They've 
                         got a couple of doctors who saw this 
                         man in the hospital.
                              (to the Detective)
                         Take him over to G2.

               Really concerned now, Klaatu tries to find a way out. He 
               attempts an authoritative air.

                                     KLAATU
                         It's very important, Lieutenant, 
                         that I see Professor Barnhardt.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         Come on, Mr. Carpenter--

               Shaking off the Detective's hand, Klaatu speaks to the 
               Lieutenant.

                                     KLAATU
                         May I suggest that you call the 
                         Professor?

                                     LIEUTENANT
                              (all patience gone)
                         Get going, will you, Brady -- before 
                         I get mad!

               The Detective takes Klaatu's arm and leads him toward the 
               door. As they go they pass a Military Police Captain, who 
               makes his way straight to the Lieutenant's desk.

               EXT. POLICE STATION - TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND DETECTIVE

               as they come out of the station. Klaatu hesitates a moment, 
               looks around. His face reveals nothing, but he seems to be 
               momentarily considering the idea of making a break. The 
               Detective, sensitive to such a possibility, hooks his arm 
               under Klaatu's and nods his head toward the sidewalk in silent 
               command. Klaatu allows himself to be led off.

               MED. SHOT

               as the Detective leads Klaatu across the sidewalk to the 
               curb, where a police car is standing. Parked just behind it 
               is an Army staff car.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - ENTRANCE TO POLICE STATION

               as the M.P. Captain appears in the entrance, accompanied by 
               the Police Lieutenant. They see Klaatu and the Detective 
               approaching the police car and hurry out of scene after them.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - AT POLICE CAR

                                     LIEUTENANT
                              (to the Detective)
                         Wait a minute, Brady--
                              (indicating orders in 
                              his hand)
                         The Captain here's got orders from 
                         General Cutler to take this man over 
                         to Professor Barnhardt.

                                     M.P. CAPTAIN
                              (to Klaatu firmly but 
                              respectfully)
                         Will you come with me, Sir?

               MED. SHOT

               as Klaatu gets out of the police car and the Captain escorts 
               him toward the staff car. Passing the Lieutenant, Klaatu 
               speaks with a polite smile, a smile that might be one of 
               mild triumph.

                                     KLAATU
                         Sorry to trouble you, Lieutenant.

               The Lieutenant reacts with impatient exasperation as the 
               Captain holds the staff car door open for Klaatu, who steps 
               into the Army vehicle, as we--

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. HALLWAY - BARNHARDT'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               as the M.P. Captain and Klaatu enter the front door, which 
               is held open for then by Hilda. She gestures them toward the 
               half-open door of Barnhardt's study, where Barnhardt can be 
               seen puzzling over the problem on the blackboard. The Captain 
               knocks on the open door to attract his attention and enters 
               with Klaatu.

               INT. BARNHARDT'S STUDY

               Barnhardt turns from his deep preoccupation at the blackboard, 
               chalk in hand.

                                     M.P. CAPTAIN
                         This is the man you wanted to see, 
                         Professor.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (studying Klaatu 
                              curiously)
                         Thank you, Captain.

                                     M.P. CAPTAIN
                         I'll wait outside.

               He steps out into the hall, closing the door. Barnhardt 
               continues to study Klaatu for a moment, then points to the 
               notations he made on the blackboard. There is a controlled 
               but anxious excitement in Barnhardt's attitude.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         You wrote this?

                                     KLAATU
                              (nodding easily)
                         It was a clumsy way to introduce 
                         myself -- but I understand you're a 
                         difficult man to see.
                              (glancing at the 
                              blackboard 
                              reproachfully)
                         I thought you'd have the solution by 
                         this time.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Not yet. That's why I wanted to see 
                         you.

               Klaatu glances at the work Barnhardt has been doing on the 
               board. Then he points to one of the expressions in an 
               equation.

                                     KLAATU
                         All you have to do now is substitute 
                         this expression--
                              (pointing to a specific 
                              place)
                         --at this point.

               Impressed and interested, Barnhardt tugs at his chin as he 
               studies and weighs the results.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (slowly, thoughtfully)
                         Yes -- that will reproduce the first-
                         order terms. But what about the effect 
                         of the other terms?

                                     KLAATU
                         Almost negligible... With variation 
                         of parameters, this is the answer.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         How can you be so sure? Have you 
                         tested this theory?

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a slight smile)
                         I find it works well enough to get 
                         me from one planet to another.
                              (Barnhardt stares at 
                              him blankly)
                         I understand you've called a meeting 
                         to study our space ship.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         As though unsure of what he's heard) 
                         Yes -- yes, I have.

                                     KLAATU
                         My name is Klaatu.
                              (noting that 
                              Barnhardt's expression 
                              is changing from 
                              amazement to 
                              incredulity)
                         I spent two days at your Walter Reed 
                         Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name 
                         was Major White -- and I had a very 
                         attractive nurse called Ruth, who's 
                         getting married next Wednesday.
                              (Klaatu waits for 
                              this to sink in, 
                              then speaks with 
                              quiet authority)
                         If you are not interested -- or if 
                         you intend to turn me over to your 
                         Army -- we needn't waste any more 
                         time.

               Barnhardt hesitates for a long, thoughtful moment. Then he 
               goes to the door, opens it and speaks to the Captain outside.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (to the Captain, his 
                              voice a little 
                              unsteady)
                         You can go now, Captain. Please thank 
                         General Cutler and tell him -- tell 
                         him that I know this gentleman.

               Barnhardt closes the door and turns to find Klaatu watching 
               him with a faint smile. Barnhardt sinks into a chair, trying 
               to adjust his mind.

                                     KLAATU
                              (dryly)
                         You have faith, Professor Barnhardt

                                     BARNHARDT
                         It isn't faith that makes good 
                         science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.
                              (unable to conceal 
                              his interest)
                         Sit down, please. I have several 
                         thousand questions to ask you.

                                     KLAATU
                              (ignoring the 
                              invitation)
                         I would like to explain something of 
                         my mission here.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         That was my first question.

                                     KLAATU
                              (with some bitterness)
                         It was my intention to discuss this 
                         officially -- with all the nations 
                         of the Earth -- but I was not allowed 
                         the Opportunity. I have come to 
                         realize since that your mutual fears 
                         and suspicions are merely the normal 
                         reactions of a primitive society.
                              (gathering his thoughts)
                         We know from scientific observation 
                         that you have discovered a rudimentary 
                         kind of atomic energy. We also know 
                         that you are experimenting with 
                         rockets.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Yes -- that is true.

                                     KLAATU
                         In the hands of a mature civilization, 
                         these would not be considered weapons 
                         of aggression. But in the hands of 
                         your people--
                              (he shrugs and shakes 
                              his head)
                         We've observed your aggressive 
                         tendencies, and we don't trust you 
                         with such power.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (puzzled)
                         If you mean that you are afraid of 
                         us--

                                     KLAATU
                              (with cool impressive 
                              emphasis)
                         We want to be sure you don't make -- 
                         let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. 
                         We know the potentiality of these 
                         developments and we are disturbed to 
                         find them in the hands of children... 
                         You see, we've had atomic energy for 
                         five thousand of your years.
                              (indicating the 
                              telephone)
                         We discarded instruments like this 
                         many centuries ago.
                              (he paces thoughtfully)
                         So long as you were limited to 
                         fighting among yourselves -- with 
                         your primitive tanks and planes -- 
                         we were unconcerned. But soon you 
                         will apply atomic energy to space 
                         ships -- and then you become a threat 
                         to the peace and security of other 
                         planets. That, of course, we cannot 
                         tolerate.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (thoughtful and 
                              impressed)
                         These other planets -- do they have 
                         peace and security?

                                     KLAATU
                         We had our atomic wars -- thousands 
                         of years ago.
                              (he smiles wryly)
                         After that we fought with bows and 
                         arrows. Then, slowly, we learned 
                         that fighting is no solution -- that 
                         aggression leads to chaos.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (with deep conviction)
                         We scientists understand this. Even 
                         we primitive scientists.
                              (Straightforwardly)
                         What exactly is the nature of your 
                         mission, Mr. Klaatu?

                                     KLAATU
                         I came here to warn you that, by 
                         threatening danger, your planet faces 
                         danger -- very grave danger. I am 
                         prepared, however, to offer a 
                         solution.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Would you care to be more specific?

                                     KLAATU
                              (evenly)
                         What I have to say must be said to 
                         all concerned.
                              (with a suggestion of 
                              deference to Barnhardt)
                         It is too important to be entrusted 
                         to any individual.

               Barnhardt is forced reluctantly to accept Klaatu's refusal 
               to go any further. After a moment's thought, he speaks 
               seriously, but with a twinkle in his eye.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         I gather that your efforts on the 
                         official level were not entirely 
                         successful.

                                     KLAATU
                              (sternly, as this 
                              unpleasant episode 
                              is recalled)
                         I come to you as a last resort -- 
                         and I confess that my patience is 
                         wearing thin.
                              (with Jovian annoyance)
                         Must I take drastic action in order 
                         to get a hearing?

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (uneasily)
                         What -- what sort of action do you 
                         mean?

                                     KLAATU
                         Violent action -- since that seems 
                         to be the only thing you people 
                         understand.
                              (quietly)
                         Leveling the island of Manhattan, 
                         perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of 
                         Gibraltar into the sea.

               Barnhardt stands staring at him for a moment, passes his 
               hand across his brow. Then, as Klaatu watches, Barnhardt 
               paces the floor, trying to digest what he has heard. After a 
               moment, he turns to Klaatu.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Would you be willing to meet with 
                         the group of scientists I am calling 
                         together?. Perhaps you could explain 
                         your mission to them, and they in 
                         turn could present it to their various 
                         peoples.

                                     KLAATU
                              (quietly, evenly)
                         That's what I came to see you about.

               Barnhardt flings him a glance, then looks momentarily 
               sheepish. But his own eagerness carries him on. He paces the 
               floor thoughtfully.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         It is not enough to have men of 
                         science. We scientists are too easily 
                         ignored -- or misunderstood. We must 
                         get important men from every field. 
                         Educators -- philosophers -- church 
                         leaders -- men of vision and 
                         imagination -- the finest minds in 
                         the world.

                                     KLAATU
                         I leave that in your hands.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         You'd have no objection to revealing 
                         yourself at this meeting?

                                     KLAATU
                         No -- not at all.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         What about your personal safety in 
                         the meantime? What about the Army -- 
                         and the police?

                                     KLAATU
                         My name is Carpenter and I'm a very 
                         earthy character living in a 
                         respectable boarding house.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (smiling, but a little 
                              concerned)
                         I'm afraid I can't offer you any 
                         real protection. I have no influence 
                         in cases of inter-planetary 
                         conspiracy.

                                     KLAATU
                         I'm sure I'll be quite safe until 
                         the meeting.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (he suddenly pauses, 
                              thoughtfully)
                         One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this 
                         group should reject your proposals. 
                         What is the alternative?

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a sense of quiet, 
                              inescapable power)
                         I'm afraid you have no alternative. 
                         In such, a case the planet Earth 
                         would have to be--
                              (he looks for the 
                              right word)
                         --eliminated.

               The implications of this statement leave Barnhardt speechless, 
               his keen mind reeling.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Such power exists?

                                     KLAATU
                         I assure you such power exists.

               Barnhardt stands silent for a moment, trying to collect his 
               shattered thoughts. Klaatu watches him as he starts pacing 
               again.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         The people who came to the meeting 
                         must be made to realize this. They 
                         must understand what is at stake.
                              (after a thoughtful 
                              moment, he looks up)
                         You mentioned a demonstration of 
                         force--

                                     KLAATU
                         Yes.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Would such, a demonstration be 
                         possible before the meeting?

                                     KLAATU
                         Yes -- of course.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Something that would dramatize for 
                         them and for their people the 
                         seriousness of the situation. 
                         Something that would affect the entire 
                         planet.

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a nod)
                         That can easily be arranged.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (frightened by his 
                              easy assumption of 
                              infinite power)
                         I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- 
                         or destroy anything.

                                     KLAATU
                              (easily)
                         Why don't you leave it to me? I'll 
                         think of something.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (with a nervous half-
                              smile)
                         Maybe a little demonstration.

                                     KLAATU
                              (thinking about it)
                         Something dramatic -- but not 
                         destructive.
                              (intellectually amused)
                         It's quite an interesting problem.
                              (Barnhardt nods vaguely)
                         Would day after tomorrow be all right? 
                         Say about noon?

               Klaatu's bland manner leaves Barnhardt shaken, almost wishing 
               he'd never started this business.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               INT. LIVING ROOM - BOARDINGHOUSE - NIGHT

               It is about 3:30 the following evening. Helen is sitting in 
               a chair leafing through a magazine. She is dressed to go 
               out. A corner of the dining room can be seen, where Mr. and 
               Mrs. Barley are playing cards with Mr. Krull. Mrs. Crockett, 
               the landlady, enters from the hall on her way to the dining 
               room and notices Helen.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                         Going out, dear?

                                     HELEN
                         Yes, I'm waiting for Tom to pick me 
                         up.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                              (with a shudder)
                         Personally, I won't go out after 
                         dark these days.
                              (with an attempt at 
                              slyness)
                         But then -- I'm not courting, am I?

               She turns to go on into the dining room and as she does so 
               almost bumps into Klaatu who is coming out, having been 
               kibitzing the card game.

                                     MRS. CROCKETT
                              (thoroughly startled)
                         Oh -- Mr. Carpenter--!

               Klaatu steps aside as she hurries nervously into the dining 
               room. He turns, puzzled, to find Helen watching with a slight 
               smile.

                                     KLAATU
                         Everyone seems so--
                              (he shakes his hands 
                              to indicate 
                              nervousness)

                                     HELEN
                         Jittery is the word.

               Helen watches him, a little uneasy in his presence. She is 
               fond of him, and she can't help being curious and concerned 
               about his brush with the police.

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a contemplative 
                              smile)
                         Bobby's the only person I know who 
                         isn't -- Jittery.

                                     HELEN
                         He has his homework to keep him 
                         occupied.

                                     KLAATU
                              (fondly, sincerely)
                         He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.

                                     HELEN
                         Naturally I think so.

                                     KLAATU
                         Warm and friendly and intelligent--
                              (thoughtfully)
                         You know -- he's the only real friend 
                         I've made since I've been here.

               Helen is deeply moved by Klaatu's affection for the boy, She 
               tried to dismiss her curiosity about him, but she can't. She 
               decides to face it.

                                     HELEN
                              (hesitantly and with 
                              some difficulty)
                         Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my 
                         business, but -- why did that 
                         detective come here last night?

                                     KLAATU
                              (with easy frankness)
                         Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a 
                         few questions. Bobby and I tried to 
                         see Professor Barnhardt in the 
                         afternoon, but he wasn't in. 
                         Apparently they thought I was looking 
                         for secrets of some kind.

               Helen has reacted in puzzlement at this second mention of 
               Barnhardt. They are interrupted by the ringing of the 
               doorbell. Helen goes to answer it.

               INT. HALLWAY

               as Helen opens the front door to admit Tom. He appears 
               impatient, anxious to get going.

                                     HELEN
                         Hello--

                                     TOM
                         You ready?

                                     HELEN
                         I will be in just a minute.

                                     TOM
                              (a little annoyed 
                              that she hasn't her 
                              coat on, he consults 
                              his watch)
                         The picture starts at eight-fifty.

                                     HELEN
                              (in explanation)
                         I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.

                                     TOM
                              (lightly, but with 
                              real sarcasm 
                              underneath)
                         I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm 
                         intruding.

               Helen tries to shush him, to indicate Klaatu is in the next 
               room, when Klaatu appears in the doorway. He must have heard 
               Tom's remark, and there is an awkward moment. Klaatu is 
               completely unperturbed, but Helen is embarrassed.

                                     KLAATU
                         Excuse me. I was just going up to my 
                         room.

                                     HELEN
                              (guiltily)
                         Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.

               Klaatu stops and turns to face them pleasantly.

                                     KLAATU
                         Have a good time -- both of you.

               He goes on up the stairs. Helen steers Tom toward the living 
               room.

                                     HELEN
                         Why don't you wait in here while I 
                         get my things?

               INT. LIVING ROOM

               As they enter from the hall, Helen turns to Tom reproachfully.

                                     HELEN
                              (quietly)
                         Oh, Tom, that was awful.

                                     TOM
                              (momentary apologetic)
                         I'm sorry. I guess I'm just tired of 
                         hearing about Mr. Carpenter.
                              (Helen shushes him)
                         I don't like the way he's attached 
                         himself to you and Bobby. After all, 
                         what do you know about him?

               This touches on Helen's own private doubts, and she cannot 
               answer.

                                     HELEN
                         I'll go get my things.

               She turns quickly and goes into the hall and hurries up the 
               stairs. Tom looks after her, dismissing the matter with a 
               shake of the head and a philosophical sigh. Of such stuff 
               are women made.

               INT - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

               Helen reaches the top of the stairs, crosses to her room and 
               grabs a coat off the bed. She's putting it on as she moves 
               down the hall to Bobby's room, the door of which is open.

               INT. BOBBY'S ROOM

               Bobby is at a table doing his homework and Klaatu has just 
               finished explaining an arithmetic problem to him, as Helen 
               enters, still putting on her coat.

                                     KLAATU
                              (about to leave)
                         All you have to remember is, first 
                         find the common denominator -- then 
                         subtract.

                                     BOBBY
                         Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.

                                     KLAATU
                              (to Helen, pleasantly)
                         I'll say goodnight again.

               Helen is embarrassed. She would like to apologize for the 
               awkwardness downstairs but she doesn't quite know how to go 
               about it.

                                     HELEN
                         Mr. Carpenter, I--
                              (it's too complicated; 
                              she can't do it)
                         Goodnight.

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a warm smile of 
                              complete understanding 
                              and appreciation)
                         Goodnight, my dear.

               He turns and goes out, closing the door. A little distracted, 
               Helen turns to Bobby.

                                     HELEN
                         Go to bed, darling. You can finish 
                         that in the morning.

                                     BOBBY
                         Okay.

               Helen watches as he starts to put away his work. She wants 
               to tell him something, but finds it difficult to say.

                                     HELEN
                              (hesitantly, almost 
                              guiltily)
                         Bobby -- I think it would be better 
                         if we didn't see quite so much of 
                         Mr. Carpenter

                                     BOBBY
                              (shocked, and 
                              bewildered)
                         Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... 
                         And he's awful good in arithmetic. 
                         He even helps Professor Barnhardt.

                                     HELEN
                         Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go 
                         to see Professor Barnhardt?

                                     BOBBY
                         Sure we did! He wasn't there but we 
                         went to see him. And Mr. Carpenter 
                         showed him how to do his arithmetic.

               Helen is surprised to get this corroboration for Klaatu's 
               story. Sensing his mother's uneasiness, the boy looks for 
               something intriguing -- some deep, dark secret.

                                     BOBBY
                              (shrewdly)
                         Mom -- is there something wrong with 
                         Mr. Carpenter?

                                     HELEN
                         What do you mean, dear?

                                     BOBBY
                         I mean -- on account of that policeman 
                         last night.
                              (his eyes light up 
                              hopefully)
                         You think he's a bank robber, maybe? 
                         Or a gangster?

                                     HELEN
                         No, dear, of course not. He's a very 
                         nice man. I Just think he might prefer 
                         to be left alone. Now you get to bed 
                         and forget about it.
                              (she kisses him)
                         'Night, darling.

               With a reassuring smile, she starts for the door.

                                     BOBBY
                         Goodnight.
                              (stopping her in the 
                              doorway, his 
                              imaginative suspicions 
                              mounting)
                         Hey Mom -- why would he want to be 
                         alone?

               Not wanting to go into this any further, Helen blows him a 
               kiss and backs out, closing the door. Bobby stands thinking 
               for a moment, his mind still speculating on all sorts of 
               wonderful possibilities. Still preoccupied, he drifts over 
               to his bed and sits down to take of his shoes. He drops the 
               first one to the floor and is starting on the other, when 
               there is a light rap on his door. The door opens and Klaatu 
               appears.

                                     KLAATU
                         Bobby -- have you a flashlight?

                                     BOBBY
                              (surprised by his 
                              appearance and his 
                              request)
                         Yeah -- sure.
                              (he goes to a drawer 
                              and gets a large 
                              hand flashlight)
                         It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.

               Bobby hands him the light, studying his face with eager 
               curiosity.

                                     BOBBY
                         What do you want it for, Mr. 
                         Carpenter?

                                     KLAATU
                              (evasively)
                         Why -- the light in my room went 
                         out.
                              (cutting off further 
                              questions)
                         Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.

               Klaatu goes out, closing the door behind him. Bobby hesitates 
               a moment, puzzled and curious. Then he goes over to the door, 
               flips off the lights, and slowly, noiselessly opens the door 
               a crack so he can peer out into the hall.

               MED. SHOT

               shooting down the hall through the crack in Bobby's door.

               Klaatu's door is ajar and through it the lights in his room 
               can be seen burning brightly. Klaatu goes to his door, reaches 
               in and flips off the lights and closes the door. He then 
               scans the hall in both directions. Satisfied he isn't seen, 
               he moves surreptitiously down the hall toward the stairs, 
               still carrying the flashlight.

               MED CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

               as he closes his door carefully, an expression of intense 
               excitement on his face. What he has seem is certainly, 
               unmistakably suspicious. Why did Mr. Carpenter lie to him? 
               What does he want the flashlight for and where is he going? 
               Bobby decides he's got to find out. Hurriedly he laces on 
               the shoe he had taken off, and peers out the door to find 
               the hall clear. He slips out the door, closing it behind 
               him.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. STREET - MED. CLOSE SHOT - NIGHT

               Klaatu is walking down the dark, semi-deserted street with 
               the determined stride of a man with a definite objective.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

               Half a block behind, he's following Klaatu, eagerly, flushed 
               with a sense of excitement and adventure.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER - NIGHT

               Walking along the sidewalk, Klaatu turns into a side street, 
               disappearing from view around the corner. In a moment, Bobby 
               hurries into scene breathlessly. He pulls up for a moment to 
               rest. Then, getting his breath, he dashes on around the corner 
               after Klaatu.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. LARGE TEMPORARY BUILDING - LONG SHOT - NIGHT

               This is a temporary structure that has been erected to enclose 
               the space ship and Gort. In front of the one small door are 
               two soldiers, standing guard. Concealed in some foreground 
               foliage, studying the layout, is Klaatu. Nearby 's a sign 
               reading: KEEP OUT! This area OFF LIMITS to the public. U.S. 
               ARMY.

               CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

               He is a short distance away, watching Klaatu eagerly.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               as he studies the situation.

               MED. SHOT

               shooting over Klaatu's shoulder. As he watches, a Jeep filled 
               with armed soldiers -- apparently regular patrol -- drives 
               up to the entrance of the building. They stop for a moment 
               while their Sergeant checks with the guards. Assured that 
               everything is under control, the Sergeant signals his driver 
               and the Jeep moves off.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               Scanning the side of the building, he sees what he's looking 
               for. Waiting until the Jeep disappears, he starts toward one 
               side of the building, keeping himself concealed in the 
               foliage.

               CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

               puzzled and interested, as he watches Klaatu.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               The two sentries standing in front of the building.

               MED. SHOT

               as Klaatu maneuvers around the side of the building, where 
               there is a window. It has no glass in it but is heavily 
               barred.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               as he leaves the concealing foliage and crosses the clear, 
               grassy area surrounding the building. He stops and tries to 
               see through the window.

               MED. SHOT - GORT

               shooting through the barred window into the building. The 
               huge robot looms large and eerie in the shadows cast by a 
               couple of naked work-lights. His head is angled, away from 
               the window.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               as Klaatu approaches the window. Aiming his flashlight at 
               Gort, he flashes the light intermittently, as though 
               signaling. (This should not approximate any known code.)

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               As we watch, the intermittent flashes of Klaatu's light appear 
               on the wall ahead of Gort. Slowly, evenly, the robot's head 
               turns to face the window.

               MED. SHOT

               from Gort's viewpoint, of the window, with Klaatu's light 
               flashing its signals.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               shooting on his back, as he finishes signaling and cuts off 
               the flashlight. He turns ant starts back for the concealment 
               of the foliage.

               CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

               craning his neck to look for Klaatu, who has eluded his view. 
               Suddenly he sees Klaatu again.

               MED. SHOT - KLAATU

               making his way behind the foliage toward the front of the 
               building. Arriving at a point opposite the entrance, Klaatu 
               waits and watches.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - ENTRANCE TO BUILDING

               The two guards are standing in the doorway in positions of 
               relaxed alertness. Suddenly, inside the building behind them, 
               the giant figure of Gort looms silently in the doorway. His 
               two great arms reach out, grab the two guards and drag then 
               back inside the building.

               CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

               He lets out an inaudible gasp as he sees this. Bug-eyed, he 
               glances quickly to the point where he last saw Klaatu. He is 
               amazed at what he sees.

               MED. SHOT

               from Bobby's viewpoint. Klaatu has emerged from the 
               concealment of the tree-lined path and is making his way 
               calmly toward the entrance of the building.

               CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

               As he watches Klaatu enter the building, his curiosity 
               conquers his fear and he starts tremblingly toward the 
               structure.

               INT. BUILDING - FULL SHOT

               as Klaatu enters. The huge shapes of the space ship and Gort 
               loom large and eerie. Klaatu starts across the barren 
               enclosure toward the ship.

               EXT. ENTRANCE TO BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT

               as Bobby approaches the door, fearful but fascinated. He 
               peers cautiously inside and his eyes grow wide as saucers.

               EXT. BUILDING - MED. SHOT

               In *f.g., near the door, the two guards lie unconscious. As 
               Klaatu walks toward the ship Gort slowly turns his head to 
               follow him with him with eyes. Klaatu touches a point on the 
               unbroken surface of the ship and the ramp silently swings 
               out and down to the ground. Klaatu mounts the ramp and 
               disappears inside the ship, whereupon the ramp silently 
               closes.

               CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY

               as he watches this; his eyes bulging. He can scarcely believe 
               what he has seen. Suddenly a wave of sheer terror sweeps 
               over him. Scrambling to his feet, he turns and runs wildly 
               away.

               INT. SMALL CORRIDOR - SPACE SHIP

               CAMERA FOLLOWS Klaatu as he moves down the tiny, dimly lighted 
               entrance corridor. He steps into the main cabin of the ship 
               and flips a switch which bathes the cabin in a diffused, 
               shadowless light. The walls are lined with a complex of 
               mysterious gadgetry -- knobs, dials, indicators, etc. All of 
               this should be as imaginative and unorthodox as possible, 
               while still retaining a feeling of sound but highly advanced 
               engineering.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               as Klaatu moves to the communications panel, flipping switches 
               and turning dials. Indicators light up. There are crackling, 
               whirring and buzzing sounds. Klaatu starts speaking into a 
               built-in microphone in his own strange language. He speaks 
               in rapid-fire explanation, continuing to talk, as we--

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BUILDING - MED. SHOT - NIGHT

               as Klaatu walks calmly away from the ship, past the two 
               unconscious guards and disappears out of the door.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT THE TWO GUARDS

               as one of them slowly regains consciousness. Looking around, 
               he sees the great figure of Gort and is terror-stricken. He 
               shakes his companion frantically in an effort to bring him 
               to.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. LIVING ROOM BOARDINGHOUSE NIGHT

               Bobby is curled up in a chair waiting for his mother to come 
               home. He's sleepy, but the excitement of what he has seen 
               precluded any such possibility. From the hall we hear the 
               front door opening as Helen and Tom come in.

                                     HELEN'S VOICE
                              (off scene)
                         Why don't you come on in for a minute?

               Helen and Tom appear in the doorway, Helen is startled to 
               see Bobby, who has Jumped up and run toward her.

                                     HELEN
                         Bobby--! What are you doing up at 
                         this hour?

                                     BOBBY
                              (excitedly)
                         I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had 
                         to tell you!

                                     HELEN
                         Tell me what?

                                     BOBBY
                              (the words tadpole 
                              out breathlessly)
                         I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right 
                         after you left -- and, gee, Mom, 
                         where do you think he went? Right 
                         into the space ship!

                                     HELEN
                              (patiently disbelieving)
                         Now, Bobby, just a minute--

                                     BOBBY
                         Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened 
                         up and he walked right in. And that 
                         great big iron man was moving around!

                                     HELEN
                         Bobby, you've been dreaming again.

                                     BOBBY
                              (desperately)
                         No, I haven't, Mom. I promise you... 
                         I saw it!

               Helen and Tom exchange a glance of tolerant amusement.

                                     TOM
                         Where did you see all this, Bobby?

                                     BOBBY
                         On the lawn down at the mall -- in 
                         that place with the soldiers out 
                         front.

                                     TOM
                              (trying to trap him)
                         Where were the soldiers all this 
                         time?

                                     BOBBY
                         That robot fella grabbed 'em and 
                         dragged 'em inside!
                              (his lips trembling)
                         I like Mr. Carpenter -- but I'm 
                         scared, Mom.

               He rushes into Helen's arms, clutching her desperately, trying 
               to hold back his tears.

                                     HELEN
                              (holding him close to 
                              her sympathetically)
                         Mustn't be frightened, darling -- It 
                         was just a bad dream. Here -- we'll 
                         prove it to you.
                              (with a look and a 
                              nod to Tom)
                         Tom, will you ask Mr. Carpenter if 
                         he'll come down for a minute.
                              (Tom turns to go)
                         The room right opposite mine.

               Nodding, Tom disappears into the hall and up the stairs. 
               Still holding Bobby, Helen tries to dispel his fears by an 
               appeal to logic.

                                     HELEN
                         Now think back hard. You didn't follow 
                         Mr. Carpenter at all, did you? You 
                         haven't even been out of the house.

                                     BOBBY
                         Yes, I have!

                                     HELEN
                              (determinedly)
                         You didn't really see the space ship. 
                         You just thought you did.

               Bitterly hurt, Bobby faces his mother gravely, accusingly.

                                     BOBBY
                         I'd never call you a liar.

               Tom is knocking softly at Klaatu's door. Getting no answer, 
               he tries the door, pushes it open and peers in. Then he steps 
               into the darkened room.

               INT. KLAATU'S ROOM - FULL SHOT

               Tom snaps on the light and looks around the empty room. The 
               bed is still made. Glancing around, Tom's eye is caught by a 
               flash of something bright on the floor below the dresser. He 
               stoops down and picks up a fair-sized diamond. Tom studies 
               the stone curiously, holding it up to the light. Thoroughly 
               puzzled, he keeps the stone in his hand, switches off the 
               light and goes out.

               UPSTAIRS HALL - MED. SHOT

               Closing the door, Tom hurries along the hall and down the 
               stairs

               INT. LIVING ROOM - FULL SHOT

               Through the hall door Tom can be seen coming down the stairs. 
               Helen and Bobby watch expectantly as he enters.

                                     TOM
                         He's not there.
                              (crossing to Helen)
                         But look what I found in his room

                                     HELEN
                              (takes the stone and 
                              studies it, amazed 
                              by its size)
                         Is it real?

                                     TOM
                              (with the shrug of an 
                              amateur)
                         Looks real to me.

                                     BOBBY
                         Mr. Carpenter's got a lot of diamonds.
                              (he digs into his 
                              pocket)
                         He gave me a couple of them.

               Helen takes the two diamonds Bobby holds out in his hand, 
               looking at them in amazement.

                                     HELEN
                         He gave these to you?

                                     BOBBY
                              (guilty for his own 
                              sharp dealing)
                         Well, not exactly. I gave him two 
                         dollars.

                                     TOM
                         This doesn't make sense... I think 
                         the guy's a crook. I never did trust 
                         him.

               Helen tries to shush Tom, not wanting to re-stimulate Bobby's 
               imagination, but it's too late.

                                     BOBBY
                         Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a 
                         diamond smuggler?

                                     HELEN
                              (firmly)
                         Come on, darling -- we're going up 
                         to bed.

                                     TOM
                         I wonder if we ought to--

                                     HELEN
                              (cutting him off with 
                              a look)
                         Bobby and I have had enough excitement 
                         for tonight.

                                     TOM
                              (seriously concerned)
                         You think it's all right for you to 
                         stay here?

                                     HELEN
                              (nods reassuringly)
                         I've got a good lock on my door.
                              (smiling at Bobby)
                         And Bobby's going to sleep in my 
                         room tonight.

                                     BOBBY
                         Oh, boy -- can I, Mom?

                                     HELEN
                         Yes, dear. Come on now.
                              (she happens to look 
                              down at his feet. 
                              Puzzled, and 
                              concerned, she feels 
                              his shoes)
                         Bobby, your shoes are soaking!

                                     BOBBY
                              (reluctantly, with 
                              childish guilt)
                         Yeah -- the grass was kind of wet.

               As the impact of this sinks in, Helen and Tom turn to stare 
               at each other in questioning consternation.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               INT. OFFICE - DEPT. OF COMMERCE BLDG. - MED. CLOSE SHOT DAY

               It is a typical government office, with lots of desks in it. 
               Helen is at her desk, straightening it up to go to lunch. 
               This done, she moves briskly to get her coat. CAMERA PANS to 
               follow her and suddenly, startlingly reveals Klaatu standing 
               near the clothes rack, as though he had materialized out of 
               thin air. Helen is thoroughly startled.

                                     HELEN
                              (unnerved)
                         Oh -- hello--

                                     KLAATU
                         May I see you for a minute?

                                     HELEN
                         I -- I was Just going to lunch.

                                     KLAATU
                              (quietly insistent)
                         May I walk out with you?

               She is nervous and uneasy but obviously can't refuse. The 
               telephone on her desk rings and Helen turns to answer it.

                                     HELEN
                              (into phone)
                         Mrs. Benson speaking.
                              (recognizing the voice, 
                              she glances nervously 
                              at Klaatu)
                         Oh, hello...

               INT. JEWELRY SHOP - MED. CLOSE SHOT

               It's a rather swank shop. Tom is standing at the counter 
               phoning. The Jeweler is behind the counter examining a stone 
               through his eyepiece.

                                     TOM
                              (into phone, cheerily)
                         I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal 
                         on that diamond. I thought we might 
                         have lunch together.

               INT. OFFICE - DEPT. OF COMMERCE - MED. CLOSE SHOT

                                     HELEN
                              (with a nervous glance 
                              at Klaatu)
                         I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right 
                         now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, 
                         that'll be fine. 'Bye.

               She hangs up and smiles uneasily as she rejoins Klaatu and 
               leads the way out into the corridor.

               INT. CORRIDOR - TWO SHOT

               CAMERA MOVES with Helen and Klaatu as they go down the 
               corridor. Klaatu's mood is one of quiet tension.

                                     KLAATU
                              (watching Helen's 
                              reaction)
                         I saw Bobby this morning before he 
                         went to school--

                                     HELEN
                              (glancing at him 
                              apprehensively)
                         Yes--?

                                     KLAATU
                         I want to know what he told you last 
                         night.

                                     HELEN
                              (nervous and evasive)
                         I -- I didn't really pay much 
                         attention--
                              (with a nervous little 
                              laugh)
                         Bobby has such an active imagination.

                                     KLAATU
                              (refusing to be put 
                              off)
                         Did you believe what he told you?
                              (Helen hesitates, 
                              trapped by uncertainty)
                         I have a reason for asking this -- a 
                         very important reason.

               MED. SHOT

               They are approaching the elevator at the end of the corridor. 
               There is a large crowd of lunch-goers milling around the 
               elevator, which is quickly filled. Half the crowd is left as 
               the elevator doors close and it descends.

               TWO SHOT - HELEN AND KLAATU

               Nervous and distracted, Helen doesn't want to get caught up 
               in this jam.

                                     HELEN
                         There's another elevator we can use--

               She nods toward a side corridor and starts for it, Klaatu 
               following.

               MED. SHOT

               CAMERA FOLLOWS them as they turn into the side corridor. 
               Helen leads the way to a small, automatic elevator. She 
               presses the button and the doors open. Klaatu follows her 
               in.

               INT. ELEVATOR

               As Helen presses the first floor button, the doors close and 
               the elevator starts down. She turns to face Klaatu.

                                     HELEN
                              (her nerves raw and 
                              edgy)
                         What is it you want?

                                     KLAATU
                         Before I ask you to be honest with 
                         me, perhaps I should be completely 
                         honest with you--

               Without warning the elevator comes to a jolting, jarring 
               stop as the power is cut off and the lights go out. The car 
               is illuminated faintly and eerily by light that seeps through 
               the ventilating grills from a skylight in the shaft. Helen 
               is terrified.

                                     HELEN
                              (gasping with fright)
                         What happened?

                                     KLAATU
                              (a moment's hesitation; 
                              then he remembers)
                         What time is it?

               Helen fumbles to get her wrist watch into a faint beam of 
               light.

                                     HELEN
                         Just twelve.

                                     KLAATU
                         We'll be stuck here for a little 
                         while -- about thirty minutes.

                                     HELEN
                              (preoccupied with her 
                              own thinking)
                         We could try pushing the other 
                         buttons.
                              (digging in her purse)
                         I have a flashlight in my purse.

                                     KLAATU
                         It won't work.

               Helen has the flashlight out and is snapping it on, but it 
               doesn't work. She looks up at him blankly.

                                     HELEN
                         Why not?

                                     KLAATU
                              (after a moment, 
                              quietly)
                         You see -- the electricity's been 
                         neutralized -- all over the world.

               The impact of this calm, quiet statement is shattering. Helen 
               stares at him awe-struck. Then she speaks numbly, almost 
               inaudibly.

                                     HELEN
                         Bobby was telling the truth -- wasn't 
                         he?

               Klaatu stares at her evenly, as we--

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               MED. SHOT - STREET

               All vehicular traffic in the street is at a dead stop. 
               Automobiles, busses, trolley cars -- all are stalled. Drivers 
               and passengers are climbing out of the vehicles in utter 
               bewilderment. Except for the people, it is as though the 
               street had been frozen in motion.

               The great generators and dynamos are silent and motionless 
               in the dim, unlighted plant.

               INT. FACTORY

               A huge automobile or airplane assembly line, with nothing 
               moving, no machinery going.

               INT. PRESSROOM - METROPOLITAN NEWSPAPER

               The giant presses are threaded with newsprint, but they are 
               silent and motionless.

               INT. CONTROL ROOM - RADIO STATION

               A couple of engineers are working feverishly over a huge and 
               complicated control panel. They are working by the light of 
               two incongruous and ineffectual candles.

               INT. NEW YORK SUBWAY KIOSK

               People carne pouring up the stairs wildly, feverishly anxious 
               to escape the darkness below. Their eyes blink weakly in the 
               unaccustomed sunlight.

               EXT. SHOT - NEW YORK STREET

               Cars, taxis and busses are stalled, their frenzied drivers 
               unable to figure out what's happened. A junk peddler with a 
               broken-down horse and wagon moves grandly and leisurely 
               through the stalled vehicles. The peddler bears a happy grin 
               of superiority. This is his moment of triumph over modern 
               civilization.

               of two cab drivers whose taxis have stalled beside each other 
               in traffic. One has gotten out of his cab. The other is seated 
               at his wheel, looking around in awe and terror, his tough 
               Manhattan heart shaken.

                                     CAB DRIVER
                         My ol' lady was right. We shoulda 
                         got a place in the country.

               standing on the sidewalk, awe-struck at the weird sight before 
               them. One of them speaks in terror, hardly daring to 
               articulate his thoughts.

                                     COCKNEY
                         It's that space man -- that's wot it 
                         is.

               They are an elderly couple. Staring bug-eyed at the strange 
               street scene, the woman mutters some terror-stricken comment 
               in Russian.

               She is middle-aged and there are tears of fright in her eyes. 
               She is mumbling a prayer in French.

               INT. BARNHARDT'S STUDY - DAY

               Barnhardt is seated comfortably at his desk with a book on 
               his lap. He has been interrupted by the entrance of Hilda, 
               his secretary. At the moment she`s beside herself with 
               excitement. Barnhardt watches her with a half-smile of secret 
               amusement. He has already deduced the cause of what's 
               happening.

                                     HILDA
                         You should see it, Professor 
                         Barnhardt! You should go out and see 
                         it for yourself!

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here.

                                     HILDA
                         The whole city has stopped. People 
                         are running around like ants!

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (musing admiringly on 
                              Klaatu's cleverness)
                         What a brilliant idea. I never would 
                         have thought of it.

               Hilda flings him a questioning look, annoyed that he won't 
               share her excitement.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         What about the people who are coming 
                         to the meeting tonight? Have they 
                         all arrived?

                                     HILDA
                              (nodding)
                         I talked to most of them this 
                         morning... They were all very curious 
                         about the meeting.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Good. Did you speak to our friend 
                         Mr. Carpenter?

                                     HILDA
                              (nodding)
                         He'll be there at 8:30.

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (studying her for a 
                              moment)
                         Tell me, Hilda -- does all this 
                         frighten you -- does it make you 
                         feel insecure?

                                     HILDA
                         Yes, sir -- it certainly does!

                                     BARNHARDT
                              (nodding with a bland 
                              little smile)
                         That's good, Hilda. I'm glad.

               The poor woman flings him a look of shocked amazement as we--

               INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - PENTAGON BLDG. - DAY

               Seated at a conference table are high-ranking officers of 
               the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps. There is the 
               uneasy tension of people dealing with unknown forces. An 
               Army Major General, who's Chairman of the meeting, is 
               speaking.

                                     GENERAL
                         --as far as we can tell, all power's 
                         been cut off everywhere -- with a 
                         few exceptions: hospitals, planes in 
                         flight -- that sort of thing. I wish 
                         I could be more specific but, as you 
                         now, all communications are out 
                         telephone, radio, cable -- everything.
                              (gravely)
                         I can tell you that the President is 
                         prepared to declare a state of 
                         national emergency.
                              (pausing to let this 
                              sink in)
                         Before we start discussing plans, I 
                         want a report from Colonel Ryder. 
                         What about the robot, Colonel?

               Ryder is a Colonel of engineers, a man about forty-five.

                                     COLONEL RYDER
                         When it was discovered last night 
                         that the robot had moved, I was 
                         directed by the Joint Chiefs to find 
                         a means of immobilizing him. We 
                         accomplished that this morning by 
                         encasing him in a block of KL 93.
                              (he hands a small 
                              block of plastic to 
                              the General)
                         It's a new plastic material -- 
                         stronger than steel.

                                     GENERAL
                         Is it possible that he's broken out 
                         of this stuff?

                                     COLONEL
                         No, sir. I've Just checked on that. 
                         He's locked up tight as a drum.

                                     GENERAL
                         All right -- that means we concentrate 
                         on the man.
                              (to the group with 
                              force and authority)
                         Up till now we've agreed on the 
                         desirability of capturing this man 
                         alive. We can no longer afford to be 
                         so particular. We'll get him alive, 
                         if possible -- but we must get him!
                              (eyes the group sternly)
                         Is that clear?

               INT. JEWELRY SHOP - MED. CLOSE SHOT - TOM AND JEWELER

               The shop and its glittering display cases, which were 
               brilliantly lighted in the previous scene, are now gloomy 
               and dim. All artificial light is off. The Jeweler is a bright-
               eyed old man of seventy with a middle European accent. He is 
               completely fascinated as he examines the diamond Tom has 
               given him, and is annoyed by the lack of light. He speaks 
               impatiently to one of the girls in the shop who happens to 
               pass by.

                                     JEWELER
                         Eleanor, did you call the electrician?

                                     GIRL
                              (she's not too bright)
                         I tried, Mr. Bleeker. But the phone 
                         doesn't work, either.

                                     JEWELER
                              (absently, as he 
                              studies the stone)
                         Well, call the phone company.

                                     GIRL
                              (plaintively)
                         But the phone doesn't work.

               The Jeweler gives her a preoccupied glance of annoyance and 
               turns back to the stone.

                                     TOM
                         Is it worth anything?

                                     JEWELER
                         I have never seen such a stone. Will 
                         you please tell me where it came 
                         from?

                                     TOM
                         That's what I wanted you to tell me.

                                     JEWELER
                              (overwhelmed and 
                              absorbed by the stone, 
                              he shakes his head, 
                              bewildered)
                         There are no diamonds like this -- 
                         any place in the world.

               Impressed by the import of what the man is saying, Tom's 
               mind is racing wildly.

                                     TOM
                         You sure about that?

                                     JEWELER
                              (eagerly, shrewdly)
                         Would you like to sell it?

                                     TOM
                              (picking up the stone)
                         No -- no, thanks.

                                     JEWELER
                         I'd give you a very good price.

               Preoccupied with his own excited thoughts, Tom has already 
               started for the door.

               INT. ELEVATOR - TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND HELEN

               In the dim light of the stalled elevator, Klaatu is finishing 
               explaining to Helen the story of his mission. Overwhelmed by 
               the staggering import of what he has told her, Helen is 
               listening with great interest and concern.

                                     KLAATU
                              (speaking gravely)
                         --I've already told you more than I 
                         told Professor Barnhardt, because my 
                         life, in a sense, is in your hands. 
                         I thought if you knew the facts you'd 
                         appreciate the importance of my not 
                         being -- apprehended, -- before the 
                         meeting tonight.

               Helen is staring at him in awe, but also in complete 
               admiration and sympathy.

                                     HELEN
                         Yes, of course. Of course I do.

               Klaatu smiles at her warmly and she manages to return the 
               smile. Their relationship is further cemented by the sharing 
               of this vital secret.

                                     HELEN
                              (studying his face 
                              anxiously)
                         You hold great hope for this meeting.

                                     KLAATU
                         I can see no other hope for your 
                         planet. If the meeting should fail, 
                         then I'm afraid there is no hope.

               Suddenly and without warning, the elevator starts moving and 
               the lights go on. Startled, Helen looks at him.

                                     KLAATU
                              (calmly)
                         It must be twelve-thirty.

                                     HELEN
                              (looks at her watch, 
                              then back at him, 
                              awe-struck)
                         Yes -- Just exactly.

               STREET - MED. SHOT - DAY

               Showing a section of street traffic as it comes back to life. 
               From everywhere comes the sound of self-starters. Trolley 
               bells start clanging. Then automobile horns. People climb 
               back into there vehicles and traffic starts to move.

               SERIES OF CUTS

               of other streets, as the strident sounds of traffic build up 
               and normalcy is regained.

               INT. LOBBY - DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE BLDG - MED. SHOT - DAY

               as Helen and Klaatu come out of the elevator and start across 
               the lobby, CAMERA HOLDING ON THEM. Helen is preoccupied with 
               concern for Klaatu's safety.

                                     HELEN
                         Where are you going now?

                                     KLAATU
                         Back to the boardinghouse. I'll be 
                         safe there for the afternoon -- and 
                         I can keep an eye on Bobby. He's the 
                         only other person who knows anything 
                         about--

               This recalls to Helen something she had forgotten and she 
               stops in sudden concern.

                                     HELEN
                         No, wait a minute -- there's someone 
                         else.

                                     KLAATU
                         Who?

                                     HELEN
                         Tom... He was there last night when 
                         Bobby told me what he saw.

               The look of concern on Klaatu's face heightens Helen's 
               overwhelming fear and uncertainty.

                                     HELEN
                              (worriedly)
                         Of course, he doesn't know anything 
                         definite. He'd talk to me first, 
                         anyway, before--
                              (interrupting herself 
                              in sudden decision)
                         We can't take that chance. I'll get 
                         in touch with him right away and 
                         make sure.

               Helen turns and starts determinedly for the lobby door, 
               followed by Klaatu, as we--

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. TELEPHONE BOOTH

               Helen is nervous and worried as she speaks into the phone.

                                     HELEN
                              (into phone)
                         --But I've got to talk to him. It's 
                         terribly important. When is he coming 
                         back?

               INT. TOM'S OUTER OFFICE - CLOSE SHOT - SECRETARY

               Tom's secretary has not yet recovered from the shock of what 
               has happened to the world.

                                     SECRETARY
                         I don't know, Mrs. Benson. He left 
                         before noon -- before that awful 
                         electric business. I'm scared to 
                         death, Mrs. Benson. I -- No, he 
                         wouldn't tell me where he was gong. 
                         Said it was something personal.

               INT. TELEPHONE BOOTH

                                     HELEN
                         Tell him I want to see him the minute 
                         he gets in... No, I'll call back.

               Helen hangs up, thoroughly worried and distraught now.

               at passenger loading gate. A group of passengers is held 
               back as soldiers close the gate to the runway, preventing 
               their boarding their plane. The passengers mill about in 
               consternation as a voice is heard over a p.a. system.

                                     VOICE

               The Army has thrown a roadblock across a main highway on the 
               outskirts of the city and is permitting no one to leave. 
               From the line of halted cars we see and the insistent honking 
               of horns we hear, we get the impression of hundreds of cars 
               stacked up.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. TOM'S OUTER OFFICE - FULL SHOT - DUSK

               It is 6:00 P.M. and growing dark outside, but the lights are 
               not on. The office is small and unpretentious, the business 
               habitat of a man who works in a big insurance agency. Tom's 
               secretary is on the phone, reflecting the world-wide terror 
               of the moment.

                                     SECRETARY
                              (into phone, nervous 
                              and jittery)
                         --Honest, Mary, I'm so scared I can't 
                         sit still. I'd like to run some place, 
                         but I don't know where to go--
                              (hearing the door 
                              open, she cuts off)
                         'Bye now.

               The corridor door opens and Tom enters with an air of urgency.

                                     TOM
                         Call the Pentagon and find out who's 
                         in charge of this space man business. 
                         Whoever it is I want to talk to him.

               The secretary has a reaction of surprise, but she manages to 
               stop Tom at his door. He has flipped on the lights in passing.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Mrs. Benson's been trying to get you 
                         all afternoon. She says it's 
                         important.

                                     TOM
                         Get this other call first.

               Tom disappears into his office, closing the door. The 
               secretary is getting out a telephone directory when the 
               corridor door opens and Helen enters, tense and nervous.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Oh, Mrs. Benson -- He just walked 
                         in.
                              (misery loves company)
                         Are you nervous, too?

                                     HELEN
                         Yes, I am, Margaret.

               The secretary buzzes the intercom and speaks into it.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Mrs. Benson is here.
                              (turning to Helen)
                         Go on in.

               Helen is starting for the door when it opens and Tom appears.

                                     HELEN
                         Tom -- I've been trying to get you 
                         all afternoon--

                                     TOM
                              (preoccupied with his 
                              own excitement)
                         Come on in.

               INT. TOM'S PRIVATE OFFICE - FULL SHOT

               as Tom follows Helen inside and closes the door. He turns to 
               her, his voice tense with excitement.

                                     TOM
                         I've got some terrific news about 
                         your friend, Mr. Carpenter.

                                     HELEN
                              (trying to appear 
                              calm)
                         What about him?

                                     TOM
                         Helen, he's the man from the space 
                         ship!
                              (she eyes him evenly, 
                              apprehensively, as 
                              he hurries on)
                         I had that diamond checked at three 
                         different places. Nobody on earth's 
                         ever seen a stone like that! After 
                         what Bobby told us, that's enough 
                         for me. Why is it nobody knows 
                         anything about him? Why hasn't he 
                         got any money?

                                     HELEN
                              (evenly, with quiet 
                              tension)
                         All right, Tom -- it's true. I know 
                         it's true.

                                     TOM
                         How do you know?

                                     HELEN
                         Never mind about that.
                              (urgently, with great 
                              concern)
                         You've got to promise me you won't 
                         say a word to anybody.

                                     TOM
                         Are you crazy? After what happened 
                         today?

                                     HELEN
                         You don't understand. You don't 
                         realize how important it is.

                                     TOM
                              (impatiently)
                         Important? Of course it's important. 
                         The point is we can do something 
                         about it.

                                     HELEN
                         That's what I'm trying to tell you. 
                         We mustn't do anything about it. 
                         Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm 
                         talking about.

                                     TOM
                              (irritated by her 
                              opposition)
                         He's a menace to the whole world! 
                         It's our duty to turn him in.

                                     HELEN
                              (desperately)
                         But he isn't a menace! He told me 
                         what he came here for.

                                     TOM
                              (dismissing this with 
                              annoyed contempt)
                         He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- 
                         just because you like the guy.
                              (busy with his own 
                              thoughts)
                         You realize what this'd mean for us? 
                         I'd be the biggest man in the country. 
                         I could write my own ticket.

                                     HELEN
                              (eyeing him coldly)
                         Is that what you're thinking about?

                                     TOM
                              (guiltily, defensive)
                         Why not? Somebody's got to get rid 
                         of him.

               They are interrupted by the sharp sound of the interoffice 
               buzzer.

                                     HELEN
                         I'm not going to let you do it, Tom.
                              (with deep personal 
                              urgency)
                         Believe me, this is literally the 
                         most important thing in the world.

               Tom picks up the phone and answers it.

                                     TOM
                              (into phone)
                         Yes?... What's his name, Margaret? 
                         General Cutler?
                              (disappointed that 
                              the connection isn't 
                              completed)
                         All right, I'll hold on.

               Realizing what he's doing, Helen crosses to him, pleading 
               wildly, desperately.

                                     HELEN
                         Tom, you mustn't -- ! You don't know 
                         what you're doing! It isn't just you 
                         and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the 
                         world, is involved!

                                     TOM
                              (exasperated)
                         I don't care about the rest of the 
                         world!

               It is as though he had slapped her across the face. Suddenly 
               he has revealed himself, naked and distasteful. Feeling guilty 
               as he sees the contempt and revulsion in her eyes, he tries 
               the old charm, holding his hand over the phone.

                                     TOM
                         You'll feel different when you see 
                         my picture in the papers.

                                     HELEN
                              (staring at him starkly)
                         I feel different right now.

                                     TOM
                              (uneasily)
                         You wait and see. You're going to 
                         marry a big hero!

                                     HELEN
                         I'm not going to marry anybody.

               She turns and runs quickly out of the room. Tom's inclination 
               is to follow her, when his connection is completed.

                                     TOM
                              (into phone)
                         Hello, General Cutler?
                              (irritated)
                         No, I don't want to speak to his 
                         aide. I want to speak to the General. 
                         Tell him it's about the space man... 
                         My name is Tom Stevens. S-t-e-v-e-n-
                         s.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - MED. SHOT - DUSK

               Helen hurries out of the building, hails a cab, gets into it 
               and the cab drives off.

               INT. TOM'S OFFICE - CLOSE SHOT - TOM

               Tom now has General Cutler on the phone.

                                     TOM
                              (into phone)
                         That's right, General. That's where 
                         he's staying... Yes, of course I'm 
                         sure.

               INT. GENERAL CUTLER'S OFFICE - PENTAGON BLDG.

               The General is on the phone and is making notes. There are a 
               couple of officers standing near his desk, a Colonel and a 
               Lieutenant Colonel.

                                     GENERAL CUTLER
                              (after listening for 
                              a moment)
                         Thank you very much, Mr. Stevens. 
                         I'll want to talk to you further but 
                         I haven't time now.
                              (hangs up and turns 
                              to Colonel)
                         Deploy all Zone 5 units according to 
                         Plan B -- immediately.

               The Colonel nods and starts out of the room, as we--

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. TAXI - MED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN - NIGHT

               The cab is traveling through city traffic. Nervous and edgy, 
               Helen glances at her watch impatiently.

               EXT. STREET - MED. SHOT

               A jeep filled with armed soldiers is moving down the street 
               at a fast clip. Behind the jeep is an Army staff car.

               MED. CLOSE- SHOT - STAFF CAR

               shooting from outside into the car. In the front seat beside 
               the driver is a full Colonel, wearing helmet and side-arms. 
               The car is moving swiftly through traffic as the Colonel 
               speaks into the transmitter of a radio.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - COMMAND AND RECONNAISSANCE CAR

               It is filled with soldiers wearing helmets and carrying rifles 
               and Tommy guns. It is traveling quite fast. A soldier with a 
               handy-talkie transmits an order to the driver.

               MED. LONG SHOT - STREET

               The C. and R. car is seen to be at the head of a convoy of 
               eight Army vehicles which are moving swiftly down the street. 
               The trucks are filled with armed soldiers.

               MED. LONG SHOT - ANOTHER STREET

               On this street also an armed convoy is racing by, headed by 
               a Jeep mounting a .30 caliber machine gun.

               MED. LONG SHOT - ANOTHER STREET

               On this street also a convoy rolls by.

               EXT. STREET CORNER - MED. SHOT

               Helen's cab rounds the corner into the boardinghouse street. 
               CAMERA PANS with cab as it draws up in front of the 
               boardinghouse. The cab waits as Helen jumps out and runs up 
               the steps to the front door. A couple of children are playing 
               jump-rope in the light of a street lamp.

               EXT. MOVING - STAFF CAR - MED. CLOSE SHOT

               shooting in at the Colonel as he issues an order into the 
               radio.

               MED. SHOT - ARMY CONVOY

               CAMERA FOLLOWS the rear of the convoy as it races down a 
               main thoroughfare. As the convoy reaches each intersection, 
               the last vehicle peels off the column and, turns into the 
               side street.

               MED. SHOT ANOTHER CONVOY

               racing down another street, the rear vehicles peeling off at 
               the intersections as in previous scene.

               MED. SHOT - INTERSECTION

               Following one of the vehicles after it has peeled off into a 
               side street. It turns around in the side street and draws up 
               facing the intersection, its motor still running. We get the 
               impression of a methodical plan to block off each street.)

               EXT. BOARDINGHOUSE - MED. SHOT

               as Klaatu and Helen come hurrying down the steps and pile 
               into the waiting taxi. The kids playing Jump-rope stop and 
               watch as the door is closed and the cab pulls out, 
               disappearing as it makes a right turn at the end of the 
               street.

               EXT. STREET CORNER NEAR BOARDINGHOUSE - MED. SHOT

               (This is opposite end of street from last shot.) Barreling 
               across the intersection into the boardinghouse street is the 
               jeep followed by the Colonel's staff car.

               EXT. BOARDINGHOUSE STREET - MED. SHOT

               As the Jeep and staff car pull up in front of the boarding 
               house, the soldiers in the jeep pile out and cover the 
               entrance to the house. Meanwhile the Colonel, still in the 
               staff car, is talking to the two kids playing out front. 
               They chatter excitedly, pointing in the direction taken by 
               the cab.

               INT. STAFF CAB - CLOSE SHOT - COLONEL

               He speaks into his radio in tones of clipped and quiet 
               efficiency. The car remains standing at the curb.

                                     COLONEL
                              (into radio)
                         Attention, Zone 5... Yellow cab, 
                         moving north on B from Ninth Street. 
                         Man and woman in back seat. Get the 
                         license number and report.

               INT. TAXI - FULL SHOT

               The cab 's moving through traffic at a normal speed. Klaatu 
               and Helen are tense and nervous.

               INT. TAXI - FULL SHOT

               The cab's moving through traffic at a normal speed. Klaatu 
               and Helen are tense and nervous.

                                     KLAATU
                         I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to 
                         hide me until the meeting.

                                     HELEN
                         Where is the meeting going to be?

                                     KLAATU
                         At the ship.

               CLOSE SHOT - CAB DRIVER

               as he looks out to his left, approaching an intersection.

               From driver's viewpoint. A C. and R. car is parked in the 
               side street, facing the intersection, its occupants armed 
               and helmeted.

               CLOSE SHOT - CAB DRIVER

               Abreast of the intersection now, he looks to his right.

               EXT. STREET INTERSECTION - MED. SHOT

               shooting over the rear of a jeep which is halted in a side 
               street facing the intersection. The cab crosses the 
               intersection and the jeep driver squints to catch its number. 
               Then he picks up his radio and speaks into the transmitter.

               INT. STAFF CAR - CLOSE SHOT - COLONEL

               (The car is still in front of the boardinghouse.) The Colonel 
               listens to his radio for a moment, then speaks into his 
               transmitter.

                                     COLONEL
                              (into radio)
                         Attention, Zone 5... license number 
                         of target vehicle is W 4936... All 
                         vehicles maintain your positions -- 
                         and hold your fire.

               INT. TAXI - MED. CLOSE SHOT

               shooting at the driver, over the shoulders of Klaatu and 
               Helen, as he turns and points out the Army vehicles to them 
               with a shrug of bewilderment. They look ahead at the 
               intersection they are approaching.

               CLOSE SHOT - HELEN

               looking ahead out of her side of the cab, at the intersection.

               MED. SHOT - INTERSECTION

               from Helen's viewpoint. There is an Army vehicle waiting in 
               the side street.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               as he looks out of his side of the cab.

               MED. SHOT - INTERSECTION

               In this side street, too, an Army vehicle is standing.

               TWO SHOT - HELEN AND KLAATU

               Their eyes meet for a moment, neither willing to conjecture 
               what this might mean. The very quietness of the operation is 
               ominous and menacing. Their faces show grave concern.

               INT. STAFF CAR - CLOSE SHOT - COLONEL

                                     COLONEL
                              (into radio)
                         Attention, Zone 5 -- report when 
                         target vehicle passes your position.

               EXT. TAXI MED. CLOSE SHOT

               shooting through the window at Helen and Klaatu, who are 
               growing more tense and nervous.

               MED. SHOT - INTERSECTION

               shooting over the back of a jeep mounting a machine gun as 
               the cab passes the intersection. The driver picks up his 
               radio and reports into it.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - WEAPONS CARRIER

               shooting through the windshield as the driver reports by 
               radio, his eyes shifting to follow the moving cab.

               INT. TAXI - TWO SHOT - HELEN AND KLAATU

               Helen is biting her lips nervously. She steals a sidelong 
               glance at Klaatu to find him staring ahead, deeply preoccupied 
               and concerned.

                                     HELEN
                              (trying to give him 
                              encouragement)
                         It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's.

                                     KLAATU
                         I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid 
                         of what he might do -- if anything 
                         should happen to me.

                                     HELEN
                         Gort?
                              (puzzled)
                         But he's a robot. I mean -- without 
                         you, what could he do?

                                     KLAATU
                              (slowly)
                         There's no limit to what he could 
                         do. He could destroy the Earth.
                              (with great urgency)
                         If anything should happen to me, you 
                         must go to Gort. You must give him 
                         this message: "Klaatu barada nikto." 
                         Please repeat that.

                                     HELEN
                              (shocked and 
                              bewildered, she 
                              repeats nervously)
                         "Klaatu barada nikto."

                                     KLAATU
                              (gravely)
                         Remember those words.

               Helen nods, repeating the words soundlessly.

               SERIES OF CUTS

               of vehicle drivers reporting by radio as their eyes follow 
               the progress of the taxi. (These should be shot so we don't 
               hear what is said.)

               CLOSE SHOT - COLONEL IN STAFF CAR

               listening to these reports. Then he speaks into his 
               transmitter with quiet tension.

                                     COLONEL

                         Attention, Zone 5... Section number 
                         2 -- block off Tenth Street at 
                         Massachusetts. All vehicles close 
                         in.

               The Colonel motions to his driver and the staff car pulls 
               out.

               EXT. STREET - MED. SHOT

               as a convoy of eight vehicles moves down the street going 
               very fast and swings around a corner.

               SERIES OF CUTS

               of individual vehicles that have been waiting at 
               intersections, as they pull out and down the main streets to 
               converge on the taxi.

               MED. SHOT

               at a major intersection, as the convoy of eight vehicles 
               previously seen dashes through the intersection and stops. 
               The cars quickly arrange themselves so that they form a 
               roadblock, completely sealing off the street.

               INT. TAXI

               shooting over the driver's shoulder. The cab is proceeding 
               down the street. When the road block comes into range of its 
               headlights. The driver, who has been getting uneasy, turns 
               to face his fares accusingly.

                                     DRIVER
                         Hey, what's this all about?

               As he slows his cab down, Helen leans forward into scene. 
               Frenzied, she is about to urge the driver on when Klaatu 
               puts a restraining hand on her shoulder.

               EXT. STREET - MED. SHOT

               shooting down the street from the barricade, as the taxi 
               stops. Army cars are closing in behind the taxi, so it is 
               trapped. The cab door ovens and Klaatu steps out, making a 
               run for the entrance to a pedestrian underpass.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - JEEP

               It is one of the lead vehicles in the group coming up behind 
               the taxi. It mounts a .30 caliber machine gun and, with the 
               Jeep still moving, the gunner fires a burst at Klaatu.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - RIFLEMAN

               He's on one of the vehicles that form the barricade. He takes 
               a bead on the running figure of Klaatu and fires.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               He has almost reached the underpass. His hand is on the 
               railing when he slumps to the ground, badly hit. In a moment, 
               Helen rushes into scene, dropping down to hold Klaatu's head 
               in her arms. He looks up at her with a feeble smile. Then 
               his face takes on an expression of urgency.

                                     KLAATU
                              (weakly, insistently)
                         Get that message to Gort. Right away--

               Klaatu is unable to say any more. He is dead. Helen looks 
               around wildly, helplessly, with tears and terror in her eyes.

               MED. SHOT

               as the soldiers pile out of their vehicles and close in on 
               the place where Klaatu lies. He is their first and all-
               important concern, and Helen finds herself pushed out of the 
               way, toward the edge of the growing crowd of soldiers.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Shocked and, staggered by what's happened, she realizes she 
               must get to Gort. Taking advantage of the milling confusion 
               in the dark, she edges toward the pedestrian underpass until 
               she can slip into its entrance without being noticed. And 
               she disappears.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BUILDING ENCLOSING SPACE SHIP - MED. SHOT - GORT - 
               NIGHT

               In the eerie light of the huge building, the great robot 
               stands encased in a solid block of clear, transparent plastic. 
               As CAMERA MOVES IN slowly, we hear a low whirring sound, as 
               of power being generated. A faint glow, visible through the 
               plastic, emanates from Gort's body. His eyes, which seem to 
               express rage, shifts as though he were straining to break 
               out. As the whirring sound and the glow of Gort's body 
               increase in intensity, the sharp edges at the top of the ice-
               like block melt into roundness and the plastic starts to 
               drip away. (About 150 folding chairs are arranged on the 
               floor near the space ship for the meeting tonight.)

               EXT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - TWO SOLDIERS

               The whirring sound can be heard faintly from inside. The two 
               soldiers standing guard at the door hear the sound and listen 
               apprehensively. The two men exchange an uneasy glance. After 
               hesitating a moment, one of them decides to investigate. He 
               turns and goes inside the door.

               INT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE SOLDIER

               As he stops and looks up at the robot, his eyes go wide with 
               terror.

               CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               Gort is an awesome and terrifying sight. His head is free 
               now and he seems to be straining against the plastic, which 
               is dripping down the sides of the block.

               CLOSE SHOT - SOLDIER

               He glances around nervously to see that his companion has 
               entered the building and is staring up at the robot, bug-
               eyed. Slowly the second soldier moves up beside the first. 
               Wordlessly, they bring their rifles up to the ready and click 
               them off safety. In spite of their terror, they advance slowly 
               toward the robot.

               CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               The whirring sound is ominous and his body glows brightly. 
               And his eyes are fixed on the two advancing figures.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - TWO SOLDIERS

               as they move toward Gort.

               CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               From inside him comes a new and terribly sharp crackling. 
               sound. And from his eyes two pencils of light dart out. After 
               a moment the crackling sound stops and the light goes off.

               REVERSE SHOT

               from same angle as scene before last. But the two soldiers 
               have utterly disappeared.

               FULL SHOT

               as Gort resumes breaking out of the plastic. There is no 
               sign of the two soldiers.

               EXT. MALL - MED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN - NIGHT

               Hurrying along a footpath, nervous and distraught, she pauses 
               for a moment, looking at the entrance of the building. Then 
               she starts determinedly across the grass toward the entrance.

               MED. SHOT

               PANNING with Helen as she approaches the entrance fearfully. 
               Rallying all her courage and determination, she forces herself 
               to step inside.

               INT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN

               as she enters the huge, weirdly lighted building. She stops 
               short as her glance falls on the awesome figure of Gort. 
               Loneliness and terror grip her and she wants to run -- but 
               she realizes she can't.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT -GORT

               He has seen Helen and his flashing eyes bore into her. His 
               upper body and arms are free now, and the plastic is rapidly 
               melting away.

               CLOSE SHOT - HELEN

               She is held fascinated by the robot's staring eyes. For 
               another moment it looks as if she would, break and run. But 
               she summons all her courage, and moves slowly toward Gort, 
               whose legs are still held captive.

               MED. SHOT - HELEN AND GORT

               as she moves slowly, fearfully toward him.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               The plastic is dripping off his legs now. With great effort, 
               he pulls his legs free and steps out of the stuff. A huge 
               figure in the heavy shadows, he moves slowly and menacingly 
               toward Helen.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN

               as she stops advancing, rooted to the spot in fear. Then she 
               starts backing away, keeping her eyes on him.

               MED. SHOT - HELEN AND GORT

               As the great, hulking figure approaches, Helen can't stand 
               her ground. She turns and runs wildly toward the far end of 
               the building. Gort follows her with unhurried, inescapable 
               strides. Unwittingly, Helen has run into a corner, and the 
               robot is closing in on her.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN

               Her eyes go wide with terror as she realizes she's trapped. 
               In a wild effort to run around him, she stumbles and falls 
               to the floor. Immobilized with fright, she lies breathless, 
               looking up at him. Then she gives a piercing scream.

               TWO SHOT - HELEN AND GORT

               as the great robot bends over her menacingly, arms 
               outstretched as though to grab or smash her.

               CLOSE SHOT - HELEN

               All hope gone, she is blessed with a moment of lucidity, and 
               she remembers the message Klaatu told her to deliver.

                                     HELEN
                         Gort--!
                              (with desperate clarity)
                         Klaatu -- barada -- nikto.

               CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               He pauses as he hears the words. His face doesn't change 
               expression, but the words obviously have an effect on him. 
               He hesitates thoughtfully for a moment.

               TWO SHOT - HELEN AND GORT

               Helen watches him in an agony of suspense. Then the robot 
               slowly bends down, picks her up in his arms and starts walking 
               toward the space ship.

               MED. SHOT

               PANNING with Gort as he carries Helen, speechless with fright, 
               to the side of the ship. He touches the side, and the ramp 
               moves slightly out. He mounts the ramp, still carrying Helen, 
               and disappears into the ship with her. And the ramp closes 
               silently behind them.

               INT. SMALL CORRIDOR - SPACE SHIP

               CAMERA FOLLOWS as Gort carries Helen through the dimly lighted 
               corridor into the main cabin, where he flips a switch that 
               lights up the cabin. The robot proceeds to a small door 
               leading off the main cabin and disappears with Helen inside 
               it.

               INT. SMALL CABIN - FULL SHOT

               This is revealed as a weirdly equipped laboratory, the walls 
               of which are lined with the most complex array of mechanical 
               and electronic apparatus. Gort sets Helen down on a stool 
               and indicates for her to stay there. Too terrified to move, 
               Helen watches as he busies himself with the apparatus. He 
               starts flipping switches and turning dials. As a result, 
               lights begin to flash and there's a strange series of 
               mechanical noises.

               CLOSE SHOT - HELEN

               Unable to guess the reason for these preparations, she is 
               gripped with a terrible fear.

               FULL SHOT

               Ignoring Helen completely, Gort finishes his work. Then he 
               moves to the door and goes out, closing the door behind him. 
               Helen rushes to the door and searches frantically for the 
               knob -- only to find, to her terror, that there is none. 
               Frenziedly she beats on the solid metal door.

               EXT. SPACE SHIP - MED. SHOT

               as the ramp comes down and Gort steps out. With grim, 
               determined strides he starts toward the entrance of the 
               building as the ramp silently closes.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. POLICE PRECINCT STATION - NIGHT

               The Colonel who was in charge of Klaatu's apprehension is 
               speaking into a phone at the desk of the Police Sergeant. 
               Standing by are three or four Army officers, among them a 
               Captain and a Lieutenant.

                                     COLONEL
                              (into phone)
                         Yes, sir, we've got the body here 
                         now. Downstairs in a cell... No 
                         question about it, General -- he's 
                         dead all right... Yes, sir. Yes -- I 
                         understand.

               The General has apparently hung up and the Colonel does 
               likewise, turning to the officers in the room.

                                     COLONEL
                         General Cutler's coming down here 
                         right away.
                              (to the Lieutenant)
                         Take a squad of men, Lieutenant, and 
                         post a guard around that cell.
                              (to Captain)
                         Captain, don't let anyone in or out 
                         of the building.

               The two officers mutter their "yes, sirs" and start off about 
               their business.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. JAIL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               A squad of armed soldiers, led by the lieutenant, is admitted 
               to the corridor by a Police guard and they start marching 
               down the corridor toward a cell at the far end.

               INT. CELL - POLICE STATION

               This is a cell on the ground floor. In the far wall is a 
               heavily barred window, beyond which is as alley. In f.g. are 
               Klaatu's feet, stretched out on a crude table. As CAMERA 
               HOLDS, the huge figure of Gort appears outside the barred 
               window, Seeing Klaatu, he reaches up and yanks out the steel 
               bars as though they were chicken wire. With a crushing blow 
               of his knee he crumbles the brick and mortar below the window 
               and steps inside the cell. He moves without interruption 
               toward the body of Klaatu.

               INT. JAIL CORRIDOR

               Hearing the sounds of clattering metal and mortar, the 
               soldiers race down the corridor toward the cell.

               MED. SHOT

               shooting over the backs of the soldiers as they reach the 
               cell and look inside. There they see the giant robot picking 
               up the body of Klaatu and starting deliberately toward the 
               gaping hole in the side of the building. They raise their 
               weapons and fire at Gort, but the bullets have no effect on 
               him. Continuing uninterruptedly, he steps over the debris 
               and disappears, carrying Klaatu in his arms.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. SPACE SHIP BUILDING - MED. SHOT

               as Gort enters the empty building, still carrying the body 
               of Klaatu. CAMERA PANS with him as he strides over to the 
               ship. The ramp opens and Gort goes inside. Then the ramp 
               closes after him.

               INT. LABORATORY CABIN IN SPACE SHIP

               Alone in the cabin, Helen is still terrified. She looks up, 
               startled as the door opens and Gort enters, carrying Klaatu's 
               body over to a long counter. Once again he starts fiddling 
               with knobs, switches and dials. As Helen watches, speechless, 
               he starts to fasten strange-looking electrodes to Klaatu's 
               wrist and ankle.

               EXT. POLICE PRECINCT STATION - NIGHT

               shooting from the outside, near the front entrance to the 
               building, through a window into the main room where the Police 
               Sergeant's desk is. The Lieutenant who was ordered to guard 
               Klaatu's cell is excitedly reporting to the Colonel how Gort 
               broke in and took Klaatu's body. Considerably agitated, the 
               Colonel snaps orders to the other officers, glances at his 
               watch and motions for the Lieutenant to follow him. He and 
               the Lieutenant cross to the door and CAMERA PANS with them 
               as they come outside the building, hurry down the steps and 
               get into a staff car. Several other Army vehicles join the 
               staff car as it roars away from the curb.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. SPACE SHIP BUILDING - MED. SHOT - NIGHT

               A good many of the 150 chairs are filled, and more guests 
               are still arriving. There is no one to greet them at the 
               door, so they wander in and seat themselves.

               INT. LABORATORY IN SPACE SHIP

               Gort is still working over the body of Klaatu. From a socket 
               in the wall he pulls a strange-looking hypodermic needle on 
               the end of a cord or tube and gives Klaatu a shot in the 
               arm.

               CLOSE SHOT - HELEN

               as she watches, fascinated in spite of her terror.

               FULL SHOT

               Gort fiddles with the dials again and there are electrical 
               cracklings and sputterings. Suddenly he flips a switch and 
               all sound ceases. Gort removes the electrodes and watches 
               Klaatu. CAMERA MOVES IN on Klaatu and we see him start to 
               breathe. In a moment his eyelids flutter. Then his eyes open 
               and he looks around.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               as Klaatu slowly lifts himself to a sitting position. Helen 
               watches breathlessly as he glances around the room, as though 
               to orient himself. Then he lowers his feet to the floor and 
               stands up. He blinks uncertainly, then smiles at them.

                                     KLAATU
                              (with a grateful glance 
                              at Gort, he turns to 
                              Helen)
                         Hello.

                                     HELEN
                              (staring at him)
                         I -- I thought you were--

                                     KLAATU
                              (nodding, with a smile)
                         I was.

                                     HELEN
                              (looking at Gort in 
                              awe)
                         You mean he has the power of life 
                         and death?

                                     KLAATU
                         No -- that is a power reserved to 
                         the Almighty Spirit.

                                     KLAATU
                              (indicating the 
                              equipment Gort used)
                         This technique, in certain cases, 
                         can re-stimulate life for a limited 
                         period. It's a refinement of 
                         scientific principles known to your 
                         own people.

                                     HELEN
                              (concerned for him)
                         But how -- how long--?

                                     KLAATU
                         How long will I live?
                              (he shrugs)
                         That no one can say.

               Klaatu moves one of the sliding panels and reaches for a 
               suit of his "other world" clothing from behind the panel. 
               With a nod of apology, he steps behind the panel to change.

               EXT. BUILDING - MED. SHOT - NIGHT

               shooting from the door. In f.g. Barnhardt, who has just 
               arrived, is greeting several friends outside the door. In 
               b.g. a staff car and three or four other Army vehicles are 
               driving up.

               MED. SHOT - ARMY VEHICLES

               As the convoy pulls up to a halt in front of the building, 
               the Colonel hurries out of the staff car and moves over to 
               Barnhardt. Barnhardt is motioning his friends into the 
               building as the Colonel comes up to him.

               TWO SHOT - COLONEL AND BARNHARDT

               The Colonel speaks to Barnhardt with deference but with 
               unyielding authority.

                                     COLONEL
                         I'm sorry, Professor Barnhardt -- I 
                         have to ask you to call off this 
                         meeting.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Call it off? I... But I had permission 
                         from the Army--

                                     COLONEL
                         I know you did. But the robots on 
                         the loose now and it isn't safe around 
                         here. You'll have to get your friends 
                         out of that building.

               INT. SPACE SHIP - TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND HELEN

               as Klaatu steps out from behind the sliding panel where he 
               has changed into his "other world" tunic.

                                     KLAATU
                         Gort and I will be leaving soon.

               Helen is genuinely upset at the thought of his leaving and 
               the knowledge that he is to die. There is a compelling warmth 
               of feeling between these two.

                                     HELEN
                              (simply, sincerely)
                         We'll miss you very much -- Bobby 
                         and I.
                              (smiling to conceal 
                              her real feelings)
                         He won't have anyone to play with.

                                     KLAATU
                         He'll have you -- and Tom.

                                     HELEN
                              (quietly -- definitely)
                         No. That's all finished.

                                     KLAATU
                         I'm sorry.

                                     HELEN
                              (she is sensible and 
                              objective, but not 
                              unfeeling)
                         I think I'm very lucky. You don't 
                         always get a chance to recognize a 
                         mistake before you make it.

               Klaatu looks at her in warm, considered admiration. Then he 
               moves to one side of the cabin and flips a switch. Suddenly 
               an entire section of the side wall is made transparent. 
               Through it, as through a screen, we can see out into the 
               building. Most of the chairs are already occupied, and 
               latecomers are still moving in through the door. Facing the 
               group, on a little dais, is Barnhardt. As Klaatu and Helen 
               watch, Barnhardt raps for order and begins to speak. His 
               voice comes in the ship through a speaker.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         Ladies and Gentlemen--

               INT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - BARNHARDT

               He addresses them gravely, with a note of terrible 
               disappointment in his voice.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         I called you from your work and from 
                         your homes all over the world because 
                         we were to meet here tonight with a 
                         man from another planet -- the man 
                         who came here in this ship.
                              (there are audible 
                              exclamations of 
                              surprise and 
                              disappointment)
                         As you all know, this is no longer 
                         possible. I can only say that I share 
                         the bitterness of your disappointment.

               INTERCUT with the above are group and individual shots of 
               the people in the meeting. They are the cream of Earth's 
               intellectuals -- scientists, churchmen, educators, leaders 
               of social and political thought. There are several women 
               among them. There are turbaned Indians, Chinese, Japanese, 
               several Negroes. All religions are represented. Every 
               important world power is represented.

               INT. MAIN CABIN - SPACE SHIP

               Klaatu and Helen are watching and listening, as the last 
               sentence of Barnhardt's speech above comes over the speaker. 
               Klaatu flips off the switch, which cuts off the view of the 
               meeting and also Barnhardt's voice. At this moment Gort moves 
               across the cabin and Klaatu speaks to him.

                                     KLAATU
                         Gort -- berengo.

               Gort moves off obediently.

               INT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - BARNHARDT

               Full of chagrin, he continues addressing the meeting.

                                     BARNHARDT
                         --under the circumstances, the Army 
                         people have asked us to leave the 
                         building. And, since their concern 
                         is for our safety, I can do nothing 
                         but suggest that we comply--

               Barnhardt is interrupted by the sudden and unexpected 
               appearance of the ramp, silently opening out of the side of 
               the space ship.

               MED. SHOT - BARNHARDT'S AUDIENCE

               as they react in startled amazement to the mysterious 
               appearance of the ramp. Then, as they watch, there is a sudden 
               gasp of terror.

               MED. SHOT - AT SHIP

               as Gort appears on the ramp and walks slowly down to the 
               ground. In a moment, Klaatu and Helen appear at the entrance 
               of the ship. Helen comes down the ramp to join Barnhardt, 
               while Klaatu remains at the head of the ramp.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT COLONEL AND SOLDIERS

               The Colonel stands near the door, flanked by a group of 
               soldiers, their rifles at the ready. The Colonel is startled 
               by what he sees. His eyes are on the revered figure of Klaatu 
               and he's debating what he should do.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               He is a figure of intense dignity in his impressive otherworld 
               tunic. He stares with even defiance at the armed soldiers, 
               as though holding them off by sheer weight of his personality. 
               He turns to look out at the audience, which is held 
               spellbound. Then, after a breathless moment, he speaks.

                                     KLAATU
                              (straightforwardly, 
                              with almost stern 
                              authority)
                         I am leaving soon and you will forgive 
                         me if I speak bluntly.
                              (he pauses, studying 
                              the faces)
                         The Universe grows smaller every day -- 
                         and the threat of aggression by any 
                         group -- anywhere -- can no longer 
                         be tolerated.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - IN AUDIENCE

               of three of the delegates, listening intently. (These three 
               are from Russia, India and France.)

                                     KLAATU'S VOICE
                              (over scene)
                         There must be security for all -- or 
                         no one is secure... This does not 
                         mean giving up any freedom except 
                         the freedom to act irresponsibly.

               CLOSE SHOT - A DELEGATE

               He is an American.

                                     KLAATU'S VOICE
                              (over scene)
                         Your ancestors knew this when they 
                         made laws to govern themselves -- 
                         and hired policemen to enforce them.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

                                     KLAATU
                         We of the other planets have long 
                         accepted this principle. We have an 
                         organization for the mutual protection 
                         of all planets -- and for the complete 
                         elimination of aggression. A sort of 
                         United Nations on the Planetary 
                         level... The test of any such higher 
                         authority, of course, is the police 
                         force that supports it. For our 
                         policemen, we created a race of robots--
                              (indicating Gort)
                         Their function is to patrol the 
                         planets -- in space ships like this 
                         one -- and preserve the peace. In 
                         matters of aggression we have given 
                         them absolute power over us.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               emphasizing his great size and inscrutable expression. The 
               normal blinking of his piercing eyes as he gazes imperturbably 
               at the audience is his only movement.

                                     KLAATU'S VOICE
                              (over scene)
                         At the first sign of violence they 
                         act automatically against the 
                         aggressor. And the penalty for 
                         provoking their action is too terrible 
                         to risk.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

                                     KLAATU
                         The result is that we live in peace, 
                         without arms or armies, secure in 
                         the knowledge that we are free from 
                         aggression and war -- free to pursue 
                         more profitable enterprises.
                              (after a pause)
                         We do not pretend to have achieved 
                         perfection -- but we do have a system -- 
                         and it works.
                              (with straightforward 
                              candor)
                         I came here to give you the facts. 
                         It is no concern of ours how you run 
                         your own planet -- but if you threaten 
                         to extend your violence, this Earth 
                         of yours will be reduced to a burned-
                         out cinder.

               QUICK REACTION CUTS

               of four delegates, reflecting their stark terror and 
               bewilderment. And a cut of the Colonel and the soldiers, 
               impressed and held by what Klaatu is saying.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY as he concludes quietly, incisively.

                                     KLAATU
                         Your choice is simple. Join us and 
                         live in peace. Or pursue your present 
                         course -- and face obliteration.
                              (after a pause)
                         We will be waiting for your answer. 
                         decision rests with you.

               By the time he reads the last line, the CAMERA HAS MOVED 
               INTO a BIG HEAD CLOSEUP.

               MED. SHOT - THE DELEGATES

               CAMERA MOVES along a row of their faces, stunned and silent, 
               their minds unable to cope with the enormity of what they 
               have heard.

               MED. SHOT

               CAMERA MOVES IN on Klaatu as he is saying goodbye to Barnhardt 
               and Helen. He turns then and speaks to Gort, glancing up at 
               the building as he does so.

                                     KLAATU
                         Gort -- veracto.

               CLOSE SHOT - GORT

               He looks up at the roof of the building, and once again we 
               hear the peculiar generating sound from within him.

               MED. LONG SHOT

               including the delegates, the space ship, everything that is 
               inside the building. As we watch, the roof and walls of the 
               temporary structure suddenly disintegrate as the tanks did 
               in the opening. The entire layout -- delegates, space ship 
               and all -- remain exactly as they were except that instead 
               of being under a roof they are out in the open Mall under a 
               starry sky. The area is ringed with the debris of the 
               building.

               MED. SHOT AT SHIP

               Klaatu is standing at the head of the ramp as Gort comes up 
               the ramp and disappears inside the ship. Klaatu is nodding 
               goodbye to Barnhardt and Helen.

               TWO SHOT - BARNHARDT AND HELEN

               as they wave to Klaatu. Barnhardt is moved and impressed, 
               and Helen's face shows her emotions at this strange parting.

               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

               He nods and smiles at them with warm affection. Then he turns 
               and disappears into the ship, and the ramp closes behind 
               him.

               MED. SHOT - THE SPACE SHIP

               From inside the ship comes the muffled roar of great power 
               generating -- not the sound of earthly motors, but of a 
               tremendous dynamo.

               MED. SHOT - THE DELEGATES

               watching breathless, stunned by what they have heard and 
               seen.

               MED. LONG SHOT - THE SHIP

               As the sound from inside it builds to a climax, the great 
               ship takes off with a tremendous roar.

               REACTION CUTS OF DELEGATES

               All are deeply moved and impressed. In the mind of each is 
               the burning question that Klaatu has posed for them.

               LONG SHOT - THE SHIP

               as it soars away into the inky blackness of the outer spaces 
               from which it came.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

1A.  INT. ROCK LEDGE - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     BLACK

     FADE IN to the dark eyes of the mysterious face of
     the REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO, who sits against smooth
     black rock. Her eyes are deep blue-within-blue and
     her skin is a haunting translucent white. Her voice
     ECHOES as if in a great cavern.

                 REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO
               We are the secret of the Universe.

           RESPONSE OF TWENTY THOUSAND VOICES
               Bi-la kaifa.

                 REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO
               We are the secret of the Universe. We know
               of spice...the spice called melange...the
               greatest treasure in the Universe. It
               exists on only one planet - ours Arrakis,
               Dune. We know of spice and the Bene
               Gesserit sisterhood's selective breeding
               plan of ninety generations to produce the
               Kwisatz Haderach, the one the spice will
               awaken.

           RESPONSE OF TWENTY THOUSAND VOICES
               Bi-la kaifa.

                 REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO
               And now the prophecy...

     Silence...then a powerful low organ NOTE resounding
     in the cavernous space.

            REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO (CONT'D)
               He will come...the voice from the outer
               world, bringing the holy war, the Jihad,
               which will cleanse the Universe and bring
               us out of darkness. He will have been born
               of a Bene Gesserit mother.
--
     The Reverend Mother continues speaking of the
     Prophecy, but we do not hear it. The huge wind organ
     BLOWS louder and louder, obscuring her voice.

     The picture FADES.

1B.  KAITAIN - A SCENE FROM SPACE

     Home planet of House Corrino and Shadam IV, Emperor
     of the known universe.

2.   INT. DROP - NIGHT

     FADE IN to:

     ...interior of one drop of water. The image changes
     subtly.

2A.  EXT. - DROP - NIGHT

     PULL BACK to a shot revealing the outside of the
     drop. There is a distant ROARING and within the drop
     we can see the distorted image of a space ship
     landing on a sophisticated landing field.

3A. EXT. LANDING FIELD - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT

     On the dark landing field, chemicals spill out of
     the ship in troughs and tank-suited Guildsmen begin
     to swarm out of a hatch opening.

4. through 6.  (Deleted)

7.   INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT

     The EMPEROR is surrounded by crowds of COURTIERS in
     his Throne Room.

     Suddenly a GUARD enters from a small door and
     quickly crosses to ANOTHER GUARD. A warning SOUND
     begins. The Emperor turns nervously. Guards quickly
     begin to clear the large room. Several women are
     rushed toward us to a door beyond. One of the woman,
     IRULAN, stops and turns back for a worried, caring
     look to her father, the Emperor.

                         IRULAN
               Father.
--
                         EMPEROR
               Irulan.

     She sees that SARDAUKAR OFFICERS are surrounding him
     now, speaking to him. Irulan turns and leaves. The
     Emperor moves away from his officers to the center
     of the now-empty room. He drops his golden robe from
     his shoulders. He stands in his elegant black
     uniform, thinking.

     The Reverend Mother is ushered in and the Sardaukar
     Officers leave her alone with the Emperor.

                         EMPEROR
                    (quickly)
               A Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here
               within minutes!

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               We felt his presence.

                         EMPEROR
               I shall want telepathy during his visit
               and a report when we're finished.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Their minds are so.... They move in
               strange directions....

                         EMPEROR
               Yes?

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Forced spice evolution of humans changes
               many things.... I must sit close to him.

                         EMPEROR
               He will not permit anyone but me to see
               him. You must be outside this room.... Do
               what you can.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               I am your Truthsayer, my lord...
                    (sensing something outside the room)
               He is here, my lord.

     Under the carved inscription "Law is the Ultimate
     Science", the doors to the Emperor's chambers slide
     open and FIFTY GUILDSMEN wheel in a forty-foot long
     giant black box. One of the Guildsmen addresses the
     Emperor through a translating device.

                   TANKED GUILDSMEN #1
               The Bene Gesserit witch must leave.
--
     The Emperor looks to the Reverend Mother.

                         EMPEROR
               Leave us.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Yes, my Lord.

                         EMPEROR
                    (after she has gone)
               We are alone...

8.   INT. HALLWAY - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT

     The Reverend Mother enters through doors and takes a
     seat on a chair just outside the door. She closes
     her eyes.

9.   INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT

     Inside the Emperor's chamber, the TANK-SUITED
     GUILDSMEN are arranging themselves in a "V"
     formation around the box. Suddenly the box opens,
     slowly and beautifully revealing a huge, thick glass
     tank. Inside the tank floats a THIRD STAGE NAVIGATOR
     twenty feet long, much like a cross between a pasty,
     pale human being and a fleshy grasshopper.

     The tank is filled with swirling orange spice-gas,
     and Guildsmen continuously vacuum up the toxic
     chemical spills dripping from under the tank.
     Suddenly the Guild Navigator swims towards the
     Emperor. His head is enormous and fleshy, like a
     huge grasshopper head -- the eyes are totally deep
     blue. His voice is a high, fleshy whispering and an
     intricate electrical apparatus in the front of the
     tank translates into English and broadcasts it into
     the room.

                        NAVIGATOR
               We have just folded space from Ix...

                         EMPEROR
                    (extremely nervous)
               Yes?... How was your journey?

                        NAVIGATOR
                    (after a long pause)
               Many machines on Ix... new machines.

                         EMPEROR
               Oh yes?
--
                        NAVIGATOR
               Better than those on Richesse.. You are
               transparent... I see many things... I see
               plans within plans.

                         EMPEROR
               Is there a problem?... Usually there is a
               problem when one of you makes a visit.

     No answer.

                        NAVIGATOR
                    (finally)
               The answer is within the problem...

10.  INT. HALLWAY - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT

     Outside the Emperor's chamber the Reverend Mother
     sits, her eyes closed, straining.

11.  INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - REVEREND
MOTHER'S MENTAL IMAGE - NIGHT

     A very blurred scene of the Emperor with the Guild
     Navigator. She is not getting the English version
     but a much different language version which is
     fascinating to listen to. A lilting, sing-song
     monologue.

12.  INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT

                        NAVIGATOR
               I see two Great Houses -- House Atreides,
               House Harkonnen -- feuding... I see you
               behind it.

                         EMPEROR
               Yes.

     The Navigator breathes the spice-gas heavily and
     swishes gently in his tank.

                        NAVIGATOR
               You must share with us.
--
                         EMPEROR
               The Atreides house is building a secret
               army!... using a technique unknown to
               us... a technique involving sound. The
               Duke is becoming more popular in the
               Landsraad... he could threaten me.... I
               have ordered House Atreides to occupy
               Arrakis to mine the spice... thus
               replacing their enemies the Harkonnens....
               House Atreides will not refuse because of
               the tremendous power they think they will
               gain. Then, at an appointed time Baron
               Harkonnen will return to Arrakis and
               launch a sneak attack on House Atreides...
               I have promised the Baron five legions of
               my Sardaukar terror troops.

                        NAVIGATOR
               So the Harkonnens will rid you of House
               Atreides...

                         EMPEROR
               Yes.

13.  INT. HALLWAY - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT

     Outside, the Reverend Mother is seeing the scene
     mentally. She suddenly sees and flinches.

14.  INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - REVEREND
MOTHER'S MENTAL IMAGE - NIGHT

     The Guild Navigator turns toward her and comes very
     close to her. We hear the Navigator speak to her.

                        NAVIGATOR
                    (to Reverend Mother, mentally)
               Reverend Mother... I will give you the
               Tleilaxu Path.

                 REVEREND MOTHER (V.O.)
                    (an excited whisper)
               A chance for escape? But for whom?

15.  INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT

                         EMPEROR
               Can you hear me?... If this visit has
               anything to do with spice...
--
     The Guild Navigator shudders and swishes quite
     violently in his tank.

                        NAVIGATOR
               LISTEN TO ME!! The spice must flow... the
               spice has given me accelerated evolution
               for four thousand years... it has enabled
               you to live two hundred years... the spice
               helps make the sapho juice, which gives
               the red-lipped mentats the ability to be
               living computers... the secret side of
               spice... the water of life.

16.  INT. HALLWAY - EMPEROR'S PALACE  - NIGHT

                 REVEREND MOTHER (V.O.)
               He shouldn't speak of this...

15.  BACK TO SCENE

                        NAVIGATOR
               ...gives the Bene Gesserit sisterhood the
               metaphysical ability to see beyond...to
               have superior powers... Our power to fold
               space is in the spice... Without us, your
               empire would be lost on isolated scattered
               planets... You would be lost.

                         EMPEROR
               I can assure you...

                        NAVIGATOR
               Do not interrupt!!! Do not speak lightly
               of the spice... ONE SMALL POINT...

16.  BACK TO SCENE

                 REVEREND MOTHER (V.O.)
               Here it comes...

17.  INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT

                        NAVIGATOR
               We ourselves... foresee a slight problem
               within House Atreides.... Paul.... Paul
               Atreides.

                         EMPEROR
               You mean, of course, Duke Leto Atreides...
               his father.

     We SEE the galaxies move as we HEAR a HUM.

                       PAUL (V.O.)
                    (whispering)
               ... beyond Epsilon Alangue... is Arrakis.

     We HOLD on this, then we see Arrakis grow larger in
     the filmbook screen and we SEE it is a planet of
     vast deserts.

25.  BACK TO SCENE

                          PAUL
                    (whispering again)
               It does look dry....

25A. INSERT - FILMBOOK

     The picture grows larger again, and we see the
     Arrakeen Valley.

                     FILMBOOK (V.O.)
               Each day the palms along the outer wall of
               the Palace at Arrakeen consume enough
               water to sustain the lives of one hundred
               men. The palms were placed by the
               Harkonnens to flaunt their water wealth in
               front of the city Fremen.

25.  BACK TO SCENE

                          PAUL
               Where are the Harkonnens from here?

25A. INSERT - FILMBOOK

     The star fields and galaxies move slightly then.

                       PAUL (V.O.)
                    (whispering)
               There!... Geidi Prime and the Baron
               Harkonnen... the enemy.

25.  BACK TO SCENE

     In the background, FOOTSTEPS grow louder, pounding
     on thick wooden floors. THUFIR HAWAT, GURNEY HALLECK
     and DR. YUEH enter. Paul has his back to the door.
     Thufir suddenly looks perturbed when he notices
     this.

                          PAUL
                    (without turning)
               I know, Thufir, I'm sitting with my back
               to the door.

     Hawat suppresses a smile.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
               I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming
               down the hall.

                         THUFIR
               Those sounds could be imitated.

                          PAUL
               I'd know the difference.

     Paul rises and turns to face them.
--
                         THUFIR
                    (inner voice)
               Yes. Perhaps he would at that.

                          PAUL
               My father sent you to test me. Music then?

     Thufir scowls.

                         GURNEY
               No music. I'm packing this for the
               crossing. Shield practice.

                          PAUL
               Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice
               -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.

                         GURNEY
                    (angered)
               Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for
               cattle and love play... not fighting.

                          PAUL
               I'm sorry Gurney.

                         GURNEY
               Not sorry enough.

     Gurney draws his knife.

25B. SHIELD EFFECT - THE FIGHT

     Gurney activates his body shield, sending a
     shimmering FORCE FIELD around his body. He advances
     swiftly toward Paul. Paul snaps on his FORCE FIELD,
     draws his knife and jumps back, collecting himself
     hurriedly for the fight.

                         GURNEY
                    (his voice sounding strange through
                    the forcefield)
               Guard yourself for true!

     Gurney leaps high, then forward, pressing a furious
     attack. Paul falls back. The shield edges CRACK
     loudly as they touch each other.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               What's gotten into Gurney? He's not
               faking.
     Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly
     around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger
     as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul
     directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney
     against the table, plunging at just the right moment
     to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade
     right at Gurney's neck.

                          PAUL
                    (strange shielded voice)
               Is this what you seek?

                         GURNEY
                    (strange shielded voice)
               Good... the slow blade penetrates the
               shield... but look down.

     Paul looks and sees Gurney's blade at his groin.

                     GURNEY (CONT'D)
               We'd have joined each other in death.
               However, you did seem to finally get the
               "mood".

                          PAUL
               Would you really have drawn my blood?

                         GURNEY
               If you'd fought one whit below your
               abilities I'd have scratched you a good
               one.

     Paul stands and snaps off his shield as does Gurney.

25.  BACK TO SCENE

                          PAUL
               Things have been so serious here lately.

                         GURNEY
               Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but
               this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we
               leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The
               Harkonnens are real.

     Thufir, Yueh, Gurney and Paul stare at each other
     for a moment in silence. Dr. Yueh moves forward and
     begins to take Paul's pulse rate and to collect
     other data with a small black machine.

                          PAUL
               Dr. Yueh, do you have any information on
               the worms of Arrakis?
--
                        DR. YUEH
               I have obtained a filmbook on a small
               specimen... only 125 meters long.

                          PAUL
               Only?!

     They smile at each other.

                        DR. YUEH
               There are have been documented sightings
               of worms as large as 450 meters in the
               deep desert -- far from where we'll be in
               Arakeen.... The desert belt and the south
               polar regions are marked forbidden....
               Why?

                          PAUL
               The storms and the worms. Is it true, that
               the sand can blow at seven hundred
               kilometers per hour?

                          YUEH
               It can render flesh to dust in minutes.
               And these dry winds can generate
               tremendous static electricity in the
               atmosphere. Our body shields won't have
               enough power to operate in the open air on
               Arrakis.

                          PAUL
               Well, how do the Fremen survive there?

                          YUEH
               We don't know much about the Fremen...
               They live in the deep desert... some of
               them in the cities and they have blue-
               within-blue eyes...

                          PAUL
                    (smiling)
               The eyes -- yes, yes... saturation of the
               blood by the spice -- melange. Could the
               spice affect us in other ways?

                         THUFIR
               Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we
               know the Harkonnens would not have given
               up their CHOAM company contract so easily.

                          PAUL
                    (rising)
               The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but
               behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor.
--
                         THUFIR
               You will make a formidable Duke!

     Paul bows.

                     THUFIR (CONT'D)
               Now remember... the first step in avoiding
               a trap is knowing of its existence.

                          PAUL
               I know.  But if it is a trap then why are
               we going?

                         THUFIR
               We have our new army.
                    (in the same breath)
               Dr. Yueh, put the weirding module on him.

     Thufir, noticing a SQUAD OF GUARDS at the other end
     of the training room, calls out to them.

                     THUFIR (CONT'D)
               Clear and lock the room.

     Gurney activates a series of locks.  LIGHTS GLOWS
     above each doorway.

                     THUFIR (CONT'D)
               Activate a fighter.

25C. ROBOT FIGHT

     Suddenly a FIGHTER ROBOT lowers from the ceiling.
     As the robot begins to rotate and go through several
     frightening, complicated movements, Dr. Yueh places
     a plastic device around Paul's neck.  He tightens it
     around the Adam's apple above Paul's voice box.
     Paul turns and emits a very strange, powerful sound
     through the weirding module as he rushes towards the
     robot.

                         GURNEY
                    (to Yueh)
               Precise control....

26.  INT. HALLWAY - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     The hallway is empty in the foreground but in the
     distance a changing of the guard is seen.

26A. through 26B.   (Deleted)

27.  INT. HALLWAY - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     Paul walks down the stairway.  In the distance,
     moving troops are packing Atreides belongings.
     Beyond, Paul sees some troops carrying a large
     bull's head.  The horns are covered with dried
     blood.

                          PAUL
               The bull that killed my grandfather... is
               this an evil omen?

     Suddenly, DUNCAN IDAHO appears from behind the giant
     black head.

                          PAUL
                    (happily)
               Duncan!

                         DUNCAN
               Paul.
                    (they shake hands)
               I was on my way to say goodbye to you.  I
               have to go on ahead.

                          PAUL
               Why?  I wish you were coming with us.

                         DUNCAN
               It's something for your father.  He wants
               to talk to you.
                    (places hand on Paul's chest)
               I'll see you in Arrakis.  May the hand of
               God be with you.

                          PAUL
               May the hand of God be with us all,
               Duncan.

28.  EXT. CLIFF WALL - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     Paul walks to meet his father near the wall.

                          PAUL
                    (diffident)
               Father.

                        DUKE LETO
               Thank you for joining me, Paul.
                    (voice tired)
               It will be good to get to our new home and
               have all this upset behind us.

28B. DUKE LETO AND PAUL AGAINST SEA

     They look out over the sea.  A huge wave crashes
     below.

     The Duke turns to Paul.

                   DUKE LETO (CONT'D)
                    (inner voice)
               My son.
                    (out loud)
               Thufir Hawat has served House Atreides
               three generations....  He swears you are
               the finest student he's ever taught.
               Yueh, Gurney and Duncan say the same....
               It makes me feel very proud...

                          PAUL
               I want you to be proud of me.

     Paul smiles up at his father.  The WIND blows the
     Duke's hair and behind him stands the castle and the
     green and black Atreides banner against the night
     sky beyond.  The RAIN starts again -- lightly.  Paul
     takes a closer look at the Atreides banner moving in
     the wind.

                        DUKE LETO
                    (studying the dark sea below)
               I'll miss the sea... but a person needs
               new experiences... they jar something deep
               inside, allowing him to grow.  Without
               change, something sleeps inside us... and
               seldom awakens... The sleeper must awaken.

     Paul's attention goes to his father's hand where he
     sees the Duke's signet ring.  Again he smiles at his
     father.

                                                FADE TO:

29. through 29A.    (Deleted)

30.  INT. PAUL'S ROOM - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     Paul is sweating during his sleep and WHISPERS as if
     struggling with some disturbing thought.
--
                          PAUL
               Arrakis... Dune... Desert
               Planet...Arrakis... Desert Planet...
               moving... moving.

31.  DARK WATER - MENTAL IMAGE

     We see Paul's dream. It is very dark.

                       PAUL (V.O.)
               Arrakis... Dune... Desert Planet.

     Suddenly a drop falls into the black, and white hot
     widening rings appear on the dark water's surface.

     Darkness again. Two moons rise in the darkness. As
     the second appears:

                          VOICE
               The second moon, your moon...

31A. INT. RESERVOIR - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     Dark again. A figure turns toward Paul. It is a
     BEAUTIFUL GIRL in deep shadow. She speaks.

                     BEAUTIFUL GIRL
               Tell me of your homeworld, Usul.

32.  INT. PAUL'S ROOM - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     CU Paul's face in fitful sleep.

33.  EXT. COURTYARD - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     In a small stone courtyard, the back-lit figure of a
     woman moves towards us through the heavy RAIN and
     darkness. As she nears us, the large, protective
     glowglobe overtakes her and in an instant we see a
     beautiful woman -- JESSICA.

                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice)
               I  know she has come to test him... no man
               has ever been tested with the box... only
               Bene Gesserit women. I may lose my son.

     The doors open, she meets the Reverend Mother Gaius
     Helen Mohiam (the Emperor's truthsayer) and takes
     her back toward the Castle. The rain rushes loudly
     into the storm drains.
--
34.  INT. PAUL'S ROOM - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

                          PAUL
                    (whispering again)
               Arrakis... Dune... Desert planet...
               moving... moving.

     CU Paul's face.

     Paul's eyes snap open. He hears footsteps outside
     his door. As the door opens he closes his eyes,
     however, and he pretends to be asleep. Jessica and
     the Reverend Mother enter and stand in the doorway
     looking at him.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               We'll salvage what we can... but I can
               tell you.. dear God... for the father...
               nothing.

     Jessica turns to the Reverend Mother, stunned! She
     turns back to look at Paul. Her hands tremble.

                REVEREND MOTHER (CONT'D)
               Did you really think that you could bear
               the Kwisatz Haderach?... How dare you!

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               My greatest student... and my greatest
               disappointment.... He's awake!... He's
               listening to us.
                    (considering)
               Good... Ready yourself, young Paul
               Atreides... I want to see you in your
               mother's chamber in one quarter of an
               hour.

     She turns and walks away. Jessica remains at the
     door and calls out to Paul in the darkness.

                         JESSICA
               Paul?... This is very important...

     Jessica leaves, closing the door behind her. Paul
     sits up in bed.

                          PAUL
               Kwisatz Haderach?... For the father...
               nothing?

35.  INT. JESSICA'S CHAMBER - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     Jessica and the Reverend Mother enter. It is quite
     dark. Jessica WHISPERS a code number and a glowglobe
     LIGHTS on a very dim setting.

               daughters to the Atreides... Jessica!

                         JESSICA
               It meant so much to him...

               You thought only of a Duke's desire for a
               son?... Desires don't figure in this! An
               Atreides daughter could have been wed to a
               Harkonnen heir and sealed the breach. We
               may lose both blood lines now.

                         JESSICA
               I vowed never to regret my decision. I'll
               pay for my own mistakes.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               And your son will pay with you.

42.  INT. DUKE LETO'S QUARTERS - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     Under a dim glowglobe, the DUKE is writing a note on
     a scroll-like piece of paper.

     Finishing reading, the Duke seals the message in a
     cylinder and presses his signet ring, with a red
     hawk symbol of House of Atreides, into a hole, which
     seals the cylinder with a swift HISSING.

     He pauses, studying the metal tube. With a VOICE
     COMMAND, he extinguishes the glowglobe above him. He
     leans back in his chair as lightning flashes outside
     the window.

     FADE TO:

35.  BACK TO SCENE

     Paul enters the room and Jessica closes the door
     behind them.

                         JESSICA
               Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius
               Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe
               you...
                    (to Reverend Mother)
               Please...
--
                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Jessica, you know it must be done. I
               enjoin you to stand guard at the door and
               practice the meditation of peace.

                         JESSICA
               Your Reverence.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               What does she fear?
                    (out loud)
               What about my Father?

                         JESSICA
               Paul... please, Paul... listen to the
               Reverend Mother and do what she tells you.

     Jessica leaves the room. The Reverend Mother speaks
     to Paul using The Voice, a Bene Gesserit training
     which permits an adept to control others merely by
     selected tone shadings of the voice. It sounds as if
     two people are talking -- one normal and the other
     gutteral and slightly electronic. The effect is
     strange, yet subtle.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
                    (using The Voice)
               Now you come here.

     Paul finds he cannot help but obey her, yet he
     fights her controlling him.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               She's using The Voice.
                    (out loud)
               No.

     She sees him struggling.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
                    (inner voice)
               Some strength there. Surprising!
                    (out loud)
               Come here.

     The Reverend Mother holds up a green metal cube.

                REVEREND MOTHER (CONT'D)
               See this... Put your right hand in the
               box.

     Paul stares at the hole in the box.
--
                          PAUL
               What's in the box?

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Pain.

     Just then, she raises one hand to his neck. Paul
     sees a glint of metal. He tries to back away.

                REVEREND MOTHER (CONT'D)
                    (The Voice)
               STOP! Put your hand in the box.

     Paul's hand goes in. Fear passes over his face.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               The Voice again.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't
               pull away or you'll feel that poison. A
               Duke's son must know about many poisons --
               this one kills only animals.

                          PAUL
               Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an
               animal?

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Let us say I suggest you may be human.
               Your awareness may be powerful enough to
               control your instincts. Your instincts
               will be to remove your hand from the box.
               If you do so you will die. You will feel
               an itching -- there... see? Now the
               itching becomes burning... heat, upon
               heat, upon heat.

                          PAUL
                    (whispering)
               It burns.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               SILENCE... SILENCE.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)(struggling to compose
                    himself)
               I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer.
               Fear is the little death that brings total
               obliteration. I will face my fear... I
               will permit it to pass over me and through
               me.
--
     The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her
     ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches
     away breathes hotly. She is smiling.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               You feel the flesh crisping?

36.  THE HAND - PAUL'S MENTAL IMAGE

     Paul's inner mind sees his hand on fire with all
     sorts of sores. The skin is bubbling.

37.  INT. JESSICA'S CHAMBER - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Flesh dropping off.

38.  THE HAND - PAUL'S MENTAL IMAGE

     He pictures this. The destruction of his hand is
     complete -- now only blood spurts out and burns.

39.  INT. JESSICA'S CHAMBER - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     Paul's face registers extreme pain.

                          PAUL
                    (cannot help the explosion)
               THE PAIN!

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               NO!! ENOUGH!! Kull wahad! No woman child
               ever withstood that much. I must have
               wanted you to fail. Take your hand out of
               the box and look at it, young human.... Do
               it!

     Paul pulls his hand out of the box. No sign of
     anything wrong. He turns his hand, flexes his
     fingers. He looks to the Reverend Mother.

                REVEREND MOTHER (CONT'D)
                    (explaining)
               Pain by nerve induction... A human can
               resist any pain. Our test is crisis and
               observation.

                          PAUL
               I see the truth of it.
--
                     REVEREND MOTHER
                    (inner voice)
               Could he be the one?... Maybe... but will
               he be ours to control?
                    (out loud)
               You know when people speak the truth?

                          PAUL
               I know it.

     Suddenly the Reverend Mother holds her hand against
     Paul's head. She closes her eyes.

40.  INT. RESERVOIR - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT - REVEREND
MOTHER'S MENTAL IMAGE

     She sees a blurred image of Paul's earlier dream.
     She sees the beautiful girl turn. She hears a
     muffled voice say "Tell me of your homeworld, Usul".

41.  INT. JESSICA'S CHAMBER - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Your mother wants you to tell me about
               your dreams. I only want to know one
               thing.... Do they come true?

                          PAUL
               Not all of them... I know which ones will.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.

                          PAUL
               What is it?

                     REVEREND MOTHER
                    (profoundly)
               The person who can be many places at
               once... the one who bridges space and
               time.... He will look where we cannot.

                          PAUL
               Where?

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Do you know of the Water of Life?... the
               Truthsayer drug?

                          PAUL
               I have heard of it.
--
                     REVEREND MOTHER
               It is very dangerous... very painful. The
               Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see
               within.... There is a place terrifying to
               us... to women. It is said a man will
               come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go
               where we cannot... Many men have tried...

                          PAUL
               Did they try and fail?

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               They tried and died....
                    (she calls out loudly)
               Jessica!

     Jessica enters immediately and sees with great
     relief that Paul is still active.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               I sense your teachings in him. Ignore the
               regular order of training. His safety
               requires The Voice.

                          PAUL
               I've heard enough of my safety... What
               about my father?... I heard you talking.
               You speak as if he was dead. Well, he
               isn't!

                         JESSICA
               Paul!

     She tries to hold him.

                          PAUL
               Well he isn't... and he won't die... Tell
               me he won't die!

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               What can be done has been done.

                          PAUL
               MOTHER! Tell me!

     The Reverend Mother covers herself and moves quickly
     to the door.

46.  EXT. GEIDI PRIME - DAY

     HOME PLANET OF HOUSE HARKONNEN - As seen from space,
     the black planet as we saw it in Paul's filmbook.

47.  EXT. GEIDI PRIME - DAY

     The surface of the planet is a vast sea of black
     oil. A small cable car traverses high above the sea
     toward a gigantic black city in the shape of a
     rectangular box over 100 stories high. Before the
     city there are rows of huge black towering steel
     heads atop massive furnaces. SMOKE billows out of
     their mouths.

48.  INT. CABLE CAR - GIEDI PRIME - DAY

     Inside the cable car stands PITER. In one hand he
     holds the cylinder with DUKE Leto's ring imprint.

                          PITER
               It is by will alone I set my mind in
               motion.
               It is by the juice of Sapho that thoughts
               acquire speed -
               The lips acquire stains -
               The stains become a warning -
               It is by will alone I set my mind in
               motion.

48A. INT. GREEN PORCELAIN ROOM - GEIDI PRIME

     Somewhere in the interior of Geidi Prime, we are in
     a green porcelain room. Two large Harkonnen
     soldiers, using large hoses, are washing down the
     walls and floors of the room. WE MOVE DOWN into the
     water rushing along the floor towards troughs.
     Closer, WE SEE bits of flesh, hair, and blood.

49.  EXT. GEIDI PRIME - DAY

     The car zooms past gigantic faces, and the furnaces
     far below ROAR with tremendous power. The city now
     looms gigantic and overpowering -- millions of
     electrical cables stretch off the top into dark
     energy taps above the city.
--
50.  INT. GEIDI PRIME - DAY

     Inside the city the cable car passes into a huge
     inner chamber filled with open-topped lime green
     porcelain rooms with tremendous electrical lines
     criss-crossing above.

52.  INT. BARON'S ROOM - GEIDI PRIME - DAY

     In front of a huge steam boiler, the cable car stops
     and Piter gets out, steps down steel stairs and
     enters a porcelain room where the Baron is being
     treated by a DOCTOR for sores on his face and body.
     The doctor uses a lasbeam on a big sore on the
     Baron's lips. The Baron is sickly and hugely fat and
     sweaty and looks like he has been sickly for some
     time. He turns to Piter as he enters the room.

                          PITER
               My Lord!

                          BARON
               Piter.

     Piter moves up to the Baron.

                          PITER
               The Atreides will be leaving Caladan soon,
               Baron, and I have here your answer from
               Duke Leto.

                          BARON
               What does Leto say, Piter?

                          PITER
               He wishes to inform you that Vendetta --
               as he puts it, using the ancient tongue,
               the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He
               does not wish to meet or speak with you.

                          BARON
                    (swallowing; angry)
               I made my peace gesture... the forms of
               Kanly have been obeyed.

     He throws down the cylinder.

                          PITER
               As you instructed me, I have enlightened
               your nephews concerning my plan t...
--
                          BARON
               My plan!

                          PITER
               The plan to crush the Atreides.  Feyd,
               Rabban... go quietly... no other great
               house of the Landsraad must ever know of
               the Emperor's aid to the Baron.  The
               entire Landsraad would turn against the
               Baron and the Emperor.

                         DOCTOR
               Put the pick in there Pete
               And turn it round real neat.

     His assistant does so.

     Rabban breaks open a squood (living food).  The
     squood makes a tiny SCREAM, then Rabban drinks the
     blood and bodily fluids.  He throws the empty
     container of tiny animal meat into the dark water
     trough running through the center of the room.
     Across the room, TWO HARKONNEN SOLDIERS enter,
     holding big guns on a BOY who is wearing white
     pants.  The Baron smiles when he sees the boy, who
     is deeply afraid.  The guards force the boy to
     arrange violet flowers on a stand by the far wall
     opposite the Baron.

                          BARON
                    (as the Baron watches the boy)
               You're so beautiful my Baron
               Your skin, love to me
               Your diseases lovingly cared for
               For all eternity.

                          BARON
               I will have Arrakis back for myself... he
               who controls the Spice, controls the
               universe... and what Piter didn't tell you
               is we have control of someone who is very
               close to Duke Leto.  This person... this
               traitor... will be worth more to us than
               ten legions of Sardaukar.

                          FEYD
               Who is the traitor?

                          BARON
                    (laughs)
               I won't tell you who the traitor is or
               when we'll attack.  However, the Duke will
               die before these eyes and he'll know that
               it is I -- Baron Vladimir Harkonnen -- who
               encompasses his doom.
--
     The Baron gives a hand signal and seven gates in the
     wall open, emitting tremendous SOUNDS.  Suddenly the
     Baron begins to float straight up, twenty-five feet
     in the air.  It is a frightening sight.  He floats
     down under the giant, humming electrical tube light
     and rubs his head and body with a black fluid which
     drips from tiny holes in either side of the pink
     glow.  Feyd and Rabban watch nervously.  The
     Attendants stand completely still with fear.

     The Baron swoops down to the Boy, who stands
     petrified.  The Harkonnen guards smile nervously as
     they step slightly backwards.  The boy begins
     SCREAMING as the Baron pulls the boy's heart plug,
     located in his chest.  The violet flowers are bumped
     and disarrayed by the violence which ensues.  Then
     the Baron turns smiling to Feyd as the SOUNDS
     continue to roar.

52C. EXT. ATREIDES SHIP - CALADAN - DAY

     A DRUM CORPS pounds out a powerful cadence in front
     of a water and cannon show as the Duke, Paul and
     Jessica mount the steel stairs to their ship.  In
     the doorway, they turn back for a final look.

     The Duke places a hand on Paul's shoulder.  We see
     the signet ring.  Jessica is there.  She tries to
     get Paul to look at her but he scowls and turns to
     his father.

                         JESSICA

               I must not fear.  Fear is the mind-

               total obliteration...

     The door of the spaceship closes.

53.  EXT. HEIGHLINER - SPACE

     3,415 Atreides ships are approaching the Guild
     Heighliner, which is staggeringly colossal.  The
     Atreides ships look like dots next to the sun.  The
     Duke's ship enters the frame and moves toward the
     Heighliner.

     Paul, Jessica and Duke Leto look out the forward
     viewing glass as tiny lights move outside in the
     darkness. They hear and feel their ship stop with a
     huge, echoing, metallic jolt. They look at each
     other in the silence which follows.

                        DUKE LETO
               Soon they'll begin to fold space.

57.  INT. CONTROL ROOM - HEIGHLINER - SPACE

     We pass through electrical shields into a 2,000-foot
     high control room filled with orange spice gas. On
     the floor are large gratings covering an exhaust and
     filtering system. Tons of spice gas are being
     converted into the clouds of gas along a wall of
     machinery. From within a dark metal tunnel comes a
     Guild Navigator. He exits the tunnel and swims
     through the gas 1,000 feet to a six-dimensional
     layered miniature replica of the entire Universe.
     The Navigator emits a long piece of light from his
     mouth which travels to one edge of the Universe and
     changes into a likeness of the planet Caladan. The
     Navigator turns and emits another piece of light
     which travels to the opposite side of the Universe.
     It changes into a likeness of Arrakis. The Navigator
     begins to put his slender fingers in amongst the
     stars and he emits SOUNDS and bursts of light into
     the mass of stars and galaxies. The Universe begins
     to vibrate and elongate, then to curve. Electrical
     lightening traverses from Caladan to Arrakis as the
     Universe bends into a U-shape. Arrakis submerges
     deep into the light. The navigator swims to the
     point where Arrakis disappeared. He begins to pull
     and tear a hole in the Universe. Stars like sparks
     and SOUNDS and rings of light appear, along with a
     roaring WIND. The Navigator swims deep into this
     hole through the rings of light. The Navigator
     becomes more and more transparent, until he's lost
     in darkness. The sounds fade.

     The engineers activate a series of atometric
     Holtzman generators. Suddenly SOUNDS begin. The
     machines start; at first low, then they WHINE
     upwards to a high pitch. When the pitch is steady, a
     series of levers are pulled.

     Two giant glowglobes drift into the Great Hall where
     Jessica and Dr. Yueh stand watching a giant bull's
     head is being hung above the massive fireplace. The
     MOVING TROOPS are unpacking crates and organizing
     furnishings. Jessica watches them. Distant SOUNDS
     reverberate inside an elaborate air vent beside
     them.

                        DR. YUEH
               Listen here.... You can here the people of
               Arrakeen outside.... Can you here the cry
               "Soo Soo Sook" of the water sellers?

                         JESSICA
               So many reminders of the scarcity of
               water.

                        DR. YUEH
               Have you noticed the line of palms along
               the wall... the Harkonnen put them in...
               to flaunt their water wealth in front of
               these people.... Each day those palms take
               enough water to sustain the life of one
               hundred men.

                         JESSICA
               The way you say Harkonnen... I didn't know
               you had so much reason to hate them.

                        DR. YUEH

               signs are al over him.... They must have
               killed here.

     Jessica sees a droplet of sweat break out on Yueh's
     cheek.

                        DR. YUEH
               I'm sorry I'm unable to talk about it.

     Above them a series of iron curtains begins to open
     over deep rock window slots, sending  narrow shafts
     of light down across the room. TWO ATREIDES WOMEN in
     uniform approach.

                    ATREIDES WOMAN #1
                    (referring to several robed figures
                    standing in the room)
               My lady... the local people... the maids
               and servants await your inspection. Hawat
               has cleared them.

     Dr. Yueh turns to Jessica.

                        DR. YUEH
               The Harkonnens may have tampered
               medically.... please wait.

     He turns a yellow light on a moves it over the
     crowd. The yellow light beam plays over the blue-
     within-blue eyes. One of the women, the Shadout
     Mapes, watches Jessica continuously. Yueh's hand
     shakes slightly.

                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice; noticing Yueh's hands)
               He's hiding something -- holding something
               back.
                    (She studies his face closely.)
               It's not just his wife... He's a good man
               though. He's probably trying to save my
               feelings...
                    (We see her mouth.)
               I could use The Voice... make him tell
               me... It would only shame him.
                    (We see her eyes.)
               I must place more trust in my friends.
                    (We see Yueh turn toward her,
                    fearful.)

     Paul wanders through the darkened passageways alone,
     his footsteps echoing as goes. He takes pleasure
     observing the details of the rock Palace but all the

     builds in him.

78.  INT. PAUL'S BEDROOM - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY

     Paul enters a small bedroom and sits down on the
     bed. He opens the filmbook, and activates it.

78A. INSERT - FILMBOOK

     We SEE a gigantic carryall lower down above a spice
     harvester and pick it up off the desert floor as a
     narrator speaks over.

                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
               One carryall handles four spice mining
               teams; however, it will fly only two
               harvesters at a time. Today, we have nine
               hundred and thirty harvesters and nine
               hundred and eighty-one carryalls....

78.  BACK TO SCENE

     Paul looks up. Across the room he sees a tray of
     small pastries which have been laid out. He goes to
     them and scans them with his poison detector, which
     he carries on his belt. A pleasant tone SOUNDS and
     the word "safe" appears in green light. Paul takes a
     pastry bites it and turns back towards the bed.
     Suddenly he stops. He looks at the pastry.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               Spice...

     As he continues eating he notices the sunlight
     through the slates over the window begins to GLOW
     white hot. Paul's eyes are intense as the light
     GLOWS brilliantly.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)

               is still training, but everything is
               shielded.... With the shielding, we are
               impenetrable. Dr. Kynes is waiting, Sire,
               for your inspection of spice mining
               operations, but since the attempt of the
               young master, I am against your leaving

               Harkonnen machine on Arrakis.... You all
               know what to do.
                    (Turning towards Gurney)

               miners... many are threatening to leave on

               Noble Born. What are your orders.

                         JESSICA
               You may refer to me as "my lady." I am not
               noble born. I'm the bound concubine of
               Duke Leto -- mother of the heir
               designate.... "Shadout"... that's an
               ancient word.

                          MAPES
                    (strangely asked)
               You know the ancient tongues?

                         JESSICA
               I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all
               the hunting languages.

                          MAPES
               As the legend says.

                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice)
               That's it! The Missionaria Protectiva has
               been here planting protective legends
               against a day of Bene Gesserit need. And
               that day has come. I must play out this
               sham.
                    (out loud)
               I know the Dark things and the way of the
               Great Mother. Miseces prejin.

     Mapes takes a step backward to flee.

                    JESSICA (CONT'D)
               I know many things. I know you came
               prepared for violence with a weapon in
               your bodice.
--
                          MAPES
               My lady, I... the weapon was sent as a
               gift if you should prove to be the one.

                         JESSICA
               And the means of my death should I prove
               otherwise.
                    (inner voice)
               Now we will see which way the decision
               tips.

     Slowly Mapes reaches into her dress and brings out a
     sheathed knife. She unleashes it.

                          MAPES
               Do you know this my lady?

                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice)
               It could only be one thing....
                    (out loud)
               It's a crysknife.

                          MAPES
               Say it not lightly...
                    (very slowly)
               Do you know its meaning?

                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice)
               Here is why this Fremen has taken service
               with me, to ask that one question. Delay
               is as dangerous as the wrong answer.
               Shadout is Chakobsa... knife, in Chakobsa
               is... maker of death.
                    (out loud)
               It's a maker...

     Mapes SCREAMS with elation and grief.

                    JESSICA (CONT'D)
                    (inner voice)
               Maker?... Maker is the key word... the
               tooth of the worm? That was close...
                    (out loud)
               Did you think that I, knowing the
               mysteries of the Great Mother, would not
               know the maker?

                          MAPES
               My lady, when one has lived with prophecy
               for so long, the moment of revelation is a
               shock.

     Mapes sheathes the blade... slowly
--
                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice)
               There's more here... yes!
                    (out loud)
               Mapes, you've sheathed that blade
               unblooded.

     With a GASP Mapes drops the knife into Jessica's
     hands and opens her blouse.

                          MAPES
               Take the water of my life!

     Jessica withdraws the knife from the sheath and,
     with the blade, scratches a line just above Mapes'
     right breast.

                     MAPES (CONT'D)
               You are ours.... You are the one.

     Jessica's eyes stare ahead. She knows these words
     ring with truth.

93.  INT. TUNNEL - OBSERVATION ROOM - ARRAKEEN PALACE -
DAY

     The Duke, Paul and SEVERAL ARMED GUARDS enter a
     tunnel to a `thopter landing pad which is
     illuminated by a shaft of light coming from a
     chimney-like exit above. DR. KYNES and his Fremen
     guard are standing next to Gurney.

                          KYNES
                    (to Gurney)
               So, this is Leto the Just...

                         GURNEY
                    (sharply)
               I hope I made myself clear. You may call
               him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And
               there is a more ancient term you might
               keep in mind -- "Noble Born."

                          KYNES
                    (inner voice)
               Play out your little comedy while you can
               off-worlders...

     Gurney turns and activates a device...

93A. INSERT - ORNITHOPTER OPENING

     ...which causes the ornithopter behind to fold open
     ready for flight.

93B. INT. TUNNEL - OBSERVATION ROOM - ARRAKEEN PALACE -
DAY

     The two parties meet and are introduced.

                        DUKE LETO
               So you are Dr. Kynes, the Imperial
               Ecologist?

                          KYNES
                    (turning to Gurney)
               I prefer the more ancient term,
               planetologist... Noble Born.

                        DUKE LETO
               This is my son, Paul.

                          PAUL
               Are you a Fremen?

                          KYNES
               I am a servant of the His Majesty the
               Emperor. I have served His Majesty on
               Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               He's hiding something.

                        DUKE LETO
               I understand we have you to thank for
               these stillsuits, Doctor.

                          KYNES
               They are Fremen suits. I hope they fit
               well, my lord.

                          PAUL
               "Your gift is a blessing of the river."

     Kynes' FREMEN GUARDS, hearing this are siezed with
     agitation. Kynes QUIETS them, then studies Paul.

                          KYNES
                    (inner voice)
               The Mahdi will greet you with holy words
               and your gifts will be a blessing.
                    (spoken, nonchalantly)
               Most of the desert natives here are a
               superstitious lot. They mean no harm. With
               your permission, I will check the security
               of your suits.

     Gurney and the guard move forward warily.

                         GURNEY
                    (angrily)
               The Duke is to be addresses as...
--
     Kynes comes forward and adjusts the Duke's suit,
     checking seals and pulling on straps.

                          KYNES
               Basically...

                         GURNEY
                    (leaping forward to protect his Duke)
               Sire!

                        DUKE LETO
               It's all right Gurney.

     Gurney steps back.

                         GURNEY
               Yes, Sire.

                          KYNES
               It's a high-efficiency filter and heat
               exchange system. Perspiration passes
               through the first layer and is gathered in
               the second. The salt is separated.
               Breathing and walking provide the pumping
               action. The reclaimed water circulates to
               catchpockets from which you can drink
               through this tube at your neck. Urine and
               feces are processed in the thigh pads.
               Should you be in the open desert, remember
               to breathe in through your mouth, out
               through the nose tubes.

     The Duke is now properly fitted. Kynes places the
     noseplug into his nose.

                     KYNES (CONT'D)
               With a Fremen suit in good working order,
               one can sustain life for weeks, even in
               the deep desert.

     He removes the noseplug.

                        DUKE LETO
               My thanks.

                          KYNES
               With your permission...

     Kynes turns to Paul, running his hands over the
     slick fabric. He stands back with a puzzled
     expression.
--
                          KYNES
               You've worn a stillsuit before?

                          PAUL
               No.

                          KYNES
     Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how
     to do that?

                          PAUL
               No one. It... seemed the proper way.

                          KYNES
               That it is.
                    (inner voice)
               He shall know your ways as if born to
               them.

     Kyne's Fremen guard are watching Paul very closely
     now.

                         GURNEY
               We're wasting time, Sire.

     Duke Leto, Dr. Kynes, Gurney and Paul enter the
     ornithopter...

               Southeast over the Shield Wall. That's
               where I told your sandmaster to
               concentrate his harvesting.

95.  EXT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER - DAY

     They crest the top of the wall which opens out into
     a black, level expanse of rock, cratered and
     fractured. On the other side is the huge, seemingly
     endless plain of sand, the Great Desert. In the hazy
     distance, flashes of light can be seen.

96.  INT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER - DAY

                          PAUL
               Will we see a worm?

                          KYNES
               Where there is spice and spice mining
               there are always worms.

                          PAUL
               Always?

                          KYNES
               Always.

                          PAUL
               Why do they come?

                          KYNES
               To protect their territory. Vibrations
               attract them.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               I've registered him now... a knife is a
               sheath on his left arm... He's strong... a
               person born to command... He's hiding many
               things.
                    (out loud, suddenly)
               Is there a relationship between the worms
               and the spice?

     Kynes turns instantly and stares at Paul. Gurney
     sees the wonder in Kynes' eyes.

                         GURNEY
               The young master is a trained Mentat, an
               advanced student of Prana Bindu has
               studied under some of the finest teachers
               in the Universe.

     Kynes takes a second look at young Paul.

                          KYNES
               As I said... they defend the spice sands.
               As to their relationship with the spice...
               who knows.

                          KYNES
               That's it... spice mining... no other
               cloud quite like it. See the spotters over
               it? They're watching for wormsign... the
               telltale sand waves. Seismic probes on the
               surface, too Sire... worms can travel too
               deep for their waves to show... Looks like
               a good patch of spice.

                        DUKE LETO
               Wormsign? Is it wormsign?
--
                          KYNES
               Yes!... worm. Big one! You've got sharp
               eyes Sire.... May I?

     Kynes grabs the microphone and dials in the correct
     frequency.

     Kynes clicks off the radio.

               What happens now?

                          KYNES
               The carryall will come and lift off the
               spice harvester. Try and get in close over

                        DUKE LETO
               Damn it... Harkonnens.

     He punches a control button and grabs a microphone.

                   DUKE LETO (CONT'D)
                    (into microphone)
               We are coming down to take you off the
               harvester... All spotters are ordered to
               comply.

                    (angrily)
               Duke Leto Atreides....

     Gurney and Paul turn to each other, worried.

                          VOICE
                    (over radio)
               Yes... yes, Sire!

                        DUKE LETO
               How many men do you have?

                          VOICE
                    (over radio)
               Full crew -- twenty-six men -- but Sire,
               we can't leave this spice...

                        DUKE LETO
               Damn the spice! Get out of there.

103. EXT. HARVESTER - DESERT - DAY

     All the spotters begin landing and the Duke descends
     directly in front of the harvester which has stopped
     mining yet emits a tremendous rythmic GRINDING
     noise. No one is coming out.

104. INT./EXT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER/DESERT - DAY

     Gurney nervously scans the sky for enemy ships. A
     very low, powerful SOUND starts now and the ground
     begins to shake.

     A hatch opens and MEN come pouring out.

               Two men in each of the spotters... You!...
               over here... run!!

     The ground is really shaking now.  A tremendous low
     THUNDERING sound grows along with a high rasping
     HISS.

                          KYNES
                    (to Paul and Gurney -- yelling over
                    the noise)

                        DUKE LETO
                    (out loud to himself as he watches
                    the men scrambling)
               Damn sloppy -- really damn sloppy.

     FOUR MEN begin tumbling into the Duke's machine.

                         GURNEY
               Come on boys... come on.
                    (Then, to the Duke)
               We're going to be heavy, Sire.

     The men press on Gurney and Paul.  Paul can feel the
     fear. The sound is a horrible ROAR and deeper
     RUMBLING now and the `thopter is vibrating and
     shaking violently.  The air suddenly begins to SPARK
     with static electricity.

                          KYNES
                    (nervous)
               Here he is... We've got to go.

     The Duke closes the doorways, surveys the area one
     last time, then takes the controls.

106A.     INT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER - DAY

     The ship strains and lifts off -- slowly.

     Paul sees the brown powder clumped on the suits of
     the men... their bluish eyes.  He smells the spice.
     He begins to feel its affect.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice as a blinding light
                    comes and goes)
               Spice!... pure un-refined spice!

                          KYNES
                    (murmuring)
               Bless the Maker and his water... Bless the
               coming and going of him.  May his passage
               cleanse the world.

                        DUKE LETO
                    (yelling)
               What's that you're saying?

                          KYNES
               Nothing.

     A spice miner turns and sees Kynes, who remains
     silent.

                    (astonished)
               Liet!

                     SPICE MINER #2
               Shhhhh.

     Paul hears this, then looks to Kynes -- locks on his
     image.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               Liet?

                    (pointing down and yelling)
               You are about to witness something few
               have seen -- watch!  Watch!

     Paul looks down as the Duke banks over the
     harvester.

107. EXT. HARVESTER - DESERT - DAY

Static electricity is IGNITING in the air and the sand is
swirling around the harvester.  Then they see it.  A wide
hole emerges from the sand, glistening spokes within it.
The hole is twice the size of the harvester.  Suddenly
the machine turns and slides into the hole, parts of it
EXPLODING.  The SOUND is deafening.  The Duke's ship is
WHINING to stay aloft.

108. INT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER - DAY

                         GURNEY
               Gods, what a monster.

               Someone is going to pay for this... I
               promise.

                          KYNES
                    (inner voice -- as he studies the
                    Duke)
               This Duke is more concerned over his men
               than the spice!  I must admit... against
               all better judgement... I like this Duke.

     Duke Leto walks into the room.  The NIGHT GUARD
     comes to attention as he passes.  DUNCAN IDAHO,
     wearing a dark, dusty stillsuit, emerges from the
     shadows.  DUKE LETO and DUNCAN meet at the foot of
     the steps.  The men embrace and separate.

                        DUKE LETO
                    (happily)
               Duncan!  What have you discovered about
               the Fremen, Duncan -- tell me.  Why
               haven't we heard from you?

                         DUNCAN
               My lord... I suspect so much.  I think
               they are the allies we seek... they are
               strong and fierce... they do not give
               their loyalty easily or quickly....  As
               you know, the Imperium has never been able
               to take a census of the Fremen.  Everyone
               thinks that there are but few -- wandering
               here and there in the desert.... My lord,
               I suspect an incredible secret has been
               kept on this planet... that the Fremen
               exist in vast numbers... vast numbers...
               and it is they that control Arrakis.

     The Duke smiles at Paul then leaves the room, but

     The BARON's face --  expressionless.  The SOUND of
     his ship screams in the background.  The DOCTOR is
     seated beside him.

118  INT. SUB-BASEMENT PASSAGEWAY - ARRAKEEN PALACE -
NIGHT

     The Duke walks down the steps to a very narrow
     passageway.  The passageway becomes very dark.

     Suddenly the Duke hears a strange MEWLING sound.  He
     turns down an even darker passageway.  He can hear
     the shield WHINING in the distance.  He almost has
     to feel his way.  Up ahead he sees a shape.  He
     bends down and sees the SHADOUT MAPES dying on the
     cold stone floor in the darkness.  She tries to
     speak but cannot.  She falls.  Suddenly the Duke
     HEARS the shield generator start whining down.

                        DUKE LETO
               What happened?  What?
                    (as Mapes dies)
               The shield!

     The Duke reaches to activate his shield be a large
     dart is shot into his shoulder.  The Duke lurches
     upwards then tumbles to the ground.  Out of the
     darkness comes Dr. Yueh.  The dart drops and
     CLATTERS as if a dream.

                   DUKE LETO (CONT'D)
                    (mind racing -- struggling)
               Yueh!

               He's sabotaged the house generators, we're

                    (with self-disgust)
               I've brought House Atreides down.  I've
               destroyed the new army's weirding modules.

                    (hoarse whisper)
               ... Why?

     The generator WHINES lower and lower
--
                          YUEH
               I wish to kill a man... not you, my dear
               Duke, but the Baron....  You were dead
               already... but you will be close to the
               Baron before you die.  You will be tied
               and drugged but you can still attack.
               When you see the Baron you will have a new
               poison tooth.  He will want you close so
               he can gloat over you.  One bite on this
               tooth and a strong exile...

                        DUKE LETO
               Refuse...

                          YUEH
               No! -- You mustn't... for in return I will
               save the lives of your Paul and Jessica.

     Yueh removes the Duke's signet ring and shows it to
     him.

                      YUEH (CONT'D)
               For Paul...

     He implants the tooth.

     Yueh becomes more and more blurred.  His image
     begins to fade.  His lips move in the darkness.  The
     generator WHINE is low and going lower and lower.

                      YUEH (CONT'D)
               When you see the Baron, remember the
               tooth!  The tooth!

     through bodies and thick smoke.  Gurney has the

     Duncan attacks and fights valiantly but he is

     dark against the passageway walls.

132. EXT. PALACE - ARRAKEEN - NIGHT

     FIRE and SMOKE.

133. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - ARRAKEEN PALACE - NIGHT

     The Baron's face, the light of FIRE and EXPLOSIONS
     playing over it.  The Baron turns as Piter ushers in
     the traitor Yueh.

                          BARON
                    (to Yueh - quietly)
               You wish now to join your wife, is that
               it, traitor?

     A sudden flash of hope crosses Yueh's face.

                          YUEH
               She lives?

     The Baron smiles, almost sympathetically.

                          BARON
               You wish to join her... join her, then.

     Piter moves to Yueh, a knife glistening in his hand.
     It flashes into his back.  A GASP escapes Yueh's
     throat, a sad look passing over his face, as if to
     say "I thought as much."  He stands stiffly, then
     falls gasping.  He tastes his own blood, then dies.

                          BARON
               Take him away.

144. EXT. GROUNDS - ARRAKEEN PALACE - NIGHT

     Black smoke palms.

145. EXT. LANDING FIELD - ARRAKEEN PALACE - NIGHT

     Rabban strides in front of his uncle's ship,
     carrying Kynes over his shoulder.  Harkonnen and
     Sardaukar SOLDIERS stand at attention.  Rabban tears
     off Kynes' stillsuit. Kynes falls.

                         RABBAN
               He was in the Palace with the Atreides...
               I also say he was a spy for the Emperor.
                    (looking up to the troops)
               Go now!  Take him to his desert to die.
               Go!

129A.     EXT. HARKONNEN ORNITHOPTER - NIGHT

     The small `thopter climbs toward the Shield Wall
     through a SMOKEY atmosphere illuminated by distant
     EXPLOSIONS.

130. INT. HARKONNEN ORNITHOPTER - NIGHT

                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice)
               Yueh's sign.  He's left a satchell.

     Jessica and Paul, bound by cabin straps, lie in the
     back, the two guards at the controls.  Outside,
     `thopters and ships fly past them toward the city.
     The distant FIRES play over Jessica's face as she
     sees Yueh's triangular tattoo scratched in the cabin
     roof.

                   HARKONNEN GUARD #1
               I'd like to have some fun before we kill
               her.

                   HARKONNEN GUARD #2
                    (laughing)
               Of course... what did you think?

     Jessica looks to Paul.

                          PAUL
                    (struggling to use The Voice)
               Don't touch my mother...

                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice)
               Oh great mother!  He's trying the voice.
               The Reverend Mother said it could save
               him.

                   HARKONNEN GUARD #1
               Did you hear a noise from the little one?
--
                   HARKONNEN GUARD #2
               I didn't hear anything.

                   HARKONNEN GUARD #1
               No?

                   HARKONNEN GUARD #2
               No.

     He turns and hits Paul in the shoulder with a
     stungun.  Paul recovers and starts taking long,
     calming breaths.

                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice)
               The calming exercise.

                   HARKONNEN GUARD #1
               The little one!
                    (they laugh)

     Suddenly, Guard #1 reaches around and puts his hand
     up Jessica's skirt.  He starts breathing hard.  Paul
     clears his throat.

                          PAUL
                    (using The Voice)
               Remove her gag!

                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice)
               Excellent!

     Guard #1 finds himself removing Jessica's gag.
     Guard #2 turns away from his controls but seems
     powerless to stop him.  Once, it's off Jessica
     smiles seductively and writhes on the `thopter
     floor.

                    JESSICA (CONT'D)
                    (The Voice)
               There's no need to fight over me.

     The two men stare at one another a moment.  Then
     Guard #1's hand, glinting silver, flashes into Guard
     #2's chest, killing him.  Guard #1 pulls the knife
     out, smiling.  The ornithopter begins to veer off
     into a dangerous nose dive.

                   HARKONNEN GUARD #1
               Now?

                         JESSICA
                    (The Voice)
               First cut my son's bonds.
--
     Guard #1 slowly cuts Paul's big straps, never taking
     his eyes off Jessica.  The ornithopter gets closer
     and closer to the top jagged surface of the Shield
     Wall.

                    JESSICA (CONT'D)
                    (The Voice)
               That's it.

     The blade cuts through the strap holding Paul's
     legs.  Paul kicks upwards extremely powerfully and
     his foot breaks through the man's chest cavity and
     drives his heart up into his head, spewing blood out
     the man's mouth.  Paul grabs the controls but it's
     too late.  The ship falls into the rock.

130A.     EXT. HARKONNEN ORNITHOPTER - DESERT - NIGHT

     The `thopter slides across the rock, shearing off a
     wing.  Suddenly they are beyond the rock three miles
     above the great desert and plummeting fast toward
     the dunes below.

130. BACK TO SCENE

     Paul pulls desperately on the controls and manages
     to keep the ship aloft and flying into the deep
     desert.

                         JESSICA
               Oh, my God!

     CU violently burning palm.

133. BACK TO SCENE

     Nefud exits - TWO HARKONNENS wheel in the stretcher,
     and swing it round - one of the GUARDS hands Piter
     his knife back - the Guards exit and the door closes
     - Piter moves up to Duke Leto and leans over him
     moving his knife across the Duke's face.

     The Baron flies down to the stretcher.

                          BARON
               Duke Leto Atreides.  Someone's torn the
               insignia off your uniform.  Such
               carelessness.

     Leto shows no sign that he has heard.
--
                          PITER
               It was Feyd.

     Leto's POV:  The Baron and his Mentat are only DIM
     FARAWAY SHAPES.  Their voices reach Leto as if
     travelling across a greater distance.  The Baron
     looks to Leto and then moves to him, looking him
     over.

                          BARON
               It was Feyd?
                    (laughing)
               It was Feyd!  Where is the ducal signet
               ring?  I must have his ring.

                          PITER
               The ring?... he was brought to us as is,
               Baron.  I...

                          BARON
               You killed the doctor too soon, you fool!

                        DUKE LETO
                    (inner voice)
               Yueh... Yueh... dead... Paul and Jessica
               safe... the tooth!

                          PITER
               He's coming round, my Lord.

     The Baron moves from behind a table stacked with
     dirty dishes and foodstuffs and goes to Leto.

                        DUKE LETO
                    (inner voice)
               Wait... he must be near...

                          BARON
               Where is your ring?

     The Baron's face is now very close to Duke Leto's.

                     BARON (CONT'D)
               You do not answer!

                        DUKE LETO
                    (very faint)
               A... little... closer....  The... water...
               of my life... for Paul.

     The Baron briefly wonders at these words and then
     turns to Piter.
--
                          BARON
               He's crying!
                    (he hits Duke Leto)
               He's crying!  He's crying, Piter.  What
               does he mean?

     Piter moves forward.  The Baron sees a suculent
     piece of chicken skin on the table.  He picks up the
     plate, then the chicken skin.

     Leto's POV:  It's grown HAZY again.  The Baron is
     beginning to move away, reaching for the small piece
     of chicken skin.  Piter leans close to Leto.

                        DUKE LETO
               Now!

     We hear a CRUNCH, hear a tumultuous RUSHING SOUND as
     Piter's face is pushed forcibly away.  The Baron is
     turning, a dumbfounded look on his face.  He drops
     the plate, and backs away.

     There is a tremendous ROARING.  Bits of visions of
     Caladan rush through Leto's ever-darkening
     consciousness --

     The Atreides banner, the green of it, then the

     SILENCE.

135. INT. HARKONNEN ORNITHOPTER - NIGHT

     As they fly deeper into the desert with the ship
     shuddering and straining, Jessica suddenly cries out
     with tremendous premonition and fear.

                         JESSICA
               Leto!  Leto!

     Tears course down her cheeks as Paul turns to her.

                    JESSICA (CONT'D)
                    (to Paul)
               Leto!  He's dead!  He's dead...

136. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - ARRAKEEN PALACE - NIGHT

     Duke Leto and Piter lie dead.

137. INT. ARRAKEEN PALACE - NIGHT

     The Baron floats near the ceiling in a small
     passageway.  He is ecstatic.

                          BARON
                    (screaming)
               I'm alive!!!  I'm alive!!!

137A.     INT. HARKONNEN `THOPTER - NIGHT

     Paul is fighting the controls of the Harkonnen
     `thopter.

     Harkonnen `thopter lights on dunes.

137A.     BACK TO SCENE

                          PAUL
               I can't maintain any altitude... we'll
               never reach the safety of rock.  Maybe
               that small rock.

                         JESSICA
               Where are we do you think?

                          PAUL
               The South Polar regions... the forbidden
               area.  We must make it to that rock...

137C.     EXT. HARKONNEN `THOPTER - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     The `thopter violently hits the sands and flips up -
     - almost turning over.  It falls slowly back,  then
     slides down the side of a dune.
--
137D.     EXT. HARKONNEN ORNITHOPTER - DESERT - NIGHT

                          PAUL
               Hurry!

     He jumps out of his seat.

                         JESSICA
               Bring these satchels!

     She hands him one.

                          PAUL
                    (at doorway)
               Hurry -- This crashing may bring a worm.

     As Paul puts the satchel over his shoulder, he feels
     something.  He looks at his father's ring.  He
     stares at it silently, then closes his hand around
     it.  They jump outside.

                         JESSICA
                    (starting to cry)
               A million deaths are not enough for

                    (inner voice)(reacting to his
                    mother's tears)
               Where are my feelings... I feel for no
               one...

138. EXT. ROCK - DESERT - NIGHT

     Paul and Jessica running.  Paul pulls Jessica to a
     place in the wall where a small overhang offers
     shelter.  Jessica falls to the ground.  She CRIES,
     pouring out her grief, but soon the sound of it is
     carried away by the building rush of WIND.  Paul
     turns and looks out to the open desert, this portion
     of which is a dust ocean.

138A.     PAUL'S POV:

     The Mouse Moon has risen.

     Ripples of dust undulate tide-like in the light of
     the moon.  The WHISPERING grains billow up like the
     foam of waves as they hit the rock.

138. BACK TO SCENE

     Paul turns, his face illuminated by the two moons
     above.  His eyes lock on the moon which has the
     image of the mouse.

               The second moon... from the dreams...

138B.     INT. PAUL'S EYE - NIGHT

     We move into Paul's eye, where the mouse moon appear
     and revolves slowly.  The moon begins to explode.
     The pieces of the moon soar toward us burning with
     white-hot flames.  Within the flames we see...

139. (Deleted)

139A.     EXT. ARRAKEEN PALACE - NIGHT

     ... the burning Palace of Arrakeen.  We move closer
     to it.

189B.     INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - ARRAKEEN PALACE - NIGHT

     We then see Duke Leto's face.  The Baron leans over
     the Duke and clutches the skin on the Duke's face.
     He begins pulling it.  The skin on the Duke's race
     slowly rips open -- making a hideous tearing SOUND.
     Black SMOKE issues forth from the hole which teats
     larger.

                       PAUL (V.O.)
                    (distorted)
               House Atreides is ruined.
                    (less distorted)
               This moon holds my past.

139C.     INT. VESTIBULE - OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

     Inside and through the SMOKE Paul sees Feyd tear the
     Red Duke insignia off his father's uniform.  He sees
     Feyd laughing.  The moving, now-brilliant red hawk
     insignia becomes...

139D.     EXT. CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     ... a burning meteor ROARING over the castle on
     Caladan.  The meteor crashes in the black sea.

                       PAUL (V.O.)
               This moon holds my future.
--
139E.     INT. WATER - NIGHT

     Foaming confusion turning into a small, twisting
     fetus under the sea.  Its eyes closed.  Moving close
     to it, its eyes snap open.  Through the eyes is the
     pale white face of JESSICA.

139F.     EXT. SHIELD WALL - DESERT - NIGHT

     There is a huge soaring WIND sound and beyond
     JESSICA the dunes roll like ocean waves.

139G.     EXT. MOUSE MOON - NIGHT

     The moon continues to spew out pieces of moving
     images which are seen then disappear as fast as
     sparks.  The broken, burning pieces float eerily
     toward us over the undulating dunes below.  One
     image floats closer.  It is a hand folded into a
     fist.

                       PAUL (V.O.)
               I am only a seed...

     The fist begins to open.

                    DUKE LETO (V.O.)
               The seed must grow.

     The hand opens fully with slow blue fluid pulsating
     out the very center of the palm.  The hand floats
     eerily forward.

                    DUKE LETO (V.O.)
               The sleeper must awaken.

139H.     EXT. WATER - NIGHT

     The last image which passes is foaming and spitting
     dark blue water.  As the image passes, the black
     smoke trailing behind it obscures the picture to
     blackness.

140. EXT. ROCK - DESERT - NIGHT

     Through the darkness we move to Paul's clenched
     hand.  It opens, revealing the signet ring in the
     very center of his palm.  Paul looks upward to the
     moons of Arrakis.  He looks back to the ring, then
     to his mother.

                          PAUL
               Listen to me!... you wanted to know about
               my dreams... and I've just had a waking
               dream... do you know why?...

               air, the soil, the food...  It's like the
               Truthsayer drug.....  It's a poison!!!!
               You knew the spice would change me.  But
               thanks to your teachings it's changed my
               consciousness.  I can see it... I can see
               it.

               I'm a seed.
                    (out load)
               I am so much more...  You don't begin to
               know me...

142B.     EXT. ROCK - DESERT - NIGHT

     Paul's head goes down.  He places the ring on his
     finger.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               Father... now I have become a killer and I
               will continue to kill until I have avenged
               your death.
                    (out loud)
               Father!

     Jessica cries as she stares at her son.

145. BACK TO SCENE

     Rabban stops up the ramp.  He wears a large smile.
     His thick head sweats and sweat runs down his thick
     neck.  He goes inside and the doors swing closed.

146. INT. HARKONNEN SHIP - NIGHT

     He enters the ship and moves down within to the
     Baron's headquarters, passing two dwarves cooking a
     dead legless cow which hangs from chains.  Rabban
     tears out the cow's tongue and eats it.  Then he
     exits through a door which closes behind him.

147. INT. BARON'S QUARTERS - HARKONNEN SHIP - NIGHT

     The Baron is flying wildly, circling the outside of
     a large steel shower, while Nefud and a DWARF play a
     strange instrument producing maniacal, perverse,
     screaming MUSIC.  The Baron SEES Rabban enter, but
     continues to fly around the shower.

                          BARON
                    (very excited)
               Rabban!!... we're knee deep in Atreides
               blood!  We've gutted them.  We've gutted
               them!
                    (laughs)

     The Baron floats to Rabban and begins lovingly
     massaging Rabban's massive neck as he speaks to him.

                          BARON
               Rabban, Rabban...  I place you in charge
               of Arrakis.  It's yours to squeeze, as I
               promised.  I want you to squeeze and
               squeeze and squeeze.
                    (massaging in rhythm)
               Give me spice!  Drive them into utter
               submission.  You must not show the
               slightest pity or mercy... as only you
               can...  Never stop!
                    (releasing him)
               Go....  Show no mercy!

                         RABBAN
               Yes, my lord Baron.

     Rabban leaves just as Feyd steps out of the shower.
     The Baron turns to him lovingly.
--
                          BARON
                    (to Feyd)
               And when we've crushed these people enough
               I'll send in you Feyd... they'll cheer you
               as a rescuer... lovely Feyd... really a
               lovely boy.
                    (suddenly he smiles and screams)
               Where's my doctor?

148. INT. HARKONNEN SHIP - NIGHT

     As Rabban leaves, he looks into one room of the
     ship.  Behind the glass porthole sits Thufir Hawat
     bound head and foot, his eyes darting this way and
     that.

148A.     EXT. ROCK - DESERT - NIGHT

     Paul and Jessica are in stillsuits.  Paul is looking
     through a Fremkit.  He finds a paper with Dr. Yueh's
     mark on it.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               Yueh's left the plans for the weirding
               modules.

148B.     EXT. MOONS - ARRAKEEN - DESERT - NIGHT

     The moons have moved further across the sky.

148A.     BACK TO SCENE

     Suddenly Paul turns and studies his mother.  A
     stronger WIND comes up.

                          PAUL
               We have to get to that mountain of rock.
               We have entered the time when all will
               turn against us and seek our lives...

     Jessica gets up.  They make their way up the crest
     of a dune by a small rock.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
               It's further than I thought... a worm is
               sure to come....  I'll plant a thumper,
               that should divert it.
--
     Paul moves off into the shadows.  Suddenly, Jessica
     SEES a burst of LIGHTNING illuminate the mountain of
     rock in the distant and the vast dunes before them.

                    JESSICA (CONT'D)
                    (inner voice)(as Paul leaves to light
                    the thumper)
               ...the night is a tunnel... a hole into
               tomorrow... if we're to have a tomorrow...

149. through 151.   (Deleted)

151A.     EXT. DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     Paul plants the thumper which begins a powerful
     rhythmic noise.  He turns to Jessica.

                          PAUL
                    (returning)
               Remember... walk without rhythm and we
               won't attract a worm... it'll go to the
               thumper.

                         JESSICA
                    (puts in her noseplug)
               I'm ready.

     Paul and Jessica move into camera and exit right.

151B.     EXT. DEEP DESERT AND ROCKS - NIGHT

     Another burst of LIGHTNING.  The distant rock seems
     to have grown no larger.  Their muscles begin to
     ache.  Suddenly they HEAR the thumper start behind
     them.

                          PAUL
               Keep going...

152. EXT. DEEP DESERT AND ROCKS - NIGHT (LATER)

     Their breathing becomes very labored.  The sand
     moves like slow water, forever rolling down and up.
     Then they hear the worm, the low thundering HISS
     shaking the tonnage of sand.  The thumper stops.
     Paul turns.

                          PAUL
               Faster!!
--
                         JESSICA
                    (screaming)
               It's deafening!

     Their bodies ache and they feel like dropping, yet
     the cliff is still a good distance away.  The worm
     SOUND grows louder and Paul turns to look.

153. EXT. WORM - DESERT - NIGHT

     A flash of LIGHTNING.  The worm is now coming toward
     them.  The mound of sand over the worm is enormous
     and is approaching at a terrifyingly fast speed.
     The power of this worm is awesome.

153A.     EXT. DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

                          PAUL
                    (screaming)
               Run!

                         JESSICA
               I can't... I can't.

     She turns to see.  Then she runs.

153B.     EXT. DRUM SAND - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     All at once their feet tromp down on firmer sand.
     The SOUND is very loud.

                          PAUL
               Drum sand!

     The DRUMMING sound ECHOES deep within the ground.
     Jessica falls.  Paul stops and drags her up.  They
     run again.  The worm SOUND becomes unbearably loud.
     Static electricity SPARKS giant bolts of pure white
     LIGHTNING and the air turns to ozone.  Finally they
     find rock.  Behind them the SOUND of the worm
     changes.  They turn.

154. EXT. WORM - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     The gigantic head of the worm is just breaking
     through the sand.  The mouth begins to open in an
     eighty-foot circle of teeth and darkness.  The mouth
     arches forward searching for them.

155. EXT. BASE OF THE CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     Paul and Jessica climb up and up inside a narrow
     slit of rock.
--
155A.     INT. ROCK CLIFF - DESERT - NIGHT

     The worm's mouth climbs higher also but it cannot
     penetrate the narrow opening in the rock.

156. EXT. ROCK CLIFF - NIGHT

     Paul and Jessica have scrambled upwards a couple of
     hundred feet.

156A.     EXT. WORM AND ROCK - NIGHT

     Still the worm stretches up to them.  Suddenly the
     worm begins BANGING on the rock.  Huge SHUDDERS
     drive through the black stone.  Over and over again
     the worm mindlessly hits at the rock.

156B.     EXT. ROCK CLIFF - NIGHT

     Paul and Jessica crouch further back in the tiny
     passageway of safety, but a solid back wall of rock
     prevents them from moving back any more.

156C.     INT. ROCK CLIFF - NIGHT

     The breath from the worm is like a hurricane of
     WIND.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               Cinnamon... the spice!
                    (out loud)
               Do you smell it?

                         JESSICA
               Yes...

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               I know the secret.  The worm is the
               spice... the spice is the worm.

157. (Deleted)

157A.     EXT. ROCK CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     Suddenly a colossal section of the rock wall cracks
     and topples off into the worm's mouth.  Instantly
     the worm pulls back.  A huge FIRE roars deep within
     the worm consuming the rock.
--
158. INT. ROCK CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     The worm now can get even closer to Paul and
     Jessica.  It looms up again and crushes its mouth up
     against the rock.

158A.     EXT. ROCK CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     Another fissure opens, and suddenly half the rock
     wall protecting them splits off entirely and
     falls... taking Paul with it.

158B.     EXT. WORM AND ROCK - NIGHT

     ...against the worm.

159. EXT. ROCK CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     Paul is knocked off the cliff and falls straight
     down two hundred feet.  His feet skid along the face
     of rock.  He bounces and brakes.  He hits and jumps.
     He careens from one boulder, flies upside down,
     rights himself then tumbles and skids into the sand.
     Unhurt, he jumps up and scrambles up another part of
     the rock to safety.

160. EXT. ROCK CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

                         JESSICA
               Paul!

     She presses against the narrow ledge that is left
     after the worm assault.

161. EXT. BASE OF THE CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     The worm is just coming up again when distant
     THUMPING is heard.  The worm, as if charmed by the
     sound, turns and moves off towards it.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               A thumper.

161A.     (Deleted)

162. EXT. ROCK CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     Jessica climbs further up and manages to get over to
     a place where she can meet up with Paul, who is now
     climbing back.
--
                         JESSICA
                    (crying)
               What's happened?...  Why did it leave?

                          PAUL
                    (breathing heavily)
               Someone started another thumper....  We're
               not alone.

     They climb upwards until the ledge ends at the mouth
     of a dark crevice.  Paul and Jessica try to see into
     the inky black hole.

163. EXT. CREVICE - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     Slowly Paul and Jessica enter, inching forward.  A
     low moan of WIND comes up.  Paul can see nothing,
     then suddenly he SEES stars above and SEES the hint
     of stairs cut into the rock.

                         JESSICA
                    (whispering)
               Man-carved steps.

                          PAUL
                    (whispering)
               Yes...

     They climb the steps and enter an extremely narrow
     dark channel of stone.  As they make their way
     through the rock, suddenly there is a burst of
     lightning which illuminates a whole troop of Fremen
     standing silently in front of them.

164. EXT. FREMEN PLACE - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

                         STILGAR
               Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us
               of.

                         STILGAR
                    (to Jessica)
               Are you trained in the ways of the desert?

                         JESSICA
               No, but many consider my training
               valuable.

                         STILGAR
               I will take the boy-man... he shall have
               sanctuary in my tribe...
--
     A LOW NOTE on a dip stick is blown by one of the
     Fremen tribe.  Jessica shifts, Paul sees it, and
     just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon,
     Jessica turns, slashes out, utters a SOUND, whirls
     again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar
     helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat.
     Paul moves on her first move.  He races up a rocky
     incline.

165. EXT. CLIFF - FREMEN PLACE - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     He then jumps higher up and presses himself between
     two rocks on a low cliff overlooking the rest of the
     Fremen troop.

166. EXT. FREMEN PLACE - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     The troop starts shooting projectile weapons in
     Paul's direction.

                         STILGAR
               Stop!  Get back!!  She has the weirding
               way.  Why didn't you tell us!  Great
               gods... if you can do this to the
               strongest of us you're worth ten times
               your weight of water.  As a leader of my
               people I give you my bond: teach us this
               weirding way and you both shall have
               sanctuary.  Your water shall mingle with
               our water.

                         JESSICA
               Then I will teach you our way of
               battle....  you have the word bond of a
               Bene Gesserit.

                        A FREMEN
               It is the legend.

167. EXT. CLIFF - FREMEN PLACE - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     Up on the rock, Paul turns.  He takes a step, then
     notices a small figure standing in front of him.  It
     is a girl.

                          CHANI
               I am Chani, daughter of Liet....  I would
               not have permitted you to harm my tribe.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               From my dream... so beautiful.  Liet....
               is this Kynes' daughter?

     Paul stares at her in wonder.
--
                          CHANI
               Come with me.  I'll show you an easier way
               down.

     They exit.

168. EXT. FREMEN PLACE - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

                         STILGAR
                    (to Paul, as they meet)
               You have strength... real strength... You
               shall be known as Usul, which is the
               strength of the base of the pillar.  This
               is your secret name in our troop.  But you
               must choose the name of manhood which we
               will call you openly.

                          PAUL
                    (thinking)
               What do you call the mouse shadow in the
               second moon?

                         STILGAR
               We call that one Muad'dib.

                          PAUL
               Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?

                         STILGAR
               You are Paul Muad'dib, and your mother
               shall be a Sayyadina among us....  We
               welcome you.

     Wind blows a cloud of dust through the rock.  High
     above the moon with the mouse shadow glows
     brilliantly.  It dissolves into the sun.

168A.     EXT. DEEP DESERT - DAY

     Paul, Jessica and the Fremen march through the
     dunes.

171. through 171B.  (Deleted)

172. EXT. DEEP DESERT - DUSK/SUNSET

     HEAT WAVES and sand dunes.  Mysterious SOUNDS echo
     in the distance as the giant sun is setting.

     Chani takes Paul to the top of a dune.  They stare
     at the sunset and a huge rock outcropping in the
     distance.
--
                          CHANI
               Seitch Tabr.

     Paul looks at the rock, then turns to her.

                     CHANI (CONT'D)
               Tell me of your homeworld, Usul.

     These words rend Paul's soul.  He cannot speak.  He
     reaches out and touches her hand - her cheek.

173. (Deleted)

174. INT. ENTRANCE - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     The Fremen troop enters into a large square room
     with slot passageways going off in various
     directions.

175. INT. PASSAGEWAY - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     They all move down one of the passageways which are
     beautifully but very plainly cut with lasguns.  They
     are like passages in the pyramids, dark with sharp
     turns and inclines upwards or downwards, some very
     steep and long, and others descending hundreds of
     feet.  There is a strong, moaning WIND.

176. through 177.   (Deleted)

178. INT. PASSAGEWAY/STAIRS - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     A quiet WIND can be heard -- deep and moaning.

                         JESSICA
               Moisture...

     She looks at Paul.  He, too, notices.

                          PAUL
               Wind traps... huge ones.

     Down a long, sloping, narrow passageway they go
     until they reach a stairway cut into the stone.  It
     is very dark and gets increasingly darker as they
     descend.  The WIND sound grows.  The air grows
     colder and damper.  Paul and Jessica share another
     questioning look.  At the bottom of the stairs they
     pass through a narrow slot doorway which suddenly
     opens out on something so totally unexpected it
     shocks Paul.
--
179. INT. RESERVOIR  -SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     It is enormous, deep reservoir of black water
     sitting silently in the depths of this sietch and
     stretching out into the darkness.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               Water on Arrakis!!!
               I have seen this place in a dream.
                    (out loud)
               A treasure.

                         STILGAR
               Greater than treasure, Usul.  We have
               thousands of such caches.  Only a few of
               us know them all.  When we have enough...
               we shall change the face of Arrakis.
               Listen!...

     There is the sound of water dripping.  The lights
     are extinguished - reflections play on Paul's face.

                    STILGAR (CONT'D)
               The Rocks of Arrakis hold many secrets.

180A.     REVISED SCENE - HALL OF RITES

     Thousands of Fremen wait below.  Paul enters a rock
     ledge, guided by two monks, which is crowded with
     Fremen and old Fremen Monks.  Below the crowds
     continue to watch and wait while a giant wind organ
     moans.  A Monk steps up to Paul.

                          MONK
               We sense that you may be the "voice from
               the outer world".  Both moons told us of
               you.  You must pass tests before we will
               know... you must conquer the beast of the
               desert, both his outer and his deadly
               inner powers.
                    (moves back)
               Speak to us... from the outer world.

     Paul turns and gathers courage to address the
     multitude below.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               I am only a seed.
                    (out loud)
               I am Usul... Paul Muad'dib.

                    (loud murmur)
               Muad'dib!

                          MONK
               The legend.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               No one ever dreamed there would be so
               many.
                    (out loud)
               Our shared enemy the Harkonnens, are once
               again in control of Arrakis.  Stilgar,
               your leader, has asked me and my mother to
               crush the Harkonnens.  We must do more
               than this.  We must totally destroy all
               spice production on Arrakis.  The Guild
               and the entire universe depends on spice.

               "He who can destroy a thing, controls a
               thing".

               I will take one hundred of your warriors
               and train them.  This one hundred will
               train the thousands that remain.  When the
               spice flow stops, all eyes will turn to
               Arrakis.  The Baron and the Emperor
               himself will be forced to deal with us.
               Arrakis will become the center of the
               Universe.
                    (inner voice)
               The dream unfolds.

182. INT. TRAINING ROOM - SIETCH TABR - DAY

     Large room with a low ceiling.  A drummer playing
     makes a low ECHOING MUSICAL HIT.  A big block of
     stone is moved across coarse sand -- back and forth
     -- fast.  A rhythm is started -- powerful.  Paul
     enters, pauses and looks to Jessica - he stands in
     front of over 100 Fremen men.  Jessica sits behind
     him alongside Stilgar.

     A large rock obelisk has been placed near Paul for
     this demonstration.

                          PAUL
               The weirding way has long been a Bene
               Gesserit secret.  With my mother's help,
               my father isolated an element of the
               weirding way and externalised it.
--
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
               Because of the Harkonnen treachery, my
               father's armies were never able to fully
               develop this new form.  This is what I
               will teach you.  You will be the fiercest
               and most feared fighters in the Universe.

               Our way of battle is built on rhythm.  You
               understand rhythm like this but you do not
               yet understand the rhythm of the higher
               sounds, sounds that heal and build...
               sounds that destroy.  Motion is the base.
               You understand the motion... but you do
               not yet understand the motion that heals
               and builds... motions that destroy...

               Orato!
                    (he moves forward)
               This obelisk is of your hardest stone.
               Kick it...
                    (he does -- the rock doesn't move)
               Hit it...
                    (he does -- the rock doesn't move)
               Yell at it...

                          ORATO
               Break!

     The Fremen laugh -- the rock doesn't move.

     A Fremen with a lasgun tries to cut it.  Paul
     motions him back, slightly.

                          PAUL
               Move back!

     Paul also moves back.  He switches on his weirding
     module.  He opens his mouth and makes a small SOUND,
     which the module amplifies.

                          PAUL
               Chuksa!

     The sound shatters the obelisk to pieces.  The one
     hundred Fremen YELL with surprise and awe.

                       100 FREMEN
               Achiii!

                          PAUL
               This is part of the weirding way that we
               will teach you.  Some thoughts have a
               certain sound... that being the equivalent
               to a form.  Through sound and motion you
               will be able to paralyze nerves, shatter
               bones, set fires, suffocate an enemy or
               burst his organs....  We will kill until
               no Harkonnen breathes Arrakeen air.

                       100 FREMEN
               Muad'dib!

               To avenge my father, I will turn you into
               killing machines.

     Stilgar turns to Jessica.

                         STILGAR
               Sayyadina.  Our Reverend Mother tells me
               she is too old... She has been calling
               through space and time for you to come and
               let her rest.  She asks that you pass
               within.

               yet... we must move swiftly if we're to
               secure our place among these Fremen.
                    (out loud)
               I will try to pass within.

                         STILGAR
               Death may be the result....  Are you sure?

188. INT. ROCK LEDGE - HALL OF RITES - SIETCH TABR -
NIGHT

     Fremen carry the Fremen REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO in
     on a litter.  The old Reverend Mother is old a frail
     yet extremely beautiful and mysterious.  She turns
     to Paul and Jessica with a strange look.

                 REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO
                    (to Jessica, in an ancient voice)
               So you are the ones.

     She turns away towards the monks who are very busy
     blowing horns and waving pots of burning spice,
     purifying the area of the rite.  Several Fremen blow
     on dip sticks and a FEMALE CHOIR begins a haunting
     chorale as the giant pipe organ blows beautiful low
     notes below.

     Paul looks to his mother.

     He then sees Chani.

     CU Chani.

     CU Paul -- he cannot stop looking at her.

     Stilgar motions to Paul.

                         STILGAR
                    (whispering to Paul)
               Do you know the Water of Life?... Come...
               ...Watch... the mystery of mysteries...
               the end and the beginning.

     He shows Paul through a narrow passageway -- almost
     a slot through the stone to a small room.  Through
     an opening in the stone wall, Paul is shown a very
     strange and somewhat horrifying scene.

189. INT. BABY WORM - MAKER ROOM - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     A thirty-foot baby worm is being lowered into a
     stone chamber.  The chamber is then covered with a
     wire top.  Valves are turned and water rushes into
     the chamber.  The worm begins to writhe violently
     and leap and bang against the bars above.  The worm
     begins to turn inside out from the mouth back and it
     begins to gag.  Some monks and watermasters quickly
     drain the stone chamber and wrench the worm out
     using large steel hooks.  They hold the worm above a
     large tub.  A watermaster-reed man runs a long reed
     in to the worm, causing it to spasm and gag up a
     beautiful deep blue bile as it dies.

189A.     INT. MAKER ROOM - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     The bile and worm water are combined in ceremonial
     containers.  Paul turns to Stilgar.

                         STILGAR
               The Water of Life.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               The most lethal poison in the Universe.

     Then we HEAR from Paul's memory his conversation
     with the Reverend Mother:

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               ... Many men have tried.

                          PAUL
               Did they try and fail?

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               They tried and died.

190. INT. ROCK LEDGE - HALL OF RITES - SIETCH TABR -
NIGHT

     Stilgar and Paul return to the ledge above the Hall
     of Rites.  A MONK PRIEST steps forward, addresses
     the crowd, silencing them.  The other monks move
     back carrying their smoking cleansing bags.

                         MONK #1
               One among us has consented to enter the
               rite.  She will attempt to pass within
               that we not lose the strength of our
               Reverend Mother.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)(turning to his mother)
               What if she should fail?

     He brings the jug close to Jessica.

                         MONK #1
               Drink!

     Jessica drinks.

                         JESSICA
                    (inner voice)
               The ultimate awareness spectrum narcotic.
               I must transform the poison configuration
               within my body... the blue must be made
               clean.

     She swallows.  Her body contorts and spasms
     violently.  She screams.  The Reverend Mother
     screams with her.

     The old Reverend Mother slowly extends a hand toward
     Jessica's shoulder.

195. JESSICA - MENTAL IMAGE

     Inside Jessica, we see the Reverend Mother Ramallo's
     hand descend through the dark void.  Shimmering
     water starts to ripple, lightly stirring an image of
     Jessica.

     As the hand penetrates, something deep within her
     starts to GLOW.  It is a fetus, a female.  The
     Reverend Mother Ramallo's hand flinches as it
     touches the fetus.  The fetus sparks to life -
     screaming and rapidly spasming upwards on its
     umbilical cord.

               You should have told us.

               have we done?
--
197A.     INT. THE TUNNEL - NIGHT

     Jessica and the fetus rush mentally through a dark
     strangely worm-like tunnel until suddenly, a gaping
     black hole appears.  A horrible WIND, SPARKS and
     circles of expanding light issues from it.

                      JESSICA (V.O)
                    (inner voice)(fearful)
               No!  This is the place where we cannot
               look.  The place only for the eyes of the
               Kwisatz Haderach.

197B.     THE FETUS - NIGHT

     The fetus twists down the tunnel to join Jessica,
     her umbilical cord trailing behind.  She SCREAMS as
     she looks into the hole.

197C.     THE NAVIGATOR - NIGHT

     She and Jessica see a shape moving deep within the
     windy hole.  It is a Third Stage Navigator, ROARING.

                         JESSICA
               What is this?...  Is this what kills the
               men who enter here?

     She quickly takes the fetus back up the tunnel.  As
     they move:

                    (inner voice)

               I've been a long time waiting for you.
               Here is my life.

198. INT. ROCK LEDGE - HALL OF RITES - SIETCH TABR -
NIGHT

     The old Reverend Mother Ramallo slumps forward onto
     the stone, dead.  The crowd waits.  The corpse is
     tenderly removed.  Jessica very slowly opens her
     eyes and looks about her.  The monk holds the jug to
     her lips.

                          MONK
               Change it that we may all drink of it.

     Jessica spews water into the spout.  The monk swirls
     the jug, sniffs at the spout and then drinks.

                      MONK (CONT'D)
               It is changed!

     They whisper "It is the prophecy!"  They soon begin

169. INT. STAIRCASE - GEIDI PRIME - DAY

     The Baron and Feyd descend several steps into a
     darker area of Geidi Prime.  Feyd is carrying a
     strange creature in a small wire cage.  The Baron is
     floating as he descends.

                          BARON
                    (takes a drink)
               Feyd, even though he's aging, Thufir is

               mine....  Quiet now.

               I will.

170. INT. BASEMENT ROOM - GEIDI PRIME - DAY

     Nefud stands eating candies behind Thufir's chair.
     Nefud has a stun gun, even though Thufir's hands are
     tied.  The Baron enters with Feyd.

                          BARON
               Oh Thufir, I see they've installed your
               heart plug already....  Don't be angry.
               Everyone gets one here.  But this is not
               why we're here.  We've brought you a
               little cat, Thufir.  You must care for it
               if you wish to live.  A poison has been
               introduced into you, Thufir Hawat.  By
               milking this smooth little cat body each
               day you receive your antidote... it must
               be done each day....  Also, you must do
               something for me if you wish to live.  You
               know I lost Piter, my dear Mentat...

     Thufir gives the Baron a weak, wide-eyed stare.

                          FEYD
               All I can see is an Atreides that I want

211. INT. JESSICA'S ROOM - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     Jessica's face shows signs of straining.  Women move
     around her, Chani and Harah at her side, helping her
     give birth.  Suddenly ALIA is born and her freshly-
     born moist body is held up in front of Jessica.
     Alia's eyes snap open, burning brightly.

                          HARAH
               What will you call her?

                         JESSICA
               Alia.

     As they lift Alia for Jessica to see...

                          ALIA
               Mother.

210. INT. TRAINING ROOM - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     Paul walks down the steps into the training room -
     followed by Harah's two sons.  He pauses at the foot
     of the steps.

                          PAUL
               Activate your weirding modules...

     Paul activates his, and the Fremens follow suit.

                          PAUL
               Set the range for two meters.

     Paul walks down the line of Fremen.

                          PAUL
               Korba...
                    (points to robot)
               The arm...

                          KORBA
                    (aiming the module)
               Chuuk-sa...

                          PAUL
               Motion... Chuuk-sa...

                          KORBA
               Chuuuk-sa...

     He fires the module and the arm of the robot is shot
     off.  Paul smiles and hits him on the shoulder -
     Paul walks on.
--
                          PAUL
               Stilgar...

     One of the FREMEN calls out to Paul.

                        A FREMEN
               Muad'dib!...

     The word `Muad'dib' causes a tremendous power to
     build.  The module shakes violently in his hand - it
     suddenly fires upwards, and the wall explodes.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               My own name is a killing word.  Will it be
               a healing word as well?

211A.     NEW SCENE

                    (to Paul as he applies red colour to
                    the shoulders of several large Fremen
                    men)
               Usul... these are fifteen of our fiercest
               fighters to serve you as your guard... the
               Fedaykin.

     He pauses, then holds up his brilliantly red hand.

213. EXT. DESERT - DAY

     An EXPLOSION.  Paul turns and his eyes are totally
     blue.  He lifts binoculars to them and looks.  He
     sees the Fremen fighters below charging at the
     Harkonnens.  As the Fremen run they make powerful
     SOUNDS with their weirding modules, exploding
     everything in their path and catching things on
     fire.

213A.     EXT. CARRYALL - DESERT - DAY

     In the distance, a huge spice carryall is shot down
     and it falls to the ground EXPLODING more violently
     on impact.

     Stilgar signals, and Fremen run behind them.

                      PAIL (CONT'D)
                    (to Stilgar)
               They're even better on the battlefield
               than in the training rooms!!
                    (inner voice)
               Sound... as a weapon.  If only you could
               see them, father.

     Paul smiles as he looks at the battle in the
     distance.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
                    (his V.O. from the past)
               When the spice flow stops, the entire
               Universe will turn to Arrakis.  The Baron
               and the Emperor himself will be forced to
               deal with us.

214. INT. PASSAGEWAYS - ARRAKEEN - DAY

     Rabban stares dumbfounded as many Harkonnen wounded
     and dead are brought through the passageway beyond.
     Rabban grabs a Harkonnen and asks:

                         RABBAN
               What happened?  What happened to you?
               What is he saying?

                    WOUNDED HARKONNEN
               Muad'dib!...  Muad'dib!... Muad'dib!...
               Muad'dib!

     Rabban pushes him away.

                   A HARKONNEN SOLDIER
               He's been repeating that name ever since
               we found him.

                         RABBAN
               Who is this Muad'dib?

215. EXT. DEEP DESERT - DAY

     HEAT WAVES; dunes.  A big thumper is forced into the
     sands.  A RHYTHM is heard pounding on Fremen hand
     drums and rhythm instruments.  Feet scramble.  Black
     stillsuited Fedaykin warrior bodyguards gather.
     Stilgar turns.
--
                         STILGAR
                    (to Paul)
               Usul... It is time you become a
               sandrider... and travel as a Fremen.  Take
               the kiswa maker hook of our sietch and
               ride as a leader of men.

217. EXT. DEEP DESERT - DAY

     As Paul leaves the troop to plant the second
     thumper:

                     STILGAR (V.O.)
               Two thumpers are planted.  The worm may
               not surface for the first - he will rise
               for the second.  Remember, when the worm
               approaches, you must be utterly still...
               and close enough to plant the hook firmly
               under a ring segment....  The worm will
               turn to lift this exposed area as far from
               the abrasive sand as possible and it will
               take you with it -- to the top.  Do not
               get too close as he approaches... the sand
               will engulf you....  Wait till the head of
               the worm passes -- then go... quickly.

                    STILGAR & FREMEN
               Shai-Hulud... Shai-Hulud.

     In the distance the telltale SOUND of the worm's
     approach begins.  This worm is deep underground and
     the sound is low and the ground trembles violently.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               Only the very strong ones travel this
               deep....

     The SOUND and VIBRATIONS continue to build.  In the
     distance, the Fedaykin and Stilgar watch.

                         STILGAR
                    (to the others)
               Usul has called a big one.  Again... it is
               the legend.

219. EXT. DEEP DESERT - DAY

     HEAT WAVES... dunes RHYTHM.  THUNDEROUS approach of
     the worm.  Paul still cannot see the worm, but the
     sound begins to drown out the Fremen rhythm
     instruments and the sand begins to VIBRATE.
     Suddenly, Paul SEES...

219A.     EXT. WORM - DEEP DESERT - DAY

     ...a mountain of sands rise up, towering, thundering
     -- lightning SPARKS fissuring throughout the air
     above the worm.

     The mountain approaches at a terrifying speed.
     Then, the worm appears -- rushing.  The mouth, at
     first a small opening, begins to widen -- exposing a
     thousand glistening teeth.

219B.     EXT. DESERT - DAY

     Paul freezes.  He lets the worm get closer and
     closer.  The HEAT WAVES distort the gigantic form,
     making it more hideous -- more foreign.  He moves
     forward.  The others watch anxiously.  This worm is
     big.  It is so much larger than imaged.  Its top
     towers 125 feet in the air.  The segments are each
     ten feet wide.

219C.     EXT. VERTICAL SECTION OF WORM - DESERT - DAY

     Paul gets close and running alongside, he plants the
     hook under a segment and pulls back.  The SOUND is
     excruciatingly loud.  The sand is so deep and more
     is being thrown out beneath the body of the worm.
     Paul gets caught in it and falls. He narrowly
     escapes being sucked under the beast.  He gets up --
     runs again and plants the hook once more.  He runs
     faster, bending the segment open to expose the
     tender flesh.

219D.     EXT. FULL-SIZE SECTION OF WORM - DESERT - DAY

     Suddenly the worm begins to turn.  Paul pulls
     himself up the body as it turns -- holding onto the
     hook.  Soon he is fifty -- sixty -- seventy feet off
     the ground -- going higher.  The giant worm gets the
     second thumper and Paul at that moment climbs to the
     top.  He plants the second hook.

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               A sandrider!...

     Paul works the hooks into the breathing holes along
     the body...
--
219E.     EXT. DESERT - DAY

     ...causing the great beast to make a slow turn
     toward Stilgar and the bodyguard.  They set
     themselves and as the worm passes...

219F.     EXT. FULL-SIZE SECTION OF WORM - DESERT - DAY

     ...they all clamber on, climbing up the sides to the
     top.

                          PAUL
                    (yelling)
               Long live the fighters!

     They return the traditional CALL and Paul steers the
     maker in a giant circle.  They head out across the
     dunes.

     Fighting is going on between Fremen and some
     smugglers.  Paul moves down a smokey dune with
     Stilgar followed by Fremen and Fedaykin.

                          PAUL
               We surprised a band of smugglers.

                    (racing into thick smoke)
               Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen.

     Paul and Stilgar move through the smoke.  A man runs
     up with a maula pistol aimed at Paul but Paul spins
     and punctures the man's chest with a sound from his
     weirding module.  Paul turns and a large figure
     comes through the smoke.  They surprise each other.
     The figure holds a gun.

                          PAUL
               Gurney!...

     Paul shows him the signet ring on his fingers.
     Gurney moves forward, his eyes tearing, and the two
     embrace each other and pound each other on the back.

     up to the face plate of another which translates his
     strange voice into English.

     the darkness of their sleeping chamber.  Paul's eyes
     snap open and he sees Chani looking down at him (the
     last image of the future in the desert).

                          CHANI
               You were calling my name... it frightened
               me.

     In the hollow of a huge dune, Paul stops with Chani.
     They share a look into each other's eyes.  Paul
     turns towards the Fedaykin and nods.  They move in
     quickly to tie and wrap Paul in Fremen rope.  They
     move back and wait quietly.  Chani moves in very
     close to Paul.  She holds a glass vial of the blue
     water of life.

                          PAUL
               Hurry!  All I see is darkness.

                          CHANI
               Paul... I will love you forever... in life
               or in death... let Shai-Hulud judge now.
                    (whispering)
               You are my life.

     She pours the blue liquid into Paul's mouth.  Slow
     move into Paul's face as:

                          PAUL
                    (inner voice)
               Now... the test of the water of life...
               what is it that waits for me in this
               darkness?

233A.     INT. PAUL'S MIND

     Fade to black then dissolves to dark blue fluid.  A
     blue drop falls into the blue fluid - a huge low
     thud - then quiet.

233B.     EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

     Cut to Paul screaming horribly in the desert.

235. INT. JESSICA'S ROOM - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     Alia walks forward in the very dark room.  Blood
     rushes from her nose.  She forces herself to walk to
     Jessica's bed.  She finds that Jessica's nose is
     bleeding also.  Jessica wakes in pain.  They stare
     at each other in the darkness.

                         JESSICA
               ALIA!

                          ALIA
               Mother - help me!

                         JESSICA
                    (struggling)
               Alia!  What is it?
--
                          ALIA
               It's Paul.  He's taken the Water of Life.

233C.     INT. PAUL'S MIND

     Cut to quiet black - dissolve again to blue -
     another drop - low thud - quietness - fade to black.

245A.     EXT. EMPEROR'S SPACESHIP - SPACE

     The Emperor's space ship soars towards us.

246. INT. EMPEROR'S SPACE SHIP - SPACE

     The Reverend Mother Helen Mohiam is on the floor,
     bleeding from the nose and weak from pain.  The
     Emperor looks on in horror.

233D.     INT. PAUL'S MIND

     Suddenly screaming towards us is white rings, stars
     and a huge Guild Navigator.

233E.     EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

     Cut to Paul's eyes - tightly closed, oozing fresh
     blood.

233F.     EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

     SCREAMING SOUND.  Paul's mouth opens and a giant
     wind is stirred on the desert.

234. (Deleted)

235A.     INT. PAUL'S MIND

     Navigator chewing giant eye and spewing blood and
     light and sounds.  Paul's mouth double exposes over
     Navigator and eye.  The sound from Paul's mouth
     destroys the Navigator and opens the Alam.
     Navigator bursts into a huge light ring and we
     quickly travel through ring after ring and masses of
     liquid stars.  The light increases until it is
     blinding and then in the light...

235B.     EXT. FLOWER BLOSSOMING

     A golden flower blossoms and glows brilliantly -
     suddenly the powerful sound of an approaching worm.

236. through 239.   (Deleted)

240. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

     Chani and the Fedaykin freeze and watch in horror as
     seven giant worms converge on them.  The worms break
     the desert surface and rise, towering over them.
     The worms hover and wait.

                                        DISSOLVE TO:

240A.     EXT. DESERT - DAY

     Chani looks to the Fedaykin, then they look at Paul
     who lies motionless.  She cuts the rope bonds with
     her crysknife.  Her fingers tremble as does the
     whole of the desert.

     Paul's eyes snap open.  He sits up slowly.  Chani
     stares at him in awe.

                          CHANI
               Paul... Paul.
240B.     EXT. WAVE CRASHING

     A huge wave crashes and Paul sees the image of his
     father.  Paul slowly gets to his knees, then stands.

240C.     EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

                          PAUL
               Father!...  Father!  THE SLEEPER HAS
               AWAKENED.

     Giant echoes of this phrase reverberate across the
     vast desert.  The worms bend back into the sand and
     leave with thundering power.

     MUSIC FULL.

251. EXT. ROCK LEDGE - HALL OF RITES - SIETCH TABR -
NIGHT

     The Rock Ledge of Sietch Tabr is filled with
     Fedaykin and monks; Chani, Jessica, Gurney and
     Stilgar stand together near the back.  Paul moves
     out on the Rock Ledge overlooking the Hall of Rites
     which is crowded with Fremen warriors who chant
     "Maud'Dib" along with the powerful sounds of the
     WIND ORGAN and FREMEN war DRUMS.

     Paul raises his open hand.  SILENCE.  Only the organ
     continues with a soft low NOTE.  The Fremen wait.

                          PAUL
               Arrakis... Dune... Desert Planet.

     A quiet, haunting MOAN of recognition of a master
     rises from the Fremen.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
                    (loud)
               Your time has come.
                    (inner voice)
               Father... our time has come.
                    (out loud again)
               A storm is coming -- our storm... and when
               it comes it will shake the Universe.
               Emperor... we come for you.

     A thunderous ROAR arises.  War DRUMS pound.  The
     ORGAN blows hurricaine of power through the sietch.

                          PAUL
                    (he raises crysknife)
               Long live the fighters!

                         STILGAR
               Long live the fighters!

     Fremen carrying weapons begin moving out in long
     lines from the Hall as the war DRUMS pound.

               Gurney, when the storm hits... set off the
               atomics.  I want an opening through the
               entire Shield Wall.  Stilgar?  Do we have
               wormsign?

     Stilgar and Gurney laugh.

                         STILGAR
               Usul... We have wormsign, the likes of
               which even God has never seen.

     Paul smiles.

261. EXT. DEEP DESERT - DAY

     Looking down over the huge desert it looks like a
     living sea of wormsign.  Everywhere ripples appear
     and worms are surfacing.

261A.     EXT. DEEP DESERT - DAY

     Thousands of Fremen are running, positioning
     themselves to mount and ride.

262. EXT. DESERT - DAY

     Dust clouds grow faster and the speed of the WIND
     increases.  Sand particles hit at a rock outcropping
     and up close they sound like giant warrior drummers
     pounding before battle.

263. EXT. HARKONNEN SHIPS - DESERT - NIGHT

                         EMPEROR
               Bring in that floating fat man... the
               Baron.

     The Baron is brought in.  Distant warning SIGNALS
     begin.  The Baron is fighting to contain his fear
     because RABBAN'S HEAD SITS ALL BLOODY ON THE FLOOR
     in front of him.  Finally the Emperor speaks.

                         EMPEROR
               Why have you brought me here?

                          BARON
               Your Highness... There must be some
               mistake... I never requested your
               presence.

                         EMPEROR
               Ah?  But your lack of action demanded it.
               Your dreadful mismanagement, your bad
               judgement in assigning to Rabban --
                    (he gestures toward the head)
               -- the governorship....  You forced me to
               come here and set things straight...
               personally.
--
                         A VOICE
               Bring in the messenger.

     Alia is brought in by the Sardaukar soldiers.  She
     is smiling.

                          ALIA
               I am the messenger from Muad'dib.  Poor
               Emperor, I'm afraid my brother won't be
               very pleased with you.

                         EMPEROR
               Silence!...  I do not court your brother's
               pleasure.

     Suddenly the Reverend Mother looks horrified and
     grabs her throat.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
                    (struggling, speaking)
               Kill this child!!  She's an abomination!!
               Kill her.
                    (points to Alia, who is smiling at
                    her)
               Get out of my mind!!!

                          ALIA
               Not until you tell them both who I really
               am.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
                    (strained speech void of emotion)
               Sister of Paul Muad'dib.

     The Reverend Mother slumps.  The Baron's mouth flies
     open.  The Emperor's face goes pale, his lips
     tremble.

                         EMPEROR
               Paul's sister... Paul is Muad'dib?!

     He turns quickly and looks at the two Guild agents
     present in the room.  They stare at him icily.  Alia
     is smiles happily.

               Alia keeps pace with the storm.
--
     Gurney and Stilgar don't understand.  Suddenly
     enormous dust clouds and LIGHTNING sweep up over the
     Shield Wall.

                          PAUL
               Gurney, now!

     Gurney gives a hand signal and...

                         GURNEY
                    (they put on their hoods)
               Atomics!

269. EXT. SHIELD WALL - ARRAKEEN - DAY

     ...TWENTY EXPLOSIONS of hydrogen bomb intensity go
     off in a row, cutting a huge gorge through the width
     of the massive Shield Wall.  As the EXPLOSIONS go
     off, a WIND howls, destroying much of Arrakeen and
     covering the rest with tons of sand.  Sand rips at
     the Palace and the Emperor's ship.

270. INT. STEEL TENT - EMPEROR'S SPACE SHIP - DAY

     Alia smiles as they HEAR the tremendous roaring,
     atomic screams of the explosions.  The Emperor's
     ship's warning SIGNALS are now close and loud.

                          ALIA
               My brother is coming... with many Fremen
               warriors.

     A Sardaukar rushes in.

                  SARDAUKAR OFFICER #2
               The Shield Wall is gone.

                         EMPEROR
               Impossible!

                          ALIA
               Not impossible.  I told you... He is here
               now.

                  SARDAUKAR OFFICER #2
               Majesty, into the ship!

                         EMPEROR
                    (to his officers)(rising)
               Release the Sardaukar.  Baron... give this

     The Baron floats down to her.  Alia turns to him --
     still smiling.  With a flash of her hand she reaches
     out and swipes at the Baron's face.  He CRIES OUT in
     pain.  She pulls his suspensor plugs and pushes him
     back, then slowly shows him the tiny needle she
     holds in her hand.  He spins crazily as he screams
     from the poison.

273. EXT. SHIELD WALL - ARRAKEEN - DAY

     Worms, each with hundreds of Fremen on them, come
     slithering through the newly-formed canyon in the
     Shield Wall.

273A.     EXT. WORMS - SHIELD WALL - ARRAKEEN - DAY

     Paul rides the lead worm with Gurney and Stilgar by

     The Emperor and his Sardaukar officers in a darkened
     room where they are horrified to see on the screens
     the hundreds of worms which are coming into the
     Arrakeen valley.  All their faces show fear.

272. BACK TO SCENE
     INT. EMPEROR'S SPACE SHIP - GREEN THRONE ROOM - DAY

     Suddenly the wall behind Alia and the spinning Baron
     is completely blown away by a BLAST.

     The Baron floats and spins out into the storm.

274. EXT. ARRAKEEN - DAY

     As the worms enter the Arrakeen basin they meet the
     Sardaukar.  The Sardaukar don't have a chance -- the
     worms suck them up by the hundreds.  The Fremen on
     the worm's backs fire weapons, killing the few
     Sardaukar the worms leave behind.

     of the storm over the Arrakeen Valley.

274A.     NEW SCENE

     The worm, that Paul, Gurney and Stilgar are riding,
     suddenly rears up.  Its mouth opens.  The Baron
     appears as a tiny spinning shape.  He flies directly
     into the mouth of this collosal worm and is
     devoured.

277. EXT. STEEL TENT - LANDING FIELD - ARRAKEEN - DAY

     A thousand Fremen battle Sardaukar outside the
     Emperor's tent.  They soon overpower them and rush
     into the giant steel structure.

278. EXT. LANDING FIELD - ARRAKEEN - DAY

     The entire airfield is now filled with wild worms,
     Fremen, and dead or dying Sardaukar.

281. INT. GREAT HALL - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY

     Paul enters the Palace hall and the first thing he
     sees is the giant bull's head.  The horns have been
     blown off and the Atreides banner has been stuffed
     and wired into the mouth.

     A WIND moans through the Palace.

     Paul turns.  Gurney and several guards bring in the
     Emperor, Irulan, the Reverend Mother, Sardaukar
     generals, Guildsmen, Feyd and Thufir.  The Fedaykin
     and Fremen troops line the walls.

     Paul's eyes meet Feyd's -- Feyd gives him an evil
     smile.

     Paul turns and looks at the Emperor, who stares back
     defiantly.  Paul moves his gaze to Irulan, who
     lowers her eyes.  He then sees his old teacher,
     Thufir Hawat, whose tired eyes wander helplessly.
--
                          PAUL
               Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the
               captives.  Let him stand free.

                         GURNEY
               My Lord?

                          PAUL
               Let him stand free!

     The Emperor turns nervously to Feyd, who passes a
     golden dagger to Thufir.

                          FEYD
                    (to Thufir)
               The antidote...

                         GURNEY
                    (gestures to Thufir)
               Thufir.  Come.

     Thufir approaches Paul, concealing the knife.  They
     come face to face.  The Emperor seems strangely
     tense at this moment.  Paul notices this.  He looks
     Thufir over.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
                    (inner voice)
               A knife....
                    (out loud)
               In payment of the many years of service to
               my family, you may know ask of me anything
               you wish.  Anything at all.
                    (quietly)
               Do you need my life, old friend?

     He turns his back on him.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
                    (quiet)
               It is yours.

     Thufir's eyes grow sad and wide.

                          PAUL
               I mean this, Thufir.  If you are to
               strike, do it now.

     Thufir's hand rises, as Jessica gasps, but the old
     Mentat pulls his heart plug out with a quick tearing
     motion.  Paul turns and catches him as he sags.

     His head lolls back and he looks up to Paul
     urgently.
--
                     THUFIR (CONT'D)
               Three... generations... of you...

     His breath escapes him and he is dead.

                          PAUL
                    (to the guards)
               Carry this noble Atreides warrior away.
               Do him all honor.

     The guards do as they are instructed.

                          PAUL
               Emperor Shadam the IV... there are Guild
               Heighliners above us containing many Great
               Houses of the Lansraad....  SEND THEM
               BACK!

                         EMPEROR
               How dare you speak to me...

                      GUILDSMAN #2
                    (speaking into electric microphone)
               Stop your speaking!!

                          PAUL
                    (to the Guildsmen)
               Good.  You have some idea of what I would
               do but I will tell it to one who has never
               been seen... one who hides deep in the
               Heighliner control rooms.  He will hear it
               first.

                      GUILDSMEN #3
                    (fear)
               No!

     Paul smiles as we move closer and closer to him.

282. INT. CONTROL ROOM - HEIGHLINER - SPACE

     Suddenly we are in the Heighliner control room, near
     the floor in the chemical spills.  We move up into
     the orange gas.  THUNDERING begins to shake the
     Heighliner.

                       PAUL (V.O.)
               Where are you....  Let me see you or there
               will be no spice.
--
     We move into very thick gas and there is a ROARING.
     Suddenly Paul sees the Third Stage Navigator.

                   PAUL (V.O.)(CONT'D)
               You know what I'm about to say is true....
               I have the power to destroy the spice
               forever.

     The Guild Navigator's mouth stretches back in a
     horrible MOAN.  The moan becomes more pained and
     grows louder and louder.

283. INT. GREAT HALL - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY

     The Guildsmen in the room are MOANING and SCREAMING
     and swarming out towards the doorway -- the Fremen
     stop them.  The Emperor and all are amazed and
     frightened.  There is a long hush.  The old Reverend
     Mother then turns and glares at Paul.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
               Don't try your powers on me.  Try looking
               into that place where you dare not look.
               You'll find me there staring back at you!!
               You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety
               generations to produce the one person your
               schemes required.  Here I stand.  But... I
               will never be yours.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               Stop him, Jessica!

                         JESSICA
               Stop him yourself.

                          PAUL
               You saw a part of what the race needs in
               the beginning.  In time you perverted the
               truth.  You sought to control human
               breeding and intermix a select few
               according to a selfish master plan.  How
               little you understand.

                     REVEREND MOTHER
               You mustn't speak of...

                          PAUL
                    (using The Voice)
               SILENCE!

     The old woman is shot backwards by the power of his
     shout.  Her breath is knocked out of her.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
               I remember your gom jabbar, now you
               remember mine.  I can kill with a word.
--
     A Fedaykin stand forward and recites from the
     prophecy.

                       FEDAYKIN #1
               ...and his word shall carry death eternal
               to those who stand against the righteous.

     Feyd hears this and is angered.

                          FEYD
               The righteous!

                          PAUL
                    (to Emperor)
               There is a Harkonnen among you.  Give the
               Harkonnen a blade and let him stand forth.

                         EMPEROR
               If Feyd wishes, he can meet you with my
               blade in his hand.

                          FEYD
               I wish it.
                    (steps forward)

                         GURNEY
               This is a Harkonnen animal.  Let me,
               please, my Lord.

                          PAUL
               The Emperor's blade.

     Feyd takes up the Emperor's blade with a smile.
     Paul takes out his crysknife.  They begin to circle
     each other.

     Paul smiles, circling still.  Suddenly, Feyd leaps,
     his blade jabbing savagely outward, but Paul easily
     evades it, moving away.  They begin to circle again.

     He makes another pass at Paul that comes dangerously
     close, but again, Paul is away, a frozen smile on
     his face.

                          FEYD
               Why prolong the inevitable?  I will kill
               you!  I will kill him!

     Feyd smiles.  He lashes out biting Paul's hand.
     Feyd LAUGHS in triumph.

     Feyd leaps forward jabbing, his right hip also
     forward.  Yet Paul, although a little slowly, again
     reels away.  Again, Feyd thrusts.
--
     This time Paul jabs with his crysknife, but Feyd
     moves away effortlessly.  Feyd counters and kicks
     Paul to the ground.

                          CHANI
               Paul!

     Paul is up instantly and he circles with Feyd.

                          FEYD
                    (smiling)
               Who is the little one?  A pet, perhaps?
               Will she deserve my special attentions?

     Paul jabs out, his crysknife slashing.  Feyd grabs
     his arm, and Paul his, the two men locked in a
     straining clinch.  Feyd presses his right hip closer
     and closer to Paul's body.  Paul strains to keep it
     away.  Suddenly, the gom jabbar flips out of Feyd's
     girdle, but on the left side, and he lunges
     powerfully with it at Paul, who just barely misses
     taking it in his skin.  He throws Feyd back, but not
     before Feyd's feet strike out, sending Paul to the
     floor.  Feyd leaps onto him.

                          FEYD
                    (whispering)
               You see... your death... my blade will
               finish you.

     Suddenly, Paul, with lightning swiftness, pushes
     Feyd up and over.  He is on top of him in a flash.

     Paul's crysknife flashes up, thrusting upward
     through Feyd's jaw.  Feyd's mouth opens as the knife
     continues up through his tongue and through to his
     brain.  Feyd's eyes go wild, then glaze over as he
     jerks dead on the floor.  Paul slowly gets to his
     feet, breathing heavily.  Anger still seething in
     him, Paul issues a SOUND -- a loud, horrible,
     powerful sound, and Feyd's internal organs rupture
     and the stone floor under him cracks open.  The
     Fedaykin smile.

                       FEDAYKIN #2
               Usul no longer needs the weirding module.

     Everyone stares in disbelief.  Paul looks to the
     Emperor.

                          PAUL
               Now, I will tell you how it will be.
               Irulan shall be my wife, opening the way
               for an Atreides to take the throne.

                         EMPEROR
               I sit on the throne!!
--
                          PAUL
               You will sit on a throne on Selusa
               Secundus, your prison planet.  Either that
               or you will die.

     The Emperor is still.  Paul moves to Chani.

                      PAUL (CONT'D)
                    (to Chani)
               The Princess shall have no more of me than
               my name... no child of mine or touch the
               softness of glance... nor instant of
               desire....  This is my promise to you...
                    (whispering)
               ...my love.

     Paul turns back to the others.

     Jessica turns to Chani and whispers to her.

                         JESSICA
               Think on it Chani... We who carry the name
               of concubine... history will call us
               wives.

     Alia enters with two monks.  She signals and one of
     them places a cloak over Paul's shoulders.

                          PAUL
               The Fremen have the word of Muad'dib.
               They will have their Holy War to cleanse
               the Universe... they will have Arrakis...
               Dune... their planet.  There will be
               flowing water here open to the sky and
               rich green oases.  For the spice there
               will always be some desert.  There will be
               fierce winds and trials to toughen men.
               We Fremen have a saying...
                    (he stares at the Reverend Mother)
               "God created Arrakis to train the
               faithful."
               One cannot go against the word of God.

     Everyone in the room stares at him soundlessly.

                          ALIA
               And how can this be?

     There are three powerful drum hits.

                      ALIA (CONT'D)
               For... he is the Kwisatz Haderach!
--
284. EXT. ARRAKEEN PALACE - DUSK

     Paul opens his mouth and issues an ever increasing
     wind.  Lightning and thunder begin.  Clouds begin to
     form over the Palace.  In the half-light of dusk,
     thousands of Fremen watch the sky.  Giant golden
     lights are illuminated and their rays shoot far into
     the sky illuminating the growing clouds.  Five
     tremendous bolts of lightning suddenly unleash a
     downpour of RAIN ON ARRAKIS.  The Fremen stand
     awestruck as they are drenched with water falling
     from the sky.

285. INT. GREAT HALL - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY

     WE MOVE through Paul's glowing blue eyes into
     beautiful blue luminescent light.

     A gigantic WIND arises, and suddenly appearing in
     the blue light is an ocean of light rolling like
     gold glass off into infinite.  The blue becomes
     darker and a golden lotus flower blooms in the
     night.

                         THE END

Commentary by Richard Michaels



TITLES: "E.T. - THE EXTRA-TERRESTIAL"

[The letters are in soft-purple against a black background. Purple is
traditionally the color of that which is sacred.]

EXT: NIGHT SKY: NIGHT

The black screen becomes a night sky. The camera angles lowers to show a
forest against the night sky.

EXT: LANDING SITE: NIGHT

In an opening in the forest stands a spacecraft. The view of the craft is
obscured by tree branches. The atmosphere is misty, with blue lights coming
from the spacecraft.

[The opening scene is misty and diffused. This forces the audience to pay
close attention to the images on the screen. The characters are not clearly
seen. This engages the audience, as they attempt to see what the aliens
really look like.]

One creature walks up the gang blank and into the ship.

INSERT: ALIEN HAND

A strange hand, with two long and slender fingers protruding, move aside a
branch that obstructs the view.

[This concentrates the audience's attention. The creature going into the
ship is being observed by another creature. Who are they? What's going on?
This is another technique that forces the audience to focus on the action.]

INT: SPACECRAFT'S GREENHOUSE: NIGHT

The inside of the ship appears to be a greenhouse. There are sounds of
water dripping. Cone shaped objects (possibly alien plants) sit among earth
plants. Vapors flow up from the plants.

[These images all appear non-threatening. The aliens are inferred to be
collecting vegetation, and are thereby inferred to be harmless.]

[Like many of Spielberg's other films, the opening sequences contain almost
no dialogue. The story is told without verbal exposition. He forces the
audience to become engaged in the storytelling process by giving them just
bits of information that they have to piece together into the story. He
doesn't insult their intelligence.]

EXT: SPACECRAFT: NIGHT

A group of the aliens work in front of the spacecraft. Suddenly, they hear
a dog howl, and they all stop working. Red lights begin to glow in their
chests. It appears as if their hearts have lit up at the sign of danger, as
the red glow seeps through their translucent skin. After a moment the red
lights dim and they return to their work.

[This sets up the prop of the red-lights signifying danger. These small
creatures are endearing and non-threatening. They are like children, which
is immediate grounds for audience empathy. The thought that they may be in
danger from wild creatures in the forest, also creates empathy for them.]

EXT: FOREST: NIGHT

A small fern grows on the forest floor. An alien hand, with two fingers
protruding, reaches out for the fern. The alien groans. A rabbit turns and
listens. The fingers dig up the plant as the rabbit watches. The alien then
carefully uproots the plant. A small wayward alien walks alone among the
gigantic redwood trees. He's dwarfed by the huge trees.

[The awesome towering trees psychologically creates audience empathy for
the creature. The audience identifies with him because they too feel small
when confronted by these trees.]

EXT: HILLTOP: NIGHT

The creature stands alone on a hilltop as he stares down at the city lights
below. Suddenly he lets out a moan of fright. A truck, with headlights
glaring, pulls up next to him.

[The quiet, peaceful alien is now in jeopardy.]

The creature runs from the lights. Several other trucks with head- lights
glaring drive up. Smoke flows from their exhaust pipes. Men's legs are seen
as they walk among the trucks. They step into a mud puddle as E.T. watches
from behind a shrub. A man with keys jangling from his waist walks past a
headlight. He carries a flashlight in his hands.

[Keys have now become a prop which identifies the antagonist of the story:
the faceless government agent. Like the antagonist of many other fantasy
films, his face is not initially revealed in order to hold the audiences
attention.]

The man with keys walks to a truck where he and two other men review a map
that's placed on the hood of the truck. The man with keys holds the
flashlight up and points it at the hood. E.T watches them from the bushes.

[The fact that E.T. is observing the actions of the men also creates a
psychological bond between the audience and him, since they are also
observing these characters.]

[While the audience doesn't actually see a map, they presume its existence
given the actions of the characters. This style of story telling engages
the audience, and gets them guessing about the characters' actions. They
then create expectations, which are later often proved to be wrong. This
makes the story both unpredictable and exciting.]

EXT: SPACESHIP: NIGHT

An alien stands in front of a round light and transmits a homing signal,
presumably to call the other aliens back to the ship.

[These characters are all in jeopardy.]

EXT: FOREST: NIGHT

When E.T hears the sound, his red heart lights up. The homing signal
reverberates in his chest.

[This establishes that his heart is used as a communication device, i.e.,
these aliens communicate with their hearts.]

"Keys" hears this sound and quickly turns around. He points his flashlight
towards the sounds. The other men join him as they walk towards the sound.
E.T. screams and runs away, which is indicated by the shaking bushes. The
men with flashlights chase after him.

[So, like Dorothy in the WIZARD OF OZ, the opening scene has the
protagonist being pursued by an unknown antagonist.]

EXT: SPACECRAFT: NIGHT

The lights dim on the footings of the spacecraft, presumably because the
spacecraft is preparing to takeoff.

[The protagonist has the added jeopardy of being abandoned.]

EXT: FOREST: NIGHT

E.T. screams as he races for the spacecraft. The glow from his red-heart
reflects off the bushes as he runs towards the white light of the
spacecraft.

[The audience still hasn't seen the face of the protagonist.]

EXT: SPACECRAFT: NIGHT

A lone alien stands before a large round white light, as he signals for the
other aliens to return to the ship.

EXT: FOREST: NIGHT

Men with flashlights run through the forest, as they pursue the red glowing
light racing towards the spacecraft. One of the pursuers is the man wearing
the keys on his waist.

EXT: SPACECRAFT: NIGHT

The grated gangplank lifts up, blocking the entrance to the ship. Behind
the grate stands the alien against the large round white light. The red
light of the aliens heart lights up as he stands behind the barrier.

[This image exhibits an obstacle to E.T. returning to his ship.]

EXT: FOREST: NIGHT

The men reach the edge of the clearing and stop as they watch the
spacecraft lift off.

One red lighted heart races along an old country fence towards the
departing spacecraft. Men with flashlights are still in pursuit. They stop
at a wooden gate as they watch the spacecraft fly away.

E.T., with face obstructed by a branch, and with red-heart aglow, watches
the spacecraft fly away into the night. He utters a sorrowful moan.

[He has been abandoned in a hostile alien world. This situation is
guaranteed to generate audience empathy.]

The men with flashlights pointed up towards the sky watch the space- craft
fly away. They hear E.T.'s groan, and in unison point their flashlights in
his direction.

[Not only is the small childlike creature abandoned, but he is still in
jeopardy of being captured by those who pursue him.]

[This is the inciting event in E.T.'s story: his spacecraft has deserted
him.]

EXT: HILLTOP: NIGHT

Below lies the city, lit up against the dark night sky. E.T slowly makes
his way down the slope.

Men with flashlights follow. They reach the hilltop, search the underbrush
for the alien, then start down the slope after him.

[This concludes the prelude to the story. Both the protagonist and
antagonist have been introduced, and audience empathy has been established
for the protagonist. The protagonist's primary objective is to survive and
find a way home, while the antagonist's primary objective is to capture the
alien.]

EXT: SUBURBAN HOUSE: NIGHT

[This is an establishing shot.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: NIGHT

A group of boys are sitting around a table playing a DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS
game. One boy is on the telephone ordering a pizza. They throw wads of
paper at each other as they play.

Elliott, the youngest boy, sits behind the counter. He's separated from the
other boys. After a few moments he yells that he's ready to play the game.

[The character's positions are structured to emphasize Elliott's separation
from the others.]

One of the boys tells Elliott that he can't join when they are in the
middle of the game.

[Audience empathy is generated for the young child who is being excluded
from the game.]

Elliott walks up to the table and yells at his brother, Mike. Michael says
that Elliott has to ask Steve, who is the Game Master, and who has absolute
power.

[The notion of "absolute power" is set up here, for a "payoff" later when
Elliott uses it to keep Michael silent about E.T.]

[Elliott's objective here is to play the game, but also to be accepted by
the group and gain the respect of the older boys.]

Steve tells Elliott that first he has to wait for the pizza, then when he
brings it back he can play. Steve gives him money for the pizza. Elliott
picks up his baseball and glove, then leaves the room.

[The ball and glove are props that will be used in the story.]

[Elliott's sub-objective is to get the pizza. Once this is accomplished,
he'll be able to play the game.]

EXT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: NIGHT

It's a rainy, misty night. Elliott, with ball and glove in hand wait at the
bottom of the driveway for the pizza. A car pulls up and parks in the
driveway. Elliott pays the driver, then takes the pizza box from him as the
car pulls out of the driveway.

Elliott walks up the driveway and into the garage. He hears a noise in the
backyard, then calls out the name "HARVEY," presumably his dogs name.

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: NIGHT

Elliott's mother wears an orange outfit as she works in the kitchen. She
bends over to put dishes into the dishwasher. When she does this one of the
young boys reaches out to put his finger on her rear. Mike yells for him to
stop. He pulls his finger away.

INT: PATIO: NIGHT

Elliot walks past the ping pong table when he hears more noises in the
backyard. Again he calls out the name "Harvey."

[This generates tension and suspense in the audience.]

With the pizza box in hand, Elliot walks past the patio table and towards
the shed in the backyard. A bright crescent moon hangs in the night sky.

[This adds enchantment to the scene.]

There is a mist in the air, and a bright light shines in the shed. Elliott
places the pizza box on the ground as he approaches the shed. He's still
carrying the baseball and glove as he stands in front of the shed's
entrance. He tosses the ball into the shed. After a few seconds the ball is
tossed back out at him and hits him on the foot.

[This is the payoff to the setup of the baseball prop. This event surprises
both Elliott and the audience.]

Elliott becomes frightened, turns and steps on the pizza box as he runs
towards the house.

[This is the inciting event in Elliott's story: there is some creature
hiding out in his shed that will change his whole life.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: NIGHT

Elliott's mother is talking to the boys when Elliott runs into the house
screaming that there's something in the tool shed. He tells them that it
threw a ball at him, but they continue to ignore him until he screams
"QUIET!" "Nobody go out there," says Elliott. The boys immediately jump up
from the table. Two boys grab kitchen knives as Michael tells his mother to
stay inside. He and his friends will check it out. She yells at them to put
the knives back as she follows them outside.

EXT: SHED: NIGHT

The light is still on in the shed.

EXT: PATIO: NIGHT

Elliott's mother walks into the yard with a flashlight in her hand. She is
surrounded by the boys as they approach the shed. The mother says that
there's nothing in there as Michael walks through the entrance. Michael
bends down and finds tracks on the dirt floor. "The coyote's come back
again, Ma." he says. His mother becomes frightened and orders them all back
into the house.

[Jeopardy is introduced into the situation. Even though the audience knows
that it is probably the alien in the shed, the scene increases the
tension.]

On his way back to the house, Michael sees the pizza box. He bends down,
opens the box, then takes out a piece. He's angry at Elliott. Elliott tries
to explain that it was just an accident, but his brother is still angry.
When the mother asks who ordered the pizza, Elliott points to one of Mike's
friends. This makes the friend mad at Elliott. Elliot tries to persuade his
mother that there is a creature in the shed, but she doesn't believe him.
They walk into the house.

[Empathy is generated for Elliott because the two boys are unfairly angry
at him and his mother doesn't believe him.]

INT: SHED: NIGHT

The alien's fingers point out into the shed entrance, then wrap around the
side of the door. The sound of his heavy breathing is heard.

[This establishes for the audience that he really is in the shed. They feel
sorry for Elliott because he was telling the truth and no one believed
him.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S BEDROOM: NIGHT

The clock on the end table indicates 2:00. Next to the clock is a picture
of a dog, presumably Harvey. This same dog lies asleep in the bed. He hears
a noise and picks up his head. He is in the lower half of a bunk bed. On
the top bunk sits Elliott. He is awake as he listens to the noise outside.

[Elliott's objective is to prove there's a creature in the shed.]

EXT: BACKYARD: NIGHT

Elliott opens a gate and walks into the backyard. He carries a flashlight
in his hand and shines it into the cornfield next to his house. He walks
into the field.

EXT: CORNFIELD: NIGHT

Elliott walks into the cornfield. He whistles, and gets entangled in the
cornstalks as he walks. He sees tracks in the dirt with his baseball
nearby. He continues to walk through the field.

[The stalks are obstacles that obstruct both his path and his vision. It
also clutters the visuals and forces the audience to pay closer attention.
The suspense increases because they aren't sure whether he'll meet up with
the alien or the coyote.]

Elliott pushes aside some stalks and shines the light into the face of E.T.
Together, in unison, the scream. Elliot drops his light, then continues to
scream as he looks around the field. E.T. cries out and runs away through
the cornfield.

[Their reactions upon seeing each other were identical. This is the first
instance of a series of situations which will "merge" their characters to
such an extent that whatever empathy the audience has for one they will
also have for the other.]

EXT: BACKYARD: NIGHT

Elliott runs into his backyard. His play swings sway back and forth in the
air, as if someone had just bumped into them. Two garbage pails fall over
near an open metal gate at the top of a stone stairway. The garbage rolls
out of the cans and down the stone stairs. A red light by the gate lights
the stone stairway.

[The audience psychologically associates this red light with E.T.'s red
lighted heart, and makes the inference that he had run up the staircase and
out the gate.]

Elliott has an expression of wonderment and gratification on his face as he
looks up the staircase, for he has just established the existence of the
creature in the shed.]

EXT: GARAGE: DAY

Elliott rides down the driveway on his bicycle. He next rides down a dirt
road that overlooks the suburban community.

[Elliott's new objective is to locate the creature.]

EXT: FOREST ROAD: DAY

Elliott holds a bag of candy in one hand as he pours some into the other
hand. He tosses candy onto the round as he walks through the woods calling
out for the creature.

In another part of the woods Elliott lays his bike down, then continues to
toss candy and yell out "hello!" He sees a man on the road below and
quickly hides behind a tree.

["Keys," the faceless antagonist, is still pursuing the alien.]

Elliott runs back to his bike, then rides down the forest road past a wire
fence. The alien's fingers side down the side to the tree. He was watching
Elliott.

[Elliott is in jeopardy both from the faceless man and the faceless alien.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY

Elliott's mother sits at the tale with the dog, Harvey, at her side.
Elliott, Michael and Gertie are eating supper.

[This is a home without a father, which creates more empathy for the
protagonist.]

Gertie asks Elliott what he's going as for Halloween. He's depressed, and
replies that he's not going. Mike mocks him by suggesting that he go as a
goblin. Elliott snaps back, telling Mike to shut up. The mother tries to
explain that it's not that they don't believe him, but Elliott cries out
that the creature was real.

[The audience also knows that the creature is real. This generates more
empathy for the protagonist, because he is mocked and not believed when he
is expressing the truth.]

Mike offers other suggestions: perhaps it was an iguana, a deformed child,
or maybe an Elf or a Leprechaun. Elliott gets angry and shouts "It was
nothing like that, penis breath." Mary, his mother shouts at him to sit
down. Elliott responds with "Dad would believe me." Mary replies "Maybe you
ought to call your father and tell him about it." "I can't. He's in Mexico
with Sally" says Elliott. Both Mary and Mike are upset, while Gertie asks
"Where's Mexico?" Mary excuses herself and leaves the table. She walks to
the window as Mike tells Elliott that he's going to kill him. "If you ever
see it again, don't touch it. Just call me and we'll have someone come and
take it away," says Mary. "Like the dog catcher?" says Gertie. "But they'll
give it a lobotomy, or do experiments on it or something," says Elliott.

[This sets up the audience's expectations about the harm that will befall
the alien when he is captured.]

After a bit of dialogue concerning who should be doing the dishes, Mary
leaves the room saying "He hates Mexico."

[This scene explores the emotional relationships between the family members
in greater detail. Empathy is also generated for Mary who was abandoned by
her husband. She is left with the responsibility of raising the children
while he's traveling with his new girlfriend to Mexico, a country which he
hates.]

Elliott takes some dishes to the sink, turns on the faucet and gazes out
the kitchen window as water steams up from the sink.

EXT: BACKYARD: NIGHT

A crescent moon floats in the sky. A bright light is on in the shed. In
front of the shed Elliott lies inside a sleeping bag on a folding chair
with a flashlight in his hand. He hears the sound of feet walking in the
underbrush.

Elliott sits up to see the alien standing in front of the shed. The alien
groans as Elliott freezes from fear in his chair. He tries to call out for
his mother, but can't get the words out of his mouth. He next tries to call
Mike, but fear makes him choke on his words.

The alien approaches Elliott. The bright light from the shed makes it
impossible to see his face: only the outline of his form is visible. The
alien walks right up to the edge of the lawn chair.

[The scene is filled with suspense because Elliott may be in jeopardy from
the creature.]

The alien slowly moves its hand over the chair, then drops candies onto the
blanket. Elliott relaxes.

[This non-verbal gesture by E.T. demonstrates that he is harmless. The
tension in the scene is thereby released. Elliott has achieved his
objective: he established contact with the alien.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: NIGHT

Elliott places candy on the carpet, then walks backwards down the hallway
towards his room. E.T. walks up the stairs and reaches out for the candy,
which he then takes into his hand and eats.

[Elliott's new objective is to get the alien into his room. His main
obstacles are to somehow persuade the alien to come into the house, while
not waking his family.]

[This scene also is a good example of how to structure a scene's beginning.
In real life, the scene would have started in the backyard, tracked through
the kitchen, the living room and then up the stairs. But since all of that
information would have been redundant, picking the action up from the top
of the stairs was sufficient.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM: NIGHT

Elliott places candy on the floor by the entrance to his room. A sign on
his door contains the word "ENTER." E.T picks up the candy.

Elliott has run out of candy. He goes to his desk in search for more. He
opens some drawers, but doesn't find any. When he returns to the doorway,
E.T. has already entered the room. E.T. pulls a box down from the table,
then knocks a can filled with pens onto the floor. This makes a loud noise,
and forces Elliott to quickly close the door to his room.

[The audience still does not have a clear view of E.T.'s face nor body.
This holds their attention during the scene. They are waiting for that
wonderful moment.]

Elliott throws a blanket over E.T. as they stare at each other. E.T. is
finally revealed to the audience.

Elliott moves his hand in front of his face, a gesture indicating
bewilderment. E.T. mimics this action.

[This is the beginning of their efforts to communicate, but also the start
of the audience emotionally identifying the two characters as one object of
empathy.]

Elliott places his fingers to his lips to see if E.T. will respond in the
same manner, which he does. Elliott then places one finger to his ear,
which E.T. also mimics. Elliott smiles, then holds his left hand up with
all five fingers spread apart. E.T. raises his left hand with three fingers
spread apart. Elliott closes his fingers until there is only one remaining
up. E.T. does the same. They both wiggle this one finger. A poster on the
wall between Elliott and E.T. has the word "SUPERSTAR" printed on it.

[These actions help the audience to conceive of these two characters as
"mirror images" of one another, worthy of equal empathy. It also bonds the
young children in the audience to them, because the characters are speaking
in a language they too can understand. All the children in the audience
have just been through the experience of learning a language. They can
easily identify with the problems that that two characters in the story are
having in communicating with each other. This forges a bond between the
children and both Elliott and E.T. This also forms the basis for the repeat
viewing of this film which was essential for its phenomenal box-office
success.]

Suddenly, Elliott becomes tired and yawns, then sways as if in a trance. He
slowly walks backwards and sits down in a chair. Elliott seems asleep as
the camera moves up for a closeup of Elliott's face.

[Presumably, E.T. has used his telepathic powers to place Elliott into a
trance in order to merge their minds and feelings.]

[This is the end of the first act. Elliott has succeeded in gaining
possession of the dramatic objective E.T.), and has him in his room. But
E.T. has also taken possession of Elliott by merging their feelings, so
that they both become one protagonist. The second act will end when they
are both captured by the antagonist.]

EXT: FOREST: DAY

Mist envelops the fence and gate in the section of the forest where E.T
originally landed. Men with flashlights and floodlights search throughout
the area. "Keys" walks into the forefront, holding a flashlight in his
hand. He bends to the ground and finds some candy.

[The objective of the faceless antagonist is to capture the alien. The
candy is a prop that will lead them to Elliott's house just as Elliott used
them to lead E.T. into his room. This scene shows that the protagonist is
in jeopardy, because he is still being pursued.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM: DAY

Elliott lies in bed with a thermometer in his mouth. His head rests on an
orange pillow (same color as his mother's dress in the first scene) while
his mother sits besides him. She takes out the thermometer, reads it, then
says "Okay, you're hot." She then leaves the room. Elliott quickly swings a
lamp back over his head and heats the thermometer. He also places a blue
heating pad over his face, to heat himself. He then places the thermometer
back into his mouth, swings the lamp away, and places the heating pad under
the covers as his mother enters the room. She opens his closet and
separates the hanging clothes as she walks into the closet. Elliott sits up
in bed and intensely watches her.

[Elliott's objective is to stay home from school in order to be with E.T.
His obstacle is his mother, who wants him to go to school. To overcome this
obstacle he must persuade her that he's sick. A crisis occurs when she
enters the closet in which E.T. is hiding. This creates jeopardy for the
protagonist.]

EXT: DRIVEWAY: DAY

Mike backs the car down the driveway.

INTERCUT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM

Mary walks out of the closet carrying a blue sleeping bag. Elliott is
tense, then relieved, once he realizes that she didn't find E.T. He falls
back into bed.

INTERCUT: DRIVEWAY

Mike backs the car over part of the lawn.

[This scene functions not only as comic relief, but also as a set up for
the scene here Mike has to drive the van during E.T.'s escape sequence.
This demonstrates both his incompetence, and that he is only allowed to
drive the car backwards down the driveway.]

INTERCUT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM

Mary covers Elliott with the blue sleeping bag as Elliott puts the
thermometer back into his mouth (first backwards, then he corrects it).

[Humor is generated because the audience knows that he is fooling his
mother.]

INTERCUT: DRIVEWAY

Mike continues to back the car down the driveway. He overshoots the edge
and goes out into the street. He then pulls forward across the sidewalk.

INTERCUT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM

"You were outside waiting for that thing?" says Mary. Elliott nods.

[Elliott is covered in blue-white colors, which traditionally signify
innocence, and which generates audience empathy for him.]

She tells him not to watch TV, kisses him, then leaves the room. Elliott
quickly closes the blinds.

EXT: DRIVEWAY: DAY

Mary runs down the driveway towards the car. Gertie points out the patches
of lawn that Mike pulled onto the driveway as he was driving the car. Mary
pulls her into the car.

INT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM: DAY

Elliott gestures for E.T. to walk out of the closet, which he does. He is
wearing Elliott's robe. Elliott asks him if he talks.

[Elliott's objective is to communicate with E.T., his obstacle is that E.T.
does not speak the English language.]

"Me Human. Boy. Elliott, Elliott, Elliott" says Elliott.

E.T. turns away and walks towards the work table. Elliott picks up objects,
such as a can of coke and toy soldiers, from the table then names them for
E.T. Elliott points to the fish and explains how the fish eat the fish
food. He places a wooden toy shark into the fishbowl, then states that the
shark eats the fish but nobody eats the shark.

[In his effort to communicate with E.T., Elliott tries to teach him the
language by showing him objects that are used in everyday life. This
process is similar to that experienced by the children and parents in the
audience everyday as they also learn and attempt to communicate with each
other. This type of scene solidifies the audience's emotional bonding with
Elliott and E.T.]

E.T. takes a toy car into his mouth on chews on it.

[Like many a child would.]

Elliott takes this to mean that E.T. is hungry. Elliott tells E.T. to stay
where he is.

[Elliott's new objective is to get food for E.T. and himself.]

Elliott opens the door and Harvey tries to run into the room. E.T. groans
with fear and backs into a corner as Elliott pulls Harvey out of the room.

[This introduces jeopardy into the scene, for Harvey could harm E.T.]

INT: KITCHEN: DAY

Elliott, dressed only in white underwear, opens the refrigerator door and
takes out some food.

INTERCUT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM

E.T. walks around the room.

INTERCUT: KITCHEN

Elliott opens up a jar of peanut butter.

INTERCUT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM

E.T. touches a tennis racket.

INTERCUT: KITCHEN

Elliott picks up cheese and tomatoes.

INTERCUT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM

E.T. picks up an umbrella.

INTERCUT: KITCHEN

Elliott takes a carton of milk out of the refrigerator.

INTERCUT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM

E.T. accidentally opens up the umbrella.

INTERCUT: KITCHEN

Elliott screams with fright and drops the milk carton onto the floor.

INTERCUT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM

E.T. screams with fright, drops the umbrella, then runs into the closet.

[This further establishes the merging of E.T. and Elliott into one being.
Elliott shares E.T.'s feelings and simultaneously experiences what he
experiences. The audience also experiences this surprise with them, which
further tightens the bonds.]

Milk flows from the open carton onto the floor, as Elliott leans into the
open refrigerator. He clutches his chest and looks up towards the ceiling
as he ponders his experience.

INT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM: DAY

Elliott carries a plate of food into the room. He walks past the open
umbrella and looks into the closet. Stuffed animals line the back of the
closet wall. E.T. pushes the animals forward. He was hiding behind them. He
is still shaking from the fright experience. "Are you okay? Too much
excitement, huh? You want a coke?"

[This is the resolution of the last scene sequence. We see both characters'
reactions to the events that have occurred.]

EXT: DRIVEWAY: DAY

Michael runs up the driveway towards his house. He's wearing a red football
blazer.

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY

Michael opens the front door and runs into the house. He takes off his red
shirt to reveal the blue shirt he's wearing underneath. He picks up a
magazine then opens the refrigerator. "Nothing but health shit," he says,
as he takes out a can and shakes it.

[The audience tenses up because jeopardy has just been introduced into the
story. They wonder what will happen when Mike discovers E.T. in Elliott's
bedroom.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM: DAY

Elliott walks away from his closet and opens the door to his room. He tells
Mike to come in. Both boys are dressed in blue and white colors. Mike calls
Elliott a faker, then starts to tell him about scores on an asteroid game,
when Elliott interrupts, to tell him about the goblin. Michael makes fun of
Elliott and his belief that the goblin has returned. But Elliott persists,
and makes Mike promise to give Elliott "absolute power."

[This is the payoff to the "absolute power" concept as set up during the
DUNGEON AND DRAGONS scene.]

[Elliott's objective is to vindicate himself to his brother and sister by
proving that "the Goblin-E.T." really does exist.]

Ellott makes Mike close his eyes, then he retrieves E.T. from the closet
and leads him to the center of the room. Mike has a silly grin on his face
as he opens his eyes and turns around to look at E.T. A sickening look of
terror comes over his face.

Suddenly Gertie opens the door and walks into the room with her doll under
her arm, saying "Elliott, look what I made for you." E.T. sees her then
stretches his neck to raise his head high. Gertie walks right up to him and
screams. E.T. screams back at her. Elliott screams for both of them to
stop. Mike falls back against the wall and knocks down the bookcase. They
all scream together. Elliott grabs Gertie's mouth and pushes her back to
Mike.

"Kids, I'm home," shouts Mary from downstairs.

[Jeopardy! The mother, an adult, is about to discover E.T. Even though they
are terrified, the children all band together against the threat. They'd
rather sit in the closet with the "monster" than have their mother discover
him.]

Mike quickly shuts the door, then they all run to the closet. Gertie
screams again. Mike grabs her by the mouth and pulls her away as E.T. runs
across the room with his arms raised. Elliott shuts the closet door just as
his mother walks into his room. Mary notices the fallen bookcase. She looks
around and then comments, "This is no room, this is an accident." Elliot
tries to cover by saying he was "reorganizing."

INT: CLOSET: DAY

E.T.'s head appears among the stuffed animals. Mike has his hand over
Gertie's mouth as she tries to scream. Mary walks past the closet door.

[This creates suspense in the audience: will E.T. be discovered by Mary?]

Mary asks Elliot to keep an eye on Gertie while she takes a shower. She
kisses him on the head then leaves the room. Elliott opens the closet door.
Michael, in awe with mouth open wide, watches as Elliott approaches E.T.

"Elliott," whispers Mike. "I'm keeping him," says Elliott.

E.T. sits behind the stuffed animals as if he was one of them.

[The use of stuffed animals as props around E.T helps to transfer positive
feelings that the audience has for them to E.T.]

Gertie asks what it is as she and Michael approach E.T. Elliott tells her
that it won't hurt her. When asked if it's a boy or girl, Elliott replies
that it's a boy. He then tells her that she can't tell Mom about the
creature. When asked why not, he explains that "grownups can't see him.
Only little kids can see him." Gertie snaps back, "Give me a break."

[The charm in Gertie's character lies in the contradictory attributes of
being a sophisticated child. Humor is generated by this incongruity.]

Elliott then goes into his Dracula voice: "Then do you know what will
happen if you do tell?" He grabs Gertie's doll, tosses it to Mike and tells
him to "Do it!." Mike "tortures" the doll by twisting its arm. Gertie cries
as she runs to it. E.T. watches the scene with wonderment in his eyes.
Gertie finally promises not to tell about E.T. They all watch him as he
stretches his neck and lifts up his head.

EXT: COMMUNITY: DAY

On the hilltop overlooking the neighborhood stands a man with a camera as
he takes photos of the houses below. The man with keys on his waist walks
into the area, as other men comb the ground with electronic equipment.

[Jeopardy is introduced in the scene in order to maintain tension in the
audience. The antagonist is getting closer to the home of the protagonist.]

EXT: ELLIOTT`S HOUSE: NIGHT

[This is an establishing shot.]

INT: ELLIOTT`S HOUSE: NIGHT

Mary, carrying a yellow watering pail, walks across the room and waters a
large plant. Gertie pulls a little red wagon into the hallway. When asked
by Mary what she's doing, Gertie replies that she's going to play in
Elliott's room. "Okay, don't let them torture you," says the mother. "I
won't, Mary," replies Gertie.

[This generates humor because the child deals with the mother as if they
are equals.]

Gertie picks up a pot containing a sickly geranium plant and places it into
the wagon. The phone rings and Mary answers it off screen.

[The plant becomes an important prop because in the story it will represent
the health and well-being of E.T.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM: NIGHT

Gertie knocks on the door. Mike lets her and Harvey into the room. They
walk to the table where E.T. and Elliott are sitting. Gertie puts the
sickly plant n the table. E.T. puts his finger into the plant. Elliott
opens up an encyclopedia and points to California on a map of the United
States. "We are here," Elliott says as E.T. munches on celery. Michael
hands Elliott a globe and tells him to use this instead of the map. Elliott
points to the globe, then asks E.T. where he's from. E.T. points out the
window.

[Elliott's objective is to discover more about the alien.]

Elliott opens the book to a page that has the map of a galaxy. He points to
the planet earth, touches the globe, then says "HOME, HOME." E.T. makes a
soft noise that sounds similar to the word "home." Gertie watches him as he
picks up round objects and places them on the map: three small pieces of
fruit and two eggs. E.T.'s eyes concentrate on the table, which then starts
to shake. The two eggs and three small pieces of fruit then lift off the
table and float in the air. The children watch with awe.

[This introduction of "magical" powers that E.T. possesses was unexpected
and thereby helps to make the story unpredictable.]

Elliott screams with fright and the floating objects drop to the floor. He
walks to a lamp and stares into it. Mike asks what is wrong. "I don't know.
Something scary," says Elliott as E.T. places his finger on Elliott's
shoulder.

[Jeopardy is introduced into the scene with this comment. Yet it is not
E.T. who is to be feared, as indicated by his comforting gesture of placing
his finger on Elliott's shoulder.]

EXT: BACKYARD: NIGHT

Elliott runs by the shed, past a swaying swing, up the stairs to the red
lamppost and to the wire gate. He strains to hear the sounds of men
talking.

[The antagonist is getting closer to the home of the protagonist.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM: NIGHT

E.T. sits next to a lamp as he reads a child's ABC book. He sits next to a
Raggedy Ann doll.]

[Another image of E.T. learning the language which helps to forge a bond
between him and children in the audience. Good feelings for the doll are
also transferred to the alien.]

On the floor next to E.T. is the pot containing the sickly flowers. He
looks at the flowers, makes a moaning sound, and suddenly they become
healthy and transform into full bloom.

[This establishes the magical healing powers of E.T.]

EXT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY

Elliott and Mike walk down the driveway. They are on their way to school.
They discuss E.T., arguing about how smart he is.

[This is just a transition scene.]

EXT: STREET: DAY

Mike and Elliot walk towards a bus stop where a group of children are
waiting. Mike's friends torment Elliott about his "goblin."

[This generates more audience empathy for Elliott, who is unfairly mocked
by the ignorant boys. Elliott still has not earned the respect of Mike's
friends, which is one of his dreams.]

They finally get on the bus as Elliott walks away, followed by a pretty
blonde girl who seems to have a crush on him. Michael appears worried as he
sits on the bus among the other children who are throw- ing objects at each
other.

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY

Gertie stands on the stairway looking up, presumably thinking about E.T. in
Elliott's room. Mary comes running downstairs and tells Gertie that they
have to get into the car, otherwise they'll be late. Suddenly, Mary hears a
noise upstairs. She goes up to see what caused the sound.

[Jeopardy: E.T. is in danger of being discovered by an adult. The
audience's expectations were shaped in the earlier dinner scene, where Mary
told the children she would call to have the creature taken away if he came
around the house again. This is what the audience expects her to do if she
finds E.T.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S BEDROOM: DAY

Mary walks into the closet and looks around. The camera pans across the
large faces of all the stuffed dolls: Raggedy Ann, a Bear, a Monkey, E.T.'s
Face, a Lion, etc. Mary doesn't notice E.T., then closes the closet door
and leaves.

[Humor is generated because of the incongruity of a living creature among
the dolls, and the inability of Mary to distinguish between them. The
laughter releases the tension that was created in the previous scene. This
also reinforces the audience's emotional ties to E.T., since he is so
"doll-like."]

INT: SCHOOL: DAY

A teacher walks down the aisle and announces to the class that today they
will perform the frog dissection for which they have been preparing. As he
passes Elliott's desk, he starts to say "frogs similar to," then he notices
the drawing of E.T. The teacher picks it up. Elliott turns to see the
pretty blonde girl staring at him. Realizing she's been caught, she quickly
turns and looks away.

[This attraction to Elliott is set up in order to payoff before the end of
the school sequence.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM: DAY

E.T. opens the door to Elliott's room and walks out into the hallway.
Harvey sees and quickly approaches.

[Jeopardy: will the dog attack E.T.? At there last encounter E.T. was
frightened by Harvey.]

INTERCUT: CLASSROOM

The teacher continues his instructions, telling the students that the
scalpel is very sharp, and that they should use discretion when cutting.
There should be very little blood, and maybe a little body fluids.

[This exposition of the plans sets up the audience's expectations, which
later will not be fulfilled. This is a standard structure used to generated
excitement and unpredictability in a story.]

INT: KITCHEN: DAY

E.T., wearing a blue-flannel shirt, walks into the kitchen with Harvey at
his side. He opens the refrigerator. Harvey licks his lips as he watches in
anticipation of getting something to eat. E.T. takes out a plastic
container of potato salad, opens it, then sticks his tongue into the salad.
He hates the taste and throws it onto the floor. Harvey licks it up. E.T.
then picks up a can of beer and drinks it as Harvey barks.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

Elliott sits at his desk as he listens to the teacher speak. Elliott burps.
All the children in the classroom stare at him.

[This again shows the merging of Elliott and E.T.]

INTERCUT: KITCHEN

E.T., drunk, wobbles across the kitchen floor and walks into a counter.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

Elliott places his fingers to his head. He is also becoming drunk. The
teacher tells the class that in this bisection they should locate the heart
and notice that it is still beating.

[The red-lit heart is the most prominent feature of E.T. Having the teacher
focus on the frog's heart starts the identification in the audience's mind
of the frogs and E.T.]

INTERCUT: KITCHEN

E.T. turns and walks into another wall as Harvey continues to eat the
potato salad on the floor.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

Elliott, now drunk, slides down in his chair.

INTERCUT: KITCHEN

E.T. turns, walks, then collapses head first onto the floor.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

Elliott slides under his desk and falls onto the floor. The teacher doesn't
hear this because at that moment he pulls down a wall hanging which
contains pictures of a frog's anatomy.

INTERCUT: KITCHEN

E.T. opens another can of beer.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

Elliott pulls himself up off the floor with a drunken smile on his face.

INTERCUT: KITCHEN

E.T. gulps down another can of beer.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

Elliott, drunk, sits at his desk. He turns and smiles at the pretty blonde
girl across the aisle. She turns away from him with disgust.

INTERCUT: LIVING ROOM

E.T. plays on the keys of a voice generating language game. He next presses
a button on a remote control which activates the TV set. A cartoon appears
with a cat getting its tail caught on fire. The cat screams and E.T reacts
with horror. He throws the beer can at the TV set.

[Laughter is generated, for while this under normal circumstances would be
inappropriate behavior, he makes sense given E.T.'s point of view.]

He then presses another button on the remote, and the image of a flying
plane appears on the screen. A spaceship next appears, and pulls the plane
up towards it.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

The teacher carries a jar of cotton balls soaked in chloroform, which he
drops into the jars containing frogs. He tells the children to immediately
put the lids on the jars. After telling the children that this won't hurt
the frogs, he places a cotton ball into the last two jars, one of which
belongs to Elliott. Elliott doesn't place the cover on his jar, but instead
sadly watches as the frog tries to escape. Slowly he places to lid on it,
as he gazes at the frog.

"Say hi. Can you talk? Can you talk? Can you say hi?" says Elliott.

[Elliott is making an emotional identification of the frog with E.T. by
attempting the same process of communication. The situation also creates
expectations in the audience that similar things will happen to E.T. once
he is captured.]

CLOSEUP: FROG'S FACE

CLOSEUP: E.T.'S FACE

[A cinematic technique which reinforces the identification of the frog with
E.T. This sets up the audience for E.T.'s operation. They expect the frog
to die, and they project these expectations to E.T. later in the story.]

INTERCUT: LIVING ROOM

E.T. has a hangover as he hiccups and puts his hand on his head. He then
picks up the cartoon section of a newspaper. One cartoon strip has a
picture of a communication device with a caption stating "HELP, HELP."

On the TV monitor a woman is talking long distance n her telephone to her
Uncle Ralph in California. E.T. hears the sounds coming from the TV, then
turns to look at the monitor, where he sees a man talking into a phone in
his hand. The camera pans to a phone near E.T. A child in the TV program
picks up the phone, says hello to his uncle, then hangs up.

[This generates laughter because it's inappropriate behavior to just say
hello, then hang up.]

E.T. looks closer at the Buck Rogers cartoon. One cell has an image of a
man in a spacesuit setting up a transmitter. The next cell has him saying
"It works" as the communication device transmits "help, help!" E.T. lifts
up his head from the newspaper.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

"Save him" shouts Elliott. Elliott picks up his jar, unscrews the top, then
lets out his frog, screaming "Run for your life. Back to the forest! Run!"

[Another merging of E.T. and Elliott's feelings and thoughts. E.T.
presumably had the feeling of wanting to be saved by his friends, and this
feeling prompted Elliott to cry out.]

He next opens the jar of the girl besides him. Elliott struggles with one
student, then proceeds to turn over many of the other jars as he frees the
frogs. Some of the other children also free their frogs.

INTERCUT: LIVINGROOM

E.T. studies the electronic circuitry of the language game. Suddenly John
Wayne comes on the screen. E.T. is fascinated with his image. It's a scene
from the movie "QUIET MAN." Maureen O'Sullivan huddles in a corner of the
room.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

A pile of frogs gather at the feet of a terrified little girl with blonde
braids. Elliott, drunk, staggers by her.

INTERCUT: LIVINGROOM

E.T. continues to watch the TV monitor as the woman in the movie screams.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

A blonde girl who has a crush on Elliott screams when a frog is placed on
her shoes.

INTERCUT: LIVINGROOM

The woman in the movie runs out the door. John Wayne grabs hold of her arm.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

Elliott grabs hold of the blonde girl as she runs out the door.

INTERCUT: LIVINGROOM

John Wayne pulls the woman back.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

Elliott pulls the blonde girl back.

INTERCUT: LIVINGROOM

John Wayne takes the woman into his arms.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

Elliott takes the blonde girl into his arms.

INTERCUT: LIVINGROOM

John Wayne kisses the woman.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

Elliott, too short to kiss her, stands on the back of a student who was
crawling on the floor after a frog. Elliott kisses the girl.

INTERCUT: LIVINGROOM

E.T., filled with fascination, watches the TV monitor.

INTERCUT: SCHOOL

The children's hands poke through the windows and free the frogs by
throwing them out onto the grass.

[Elliott was able to accomplish his objective of freeing the frogs. This
sequence was structured to run in parallel in order to emphasize the
merging of Elliott and E.T.]

INT: LIVING ROOM: DAY

A blanket containing aluminum foil, electrical toys and appliances is
pulled across the floor.Mary opens the door and yells hello. Harvey runs to
the front door. E.T walks out from behind the TV and kicks beer cans across
the floor.

[The alien quickly learns the appropriate behavior for drinking at home.]

Mary, with her arms filled with grocery bags and clothes from the cleaners,
walks into the kitchen. She is followed by Gertie, who sees E.T standing
near the refrigerator. Mary opens the refrigerator door, and knocks E.T. in
the head. He falls backwards onto the floor. Gertie helps E.T. up off the
floor. He walks past Mary as he goes back to the refrigerator. Mary still
doesn't see him.

[This increases the audience's tension. They are expecting E.T. to be
discovered by Mary, and they are expecting her to scream.]

Gertie keeps telling her that she wants Mary to meet somebody, but Mary
ignores her as she talks about how much the price of food has gone up in
one week. E.T. grabs a can of coffee from the kitchen table, then again
walks past Mary as she goes in the opposite direction. He goes back into
the TV room.

[The laughter's produced by Mary's failure to see the reality of the alien
who's right under her nose.]

Gertie is watching a language teaching program for children on the TV. The
program is teaching words that begin with the letter "B". The phone rings
as Mary accidentally kicks a can of beer across the floor. She answers the
phone with the beer can in her hand. The person on the phone tells Mary
that Elliott is intoxicated.

Gertie, watching the TV monitor, responds to the program by practicing the
"B" words. E.T. pokes his head up from behind the monitor and says
"BBBBBBB." Gertie stares at him as he repeats the "B" sound, then lowers
his head back down below the TV.

"You said 'B'," says Gertie. "B," repeats E.T. "You said 'B,' good," says
Gertie. "B...GOOD," repeats E.T.

[This is a set up for the closing communication between E.T. and Gertie
before he flies away in the spacecraft. This is also the first moment that
he spoke an English word. Many children and parents in the audience can
identify with this moment, and the first moral precept usually taught to a
child: be good.]

Mary hangs up the phone and tells Gertie that she has to pick up Elliott.
She asks Gertie to be a good girl. "Mommy, he can talk," says Gertie. "Of
course he can talk," says Mary, referring to the TV program.

[The humor is generated from Mary's misunderstanding of Gertie's
statement.]

As Mary leaves, E.T. walks out from behind the TV. He walks to a phone and
stares. "Phone," says Mary. "Phone," says E.T. E.T. presses the numbers of
the phone. "You want to call somebody?" asks Gertie.

[This establishes E.T.'s objective: to communicate with his fellow
creatures so that he can return home.]

INT: HOUSE: DAY

Elliott walks up the stairs to his room. Mary's voice can be heard from
below saying she refuses to pay for frogs.

[This is a fine example of the point of attack for a scene: Instead of
showing what would happen in real life (Mary's discussions with the teacher
about Elliott's behavior in the classroom), the scene picks up with what is
important for the audience: Elliott's discovery that E.T. can now talk. A
scene showing Mary in school would be redundant and dramatically
irrelevant.]

Elliott is walking towards his room when he hears Gertie talking to E.T. in
her room. He drops his bags on the floor, and quickly enters her room.

"Be good, be good," says Gertie as she closes the doors to her closet.
Elliott pushes Gertie away from the closet and opens it. Inside is E.T.
dressed up in girl clothes with a blonde wig on his head. He has a rabbit
fur around his neck and wears a black hat with flowers.

[This is completely inappropriate attire for an alien, whether male or
female. The visual incongruity of E.T. in girl's clothes generates the
laughter.]

"Oh God!" says Elliott. "Elliott," says E.T. "What?" says Elliott, not yet
realizing that it was E.T. who spoke. "Elliott, Elliott," repeats E.T. "I
taught him how to talk. He can talk now," says Gertie.

[Elliott, with the help of Gertie and the TV program, has completed one of
Elliott's objectives: communicating with E.T.]

Gertie points out the things that E.T. has brought upstairs: electrical
toys and the plant. She wonders what he needs this for. E.T. holds the
cartoon page of the newspaper out to Elliott. "E.T., can you say that? Can
you say E.T.?" asks Elliott. "E.T.," repeats E.T. Elliott laughs with joy.
E.T keeps repeating his name as he turns and walks through the closet into
Elliott's room.

"E.T., be good," says E.T. "Be good," I taught him that too," says Gertie.

["Be good" is a fundamental value taught children, as basic as the
principle "There's no place like home," taught in the WIZARD OF OZ.]

"You should give him his dignity. This is the most ridiculous thing I've
ever seen," says Elliott.

E.T. hands Elliott the newspaper, and points to the Buck Rodgers comic
strip. He then says "PHONE". Elliott is amazed at this. E.T. walks into the
closet and says "HOME." Elliott confirms that this is E.T.'s home. E.T.
then turns, walks to the window, points to the sky, and says "E.T. HOME
PHONE."

"E.T. PHONE HOME" says Gertie. "E.T. PHONE HOME" says Elliott.

"He wants to call somebody," says Gertie.

[This reconfirms E.T.'s objective.]

Mike walks into the room and laughs at E.T.'s attire.

"E.T. Phone Home," says E.T.

"Oh my God, he's talking now," says Mike.

E.T. once again points out the window and repeats that he wants to call
home.
"And they'll come?, says Elliott.
"Come?" responds E.T. "Home, home" he repeats.

EXT: STREET: NIGHT

A truck drives down the street. Inside a man with earphones listens to the
conversations in the neighborhood homes, as he fine tunes his electronic
eavesdropping equipment. He focuses in on Elliott's voice.

[Jeopardy: the forces of the antagonist are getting closer and closer. They
are now inside the privacy of the protagonist's home, listening to their
most intimate conversations.]

INT: GARAGE: NIGHT

Elliott, Mike and Harvey are in the garage searching for objects that E.T.
could use in building his communications device. Elliott restates that he
has "absolute power" and that E.T. belongs to him.

[Elliott's objective is to possess E.T., not set him free. Freeing the one
he loves is the lesson he will have to learn in this story.]

EXT: STREET: NIGHT

The van containing electronic eavesdropping equipment drives past Elliott's
house.

[They are still in jeopardy: their actions and words are being monitored.]

INT: GARAGE: DAY

Mike tells Elliott that E.T. doesn't look too good anymore.
"Don't say that, we're fine!" says Elliott.
"What's all this we stuff. You say we all the time now. Look Elliott,
I think he might be getting sick," replies Michael.

[This confirms Elliott's belief that he considers himself and E.T. to be
one being. It also introduces further jeopardy for E.T. Besides being
tracked by the antagonist, he is also becoming sick.]

INT: VAN: NIGHT

The man with the earphones is listening to Elliott and Michael's
conversation as they discuss E.T.'s sickness.

INT: GARAGE: DAY

Mike tells Elliott to grab the fuzzbuster. Elliott pulls his father's blue
shirt out from the shelf. They reminisce about the days when he used to
take them to baseball games and the movies, where they would have baseball
fights. Mike says that they'll do that again, but Elliott doesn't really
believe him. They each smell their father's shirt.
"Old Spice," says Mike.
"Sea Breeze," says Elliott.

[Here a prop (their father's shirt) is used to reveal the emotional
relationships between the two boys and their father. Audience empathy is
generated for them because they have been abandoned by their father. The
audience's anger is transferred from the father to the antagonist who is
eavesdropping on this private intimate moment.]

INT: VAN: NIGHT

The man in the van continues to listen to Elliott and Michael's
conversation. Only the listener's eye is clearly visible.

[This is a cinematic technique to signify the "ever-watching eye" of the
faceless antagonist.]

INT: GERTIE'S ROOM: NIGHT

Mary lies in bed next to Gertie as she reads her the Peter Pan story. Mary
reads that Peter has defeated the Indians, but Wendy and the boys have been
captured by the pirates. He vows to rescue her. E.T. watches them from the
closet.

[Here the notion of "a rescue" is introduced, and visually associated with
E.T. as he watches them from the closet. This is an emotional set up for
the audience, so that they will later be supportive of Elliott and the
boy's efforts to rescue E.T.]

Mary reads the section of the Peter Pan story where Tinker Bell becomes
poisoned. Elliott comes into the closet, stands next to E.T., then closes
the door behind them.

"Tinkerbell swallows the draft as Peter's hand reaches for it," reads Mary.
"Why T, you have drunk my medicine."

Elliott pulls E.T. away from the door, then shifts through a box of items
that he brought up from the garage. He cuts his finger on the blade of a
power saw, then says "OUCH," as he holds his bleeding finger up into the
air. E.T. points his own finger towards Elliott. E.T.'s finger glows like a
laser light as he says "ouch." He then presses this lit finger on Elliott's
cut and heals it.

[This establishes the fundamental goodness and healing power of E.T.]

E.T. opens the slit in the closet door and continues to watch Mary read to
Gertie the part where Tinker Bell is dying.

"She says she thinks she can get well again if children believe in fairies.
Do you believe in fairies? Say quick that you believe."
"I DO! I DO! I DO!" says Gertie.
"If you believe, clap your hands."
Both Gertie and Mary clap their hands. Elliott places a blanket around
E.T.'s shoulders and a scarf around his neck, as they listen to the rest of
the story.
"Thank you, thank you. And now to rescue Wendy," reads Mary. Elliott places
his arm around E.T.

[The Peter Pan story is used to set up the audience's emotional reactions
to a fairy tale concerning near death and rescue. This emotional empathy
will then be transferred to E.T., another "fairy-like creature" when he
becomes sick and is rescued. Just as the audience felt like clapping for
Tinker Bell, they will applaud the children's efforts to save E.T.]

EXT: HOUSE: NIGHT

Exhaust flows from the tailpipe of a van. This is the same type of
poisonous exhaust image that the audience saw when vans drove into the
forest at the beginning of the movie.

[Jeopardy: the forces of the antagonist are still nearby.]

INT: BEDROOM: NIGHT

Elliott, dressed in white long-johns, sits on his bunkbed as he watches
E.T. Michael stands next to him. Elliott comments that E.T. is putting
together his instrument, while Mike fears that it might blow up the house.
He also comments on the irregularity of E.T.'s breathing.

[More jeopardy, both in Mike's fears of his family and home being
destroyed, and in E.T.'s illness becoming progressively worse.]

E.T places his communication device over the Buck Rodgers comic strip.

[This movement establishes a mental association between the device and the
spaceman's communication efforts in the comic strip.]

Petals drop off the flower in the pot.

[This represents E.T.'s failing health.]

E.T. lifts up his head (which indicates he's using his telekinetic powers),
then lifts part of his communication device into the air. He next lifts up
the umbrella and opens it. Both objects float in the air in front of him.

[E.T's primary objective is to go home. To accomplish this he must create a
communication device. This is his sub-objective, which appears to be
completed. He next must activate this device from the landing site and call
home. The obstacles he has to overcome are Mary, the community, and the
distance to the forest. These obstacles will be confronted in the next
scenes.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM: DAY

Preparing for Halloween, Elliott paints his lips with makeup. He talks to
Gertie about her going out that night as a ghost. They review the evening
plans. She will meet them at the lookout.

[This is an example of incomplete exposition which engages the audience.
They only talk about part of the plan: the meeting at the lookout. They
don't discuss anymore details, such as deceiving Mary into thinking that
Gertie is with them instead of E.T. The partial information forces the
audience to stay involved with the action and to create their own
conjectures about what will happen.]

INT: CLOSET: DAY

Mike helps Elliot put on his knapsack. Elliott then places a sheet over
E.T.

INT: STAIRCASE: DAY

E.T., covered with a sheet and clown shoes, walks down the staircase. The
clown shoes cover his three-toed feet.

INT: HOUSE: DAY

Mary walks through the house dressed in a tight fitting leopard skin dress
with facial makeup that makes her look like a cat. Mike tells his mother to
wait and not peek, as he and Elliott lead E.T. into the room. Finally, Mary
turns and shrieks with glee. She runs to get a camera.

[The tension in the situation is caused by their fear that E.T. will be
discovered by Mary. Mike and Elliott's objective is to get him out of the
house undiscovered.]

E.T. looks through holes cut out for his eyes and sees Michael with a fake
butcher knife through his head. He lights up his finger in an attempt to
heal Mike's wound. Mike grab's E.T.'s hand and puts it back under the
sheet. "Ouch, ouch" says E.T, as he tries once again to heal Mike. "It's a
fake knife, it's fake," says Mike.

[Laughter is generated because while E.T.'s behavior would be appropriate
if Mike was really wounded, it is inappropriate in this situation since the
knife is fake.]

Mary comes back with a camera and prepares to photograph them.

"You look great," says Mary.
"Thank you," says Mike.
"Thank you," says Elliott.
"Thank you," says E.T.
Mary doesn't notice that E.T. has spoken.

[Laughter is generated by the "rule of three" humor structure and Mary's
ignorance.]

When Mary takes the photo, the flash shocks E.T. and knocks him onto the
floor. Mike and Elliott quickly pull him up before Mary notices and lead
him out of the house.

[They succeed in their objective with the help of their "not so smart"
mother.]

EXT: STREET: DAY

Mary walks down the driveway as she orders them to be home no later than
one-hour after sundown. E.T., dressed in the sheet, turns and looks at
Mary, then continues down the driveway with Mike and Elliott.

[This creates a "timelock", a sense of urgency, and the expectation of an
upset mother if they haven't returned by the assigned time.]

EXT: COMMUNITY: DAY

Establishing shot of the neighborhood. On a hilltop by a fence stands
another person in a white sheet (presumably Gertie). She kicks dirt at the
bicycle near the fence.

[This is the end objective of Mike, Elliot and E.T.: to connect up with
Gertie at the lookout. Their obstacle is to get E.T past all the children
on the streets.]

EXT: STREET: DAY

The sun is setting. Children in Halloween costumes walk through the
streets. E.T. walks between Mike and Elliott, as he watches the other
children parade by. One child dressed as YODA from RETURN OF THE JEDI walks
by. E.T. turns and walks after him saying "HOME,HOME."

[The laughter is obviously the result of E.T. misinterpreting the situation
by believing that the child is another alien.]

They walk towards the setting sun as Mike reminds Elliott that he must be
back by one hour after sunset. Elliott promises to try, but he wants Mike
to cover for him.

[This creates jeopardy for the characters, because if they don't complete
their mission within the time frame, they will have trouble with Mary.]

EXT: HILLTOP: DAY

The sun is setting as Mike, Elliott, and two small characters covered with
sheets stand on the hilltop overlooking the city. Elliott asks Mike to help
him lift E.T. onto the bike. Mike does and then tells Elliott that they
will be waiting for him.

[They have reached this objective. The next objective for Elliott and E.T
is to get to the landing site in the forest.]

EXT: FOREST: DAY

Elliott, with E.T sitting in the front basket, rides his bicycle through
the forest. The road becomes very bumpy. Elliott tells E.T. that they will
have to walk from there. Suddenly, E.T. takes control of the bike through
the use of his telekinetic powers and speeds it forward. Eliott becomes
frightened as E.T. speeds the bike towards a cliff and then drives it over
the edge. E.T. then makes the bike up through the air.

[The audience gulps from suspense and then goes into elation by this
surprising and magical turn of events.]

They continue to fly over the tree tops. Elliott yells "Not so high, not so
high."

[E.T and Elliott both have white hoods over their heads, which further
visually reinforces their identification.]

They ride across the front of the moon, the guiding light of magic. Elliott
laughs with glee. When they start their descent he begs E.T. not to crash.
They hit the ground. The bike turns over, and both E.T. and Elliott are
thrown to the ground.

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: NIGHT

The grandfather clock indicates 9:45. Mary watches the clock as she sits in
front of lighted candles. The time has long passed when Elliott was
supposed to be home. The lighted candles give a church like effect as if
Mary was praying for the safety of her children. She is upset that they
haven't returned. She blows out the candles, then taps out another candle
with her wand.

[There is jeopardy for the children as Mary and the audience wonder if they
are okay. Empathy is generated for Mary who is truly concerned for the
safety of her children.]

EXT: FOREST: NIGHT

The sun has set. It's nighttime in the forest. E.T opens a box which
contains the saw blade brought to him by Elliott. Elliott ties a rope up to
a tree branch. He then opens the umbrella which is lined with aluminum foil
and points it towards the star-filled sky. It will function as a
transmitter. E.T. places a coat hanger with nails above the saw blade,
plugs a cable into a battery, then activates the toy language teaching
device.

[They succeeded in completing their objective to reach the landing site.
Their new objective is to communicate with E.T.'s fellow aliens in order to
accomplish E.T.'s primary objective, which is to return home.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: NIGHT

Mary, still dressed in her leopard outfit, leaves the house. She is very
upset that her children have not yet returned home. She mumbles to herself,
sticks the wand in her mouth, and shakes the car keys. She gets into the
car and mumbles that their father is going to hear about this one.
"Mexico!" she says. She drives down the driveway and into the street to
search for her children.

[This creates more empathy for Mary, who is very upset that her small
children are out this late. The parents in the audience can easily identify
with her. But the real function of this scene is to get her out of the
house so that the antagonist can invade their home. She could have stayed
inside, we never see her in the car searching for the children, and the
next time we do see her is by the refrigerator in the kitchen.]

Men get out of a parked car as Mary drives away. They take suitcases out of
a second car, then walk up the driveway to Elliott's house.

EXT: FOREST: NIGHT

Elliott watches the treetops sway. He scratches his face, as does E.T.
Together they stare at the stars. The wind causes the branch to sway, which
then pulls the rope, which, in turn, pulls a fork across the saw blade.
This drags the nails in the hanger across the flat surface of the blade,
and sends signals out into space. Elliott is overjoyed and shouts that it
works, while E.T. repeats the word "Home." Together they gaze up to the
stars.

[They have accomplished their objective of sending a message into space.
Now, they wait to receive a signal back.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: NIGHT

The light from a flashlight crosses in front of a pumpkin's face. More
light floods through the slits of Gertie's door. A hand holding a
flashlight opens Gertie's door, and shines the light into the face of a
black doll.

[This has an irritating and frightening effect on anyone in the audience
who has ever had the experience of having a light shined into their face.]

Light from the flashlight searches around Gertie's room.

INT: HALLWAY: NIGHT

A pile of yellow electrical cord is stacked on the floor near a chair. It
slowly unwinds as it is pulled by someone in Elliott's room. The door to
Elliott's room is shut, with a poster sign hanging on it saying "DO NOT
ENTER." The silhouette of a man passes behind the door, as sounds of a
Geiger counter filter into the air. Muffled voices are heard as the cord is
pulled to its fullest extent. It forces a chair to slam against the wall.

[This last action has a jarring effect on the audience. Emotionally, the
audience is outraged at the invasion of the children's rooms, and this
creates hatred for the antagonist and his cohorts. They are still faceless
so the audience can project the face of the persons they most hate onto
these characters. This personalizes the story for them and gets them more
intensely involved on an emotional basis. They also become intellectually
involved, because the sounds of the Geiger counter and the extension of the
cord to its maximum length forces them to infer that the antagonist has
found E.T.'s "home" in the closet. This involves the audience in the story
much more than if the filmmaker had shown the antagonist poking around in
the closet.]

EXT: FOREST: NIGHT

"We have to go now E.T. It's so late already," Elliott says as both he and
E.T. sadly gaze into the sky.

[Their objective of receiving a return signal has not been achieved. Their
sadness at failure creates empathy for them in the audience.]

Elliott coughs from being out in the cold, damp air.

[This is a setup for the later scenes when both Elliott and E.T. are
deathly ill.]

Elliott repeats that they really have to go home, but E.T. ignores him and
has a sad expression on his face as he stares up to the sky. Elliott tells
them that he has to give them some time. E.T. responds by saying "ouch,"
signifying that he feels pain. A small fawn watches them from a distance.

[The jeopardy in the scene is due to their being so late. Mary will be very
angry and they face the obstacle of getting E.T. back into the house
without being discovered. The fawn generates feelings of sympathy in the
audience which is transferred to E.T. The audience also empathizes with the
sadness they feel at failing to make contact. For now, supposedly, E.T.
won't be able to go home.]

"You could be happy here. I could take care of you," says Elliott
tearfully. I wouldn't let anybody hurt you. We could grow up together,
E.T."

[Elliott states his primary objective: to always have E.T. with him.]

"Home, Home," says E.T.

[E.T. states his primary objective: to go home.]

Elliott sits down and cries. E.T. touches one of his tears.

[The audience empathizes with the sadness of both characters.]

EXT: FOREST: NIGHT

It's morning. Elliott is asleep as he leans against a large rock. He is
covered with a blanket as the wet forest mist surrounds him. Next to him
lies E.T.'s communication device.

Elliott coughs, gets up, tugs on the rope which activates the device, then
looks around for E.T. but can't find him.

[The new objective: where is E.T. and what has happened to him? This is
also the new question that will maintain the audience's interest.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY

Mary opens the refrigerator door and puts back a carton of milk. Mike and
Gertie sit besides her. A policeman asks Mary how Elliott was dressed when
she last saw him. Mary tells him that he was dressed as a hunchback. The
policeman, whose face is not shown (I suppose so that the audience will
associate him as "one of them"), asks Mary if there is any indication that
he might have run away? Were there any family problems or recent arguments?
Mary explains that she and her husband had just separated and that this has
not been easy on the kids.

"My father is in Mexico," says Gertie.

[This scene generates empathy for the whole family.]

Mary slams the refrigerator door shut, thereby revealing Elliott standing
behind it. White light floods onto him making him look ghastly. Mary hugs
him as Mike and Gertie join them.

[The audience is relieved and overjoyed with Elliott's safe return.]

"Oh Elliott," she says as she hugs him. "Don't ever do this again, Elliott.
You're so hot."

Elliott is feverish from spending the night outside. Mary tells Gertie to
go upstairs and draw him a bath. Mary walks over to the policeman (whose
face is still unseen) and thanks him for his concern.

Elliott asks Mike if E.T. is in the house. Mike shakes his head, indicating
no. Elliot pleads with Mike to find him. He's somewhere in the forest near
the bald spot.

[This is the new objective: find E.T. and bring him back.]

EXT: STREET: DAY

Mike rides the bicycle with the basket in front down the driveway and into
the street, past a car filled with waiting men. The car starts and follows
Mike. He looks behind and realizes that he is being pursued.

[This is a standard chase scene, with a friend who is trying to save the
life of the protagonist being pursued. Both he and the protagonist are in
jeopardy. Mike's new sub-objective is to lose those who are following him.]

Mike cuts through a backyard and into an alley behind some houses. The car
follows him. Mike then rides up an embankment and drives off in the
opposite direction, leaving the car stranded behind.

[He successfully accomplished his subobjective.]

EXT: FOREST: DAY

Mike rides through the forest as he calls out E.T.'s name. He stops and
searches for E.T. Mike finds the abandoned communication device, then runs
up a path and discovers E.T.'s white sheet hanging from the open gate.

[The blue-orange colors of E.T.'s communication device are the same colors
that Spielberg chose the logo of his production company, AMBLIN
ENTERTAINMENT.]

[This is the same gate near the landing site that the characters ran past
in the opening sequence.]

In another part of the forest, Mike rides his bike on a ridge above a
stream. E.T lies in the water below, is skin discolored to that of sickly
white. Mike sees him, grabs the sheet, then runs down the embankment. A
raccoon wanders near E.T. Mike shouts him away, then covers E.T. Mike hears
the sounds of a helicopter above him and looks up at the sky.

[Mike has achieved his objective: he has found E.T. But, danger hovers
above him in the unseen presence of the ever observing antagonist.]

EXT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY

The shadow of a man falls on the driveway. The sound of keys jangling is
heard.

[High jeopardy: the antagonist is about to invade the home of the
protagonist.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY

Mike is in the hallway as Mary walks up the stairs. She has a cup of coffee
in her hand.

[The cup is a prop which will be used to reveal Mary's emotions.]

He wants her to come with him. He asks her if she remembers the goblin. He
tries to get her to make a promise, but she is annoyed with him.

INT: BATHROOM: DAY

Michael then opens the door to the bathroom. Elliott is sitting on the
floor as Gertie sits on the counter. They are both looking into the
bathtub. Mary smiles as she walks into the bathroom with the cup of coffee
in her hand. Then she sees E.T. on the floor. He is a sickly white. He
extends his arms out towards her. Mary is stunned, as she turns the cup
over and coffee pours out onto the floor.

[Here a character's non-verbal action with a prop reveals her true
emotional state. She has lost it.]

"He's sick. I think we're dying," says Elliott. Mary covers her mouth. Mike
tries to tell her that E.T. won't harm them, but she orders him to take
Gertie downstairs. Gertie cries that he's the man from the moon as Mike
picks her up and carries her downstairs.

[Elliott, clothed only in white long-john underwear, is visually almost
identical to the ghastly white-colored E.T.]

Mary picks up Elliott and carries him out of the room as E.T. groans and
reaches out for them.

[Mary's objective is to save her family from the alien in her home.]

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY

Mary carries Elliott down the stairs. He protests that she can't leave E.T.
alone. Michael runs down the stairs with Gertie on his back. He opens the
door, freezes, then backs away. Mary, with Elliott in her arms, approaches
the door and is confronted by a man in a spacesuit.

Mary backs into the living room as the spaceman enters and reaches out for
her. She goes in the opposite direction, only to run into another man in a
spacesuit. She runs into the kitchen, followed by Mike carrying Gertie. The
are blocked by still another spaceman with outstretched arms. Mary and her
children are backed into a corner. Another man in a spacesuit opens up the
window blinds from the outside. Mary shouts "THIS IS MY HOME."

EXT: STREET: DAY

Dawn. The sun rises as a line of men wearing helmets and uniforms march up
the street.

INT: BATHROOM: DAY

E.T., his skin discolored to a grey-white hue, lies on the floor as a man
in a space suit enters the room. "Home," says E.T.

[This is the end of act two. The antagonist and his forces have invaded the
home of the protagonist and taken them into possession. This terrifying
invasion of the privacy of their home generates more empathy for Mary and
her children.]

EXT: STREET: DAY

Men in helmets walk up a street as they push a large plastic tunnel. Police
cars slowly drive up the street, as faceless men march to a drumbeat.

[This is the beginning of the third act with the forces of the antagonist
in complete control.]

EXT: STREET: NIGHT

Men with welding torches work on a truck. The plastic tunnel leads up the
driveway to Elliott's house. The faces of the men are still not shown. They
are either wearing helmets or are silhouettes.

CLOSEUP

The man with keys jangling on his side is putting on a pair of light-blue
pants.

INTERCUT: STREET

Men are working outside. Large bright lights flood the area.

INTERCUT: "KEYS"

The man in the blue suit puts on a white pair of plastic gloves. Red and
black colors on his cuff are associated with his keys as ominous music
fills the soundtrack.

[This is the only instance in this film where the traditional colors of the
antagonist (red and black) are associated with the antagonist ("keys").
Putting on a light-blue outfit starts the transformation of the antagonist
into a character worthy of audience empathy, for blue-white is the
traditional production design colors signifying "innocence."]

The man in the light-blue suit gets up walks through the plastic tunnel
towards Elliott's house. He exits the tunnel and walks into the house which
has been completely enclosed by plastic.

Finally, the antagonist's face is shown. His head is covered by a blue hood
while a light under his face mask accentuates his white shirt.

Mary stands in the middle of the room with Gertie at her side. A doctor
asks her questions about E.T., but Mary is more concerned with Elliott's
state. A nurse cuts a lock from Gertie's hair (presumably for analysis),
while both Elliott and E.T. can be seen on a video monitor. This nurse
walks to Mike and cuts a piece of his hair while a doctor asks him
questions about E.T. A video monitor shows Elliott and E.T. "Elliott thinks
his thoughts," asks the doctor. "No, Elliott feels his feelings," answers
Michael.

[This is the first time in the film that the merging of Elliott and E.T.
has been explicitly stated. Yet, this condition has been revealed to the
audience non-verbally throughout the story. The verbalization seems
redundant and not necessary, but does make sense as an explanatory comment
to a character new to the story.]

INT: CHAMBER: DAY

A man stands in what appears to be a decontamination chamber.

INTERCUT: MEDICAL INSTRUMENTS

Hands push buttons on electronic equipment used to gather medical
information about Elliott and E.T. Graphs representing E.T. and Elliott run
in exact parallel.

[This is another representation of the fact that E.T. and Elliott have
merged and are to be considered as one being.]

INT: MEDICAL ROOM: DAY

Two people in white suits zip open a plastic covering and enter the room
where Elliot and E.T. are being examined.

[The color white traditionally signifying purity. A transition in the
audience's emotional alliances is being manipulated at this stage of the
story. Their hatred will be transferred from "keys" who will become much
more sympathetic to "death itself" which threatens the life of E.T. It
would be too much to ask of the adult audience to remain sympathetic to the
emotional pleadings of a child when space scientists are trying to save the
life of a sick alien.]

"You're scaring him," cries Elliott, as the doctors examine both Elliott
and E.T. as they lie on adjacent tables. E.T's head rests on a blue piece
of cloth.

"Leave him alone, leave him alone. I can take care of him," moans Elliott.

[Which, of course, he can't. But this is something that both he, and
probably most of the children in the audience, really believe.]

Elliott looks up into the face of "Keys," who says that he's been to the
forest. He wants to know what the machine does. Elliott says that it's a
communication machine, and asks if it's still working. He then states that
"He came to me. He came to me." "Keys" explains that he's been wishing for
this too, ever since he was ten years old. He doesn't want the alien to
die. He asks what more can they do that they are not already doing.

Elliott's image reflects in "Keys" face gear. Elliott tells him that E.T.
was calling his people because he needs to go home.

["Keys" is no longer the threat. He has been transformed into a friend who
also wants to help the alien. A new antagonist must now be created in order
to maintain conflict in the story. In this scene DEATH will serve that
function. For the rest of the film the forces of the United States
Government, who attempt to block E.T.'s escape, will function as the
antagonist.]

Another Doctor dressed in white enters the room and announces that E.T. has
DNA. Suddenly, a display screen shows a drop in E.T. and Elliott's graphs.
One doctor says there's a drop in the creature's blood temperature, while
another states that Elliott's condition is stabilizing: his blood pressure
is coming back up.

E.T. calls Elliott's name, and the medical personnel become aware that he
can talk. Elliott pleads with him to stay. E.T. repeats the words "stay,
stay," then slowly turns his head away.

Their graphs separate. One doctor announces that the boy is coming back,
but they are losing E.T.

INT: CLOSET: NIGHT

Michael enters the closet space where E.T. stayed. He looks at the objects,
including the cartoon page from the newspaper, then huddles down among
E.T.'s possessions.

[These actions create more empathy for Michael who suffers at the thought
of losing E.T.]

The is a time transition, for Michael is asleep in E.T.'s space when the
morning sun shines on his face. Michael wakes up, then watches the plant
(which represents E.T.'s life force) wilt. He screams.

INT: MEDICAL ROOM: DAY

"E.T., don't go" screams Elliott.

Doctors state that he has no blood pressure and there is no pulse or
respiration. A bell rings, which signifies a life and death situation.
Doctors run into the room and tear down the plastic coverings surrounding
E.T.

"Leave him alone. You're killing him," says Elliott. They wheel Elliott out
of the room as he continues to scream. The medical staff frantically tries
to revive E.T. They try electrical shocks, but that fails. Gertie holds her
doll as she watches. She reacts by jumping when the electrical shocks are
applied to E.T.

[Showing one character's reactions to a situation help to create the
intended reaction in the audience.]

The doctors are losing him. Elliott watches and cries. Mary goes to him and
they hug each other. Gertie cries as she holds her doll. Mike walks into
the room, as "Keys" watches, then turns away.

[This provides the audience with each character's reaction to the death of
E.T. This is a surprising event for the audience: the protagonist has died.
Emotionally, it was designed to sadden the audience so that they will
become overjoyed when he is brought back to life.]

EXT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY

A white van awaits at the bottom of the driveway.

[Previously, the vans and cars associated with the antagonist were of dark
colors. The color changes allows the filmmaker to use culturally determined
color associations to manipulate the audience's emotional responses.]

Police and other officials walk past a white van, white truck, police cars
and other white vehicles towards a tan colored car. Mike's friends sit on
their bikes behind police barriers. They make comments that something has
just happened inside the house.

[This establishes the existence of Mike's friends who will play a crucial
role in the last chase scene.]

INT: MEDICAL ROOM: DAY

The medical staff gives up on E.T. and decide to pack him in ice. Mike
watches as the staff of E.T. slowly walks away. "Keys" removes his headgear
and walks to Elliott who is standing vigil over E.T.'s body. "Keys" then
approaches E.T. Mike watches and cries as a man behind him removes his
headgear. The faces of several medical attendants are shown.

[This humanizes the forces of the antagonist and makes them much less
threatening. That's why they had to be faceless for so long throughout the
story.]

"Keys" kneels besides E.T. and with gloved hand closes his eyes. Mary holds
Gertie. When Gerite asks if he's dead, Mary replies that she thinks so.
Gertie then says she wishes him back.

[The interchange between Gertie and Mary reminds the audience of the Tinker
Bell situation when Mary read to her from Peter Pan. Those same feelings
are reintroduced here: the clapping of hands to save the fairy and then the
desire to rescue the children. This is the payoff to the emotional
reactions set up in that earlier scene.]

"Keys" looks up to see two attendants roll in a metal casing filled with
ice into which they will place E.T.'s body.

Mary picks up Gertie and carries her out of the room. Medical technicians
prepare the casing as Elliott watches. Keys approaches Elliot and tells him
that they will be taking E.T. away. "They are just going to cut him all
up," replies Elliott.

[This is the payoff to the frog sequence. The audience believes that
Elliott is correct, given the scientific mind as demonstrated by the
teacher. They also now remember the joy they felt when Elliott freed the
frogs, and wish they could experience that again now.]

"Do you want to spend some time alone with him?" asks "Keys," as he puts
his arm around Elliott and walks him to the casing. He tells the medical
attendants to leave the room.

[This generates empathy for "Keys" who is shown to be concerned for
Elliott's feelings.]

The attendants walk out of the room past Michael who is watching Elliott.
"Keys" leaves Elliott alone with the body of E.T., which is covered in a
plastic bag as it lies on dry ice. Elliott stares down at E.T.

"Look at what they've done to you. I'm so sorry. You must be dead. I... I
didn't know how to feel. I can't feel anything anymore. You've gone
someplace else now. E.T., I love you."

[Elliott wears a partially open white-jacket. He is framed within an oval
shaped glass.]

Elliott places the cover down over E.T. and walks away from the oval glass.
A red-light flashes from inside the casing, but Elliott doesn't notice this
as he walks away. He passes the pot of wilted flowers. The flowers slowly
start to regain strength. Elliott notices this, then quickly returns the
casing.

[This is the payoff for the pot-of-wilted-flowers prop.]

He opens the casing, sees the red-light flashing from E.T.'s heart, then
zips open the plastic bag. The alien looks up and says "E.T. phone home."
Elliott screams with joy.
"Home, home, home, home," says E.T.
"Does this mean they are coming?" asks Elliott.
"Yes," answers E.T.

[E.T. has finally succeeded in his objective of communicating home.]

Elliott tells him to stay and shut up, as he places his hand over E.T.'s
mouth. Elliott zips him back up, then places a cloth over his flashing
red-heart, as "KEYS" re-enters the room. Elliott slams down the cover.
"KEYS" pulls Elliott away from the case as two attendants prepare for its
removal. Elliott cries out with feigned sorrow to conceal his glee when he
sees the wilted flowers regain their health. The attendants lock the case.

INT: DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER: DAY

Elliott tells Mike that E.T. is alive. Mike's also overjoyed. Mike and
Elliott rejoice as the wilted flowers continue to bloom.

INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY

Mary is talking to "KEYS" as Gertie runs up with the pot of flowers in her
hands. He asks Mary if the boys have gone because she's sup- posed to give
her a note when they have gone. Mary takes the note from Gertie and reads
it.

[This note provides the crisis to which Mary must react, yet the audience
is kept in suspense.]

EXT: PLASTIC TUNNEL: DAY

Elliott runs down the tunnel past two men dressed in blue, then enters the
back of the van. Elliott then pulls aside the white curtains that separate
the drivers compartment from the back of the van to reveal Michael in the
driver's seat. He to is wearing a blue jacket. Elliott yells at Mike for
not wearing his mask. Suddenly, a black official walks by the van, spots
Mike in the driver's seat, and knocks on the window. He holds a
walkie-talkie in his hand as he asks Mike who he is. Mike responds that
he's driving. The official tells Mike to open the door. When Mike looks to
Elliott for advice, Elliott tells him to drive away.

[Elliott and Mike's objective is to escape with E.T.]

A group of men approach the van. Mike screams that he's never driven
forward before, shifts into first gear, and drives away.

[This is the payoff to the scene of Mike incompetently backing the car down
the driveway.]

As Mike drives away he drags along the plastic tunnel with the two men
still inside. Mike briefly stops by his friends and tells them to meet him
at the playground at the top of he hill. He then drives away, pursued by a
group of men. Mike's friends put on their hats and sun- glasses, and join
the fray.

[The chase is on. Suspense is created because the audience wonders whether
they will get E.T. back to the forest before the are stopped. They face
impossible odds, yet Mike's friends display loyalty as they join the fight.
Mike and Elliott's first objective is to reach the park. Their major
obstacle is the men trying to capture them.]

Mike drives the van down the street. The two men still in the plastic
tunnel try to climb back towards the van. Elliott starts to disconnect the
tunnel by pulling out metal braces.

[Jeopardy: If these men get into the van, they will overpower Elliott and
Mike, and prevent E.T. from getting home.]

EXT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY

Mary backs her car out of the garage. Gertie is sitting next to her in the
front seat holding onto the flower pot. "Keys" runs up to Mary and asks
where she's going. Gertie blunts out "to the spaceship."

["Keys" now realizes that the aliens are returning for E.T. This is his
"crisis" information, that spurns him into action.]

EXT: STREET: DAY

The van continues down the road, still pulling the plastic tunnel behind
it. The two men have almost made it to the back of the van as Elliott pulls
out the final stake. He tosses it to one of the men. When Mike turns a
sharp corner the plastic tunnel disconnects, leaving the two men behind.

[They have overcome their immediate obstacle. Humor is generated when
Elliott tosses the nail to one of the men, because it is the reversal of a
life saving situation. Instead of catching something (like a rope) that
will save him, he catches the object that is his undoing.]

EXT: STREET: DAY

A convoy of police cars drive up a street.

[The chase is still on. Even though one obstacle has been overcome, the
antagonist brings more formidable forces into the fight. The protagonist is
still in jeopardy.]

EXT: PARK: DAY

The white van drives up over the sidewalk and into the park. It swerves
between the children's rides, then finally stops. Smoke pours out of the
van, whose back two doors are still open.

[They have reached their sub-objective: the park where they are to meet up
with Mike's friends and continue on their bikes.]

Mike's friends wait on their bikes. Between them they also have bikes for
Elliott and Mike. E.T. is revealed to the boys. He stands among the smoke
from the dry-ice with his red-heart light flashing. "Okay, he's a man from
outer space and we're taking him to his spaceship," says Elliott, now
dressed in blue pants, white shirt, and red jacket.
"Why can't he just beam up?" asks Greg.
"This is reality, Greg," says Elliott.

[Of course, the joke is that it isn't reality. It is a fantasy movie with a
realistic response to a fantastic situation. Right?]

[Elliott finally wins the respect and admiration of Mike's friends,
something he's desired from his introduction scene when they wouldn't allow
him to play DUNGEONS & DRAGONS with them.]

EXT: PARK: DAY

Mary, along with a crowd of plain clothes police, run towards the van.
"Don't shoot, they're only children," screams Mary.

[This introduces a life and death jeopardy into the scene. It also
characterizes the forces of the antagonist as characters who would shoot
children.]

They reach the back of the van only to find it empty.

EXT: STREET: DAY

Elliott and friends ride down the street. E.T., covered with a white
blanket, rides in Elliott's basket. Elliott, with the red hood over his
head, shouts that they are to ride to the forest.

[To cloth a character in red is effective in chase scenes. This helps the
audience to visually pick out the scenes important character when the pace
is fast and the action intense. Spielberg used this technique for Elliot in
this scene and for Marion in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK when she runs through
the market chased by Arabs.]

Cars chase them. Elliott rides up the alley and tells the others to follow
him. Police cars encircle them and try to cut them off. The bikers turn off
the main road and ride into a dirt field. A tan car with "UNITED STATES
GOVERNMENT" written on the driver's door rides parallel to the bikers.

Two men ride inside the tan car. One speaks into the car radio saying that
they'll get them at the bottom of the hill. The tan car pulls into the base
of the hill and stops. One man gets out and starts to climb up the
embankment. The bikers almost run him over. They ride over the hood of the
car, then continue down the street, now pursued by a blue police car.

The bikers cycle down a dirt road of a section of the community that is
still under development. E.T., with the white blanket covering his head,
sits in the basket of Elliott's bike. A blue car trails them. The bikers
decide to split up. Two ride down an embankment. They are followed by
another police car. The bikers then escape from their pursuers by riding
down steep embankments. The cars cannot follow and must stop on different
levels. The bikers unite and ride away.

[It seems that the chase is over and they have eluded the antagonist.]

The biker's are overjoyed by their victory. One takes off his hat, waves it
in the air, and shouts "We've made it!" Suddenly, he quickly ducks to avoid
being grabbed by a man. A group of men continue the chase. Several cars
pull up ahead and form a blockade in the road.

Elliott and E.T. ride forward. Horror grows on Elliott's face as he stares
at the enemy in front of him.

[This final confrontation between the protagonist (Elliott and E.T.) and
the antagonist.]

The antagonist is explicitly revealed at this moment. On the side panel of
a car is a sign stating:

                           FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
                              U.S. GOVERNMENT
                           INTERAGENCY MOTOR POOL
                                    GSA

The shadow of a shotgun covers the sign. Next, two shotguns are raised
against E.T. and Elliott.

Elliott shuts his eyes with fear. There is a closeup of E.T.'s face. With
shotguns drawn, government agents gesture for them to stop.

[This is the life and death final moment before the climax. The audience
has been set up to expect that the government agents would shoot at the
protagonist by Mary's comments in the park scene.]

Suddenly, E.T. saves the day with his telekinetic powers. He lifts all of
the bikers up into the air as they fly above the blockade.

[The climax is over E.T. has saved himself and his friends]

E.T. then flies the bikers over the housetops, and across the setting sun.
Finally they float down onto a path in the forest.

EXT: FOREST: DAY

Elliott has reached the landing site. He brushes the leaves away from the
turntable of the communication device. A blue-light floods Elliott's face.
He looks up into the, along with the other bikers. E.T., with red-heart
happily flashing, also gazes into the sky as his spaceship descends.
"Home," says E.T.
The spaceship continues its descent as E.T.'s red-heart flutters. The
spaceship finally lands in a golden glowing light.

A car pulls into the forest, and Gertie's voice can be heard pointing out
the location of the boys. The ramp to the spaceship lowers. Gertie runs up
to Mike and E.T. She gives E.T. the plant and says that she just wanted to
say goodbye. Michael responds that E.T. doesn't know goodbye.
"Be good," says E.T.
"Yes," says Gertie, as she kisses him on the nose.
Mike places his hand on E.T.'s head.

[This is a basic gesture of trust. The fact that E.T. allows Mike to do
this indicates that he considers him a friend.]

E.T. puts the plant on the ground, as Mary and "Keys" run up to the edge of
the site. Mike picks up Gertie and carries her away as Elliott approaches
E.T.

"Come," says E.T
"Stay," says Elliott.

[The two characters that had merged into one protagonist must split apart
because they now have different primary objectives. E.T. want's to return
home, and Elliott wants him to remain.]

E.T. lifts his finger to his lips and says "ouch."

[Of course, this indicates the pain he feels in their separation.]

Elliott tearfully lifts his finger to his lips and says "ouch."

[The symmetry of his movements indicate that in some sense, they still are
one.]

E.T. and Elliott hug each other as the are visually surrounded by blue and
white lights. Then Elliott and Mary exchange glances as Mike and Gertie
stand by and watch. E.T. lifts his finger to Elliott's forehead. It lights
up, then he says: "I'll be right here."

[The resolution of the dilemma. Though E.T. leaves, he will still remain,
perhaps telepathically, or perhaps only within Elliott's thoughts.]

"Bye," says Elliott..

E.T. picks up the potted plant and carries it up the gangplank. Elliott
watches from below as Harvey starts up the plank, then returns to Elliott's
side.

[E.T. leaves with what he really came for, a sample of the earth's
vegetative life form. But now he has much more in the flowers that will
serve as a memorial of all that he has experienced with his new friends.]

The gangplank lifts up and separates E.T. from Elliott. The ships circular
entrance closes. The spaceship lifts off. Elliott watches it float up into
the sky. It then speeds away, leaving an orange-blue rainbow behind against
the blue-morning sky.

[Orange and blue were also the colors of E.T.'s makeshift communication
device as found by Mike in the forest.]

Mary watches and laughs with happiness. The other boys also watch, as Mike
holds Gertie in his arms. The film ends with a shot of Elliott gazing up
into the sky.

THE END
ARAC ATTACK
   (Eight Legged Freaks)

        July 2000 Draft




    FOR EDUCATIONAL
     PURPOSES ONLY

                      ARAC ATTACK!


FADE IN:

EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

A rabbit hops across rough terrain.


EXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - NIGHT

Three trucks from Chemical Technologies carry barrels of
toxic waste. They pass a sign: PROSPERITY, NEVADA, POP
454.


INT. THIRD TRUCK (HIGHWAY, DESERT) - NIGHT

A sleepy trucker called PIG PEN drives the third truck.

                         SELF-HELP TAPE (V.O.)
           I will be self-assured and
           confident around women.

                         PIG PEN
           I will be self-assured and
           confident around women.


EXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - NIGHT

The rabbit stops at the edge of the road. The first
truck speeds past. Then the second. The rabbit crosses
the highway in front of the third.


INT. THIRD TRUCK (HIGHWAY, DESERT) - NIGHT

                         SELF-HELP TAPE (V.O.)
           I will not fear the unexpected.

                         PIG PEN
           I will not fear the unexpected.

The rabbit appears in the road, frozen by headlights.

                           PIG PEN
           Ahhhhhhhhhh!

Pig Pen jams on his brakes and swerves to avoid the
bunny.


EXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - NIGHT

The truck slews crazily.    Missing the bunny by a whisker.

                                                        2.

INT. THIRD TRUCK (BRIDGE, DESERT) - NIGHT

Pig Pen sees a bridge ahead. If he doesn't regain
control, he will crash. At the last second, he gets the
rig together.


EXT. BRIDGE (DESERT) - THIRD TRUCK - NIGHT

The rim of a wheel tags the curb. One of those toxic
waste barrels falls out of the back and plunges to the
water below.


EXT. DRAINAGE DITCH - NIGHT

A biohazard warning label is legible as the barrel slips
beneath the surface. Glowing toxic waste seeps from a
gash in its side. Spreading through the pool like neon
ink.


EXT. DRAINAGE DITCH - DAY

The ditch is littered with garbage. The DRONE of
INSECTS. No visible traces of toxic waste. A butterfly
net sweeps through the air to capture an oversized
horsefly.

JOSHUA TAFT (70s), scrutinizes the bug. This old codger
is more comfortable studying bugs than socializing with
people.

                         JOSHUA
          Hey, Mike.   Check this one out.

MIKE PALMER (12) steps over for a look.     Puberty hit hard
and fast for this bright, little nerd.

                         MIKE
          He's huge!

                        JOSHUA
          They've been like this all week.
          Must be something extra tasty in
          the water.

                         MIKE
          Like what?

                        JOSHUA
          Dead coyote. Snake maybe. Back
          in the 'Nam we'd eat python with a
          dash of habanero sauce. Mighty
          satisfying.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                         3.

CONTINUED:

                              MIKE
             You ate snake?

                           JOSHUA
             When you're thirty klicks out from
             the nearest firebase. Humpin'
             through the wake-up with your
             finger on the trigger. Charlie
             doesn't give you time to stop for
             cutlet.

As Mike skims his own net over the water, he glimpses a
familiar barrel at the bottom of the pool. The brightly-
colored biohazard warning label is clearly visible.


EXT. ROAD - JOSHUA'S HOUSE - DAY

Two bicycles are parked outside a cabin in the middle of
nowhere.


INT. JOSHUA'S HOUSE - DAY

The decor is an odd mix of Vietnam era war relics and
homegrown scientist. Charlie the Parrot sits on a perch.

                           CHARLIE (V.O.)
             Charlie, don't surf!

                              JOSHUA
             Quiet, bird.     We're working.

Mike and Joshua stand near the spider tanks. A dozen
aquariums on low shelves. Each glass tank replicates a
specific environment: jungle, desert, cavern, pond, etc.

                           JOSHUA
                    (dims tank lights)
             The sun is going down, my
             nocturnal hunters. It's time to
             come out and feed.

Mike watches Joshua deposit bugs into each spider tank.

                          MIKE
             Yeah. They're definitely getting
             bigger.

                           JOSHUA
             I've calculated a growth factor of
             twelve percent over the last
             forty-eight hours. But that seems
             to be accelerating.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                           4.

CONTINUED:

                           MIKE
             All from eating these bugs?   Maybe
             I should try some.

Mike pauses at the desert tank, watching a cricket search
for food. A trap-door spider pops out of its camouflaged
den like a jack-in-the-box. The arachnid yanks the
cricket below and replaces the roof in a nanosecond.

Mike looks in another tank where ogre-eyed spitting
spiders shoot blasts of paralyzing goo at hapless
insects.

                           MIKE
             Run, little guys.

                           JOSHUA
             They can't outrun the food chain.

                           MIKE
             I could get away.

                           JOSHUA
             Imagine yourself the size of that
             fly. A scytodes spitter would be
             as big as a Cadillac. You'd be
             spider chow, kid.

Mike looks in a tank where jumpers chase fleeing
crickets. He moves toward another tank that is covered
with a towel.

                           MIKE
             Are the new tarantulas in here?

                           JOSHUA
             Took me forever to get a breeding
             set of Chilean reds. I must have
             bribed every customs agent from
             Vegas to Santiago.

Joshua unveils the    tank. Dirt floor. Several burrow
entrances. Joshua     pours in the bugs. A large, male
tarantula comes out    of a burrow. It pounces on a bug,
then wraps its prey    in webbing, turning the insect into a
mummy-like bundle.

                           MIKE
             That is too cool.

                           JOSHUA
             Male tarantulas compete for the
             female's attention.

CONTINUED:

                           JOSHUA (CONT'D)
             Each one tries to bring her the
             best present. Bugs, rats, even
             the occasional parrot.

CHARLIE SQUAWKS.

                           JOSHUA
             The prey is cocooned alive so she
             can eat them in her nest. You
             know how women love breakfast in
             bed.

Joshua leads Mike to the back of the tank. A network of
subterranean tunnels is revealed. The male tarantulas
scuttle through carrying their mummified offerings.

                           JOSHUA
             Take a look, the female of the
             species is three times as big as
             the male.

Mike peers into a large den. The female tarantula steps
out of the shadows. This is Consuela, the Chilean red
tarantula.

                           JOSHUA
             Say hello to Consuela.

Mike watches Consuela unwrap one of the mummified
bundles. She begins to eat the paralyzed insect within.

                           JOSHUA
             She fills her prey with digestive
             acid to liquify the internal
             organs. Now watch... She'll drink
             her victim from the inside out.
             While it's still alive!

                           MIKE
                    (looks queasy)
             And you wonder why my mom doesn't
             like me hanging out with you.

                           JOSHUA
             Arachnids have been roaming the
             earth for millions of years. And
             they'll be here long after the
             human race is dead and buried.

Suddenly Consuela lunges at the glass.     Mike recoils.

                            MIKE
             Bad!   Bad Consuela!

Consuela backs up, apparently she can be intimidated.

                                                        6.

TARANTULA POV - MIKE

The multi-eyed spider's PANORAMIC VISION. Mike looms
large at the edge of the glass, wagging his finger.


BACK TO MIKE

Mike stares into the many eyes of Consuela.

                        MIKE
          Do that again and I feed you to
          the parrot.

CHARLIE SQUAWKS hungrily.    The sound of a CAR HORN.

                        JOSHUA
          There's your mom.

                        MIKE
          See you tomorrow, Joshua!

Mike heads for the door.


EXT. DESERT - DAY

The entrance to a mine shaft protrudes from a hillside.
A pickup truck is parked nearby. The faded logo on the
door reads: McCORMICK AND SON MINING COMPANY,
PROSPERITY, NV.


INT. MINE SHAFT - DAY

Rotten beams. Chipped walls. A GENERATOR POWERS a
string of lightbulbs. A lone figure works at the end of
the tunnel.

CHRIS McCORMICK (30s) has rugged good looks. Weathered
clothing. Dirt-stained face. Ripped muscles.

Chris chips at the wall with his pickaxe. As it makes
contact, the occasional spark flies up. Chris pauses to
scrutinize the target area with his helmet-light.

Something sneaks along the floor of the mine behind him.

Chris is oblivious to his unseen stalker. He chips away
a section of stone to reveal shiny minerals. Reflections
of silver and gold splash across his face. His smile
fades...

                           CHRIS
          Damn.

                                              (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

Chris bends over, reaching for a bottle of water. A
large rat scurries out of hiding dragging away Chris's
sack lunch.

Chris grabs his pick-axe and goes after the rat. The
rodent dodges every hit. Sparks fly when the axe strikes
rock. These ignite a vent of methane gas.

A BRIEF EXPLOSION knocks Chris off his feet. He notices
a small hole in the floor is lit like the burner on a
stove. Chris pats out the flame as the rat scurries away
with lunch.

                           CHRIS
             Hope you like bologna!



EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

A police car drives with a bicycle hanging out of the
trunk.


INT. POLICE CAR (HIGHWAY) - DAY

SAMANTHA "SAM" PALMER (30s) is the sheriff of Prosperity
and a confident, single mother. Mike is seated beside
her.

                             MIKE
             You   should see them, Mom. Each
             one   has a unique feeding behavior.
             The   spitters fire poisonous snot.
             The   tarantulas mummify their prey.
             The   jumpers can...

                           SAM
             Why does he have all those things?

                           MIKE
             He studies them. NASA uses spider
             webs in outer space. And for
             medicine. They've been here
             forever, and they'll be here long
             after we're all dead.

                           SAM
             You're givin' me nightmares.

                           MIKE
             Nightmares are cool.

             U.P.S. brought this to the

Sam hands Mike a small package.

                           MIKE
             It's from Dad! He didn't forget
             my birthday. I told you he
             wouldn't.

                           SAM
             Better late than never.

Mike tears open the box to reveal a Cassiopeia PDA.

                             MIKE
             Rockin'!

                           SAM
             Is that the one you wanted?

                           MIKE
             Cassiopeia 2304 with 64 megs of
             ram. Integrated modem. Voice
             recording capability. This baby
             is tight.

Mike can't turn on the gizmo.

                             SAM
             What's wrong?

                           MIKE
             He forgot to send the batteries.

                           SAM

             I told him to send batteries.

The ROAR of two off-road MOTORCYCLES tearing up the
desert.

BRET HALE (18) leads the way. A Kid Rock-punk with good
looks and FU attitude. Seated behind him is ASHLEY
PALMER (16). This milk-fed desert honey is a wannabe
Britney Spears. LARRY (17) is the wiseacre on the other
bike.

                           BRET
             Hang on, babydoll!

CONTINUED:

They GUN their BIKES onto the highway. Slalom the yellow
lines. Wheelie for days. Ashley peeks over Bret's
shoulder at a police car coming at them in the opposite
lane.

                           ASHLEY
             Oh shit.


INT. POLICE CAR (HIGHWAY) - DAY

Sheriff Sam watches intently as the bikes wheelie past.

                           SAM
             Hang on.

                           MIKE
             Why?


EXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - DAY

The police car does an impressive bootlegger 180. Lights
ablaze. SIREN WAILING. The bikes pull over to the
shoulder.


EXT. SHOULDER OF HIGHWAY (DESERT) - DAY

The motorcycles stop with the cop car behind.        Sam's
voice barks over the PA.

                           SAM (V.O.)
             Party's over, gentlemen.   Off the
             bikes.

Sam exits the car and approaches.       The bikers dismount.

                           BRET
             There is something very sexy about
             an older woman in uniform.

                           LARRY
             Her nine-millimeter gives me a
             stiffy.

                           ASHLEY
             Don't antagonize her, you guys.

                           SAM
             I told you not to act like
             kamikazes. Especially with Ashley
             riding behind. That is
             unacceptable, Bret.

Larry snickers.     Sam steels her rage.

                           SAM
             You just bought yourself a
             reckless.

Sam begins to write up the ticket.

                           ASHLEY

                              ASHLEY
             But, Mom!

Sam shoots his daughter an intimidating glance.

                           BRET
             No sweat, babydoll.       We'll hook up
             later.

The punks remount their bikes.

Ashley slides the zapper into her backpack.

                           ASHLEY
             You are so over protective.

Mike and Ashley lip-sync along with Sam's response.

             You need to start trusting me.

                           SAM
             I'd like to. But you keep
             skipping classes to go to the
             dunes with Bret.

                           ASHLEY
             Why do you hate him so much?

                           SAM
             I don't hate him. I just want you
             to have a future. I thought you
             wanted to get out of town. Go to
             med school.

                           ASHLEY
             Maybe I want to stay. I could get
             pregnant by nineteen. Then
             divorce with a couple of kids I
             can't handle. Slap on a badge and
             be a trailer trash sheriff.

                    (deeply hurt)
             Thanks for the flashback.

They drive on in painful silence.     Mike turns ON the

                           HARLAN (V.O.)
             ... listening to W.F.R.E. Freedom
             radio. We've put aside the
             U.F.O.'s and conspiracy
             theories...

                                                       13.

INT. PICKUP TRUCK (HIGHWAY) - DAY

Chris drives into town with the RADIO ON.

                        HARLAN (V.O.)
          ... for some down home talk back
          with our own mayor: Wade Hale.

                        CHRIS
          Oh, great.

                        WADE (V.O.)
          Thanks, Harlan. As I was saying,
          Chemical Technologies has been
          looking for viable storage sites.
          And Prosperity is lucky enough to
          be on that list.

                        HARLAN (V.O.)
          Lucky? I think most of us are
          insulted that some outsiders think
          our town is a perfect place to
          dump toxic waste.

                        CHRIS
          Right on.


EXT. MAIN STREET (TOWN) - DAY

Chris's pickup approaches... The entire town is not much
bigger than a few football fields. The kind of place
where everybody has known each other since childhood.
Some buildings date back to the 1880's gold rush.

                        HARLAN (V.O.)
          Isn't this just your latest get-
          rich quick scheme?

At one end is the Prosperity Mall. A huge windowless
rectangle in the sand. Permanent signs tout the many
outlet stores inside: Victoria's Secret, Home and Garden
Supplies, Sport Chalet, etc. Hand-painted signs reveal:
"GOING OUT OF BUSINESS SALE. EVERYTHING MUST GO. FINAL
CLOSE OUT." On the roof of the mall is a very tall radio
antenna.

                        HARLAN (V.O.)
          Your mall has more employees than
          customers.


INT. PICKUP TRUCK (TOWN, MAIN STREET) - DAY

Chris smiles as he listens to the RADIO.

                                              (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

                           WADE (V.O.)
             I may have overestimated the need
             for 100,000 square feet of outlet
             shopping.


EXT. BEVERLY'S HOUSE - DAY

BEVERLY (40's) is tending to her garden as she listens to
a transistor radio.

                           HARLAN (V.O.)
             And your ostrich ranch?

                           WADE (V.O.)
             If the government subsidies hadn't
             dried up, I'd still be rolling in
             cash.


EXT. HARLAN'S TRAILER (MAIN STREET, TOWN) - DAY

An airstream at the far end of town. Signs identify it
as: "FREEDOM RADIO." A brand new humvee is parked out
front.


INT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - DAY

Walls decorated with clippings about aliens, monsters,
and conspiracies. Two men sit at a home built
transmitter.

HARLAN GRIFFITH (40s) wears an "Aliens Go Home!" T-
shirt. He eats from a box of Frosted Flakes and drinks
Jolt cola.

WADE HALE (40s) is the mayor of Prosperity. A slick-
haired dandy who looks more like a Vegas lounge singer
than a Mayor.

                            WADE
             With one phone call I could put
             together a deal that would make us
             all very rich.

                           HARLAN
             They say money doesn't buy
             happiness.

                           WADE
             They probably don't have any.

                                                    15.

INT. POLICE CAR (HIGHWAY) - DAY

Sam and her kids listen to the radio.

                        WADE (V.O.)
          Money pays for kids to go to
          college. It pays the mortgage.


INT. DINER (MAIN STREET, TOWN) - DAY

An attractive waitress on roller-skates. A harried CHEF.
Locals chow down. The RADIO BLARES in the b.g.

                        WADE (V.O.)
          It puts food on the table.
          Haven't the people of this town
          lived hand-to-mouth for long
          enough?


INT. BARBERSHOP (MAIN STREET, TOWN) - DAY

FLOYD and LEROY are the Jurassic era barbers. Floyd cuts
Leroy's hair. The two men listen to the RADIO.

                        WADE (V.O.)
          We're all gonna die in this hell
          hole.

                        FLOYD
          Yeah, of boredom.


INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

DEPUTY PETE sits with his feet up on the desk reading
Playstation magazine. He listens to the RADIO.

                        WADE (V.O.)
          Wouldn't it be nice not to worry
          about surviving retirement? Or
          taking a shot at that life-long
          dream?


INT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - DAY

                        WADE
          Think about it, Harlan, you could
          buy a commercial transmitter and
          start broadcasting to a national
          audience.

                        HARLAN
          It would be nice to get the
          message out. Let people know the
          aliens walk among us.

                                                     16.

INT. PICKUP TRUCK - DAY

Chris slows to a stop in front of the McCormick and Son
Mining Company. This stately edifice was once the
driving force behind the local economy.

                        WADE (V.O.)
          If Chris McCormick refuses to sell
          his mines. The rest of us are out
          of luck.

Chris frowns.


INT. POLICE CAR (HIGHWAY) - DAY

                        WADE (V.O.)
          I don't think it's fair for one
          person to wield that much power.
          But he's just like his father.
          Selfish. Greedy. And more than a
          little bit nuts.

                          SAM
          Uh-oh.

Sam flips on the SIREN and accelerates.


INT. DINER - DAY

The locals stop eating and look toward the radio.

                        WADE (V.O.)
          That family has been digging in
          those tunnels since the twenties.
          If there was something down there,
          don't you think they would have
          found it by now?


INT. BARBERSHOP - DAY

Floyd and Leroy stare at the radio.

                        WADE (V.O.)
          Common sense does not apply to
          crazy people.


INT. PICKUP TRUCK - DAY

                        WADE (V.O.)
          Might as well be chasing a
          leprechaun's pot of gold at the
          end of the rainbow.

Chris is furious as he PEELS OUT and speeds toward
Harlan's.


INT. DINER - DAY

The locals watch Chris's pickup speed by.

                           WADE (V.O.)
             ... lunatics...


INT. BARBERSHOP - DAY

Floyd and Leroy watch Chris speed by.

                           WADE (V.O.)
             ... certifiably nuts...


INT. POLICE CAR - (MAIN STREET, TOWN) - DAY

As Sam pulls into town. She sees Chris skid to a stop in
front of Harlan's trailer. He leaps out of his pickup.

                           WADE (V.O.)
             ... at the very least...


INT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - DAY

Chris yanks the door open in time to hear...

                           WADE
             ... those McCormicks are just
             plain-old dumb.

Wade stands up to protest. But it's too late. Chris
punches him in the nose. The mayor tumbles back.

                           CHRIS
             I've warned you not to talk about
             my family!

                           HARLAN
             We have a surprise guest in the
             studio.

Chris drags Wade to his feet, shoving him against the
wall.

                           CHRIS
             My family built this town!

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                           18.

CONTINUED:

                           WADE
             Am I supposed to be grateful?

Chris draws back his fist for another shot.       Sam runs in
and grabs him from behind.

                              SAM
             That's enough!

                           CHRIS
             Stay out of this, Sam!

She manhandles Chris toward the door.


EXT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - DAY

Practically the entire town has gathered outside. Sam
drags Chris through the door. Wade and Harlan are close
behind.

                           CHRIS
             Did you hear what he said?

                              SAM
             I heard.

                           WADE
             I want him locked up!

                           SAM
             Let's all calm down.

Wade tries to take advantage of the assembled audience.

                           WADE
             We have no economy! People are
             barely scraping by! And now we've
             been offered the deal of a
             lifetime. You don't have the
             right to stand in our way!

                           CHRIS
             Those mines are full of gas. One
             spark in the wrong place could
             blow this entire valley sky high.
             Do you really want to load that
             gun with toxic waste?

                           WADE
             Chem-Tech did seismic analysis,
             vapor checks, groundwater reads,
             soil sampling. They found
             isolated methane pockets, but no
             benzene or hydrogen sulfide.

                           CHRIS
             How could they run tests? I
             didn't give them permission to go
             into the mines.

Wade retreats toward his shiny new Hummer.

                           CHRIS
             I asked you a question, you greedy
             son of a bitch!

                           WADE
             I'm greedy?! You're the one
             keeping us down so you can search
             for gold!

Chris tries to go after Wade.       Sam holds him back.

                           SAM
             Don't take another step.

Chris stares at her.

                           CHRIS
             You're taking his side?

                           SAM
             I'm trying to keep the peace.

                             WADE
             You're crazy!    Just like your
             father!

Wade drives off in his humvee.       The crowd begins to
disperse.

                            CHRIS
                    (sotto)
             He wasn't crazy.

                             SAM
             It's okay.

Chris heads off to his truck. Sam watches him go. Her
eyes drifting down his body. Ashley steps up beside her
mom.

                           ASHLEY
             Maybe you're not gay after all.

                           SAM
             What are you talking about?

             butt.

                           SAM
             Where did you learn that it's okay
             to talk to me like this?

                          ASHLEY
             Relax, Mom. He's hot for an old
             guy. I can admit it. Why can't
             you?

Sam watches Chris get into his truck. He gives her one
last look before pulling out. Sam smiles with her
daughter.


INT. MINING MUSEUM (MAIN STREET, TOWN) - DAY

Vintage mining gear. Walls covered with sepia-tone
photos chronicling the history of the McCormick mines.

GLADYS LAUDERBACK (50s) sits at a desk. She blows smoke
from her Kool into the breeze of an air conditioner.
Ignoring the signs behind her head: "NO SMOKING!",
"DANGER GAS!"

As Chris enters, Gladys hides her lit cigarette in a
drawer.

                           GLADYS
             Did you pop him one?

                           CHRIS
             He had it comin'. But Sam
             Palmer... That woman abuses her
             power.

                           GLADYS
             Why? Because she stopped you from
             givin' Wade another pop?

                           CHRIS
             I'm not proud of it.

Chris goes to a table and a map of the mines that
honeycomb beneath the town. Many of them are marked
"explored." Many aren't. Chris checks another tunnel
off the list. He sniffs the air and glares at Gladys.
Smoke rises out of her desk drawer. Gladys yanks it open
and puts out the flame.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                           CHRIS
             I thought you were trying the
             patch.

                           GLADYS
             I am.

She raises her sleeve to reveal several nicotine patches.
Chris exits through a door at the back of the museum.


INT. MUSEUM - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Chris enters the family living quarters. The furniture
was new in 1947. He continues to the adjacent kitchen.


INT. MUSEUM - KITCHEN - DAY

Chris takes a beer out of the fridge. Then he notices an
odd CLICKING. He tracks the sound to a stove burner
permanently on "light."

Chris moves to a fuse box in the adjacent hallway. He
removes the fuse for the stove. The SPARKING STOPS.

Chris sits at the table and has a cooling sip of beer.
Gladys enters with a stack of bills.

                           CHRIS
             That burner's on the fritz again.

                            GLADYS
             Oh something's broken? What else
             is new?
                     (lays bills on table)
             You need to pay these by the end
             of the month.

                    (looks at bills)
             Today... For a split second... I
             actually thought I had it.

                           GLADYS
             Another vein of iron pyrite?

                           CHRIS
             Yeah... Then a rat stole my lunch.
             I practically blew myself up
             trying to get it back.

             What are you saying?

                           GLADYS
             Honey, if he really does have a
             buyer...

                           CHRIS
             You of all people know how much my
             dad wanted to find that mother
             lode.

                           GLADYS
             Your daddy wanted to    get rich. I
             don't think he cared    how that
             happened. If he was     still alive,
             maybe he'd sell those    mines.

Chris takes umbrage...

                           CHRIS
             And maybe you didn't know him so
             well after all.

A tense beat.

                           GLADYS
             You're right... I'm just worried
             about how we're going to pay these
             bills.

                           CHRIS
             Don't give up on me, Gladys. I
             promised him I'd find the gold.
             And I will.

Gladys steels her fear, patting Chris on the hand.


EXT. TOWN - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAWN

The sun rises.     The town slowly comes to life.

                           HARLAN (V.O.)
             Good morning, Prosperity, Nevada.
             It's another beautiful day on the
             frontier.

Locals prepare their stores for business.

                                                          23.

INT. JOSHUA'S HOUSE (DESERT) - DAY

                        HARLAN (V.O.)
          No charges have been filed in
          yesterday's fracas between Chris
          McCormick and Wade Hale. And
          we've got...

Joshua turns the radio down. He holds a tape measure to
a glass spider tank, recording the size of an unseen
arac.

                        JOSHUA
          An exponential growth rate...
          That's impossible.

                         CHARLIE
          Me so horny.   Me love you long
          time.

Joshua doesn't look back at the parrot sitting on its
perch.

                        JOSHUA
          Be quiet, bird!

Charlie looks over at the tarantula tank. Watching
curiously as the cloth cover moves slightly. As if one
of the spiders is escaping. Charlie flies over to
investigate. He lands on the counter and peers around
the back of the tank.

                        CHARLIE
          Charlie's in the wire!     Incoming!

Something yanks the parrot O.S.

                        JOSHUA
          Stop screwing around...!

Joshua looks back in search of the parrot. He notices
several feathers floating down to the floor. He heads
over to investigate. Joshua pulls the blanket clear to
reveal the top of the cage has been pushed aside. No
sign of any tarantulas. Joshua checks the back side of
the tank.

                        JOSHUA
          Where'd you go? Consuela?

She's nowhere to be seen. Joshua spots      something
sticking out from under the table. Two      parrot feet.
Joshua pulls Charlie out from under the     table. It's a
horrible sight. The bird is wrapped in      spider webbing.
His body desiccated.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          24.

CONTINUED:

                           JOSHUA
             Charlie... Semper fidelis.

Joshua sees Charlie is attached to a web. He tugs on the
webline. Something tugs back. Joshua leans down to look
under the table. His eyes go wide at what he sees. Then
a shadow looms over his head. Joshua looks up and...


EXT. JOSHUA'S HOUSE (DESERT) - DAY

SCREAMS and the sounds of BREAKING GLASS come from
within.


EXT. PALMER HOUSE (TOWN) - DAY

Ranch style.    Cop car in front.     Chris's pickup cruises
by.


INT. PICKUP TRUCK - OUTSIDE PALMER HOUSE - DAY

Chris drives past.    He catches sight of a figure in a
window.


INT. PALMER HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

Sam is brushing her teeth at the window as Chris drives
by. They make eye contact. Chris moves on. Sam looks
at herself in the mirror. Bathrobe. No makeup. Messy
hair. Mouth full of toothpaste.

                              SAM
             Work it, babe.


INT. PALMER HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

Sam comes out of the bathroom dressed in her uniform.

                           SAM
             It's all yours.

Ashley and Mike exit their rooms. Mike is dressed for
the day. Ashley in a robe. They race for the bathroom.
Mike is first. Then Ashley hip-checks him out of the
way, slamming the door in his face.

                              ASHLEY (O.S.)
             Ladies first.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                           MIKE
             What's your excuse!?

Sam sticks her head out of a room at the end of the hall.

                           SAM
             You still want a ride, Mike?

                           MIKE
             I'm just going to the mall.

                           SAM
             Have fun.

Mike heads down the hallway and out of the house.


INT. PALMER HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

Ashley turns on the shower, drops her robe, and climbs
in.


INT. BATHROOM - SHOWER - DAY

Ashley is surrounded by steam. She sings an edgy gangsta
rap tune by NWA. Tres' bizarre, non? Shampoo lather
cascades down her face. Her eyes close. She is
oblivious to a small spider crossing a web in front of
her. The spider gets clear as Ashley rinses off the
soap.

Ashley rubs conditioner into her hair. The lather
builds. Covering her face. Forcing her eyes closed once
more. The spider returns across its web right in front
of her eyes.

The water stops. Ashley reaches for the showerhead
blindly knocking the spider off its web. She feels no
water coming out, and fumbles for a washcloth. Reaching
with eyes closed, she can't see the little spider has
landed on top of the cloth. As Ashley retrieves it, the
spider scurries onto its opposite side.

Ashley wipes the soap off her face. The spider rides the
washcloth and moves toward her hand. Before it can
strike, Ashley gets her eyes clear and drops the cloth.

The cloth lands on the floor atop the spider. As the
beast stares out from under it, barefoot Ashley steps on
the cloth. Crushing the spider without ever knowing it
was there.

                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                     26.

CONTINUED:

Ashley turns her attention to the showerhead. She cranks
the water handles, trying to get the water flowing again.
The handles suddenly pop off. Dozens of tiny spiders
pour from the holes onto the floor. Ashley shrieks in
horror.

Sam bursts into the bathroom and yanks open the shower
door. She drags Ashley out and looks at all the little
spiders.

                          SAM
             Now what?

Ashley just screams.


INT. HANK AND EMMA'S HOME - DAY

The SCREAM of a SAWZALL. A house in the midst of
remodeling. Sections of wall are exposed. Sheets cover
furniture. HANK (30s) is the Bob Villa-poseur.

A cat sits near an open section of wall. Watching
something intently. The cat charges into the wall after
unseen prey.

EMMA (30s) comes downstairs wearing her bathrobe. She
clutches her ears in pain, screaming for Hank to stop.
He can't hear. She grabs his shoulder and he STOPS
CUTTING.

                           EMMA
             Why do you need to do that as six
             in the morning!? Do you hate me
             that much!?

                           HANK
             I want to finish before I go to
             work.

                           EMMA
             You've been saying that for six
             months!

                           HANK
             I can't finish if you keep
             interrupting!

Hanks RESTARTS the SAW as Emma staggers into the kitchen.

                                                         27.

INT. REMODELED HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Emma makes herself a hangover helper. Egg, tabasco,
lemon juice, and a shot of vodka. All of it goes into
the BLENDER. She FIRES it UP. Competing with the noise
of Hank's SAW. Then Emma notices a bowl of uneaten cat
food.


INT. REMODELED HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Emma comes back in and UNPLUGS the noisy SAW.

                        HANK
          If you're gonna keep pulling the
          plug...

                        EMMA
          Have you seen Zeke this morning?

                        HANK
          He was chasing something earlier.

                        EMMA
          If he got into the wall again,
          it's your balls in the blender.

They hear FAINT MEOWING. Hank traces the source.       It's
coming from behind a partially-dismantled wall.

                         HANK
          Hey, Zeke.   Breakfast is ready.

                        EMMA
          I'll get the tuna.

Emma heads back into the kitchen. Hank listens at the
wall. After a beat he hears the CAT RUSTLING around
inside.

                           HANK
          Zeke?

Emma re-enters with a can of tuna.       She hears ZEKE HISS.

                        EMMA
          What's wrong with him?

Hank shakes his head. The CAT noises become more
aggressive. The panicked couple tries to follow the
cat's progress. They tracks the sounds of BATTLE along
the wall. The noises become FRANTIC. SCRABBLING CLAWS.
HOWLS of KITTY pain.

                           HANK & EMMA
          Zeke!?   Zeke!    Zeke!

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                       28.

CONTINUED:

They follow the cat's frenzied movement up the wall,
across the ceiling, and down the other wall. Hank
hurries over. He can feel his cat thrashing maniacally
on the other side. A FELINE SCREAM. And then deafening
silence.

Hank tears open the drywall, reaching for his cat.

                           HANK
             I've got him by the tail.

He withdraws all that remains of the Zeker... a bloody
tail.


EXT. MALL - DAY

Mike hops off his bike before it stops moving. Letting
it crash in the dirt. He enters the mall through glass
doors.


INT. MALL (PROSPERITY) - DAY

Mike passes NORMAN (18), a janitor polishing the floors.
Norman listens to LOUD DEATH ROCK TUNES on a Sony
WALKMAN.

                           NORMAN
                    (conspiratorial)
             Hey, dude. Yeah. You.

Mike comes over to this goatee'd rascal.

                           NORMAN
             Wanna buy some smoke?

                           MIKE
             A pack of cigarettes?

                           NORMAN
             Smoke to get high, not to die. My
             stuff is hydroponically grown in a
             top secret location. No
             artificial flavors. No
             preservatives. Just 110 percent
             homegrown.

                           MIKE
             Where's this secret location?

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                                29.

CONTINUED:

                           NORMAN
             I could have a dime bag for you
             toot sweet. But if I tell you
             where exactly, I'd have to kill
             you.

                           MIKE
             Norman, you know my mom's the
             sheriff.

                           NORMAN
             Oh yeah... Right on...
                    (considers this)
             Does she get high?

Mike walks away, deeper into the mall. A dozen stores
line the hallway: Victoria's Secret, Electronic
Boutique, Sport Chalet. Most of the stores are closed
for good. A large atrium features a fountain and jungle
gym. Skylights cover the ceiling. Mike enters the Home
and Garden store.


INT. HOME AND GARDEN STORE - DAY

Mike goes up to the counter.          The CLERK snaps at him.

                           CLERK
             The bug spray is on aisle five!

                              MIKE
             What?

                           CLERK
             You want mousetraps!?       Is that
             it?! Aisle five!

Mike grabs some batteries and lays them on the counter.

                              CLERK
             Oh.     I thought you wanted...

An OLD LADY walks past.

                           OLD LADY
             Excuse me, young man. Where can I
             find the bug spray?

                              CLERK
             Aisle five!

The Clerk grabs the PA's microphone.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                    (over PA speakers)
             All bug spray, rodent traps, ant
             poison and fly paper is on aisle
             five!

He returns his attention to Mike.

                           CLERK
             That'll be three fifty-two.

Mike pays the man.

                           MIKE
             Where's aisle five?

The annoyed Clerk points. Mike heads over. He sees the
aisle is crowded with locals squabbling over the few
remaining cans of Raid, Black Flag and Off.


EXT. BEVERLY'S HOUSE (TOWN) - DAY

Beverly uncoils a hose, cranks a spigot. She sprays her
vegetable garden with water. After a beat, a solid
object is coughed up through the hose.

Beverly continues watering. Two more unidentified
objects are spewed from the hose. She reacts by cranking
the spigot on full. The water sprays harder. Then
inexplicably stops.

Beverly checks the spigot. She looks into the opening of
the hose. Puts it to her ear and listens. Sniffs. Now
she puts the end of the hose in her mouth and sucks
deeply, trying to siphon away the blockage.

Beverly removes the hose. A FAINT RUMBLING sound. She
puts it back in her mouth and sucks. A solid object
comes through the hose and into her mouth. Then another.
And another. A dozen things pump through the hose and
into her mouth.

Beverly yanks it out. Water spews from her mouth and out
of the hose. Apparently the blockage has cleared.

Beverly falls to her knees. Hunching forward. She
vomits forth a stomach full of water... and small
spiders. Mouth agape. Eyes wide in horror. She watches
them scurry into the garden. Beverly tries to scream...
but can only retch.

                                                        31.

EXT. STREET (TOWN) - DAY

Mike Palmer rides his bike through a puddle of water. He
sees Beverly throwing up in her vegetable garden. Mike
it thoroughly grossed out.


EXT. JOSHUA'S HOUSE (DESERT) - DAY

Mike rides his bike into Joshua's front yard.    He
dismounts before the BIKE stops. It CRASHES.     Mike heads
inside.


INT. JOSHUA'S HOUSE - DAY

Mike stops short in the doorway. An off-hook TELEPHONE
BEEPS incessantly. WIND MOANS through shattered windows.
Furniture is tipped over. Mike moves through the chaos.

                         MIKE
          Hello?   Joshua? Charlie?

The spider tanks are shattered. No trace of their
occupants. Mike pulls out his Cassiopeia PDA and starts
recording.

                        MIKE
                 (into PDA)
          Captain's log. Stardate...

Stops recording, PLAYS it BACK, listens to HIS VOICE.

                           MIKE
          Cool!
                 (records again)
          The house is deserted. No sign of
          Joshua Taft or his bird. The
          spider tanks are shattered. There
          is broken glass everywhere.

Mike moves toward the back door of the cabin.    It swings
open and shut in the WIND.


EXT. JOSHUA'S HOUSE (DESERT) - BACK YARD - DAY

Mike comes out and notices hundreds of coin-sized
footprints. He follows these tracks to a cluster of
wooden barricades labeled: "McCORMICK AND SONS MINING
COMPANY." Mike peers toward a vertical mine shaft behind
the barriers.

                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                       32.

                    (into PDA)
             Animal tracks. Definitely too big
             to be spiders. Could be rats.

Mike slips past the barricades. Following the tracks to
the edge of the abyss. He can't see anything. It's too
dark.

Mike turns away and returns to the yard.    Never
realizing...

Several feet down the shaft. Hidden under a rock... the
shriveled and desiccated corpse of Joshua Taft. It hangs
from the side of the shaft in thick sticky webbing.
Grisly.

Suddenly the corpse is tugged loose and dragged deeper
into the shaft by some unseen creature.


EXT. MINE SHAFT - DAY

Chris's pickup is parked outside another mine shaft.


INT. MINE TUNNEL - DAY

Chris works with   his pick-axe. He pauses, listening to a
DISTURBING NOISE   somewhere down the tunnel. A growl? A
roar? Chris isn'   t so sure. And then a new sound... a
SCREECHING. The    noise grows LOUDER. Something's coming.

Chris shines his light into the darkness. Trying to see
what's causing the unsettling crescendo...

Suddenly dozens of RATS burst from the darkness.


EXT. MINE SHAFT - DAY

Chris runs out the mouth of the tunnel. The rat stampede
is on his tail. He leaps into the back of his pickup.
The manic rodents continue off into the desert.

Chris looks back toward the gaping mouth of the tunnel.

                           CHRIS
             What am I, the Pied Piper...

                                                        33.

EXT. MAIN STREET (TOWN) - BARBER SHOP - DAY

Mike rides his bike. Floyd the barber stands out front
chatting with an elderly couple. They hold a dog's leash
in their hand.

                         FLOYD
          I'm sorry.   I haven't seen him.


EXT. MAIN STREET (TOWN) - DAY

Mike rides on. He notices a guy taping a flyer to a lamp
post. Mike glances over. It's a sign for a missing dog.


EXT. MAIN STREET (TOWN) - POLICE STATION - DAY

Mike arrives at the local police station. Several cars
are parked out front. The door is ajar. Locals are
crowded inside. Mike lets his bike crash as he enters.


INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Sam is behind her desk.   The place is swarming with
locals.

                         SAM
          Quiet!   Quiet please!

The mob is not listening.

                        BEVERLY
          They were clogging up my house!

                        EMMA

Deputy Pete whistles at top volume.   Everybody shuts up.

                        SAM
          I had spiders at my house too.     We
          need an exterminator not a
          sheriff.

                        TRAVIS
          What about my dog?

             should go back out there and look
             for your animals. If they haven't
             shown up by tonight. I'll call
             Fish and Game. Okay?

Pete ushers the grumbling mob out of the office.   Mike
avoids the crush and manages to stay inside.

                           MIKE
             Mom! Mom!   All Josh's spiders are
             gone!

                           SAM
             I can't do this right now, Mike!
             Everyone's having pest problems!

                           MIKE
             But Joshua is gone!

                           SAM
             Maybe he's out looking for his
             spiders?

                           MIKE
             Mom, I'm serious! You're not
             listening!

                           SAM
             Mike... I've got missing pets.
             Spiders in the plumbing. Rats and
             mice coming out of basements. And
             your sister's about to end up on a
             milk carton. I can't have you
             losing...

The PHONE RINGS.     Sam answers it.

                           SAM
             Hello? Wade... wait a second...
             your ostriches?

OFF Mike's look.


EXT. WADE'S RANCH - DIRT DRIVEWAY - DAY

Prosperity is clearly visible just a mile away. The
police car drives down a long road lined with fences.

                                                       35.

EXT. WADE'S RANCH - RANCH HOUSE - DAY

Wade's new Hummer is in the driveway. A CATTLE DOG BARKS
as Wade leads Sam and Mike around the side of the house.

                        WADE
          Came out to feed my birds this
          morning.

                         SAM
          Coyotes?

                         WADE
          Hell no!

The trio steps to the fence.    Only three mangy ostriches
are there to greet them.

                        WADE
          My flock had fifty birds! Where'd
          they go, dammit! Who the hell
          steals fifty birds that can't even
          fly!?

                        SAM
          All this happened last night?

                         WADE
          I guess.   And we didn't hear a
          thing.

Sam gestures toward the BARKING DOG.

                        SAM
          What about him?

                         WADE
          Not a peep.

Mike notices some ostrich feathers on the ground.     He
heads over for a closer look.

The DOG watches his progress.    BARKING excitedly.

Sam talks to Wade.

                        SAM
          How's the ostrich business?

                        WADE
          Not so good lately.

                        SAM
          You've got that new Hummer. You
          must be makin' enough to pay for
          it.

                           WADE
                    (annoyed)
             You like it? I'll take you for a
             ride.

                           SAM
             These birds are insured.   Right?

                           WADE
             I didn't kill my birds, Sam.      Is
             that what you think?

Mike looks back to see his mom confronting Wade.

                           WADE
                    (in the distance)
             ... reject... absolutely not...

Mike scrutinizes what appear to be more of those tracks
that he found at Joshua's. But this time they are
larger:

                           MIKE
                    (into PDA)
             I've found more tracks.    Even
             larger now.

Mike follows the trail toward another mine entrance.
This one is plugged with concrete. The tracks don't go
there. They stop at what appears to be a normal patch of
ground. Several ostrich feathers are scattered nearby.

Mike takes a closer    look. Something doesn't seem right.
An odd demarcation    in the soil. His fingers trace the
edge of a thin film    of material. It is a lid of sorts.
A sheath of sticky    webbing coated with dirt. Mike is
able to lift it.

Mike peers into a deep dark burrow three feet wide.


INT. UNDERGROUND BURROW - DAY

Twenty feet down the shaft.     A shape moves.

Mike is oblivious as he peers into the dark.


EXT. WADE'S RANCH - RANCH HOUSE - DAY

The BARKING CATTLE DOG SNAPS its TETHER and charges Mike.
Sam and Wade see this and run after it.


EXT. WADE'S RANCH - OSTRICH PEN - DAY

Mike doesn't see the dog.    He's too busy looking in the
hole.


INT. UNDERGROUND BURROW - TRAPDOOR SPIDER POV - MIKE

The kid is FRAMED IN the burrow opening just a few feet
away.


EXT. WADE'S RANCH - OSTRICH PEN - DAY

Mike senses something approaching in the darkness.
Suddenly he's grabbed from behind. Sam drags him away as
CLYDE the cattle dog continues BARKING.

                        WADE
                 (to Clyde)
          Now you're on the job?! What the
          hell were you doin' last night?!

                           SAM
          Come on, Mike.     Let's hit it.

Sam leads her son toward the house.     Mike glances back.


EXT. WADE'S RANCH - DIRT DRIVEWAY - DAY

Mike and Sam are in the cop car.     Wade is at Sam's
window.

                        WADE
          I need to know what happened to my
          birds!

             If I find anything I'll let you
             know.
                    (a beat)
             So you can fill out that insurance
             form.

Sam drives down the driveway. Wade takes off his hat and
wipes his brow. He watches Clyde run parallel to the
accelerating police car.


INT. POLICE CAR (DIRT DRIVEWAY) - DAY

Sam eyes the road ahead.     Mike is lost in thought.

                           MIKE
             We have to go back.

                           SAM
             Mike?

                           MIKE
             That was a trapdoor spider's
             burrow.

                           SAM
             What are you talking about?

                           MIKE
             Joshua was feeding his spiders
             bugs from the creek. And they
             were getting bigger.

Mike glances out the window at the dog running nearby.

                           MIKE
                    (agitated)
             What if they didn't stop growing?
             What if they broke out of their
             tanks. Ate Joshua. And went into
             the mines?

Sam looks at him like he's out of his mind.

                           MIKE
             That could be why the other
             species are coming out into the
             open. They're trying to get away
             from the giant spiders.
                    (a beat)
             The ecosystem is out of balance.

             Ritalin?

She checks him for a fever.


EXT. WADE'S RANCH - DIRT DRIVEWAY - FENCE LINE - DAY

CLYDE runs   next to the car. Suddenly he disappears
underground   with a YELP. Only still frame on a DVD
player will   capture the trapdoor spider's lunge from a
camouflaged   den. The dog's empty collar rolls to a stop
in a cloud   of dust.


INT. POLICE CAR (DIRT DRIVEWAY) - DAY

Mike turns from his mother and looks out the window.        He
is confused when he doesn't see any sign of the dog.

                           MIKE
             Maybe I am losing it...

He checks himself for a fever.


INT. ABANDONED TRUCK STOP (DESERT) - DAY

A dingy collection of buildings surrounded by dunes and
rock. The structures have boarded windows. Graffiti on
the walls. Teenagers hang out. Off-road motorcycles
parked nearby.

Bret Hale's monster truck does donuts in the parking lot.
Ashley hangs out the passenger window shrieking with
glee.


INT. BRET'S TRUCK (TRUCK STOP) - DAY

Bret smokes a Phillies Blunt as he donuts his TRUCK.
Ashley laughs hysterically. Bret steers them around to
the back of the truck stop. He SKIDS to a stop.

                           ASHLEY
             Woo-hoo!

Bret offers his stogie.    Ashley refuses.     Bret puffs
away.

                           ASHLEY
             Haven't you had enough of that?

                              BRET
             No such thing.     Norman's bud is
             da'kine.

He coughs and they both laugh.

                           BRET
             When I medal at the X-Games, Honda
             will give me full sponsorship.
             Then I'll take you with me on the
             Supercross tour.

Ashley is silent.

                           BRET
             Are you still thinking about going
             away?

                           ASHLEY
             I don't know. I want to do
             something with my life, Bret.
             Help people. Maybe med school is
             still an option.

                           BRET
             Not if you keep hanging out with
             me.

                              ASHLEY
             Thanks, Mom.

They kiss. Things head toward a serious        level of "get
down." Bret slides his hand up Ashley's        shirt. Ashley
gets into it. But then Bret slides his        hand toward the
buttons of her 501s. Ashley removes his        hand.

                              ASHLEY
             Slow down...

Bret persists.       Ashley climbs off of him.

                           BRET
             I thought you loved me.

                              ASHLEY
             I do!

                           BRET
             Then what's the problem? You want
             to leave town. You don't want to
             make out.

                           ASHLEY
             I don't feel...

             What?

                           ASHLEY
             I don't want to lose my virginity
             in the front seat of a monster
             truck.

                           BRET
             Why didn't you say so? We can go
             outside. I've got a blanket in
             the back.

                           ASHLEY
             No... I guess... I'm just not
             ready.

                           BRET
             Tammy and Larry do it every night!

                           ASHLEY
             Then call them! Have a menage a
             trois!

                             BRET
             Come on,   Ashley. Mommy's not
             around.    You don't have to play
             the good   girl. Let Daddy give you
             what you   really want.

Bret goes after her once more.      Ashley's not into it.

                           ASHLEY
             Please, Bret... Please don't...

But Bret won't listen. Ashley isn't strong enough to
fight him. She reaches into her purse and pulls out her
stun gun. She rams it up in Bret's crotch and pulls the
trigger.

Bret howls like a baboon in a wood chipper. He
spasmodically jerks off of Ashley and tumbles out the
driver's side door.


EXT. BEHIND TRUCK STOP - DAY

Bret twitches on the ground.

                           BRET
             My balls? Ahh! My balls!
                    (looks down)
             I pissed myself?! Damn, bee-otch!

Ashley watches from the truck.

                           ASHLEY
             I told you to back off!

Ashley closes the door of the truck and rolls up the
windows.

Bret is dazed as he gets to his feet. Then his eyes
rack-focus to a nearby dune. A Rottweiler-sized jumping
spider stands atop it. Two large eyes surrounded by six
smaller orbs. Orange and black designs on its abdomen.
Wiry hair. Dagger-sized fangs. Bret can't quite believe
what he sees.

Ashley STARTS the TRUCK.      This snaps Bret back to
reality.

                             BRET
             Ashley, wait!

                           ASHLEY
             Screw you, Bret. I'm going home.

Bret sees the spider leisurely coming down off the dune.
He runs over to the door of the pickup and tries to open
it.

                            BRET
             Please!   Open the door!     I'm
             sorry!

                           ASHLEY
             I can't believe my mom was right
             about you. Do you know how
             embarrassing that is?

Ashley starts to pull away.         Bret keeps banging on the
glass.

                           BRET
             Open the door, baby!      I love you!
             I want to marry you!      Have my
             children! Please!

Ashley flips him the bird and BURNS RUBBER. As the truck
moves out of the way, Bret finds himself staring at
several more jumping spiders that are methodically
approaching. Bret sprints around to the other side of
the truck stop.

                                                         43.

EXT. TRUCK STOP - PARKING LOT - DAY

Bret runs from behind the building.    Larry Witzer and a
bunch of other kids see him coming.

                          LARRY
            Dude, did you piss in your pants?

                           RANDY
            Ha-ha!   Bret pissed his pants!

All the kids start laughing and pointing at Bret.      None
of them see the approaching jumping spiders.

                          BRET
            Get out of here! They're coming!

                          RANDY
            The only one coming is you, dude.

Larry and Randy high-five. A jumping spider lands on
Randy's back, piercing him with its fangs, throwing him
to the ground. Randy screams. The kids have a front-row
seat as the spider's pincers mash their buddy into an
edible pulp.

Bret leaps onto his MOTORCYCLE and FIRES it UP. Several
more jumping spiders bound across the parking lot.

                           BRET
            Ride!

The kids scramble, leaping onto their bikes. One rider
is picked off by a spider. The others kick up rooster
tails as they accelerate away. The spiders chase them
into the dunes.


EXT. SAND DUNES - DAY

A wasteland on the outskirts of town. The sandy waves
are "surfed" by the noisy MOTORCYCLES. The jumping
spiders keep after them, leaping a dozen feet in a single
bound.

A biker is ripped off a motorcycle.     The BIKE CRASHES.

Larry ends up with a jumper on his bike. Another biker
tries to kick it off, managing to knock the critter into
the motorcycle's spokes. The spider gets munched. But
then the courageous biker crashes and is set upon by a
hungry jumper.

Larry continues riding. But a spider lands on his back
and sinks fangs into his spine. Larry yells bloody
murder.

CONTINUED:

Bret sees Larry go down in a cloud of gore and sand.
Bret is the only human left. A jumper comes after him in
mid-air. Bret does an X-Games style rocket air, kicking
backward with booted legs. He knocks the spider away and
keeps on riding.


EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

Three familiar trucks cruise down the highway.     This time
they are devoid of any toxic waste cargo.


INT. THIRD TRUCK - HIGHWAY - DAY

Pig Pen stares fixedly at the endless road ahead of him.

                           SELF-HELP TAPE (V.O.)
             I will live every moment of my
             life as if it were my last.

                           PIG PEN
             I will live every moment of my
             life as if it were my last.

Suddenly Bret Hale wheelies across the road. A jumping
spider explodes against the windshield. Spider guts
splatter everywhere. Pig Pen screams as he JAMS on the
BRAKES.


EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The TRUCK jack-knifes into a line of telephone poles.
Knocking them over and rolling multiple times before
EXPLODING. Several jumping spiders are caught in the
blast. Bret Hale rides on with several more jumpers
behind.


INT. PALMER HOUSE - MIKE'S ROOM - DAY

The black and white classic: Tarantula, plays over an
old TV and VCR. Mike is at his computer, downloading a
spider encyclopedia into his PDA. A message flashes
across the screen: CONNECTION LOST. Mike picks up the
telephone.

                               MIKE
             Hello?   Hello?

The line is dead.

                                                     45.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Bret rides into a dead-end canyon with the spiders very
close behind. Bret steers for the mouth of a hillside
mine shaft.


INT HORIZONTAL MINE SHAFT - DAY

Bret speeds inside. He looks over his shoulder to check
for his pursuers, they're gone. Bret looks relieved. He
faces forward as... whack! A support beam knocks him
from his bike. The bike continues on into the tunnel
alone. From the sound of things it travels pretty far
before crashing.

Bret lies on the ground as dust settles onto his face.
He looks up at a support beam which begins to crack.
Bret moves clear just as the ceiling caves in, sealing
him in the mine.


EXT. MAIN STREET (TOWN) - DAY

Several locals put up more signs for missing pets.


INT. DINER/EXT. MAIN STREET (TOWN) - DAY

Harlan is kibitzing with Travis. Pete and Emma console
each other over dessert. Wade sits alone at a table for
two. The attractive WAITRESS on roller-skates give him a
fresh beer.

                        WAITRESS
          The phones went down for some
          reason. Maybe that's why Bret
          didn't call. Did you want to go
          ahead and order?

                        WADE
          Just give me the usual.

                        WAITRESS
          One ostrich steak, comin' up.

Wade reacts glumly to the word "ostrich."


INT. MUSEUM - KITCHEN - DAY

Gladys smokes as she puts together the fixings for a
large meal. She has a cookbook out. Pots and pans.
Chris enters. Gladys quickly drops her cigarette in the
disposal.

                           GLADYS
             What are you doing home?

                           CHRIS
             Need some rat traps.

                           GLADYS
             Try the basement.

                           CHRIS
             What is all this?

                           GLADYS
             I wanted to surprise you with a
             special dinner. Turkey De La
             Gladys.

                           CHRIS
             I'll have mine without Nicotine.

                           GLADYS
             Not as good that way.

Chris goes through a nearby door to the basement.


INT. MUSEUM - BASEMENT - DAY

Chris comes downstairs. He rummages through some junk.
comes up with several rat traps. He turns around to
discover an odd hole in the wall. He ventures over for a
look.

                           CHRIS
             Rats...

Chris leans into the hole, his jacket restricts his
entry.

Chris pulls out of the hole, standing to reveal a large
male tarantula on his back. Chris is oblivious as he
takes off his jacket. The coat lands in a heap atop the
spider.

Chris gets back down and places one of the rat traps in
the hole. He doesn't notice the jacket moving behind
him.

Chris backs out of the hole. He picks up his jacket.
The spider is gone. He grabs his traps and heads
upstairs.

                                                       47.

INT. MUSEUM - DAY

Chris passes through the kitchen.    He eyes Gladys warily.

                        CHRIS
          Have you been smoking?

                        GLADYS
          No.

Smoke pours out of her nostrils.

                        CHRIS
          Gladys...

                        GLADYS
          Get back to work. I'll see you
          tonight.

Chris starts out.

                        GLADYS
          Sam called for you.

Chris hesitates.

                        GLADYS
          She wants you to come by the
          station.

                        CHRIS
          She really has it in for me.

                        GLADYS
          Oh please.

                        CHRIS
          What?

                        GLADYS
          You two should just sleep together
          and get it over with.

                        CHRIS
          Me and Sam... Hook up...

                         GLADYS
          I may be older than electricity,
          but I used to be a nice-looking
          piece of tail.

                        CHRIS
          Too much information.

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                          48.

CONTINUED:

                           GLADYS
             I'm not kidding. I got more
             action than those chicks on VIP.
             So when I tell you Sam thinks your
             butt is U.S.D.A. choice...

                           CHRIS
             This is where I throw up.

                           GLADYS
             Don't tell me you don't think
             she's a fox.

Chris mulls this over.   Testing his own feelings. He
opens his mouth to ask another question. And then heads
out.

                           GLADYS
             See you for dinner.

Gladys doesn't notice the basement DOOR CREAK open
slightly.


INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Sam is on the phone at her desk.

                           SAM
             Nothing yet. I'm sorry.     We're
             still trying to get...

Chris enters.

                           SAM
             Let me call you back.
                    (hangs up)
             This has been one crazy day.
             We've got missing pets, dead
             ostriches. God only knows what's
             next.

                           CHRIS
             I'm sorry about yesterday. Wade
             is... He knows how to push my
             buttons.

                           SAM
             I wanted to ask you...

                           CHRIS
             On a date?

Sam freezes for a second.     Chris laughs.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                           49.

CONTINUED:

                            CHRIS
             I'm kidding.   What did you want to
             ask?

                           SAM
             Have you noticed anything strange
             in the mines?

                           CHRIS
             Define strange.

                           SAM
             I had spiders in my house. Hector
             had roaches in his basement. Some
             mice...

                           CHRIS
             How about stampeding rats?

                           SAM
             Were they running away from
             something?

                           CHRIS
             Could have been. Never saw them
             do that before. I guess it
             qualifies as strange.

Sam thinks this over.

                           CHRIS
             Sam... Do you want to go out
             sometime?

                           SAM
                    (taken aback)
             Are you asking me out on a date?

                           CHRIS
             Only if you're going to say yes.

Sam smiles slightly.


INT. MUSEUM - KITCHEN - DAY

The basement door is wide open. Gladys mixes food in a
bowl. A cigarette with a massive ash hangs off her lip.

A male tarantula moves across the ceiling. The creature
is the size of a pit bull. Two quivering palps flank
dart-sized fangs. Multiple eyes the size of quarters.
Hair all over.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                        50.

CONTINUED:

Gladys is oblivious to the ominous threat above her. As
she works, the spider shadows her. Every time the spider
is about to strike, she goes another direction to get
spices, utensils, a pan.

Gladys places her bowl on the stove. Suddenly the
tarantula drops onto the stove right in front of her.
Gladys shrieks. The tarantula lashes out at her. Gladys
grabs a frying pan and smashes it across the face as she
stumbles backward. The spider reels, striking the burner
knobs, turning on the gas.

Gladys registers the sound of ESCAPING GAS. She looks
back toward the fuse box and makes a run for it. As she
goes, the tarantula fires a webline at her.

Gladys gets the fuse off the top of the fuse box, but the
webline prevents her from slotting it home.

Gladys strains with all    her might, finally slots the
fuse. She turns toward     the kitchen just in time to see
the broken burner spark    to life. The gas ignites. The
tarantula is engulfed in    flame.

Gladys is knocked down by the blast. She lies on her
back when a second male tarantula nails her with a
webline. Gladys screams as she's dragged across the
floor toward the basement door.

The fire grows more intense, spreading quickly.


INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

                           CHRIS
             So that's a 'No.'

                           SAM
             My kids are the world to me,
             Chris. When their dad left... it
             really took a toll. On all of us.
             I can't go through that again. I
             won't.

                           CHRIS
             No... I understand... I don't know
             what I was thinking...
                    (laughs)
             Gladys has some crazy ideas. I'm
             gonna kill her.

Deputy Pete throws open the door.

             The museum's on fire!

OFF Chris's look.


EXT. BURNING MUSEUM - DAY

The museum burns. The volunteer fire department attacks
the conflagration. All the locals are there to help.

Sam's COP CAR SKIDS to a stop. Chris leaps out. Stares
at the fire for a beat. And then he charges toward the
inferno. Sam tackles him from behind. Pinning him to
the ground.

                            CHRIS
             No!   Let me go! Gladys!   Let me
             go!

The museum collapses.     Chris watches it burn to the
ground.


EXT. MUSEUM - DAY (LATER)

The fire is out. The once-proud building is now a
smoldering pile of rubble. Locals stand in small groups.

Chris wanders through the ruins as    firemen mop up. He
picks something out of the char.     The map of the mines.
Almost completely burned. Soaked     with water. He stares
at it for a heavy beat. All that     remains of his legacy.
Sam steps up.

                           SAM
             Maybe she got out.

Sam puts a comforting hand on his shoulder.

                            CHRIS
                     (devastated)
             She was cooking. The stove was
             broken.

                           SAM
             Why don't you come home with me?
             We'll get you cleaned up.

Chris hesitates for a moment. And then he lets the map
fall. He walks out of the ruins with Sam.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                            52.

CONTINUED:

Mike stands off to the side. He spots something near the
edge of the ruins. He goes over to pick it up. It's a
piece of arachnid exoskeleton. A spider's leg. Big.
Very big. Travis the fire chief warns him away.

                           TRAVIS
             Get away from there, Mike!

Mike hurries clear with his prize. He puts it on the
ground, sketches the outline of a spider to fit the scale
of the leg.

                             MIKE
             Holy God...

Mike looks around for his mom.         He sees her driving off
in the cop car with Chris.

                             MIKE
             Mom!   Wait!


EXT. PALMER HOUSE - DUSK

The sun hangs low in the sky.         Sam's cop car parks beside
Bret's monster truck.


INT. PALMER HOUSE - DAY

Ashley watches TV. A doctor resuscitates a dying patient
with CPR. The doctor counts as he pumps the man's chest.

                           TV DOCTOR (V.O.)
             One... two... three...

Ashley watches intently.       The patient is revived.

                           TV DOCTOR (V.O.)
             Helping people never gets old.

Ashley hears KEYS in the front DOOR. She quickly
switches channels to MTV. Sam enters with Chris.

                             SAM
             Is Bret here?

                             ASHLEY
             No.

                           SAM
             Then why is his truck out front?

                           SAM
             What do you mean?     What happened?

                            ASHLEY
             Nothing.

Ashley starts crying. Sam goes to comfort her daughter.
Chris stands by in shock. Watching, Upset.

                           ASHLEY
             Nothing happened, alright!

Ashley runs off to her room.       Sam follows.

Chris stands alone for a beat. He walks to the kitchen
and pulls a bottle of Vodka from the freezer. He puts
the cold bottle against his head and neck. Trying to
cool off.

Mike bursts into the house carrying his piece of
exoskeleton. He sees Chris opening the bottle of vodka.

                           MIKE
             Spiders shed their skins when they
             grow.

Chris looks at Mike for a moment.

                            MIKE
             Like snakes.

                           CHRIS
             Gladys is dead.

Chris drinks vodka straight from the bottle.

                            MIKE
             Maybe not.

That got Chris's attention.

                           MIKE
             This is a tarantula's leg. Or it
             was. It's an exoskeleton, to be
             scientific.

                           CHRIS
             It's a little large.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

Chris has another gulp of vodka as Mike holds up his
Cassiopeia full of spider data. He shows Chris a video
of a male tarantula mummifying its food. Chris watches
in amazement.

                           MIKE
             See! Male tarantulas wrap their
             prey in webbing. Tight like a
             mummy. The food stays alive so
             they can eat it later.

Sam enters the room in time to overhear this.

                             SAM
             Mike, please.    Now isn't the time.

Chris looks up at Sam.

                           CHRIS
             They keep their food alive.

Mike hands his mother the new piece of exoskeleton.

                             SAM
             What is this?

                           MIKE
             A spider's leg!

Sam flinches, dropping the object to the floor.

                             MIKE
             Careful!

                           SAM
             No. That's a piece of cactus.
             Look... It's covered with spines.

                           MIKE
             Those are quills! Tarantulas can
             flick them at you like darts!

Mike does an odd flicking motion.       Kind of like a dog
scratching a flea.

                           SAM
             Giant tarantulas?

                           MIKE
             Tarantulas! Wolfs! Trapdoors!
             Joshua had a ton of exotics!

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                           55.

             If there were giant spiders
             roaming the desert, don't you
             think somebody would've seen them
             by now?

                           MIKE
             The jumpers hunt in daylight. But
             not the others. They only come
             out when the sun goes down!

The group looks to the window, the sun hangs low in the
sky.


EXT. TOWN - DUSK

Prosperity is bathed in sunset. The mine shaft entrances
are clearly visible. Like black holes of malevolent
promise.


INT. PALMER HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY

The garage is cluttered. Old station wagon. Bikes.
Skis. Sam leads Chris to a bag full of her ex-husband's
clothes.

                           SAM
             I guess I should watch more
             'Oprah.' It must be a textbook
             'no-dad' kind of thing.

Chris shifts awkwardly.     In shock.   Sad.   Sam holds up a
flannel shirt.

                           CHRIS
             That one looks kind of scratchy.

Sam holds up a shirt that Chris approves of. He takes it
and proceeds to take off his old soot-stained shirt.

                           SAM
             All Jason cared about was getting
             out and starting over. I guess
             that included buying a new
             wardrobe.

Sam turns to pass Chris a pair of Levis. He's buttoning
up the new shirt. Chris takes the pants. He doesn't
register Sam ogling his exposed chest.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          56.

CONTINUED:

                           CHRIS
             Gladys thought I should sell...
             but you know... I never wanted to
             get rich. If it was about the
             money, I would have sold out to
             Wade a long time ago.

Chris moves behind the car and takes off his pants.

                           CHRIS
             I think I just wanted to prove the
             gold was down there. That my
             family wasn't crazy to keep
             looking. Even after we'd lost so
             much. And now... she's gone, too.

                           SAM
             I'm sorry, Chris.

                           CHRIS
             Do you know what I'm trying to
             say?

                           SAM
             It wasn't about spending the gold,
             it was about finding it.

                             CHRIS
             That's right.    That's exactly
             right.

Sam glimpses Chris through car windows. The poor guy's
struggling to pull on some 501s. Sam turns away, but
catches sight of him in a propped-up glass door.

                           CHRIS
             Remind me never to let you do my
             laundry.

She turns, only to see him in a mirror. He steps out
from behind the car. Sam stares at him.

                           SAM
             They look great.


INT. ASHLEY'S ROOM - SUNSET

A melancholy N'SYNC ballad plays over a BOOM BOX. Ashley
sits on her bed with her back to the open window. The
sun setting in the distance. She rips up the photographs
of Bret.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                       57.

CONTINUED:

Ashley doesn't notice the Great Dane-sized spitting
spider crawling in through her window. It is striped
like a jungle predator.

It comes all the way into the room and then lingers among
Ashley's stuffed animal collection.


INT. MIKE'S ROOM - DUSK

Mike checks the phone. Still dead. He types at his
computer, entering the specification of the piece of
exoskeleton. A digital representation of a spider grows
on his monitor screen. Showing Mike exactly how big the
spider would be after shedding this skin. Mike is
distracted by the LOUD MUSIC coming from Ashley's room.

                           MIKE
             Can't you turn that down?!


INT. ASHLEY'S ROOM - DUSK

                           MIKE (O.S.)
             I'm doing spider research!

Ashley stops ripping. She goes to the pile of animals,
oblivious to the spider. The beast doesn't move. Ashley
grabs a pink teddy bear with a heart on its belly. She
returns to bed and cuts the bear's heart out with
scissors.

The spitting spider sneaks up behind Ashley. As it
moves, so does Ashley. She scoops up the torn photos and
mutilated bear, dumping them in the trash. She turns
around to find the giant spider on her bed. She freezes
momentarily.

                            ASHLEY
                    (sotto)
             Spider... Mike... Spider...

Ashley sees her stun gun is on   the dresser. She lunges
for it. She's almost got it.     The spider squirts two
lines of gummy web at Ashley.    The glop hits her int he
chest, carries her backward.    Glues her to the wall.


INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

Chris finishes   dressing. He faces Sam. There is an odd
moment as they   find themselves standing close. If the
circumstances   were different they'd probably end up
kissing. And    then they hear ASHLEY'S bloodcurdling
SCREAM.

                                                     58.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Mike pops out of his door. Sam and Chris run down the
hallway. Sam yanks open the door to Ashley's room.


INT. ASHLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Sam, Chris and Mike stand in the doorway staring at a
giant spider menacing Ashley. The spitter fires another
webby blast, sticking the girl's legs to the wall.

                         MIKE
          Wow!   A scytodes spitter!

Chris pushes past Sam and Mike. He grabs a chair and
shoves it at the spitter like a lion tamer. The spider
backs off. Sam takes off running down the hallway.

                        ASHLEY
          Where are you going?


INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Sam runs up to find a gun case. She tries to get a
shotgun, but finds it locked. She doesn't have the key.
Sam grabs objects in the room and smashes the gun rack to
pieces.


INT. ASHLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Chris has the chair in one hand to fend off the spider.
With the other hand he tries to get Ashley out of the
webbing. Mike stands nearby reading from his Cassiopeia.

                        MIKE
          The scytodes spits a gooey
          discharge to immobilize their
          prey.

                         ASHLEY
          No shit!

The spider hits Chris's chair with a blast of webbing.
The chair is blown from his hand, and stuck to the wall.
Chris stands weaponless before the spider.

                        ASHLEY
          Use my stun g...

Ashley is nailed in the face with another blast of goo.
Mouth sealed shut. Chris reaches under the bed and
pushes it over on to the spitter. The spider leaps clear
onto the wall.

                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                       59.

                    (reads)
             Watch its fangs! The spitter's
             fangs move from side to side as it
             fires!

                           CHRIS
             I'll keep that in mind.

Chris grabs the spitter from behind and drags it off the
wall. The spider turns to fight. Chris wrestles it to
the ground. He sees the fangs begin to move from side to
side and rolls clear of a point-blank web shot.


INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Sam takes a purposeful step back and launches a spinning
roundhouse kick that snaps the shotgun out of its
binding. She grabs the bang stick and runs from the
room.


INT. ASHLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Chris puts himself between Ashley and the spider. He
looks for a weapon. Lunges for the scissors, but the
spitter nails him with a blast of glue. Chris is flung
across the room and stuck to the wall by the sleeve of
his shirt. He shrugs out of it and makes another grab
for his scissors. He gets them.

                           MIKE
             Get under it! Stab it in the
             abdomen! They don't have any
             armor down there!

                           CHRIS
             How am I supposed to do that!?

The spider leaps at Chris... and EXPLODES in midair.
Bits of gore shower Chris. He stands to see Sam in the
door with her shotgun. Chris is covered in spider guts.

                           CHRIS
             I'm gonna need some new pants.


INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Sam finishes loading new shells into her shotgun and then
pops a fresh clip into her 9mm. Chris comes out of the
garage wearing clean clothes. Sam chucks him the pistol.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                             60.

                           SAM
             Ever used one of these?

                           CHRIS
             I'm a fast learner.

Chris tries to put the gun in his pocket. And then his
waistband. But these damn pants are too tight.

Ashley uses scissors to cut web out of her hair.

                           MIKE
             I told you! I told you all!     But
             nobody ever listens to Mike!
             Still think I'm crazy, Mom?

                           SAM
             I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

Ashley is about to hyperventilate.

                           SAM
             Calm down, baby.

                           ASHLEY
             There aren't enough wine coolers
             in the world to calm me down!

                           SAM
             I won't let anything happen to
             you.

Sam ka-chacks a fresh round into her shotgun.

                           CHRIS
             What other spiders did Joshua
             have?

                           MIKE
             Spitters, jumpers, orb weavers,

             Why couldn't he keep goldfish like
             a normal person?

Sam checks the phone.     It's dead.

                           SAM
             We need to warn people.

                           CHRIS

             Outside?    You want to go outside?


EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - PALMER HOUSE- NIGHT

Chris and Sam open the front door of the house.          Sam
looks one way. Chris the other.

No giant spiders lurking about. Chris and Sam continue
onto the lawn. Mike and Ashley watch from the safety of
the doorway. They listen to the comforting SOUNDS OF a
SUMMER NIGHT.

                             SAM
             It's okay...

Mike and Ashley move out of the doorway.          Joining the
adults. They move toward the cop car.


EXT. STREETS (TOWN) - NIGHT

The cop car cruises. The occupants peer out the windows.
Everything appears normal. Although no people are
visible.


EXT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - NIGHT

Sam, Chris, and the kids move away from the cop car to
the door. They are at the far end of town. All appears
to be normal.


INT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - NIGHT

Harlan is broadcasting.

                           HARLAN
             ... I'm saying the invasion has
             already occurred. The aliens are
             among us. But they've taken
             common forms. They hide in plain
             sight.

Harlan is startled as Sam and the others enter with guns.

                           SAM
             We need to make an emergency
             broadcast.

             Giant spider invasion.

Harlan's jaw drops.    Sam takes the microphone.

                           CHRIS
             What are you going to say?   You
             can't tell them the truth.

EXT. STREET (TOWN) - NIGHT

             A pack of rabid coyotes is loose
             in town.

Wolf spiders crawl across rooftops. Spitters scale
buildings Tarantulas lurk in the shadows. Jumpers
scuttle out of the mineshafts. Trapdoors prepare their
burrows.


INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

This funky old couple relaxes in their LaZee-Boys.

                           SAM (V.O.)
             They are extremely dangerous.

The forelegs of a tarantula reach over the top of the
man's recliner, yanking him clean out. The woman is
oblivious as her husband is dragged away across the
floor.


EXT. HANK AND EMMA'S HOME - NIGHT

Emma bursts out of the front door, screaming
hysterically. Hank is behind her with the SawzAll. A
wolf spider crawls after them from inside the house.

                           SAM (V.O.)
             Arm yourselves with any weapons
             you can find.

Hank raises the saw, overextending the power cable.   He
loses power. Drops the saw and runs for his life.

                                                        63.

INT. BARBERSHOP - NIGHT

Floyd and Leroy use brooms to fend off several wolf
spiders.

          Stay together and head for the
          mall.


INT. DINER - NIGHT

A spider eats the chef. The waitress roller-skates away
from an arachnid. She jumps through the window into the
street.


EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

A family piles into their mini-van. Oblivious to the
jumper hiding in the "way back." They close the door and
drive off.


INT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - NIGHT

Harlan has donned a vintage football helmet and pads.

                          CHRIS
          The mall?

                        SAM
          The walls are concrete and the
          exits have steel gates. We could
          hold an entire army of giant
          spiders from inside.

                        ASHLEY
          You just said giant spider on the
          air.

Sam sees the microphone is keyed.

                        HARLAN
          Now that's great radio!

                        SAM
          Not giant spiders!      I meant to
          say...

Harlan notices long spider legs passing the window.

EXT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - NIGHT

Sam and the    others spill out of the trailer. They head
for the cop    car. As they get closer, a wolf spider
climbs onto    the car's roof and gnaws on the light bar.
Sam raises    her gun to blast it.

                        MIKE
          Wait, Mom! The noise will attract
          more of them!

                        CHRIS
          Let's try for the mall.

Sam leads the others toward town.


EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT

Chris and Sam hang onto the panicked kids. Harlan brings
up the rear. The place is chaos. People are chased by
spiders. Dragged by spiders. Killed by spiders. Eaten
by spiders.

                        CHRIS
          My truck's at the museum.

                           SAM
          Your keys?

                        CHRIS
          In my other pants.

                           MIKE
          Look out!

The group flees a trio of goo-firing spitters.    Suddenly
a familiar mini-van races past.

                          HARLAN
          Stop!    Take us with you!

Harlan tries to flag down the speeding ride but sees...

The van's occupants are locked in combat with a jumper.
The beast is inside their vehicle and tearing them to
pieces. The van crashes.


EXT. POWER LINES (MAIN STREET, TOWN) - NIGHT

A group of orb weavers scurry across power lines. They
hit a transformer, shorting it out. The entire town is
suddenly plunged into darkness. Headlights. GUNFIRE.
Moonlight. Spotty illumination for the arachnids'
feeding frenzy.

                                                          65.

EXT. ALLEY (TOWN) - NIGHT

A dumpster. The lid rises slightly. Wade Hale peers out
from within. He lifts the lid higher, oblivious to the
wolf spider on top of it. The spider reaches down at
him.

                            WADE
          No!     Please!

The spider is suddenly BLOWN AWAY by Sam and Chris.      Wade
climbs out of the dumpster.

                            WADE
          Thank you!

Chris and Sam move on with the kids. Wade runs after
them. Mike looks at garbage-covered Wade.

                            MIKE
          You stink.

                        WADE
                 (to Ashley)
          Have you seen Bret?

                        ASHLEY
          He was out at the dunes.

                          SAM
          Go ahead.    I've got your butt.

                            CHRIS
          What?

                          SAM
          Your back!    I've got your back!

Chris gives Sam a funny look.       Maybe Gladys was right...


EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT

Sam leads her group down toward the mall. Other groups
of survivors do likewise. As they get closer to the mall
the groups coalesce into one large pack. We recognize
Deputy Pete. Fireman Travis. The roller-skating
waitress. Floyd. Leroy. Hank. Emma. And many other
locals.


EXT. DESERT (NEAR MALL) - NIGHT

Sam and Chris are at the front of the mob with their
kids.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                            66.

CONTINUED:

Suddenly a trapdoor spider pops out of the ground. It
grabs Travis the fire chief, and pulls him under, quickly
replacing the roof of its den. TRAVIS SCREAMS
underground.

                             MIKE
             Trapdoors!    They're all around us!

                           SAM
             How can we spot them?

Mike consults his Cassiopeia.

                           MIKE
             I didn't download that part!

                             ASHLEY
             You dork!

The group wheels at the MUFFLED SOUNDS. They see
nothing. They hear another MUFFLED SCREAM, and the top
of the spider's den pops up. Travis drags himself out of
it.

                           TRAVIS
             Help... me... please...

He is dragged back underground.

The group continues toward the mall entrance. Suddenly a
gun-toting hunter is grabbed by a trapdoor. He goes
cyclic, madly FIRING his GUN into the air as he's dragged
under.

More beasts rise out of their dens.       Reaching for the
humans.

                             CHRIS
             Keep going!

Chris and the others flee toward the mall.          Some of them
SHOOT at the spiders as they run.

Leroy is grabbed by a trapdoor. Floyd tries to help but
the spider plunges its fangs into poor Leroy, dragging
him under.

The group clears the trapdoor minefield. But some of the
spiders have vacated their dens and are coming after
them.

                                                       67.

EXT. MALL ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Chris and Sam and the kids lead just fifteen other
survivors to the glass doors. The doors are locked.
Wade pulls out a ring of fifty keys and fumbles with them
desperately.

                        ASHLEY
          There's someone inside!

The group sees Norman the dope dealer janitor approaching
out of the gloom. He's staring at them all curiously.

                          NORMAN
          We're closed.

Sam points her gun at him.   Norman raise his hands in
shock.

                        NORMAN
          Wait! I have a prescription!
          It's for my glaucoma!

                        SAM
          Open this goddamn door!

                          NORMAN
          Yes, ma'am.

Norman unlocks the door and lets the group in.


INT. MALL - NIGHT

The survivors hustle inside. They lock the glass doors
behind them. The spiders are still coming.

                        MIKE
          Get away from the doors!

                        NORMAN
          Be cool, little dude.     They're
          locked.

                        MIKE
          Glass won't stop them!

The spiders begin smashing through the glass doors.
Chris and Sam SHOOT to keep them back. People flee into
the mall.

                          SAM
          The gates!    Close the gates!

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                        68.

CONTINUED:

Wade and Norman proceed to lower the slotted steel
security gates. Only problem is: Sam and Chris are on
the other side.

                           ASHLEY
             Mom!

                           MIKE
             Hurry up!

Sam and Chris see the gate coming down. They run for it
and slide underneath just as the gate comes down. A
massive trapdoor slams up against the metal. But the
metal holds.

                           SAM
             Shut the other entrances!

Norman and Chris run toward the opposite end of the mall.


INT. MALL - SOUTH ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Chris and Norman arrive. Spiders are SMASHING through
the GLASS. Chris and Norman bring the gate down. They
back away as more spiders slam against the steel.

                           NORMAN
             Trick or treat.

Chris and Norman head back to join the others.   They
find...


INT. HOME AND GARDEN STORE (MALL) - NIGHT

The survivors gather makeshift weapons. Floyd take a
chainsaw off the wall. Norman practices swinging a heavy
sledgehammer, accidentally toppling a stack of paint
cans. Hank stands before a display of circular buzz
saws.

Chris goes to where Sam doles out the few firearms.

                           CHRIS
             We're sealed up at both ends.

Sam hands Chris a shotgun.    He tries to get the feel of
it.

                           SAM
             You pump the slide to jack in a
             fresh round. Point at your target
             and squeeze.

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                          69.

CONTINUED:

Chris tries it out, pumping the slide. A shell flies out
the slide of the weapon and hits Wade in the head.

                           WADE
             Watch it!

                           CHRIS
             Like that?

Sam shakes her head and takes the gun back.       She pulls a
machete off the wall and hands it to Chris.

                           SAM
             Try not to cut yourself.


INT. MALL - NIGHT

The place has the feeling of a fortress under a siege.
Separate groups of townspeople are stationed at the
entrances to watch the spiders' every move.


INT. MALL - NORTH ENTRANCE - NIGHT

                           WADE
             Why didn't we see them earlier?

                           MIKE
             For the last time! They can't
             handle the sunlight. They were
             waiting in the mines for the sun
             to go down!

                           CHRIS
             Then at daybreak they'll go back
             inside. We can walk out the front
             door.

                           MIKE
             We won't make it that long.

                           ASHLEY
             They're gonna come in after us?

                           MIKE
             They're growing very fast. They
             need food to sustain that kind of
             development.

                           HANK
             Someone should go out and get
             help.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                           70.

CONTINUED:

                             EMMA
             You go, Sam.

                             SAM
             Me?

                           WADE
             You're the sheriff.

                           SAM
             I don't have that many handcuffs.

                           PETE
             What about the police radio?

                           SAM
             You're not goin' back out there,
             Pete. None of us are.

                           CHRIS
             Radio Shack is full of cell
             phones.

                           WADE
             But the signal won't get out of
             the valley. That's why we
             couldn't sell any of the damn
             things.

                             HARLAN
             My antenna...

The group looks up. The moon-cast shadow of the antenna
is visible on the skylights that run the length of the
mall.

                           HARLAN
             I could climb up to the top. I
             bet I could get a signal out.

                             WADE
             Great idea.    You should do that.

                           CHRIS
             I'll cover you, Harlan.


INT. MALL - NIGHT

Wade leads Chris and Harlan toward an access door. Sam
stands with her kids. Watching. Chris looks over his
shoulder for one last look. Sam runs up to him, gives
him the shotgun.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                          71.

CONTINUED:

                           SAM
             Are you sure you can handle this?

                           CHRIS
                    (re: pants)
             While I'm gone, do you think you
             could find me a size 32?

                           SAM
             I'll do my best.
                    (a beat)
             Uhh... Do you want to go out
             sometime?  Dinner? Maybe a movie?

Chris takes her in his arms and plants a kiss on her
lips.

Wade holds open the nearby access door.

                           WADE
             Hey, loverboy... you've got a town
             to save.

Chris and Harlan head out. Sam watches them disappear
through the door and then returns to the survivors.

                           ASHLEY
             You're not really going to get him
             bigger pants are you?

                           SAM
             No way.


INT. MALL - ACCESS STAIRS - NIGHT

Wade leads Chris and Harlan up a tight staircase. The
door at the top is identified as "Roof Access." Wade
reaches the door. The others bunch up behind him.

                           CHRIS
             Don't even think about locking
             this door.

                           WADE
             I'll be right here waiting.

Wade slowly opens the roof door.


EXT. MALL - ROOF - NIGHT

Chris and Harlan step onto the roof with their gear.       No
sign of any spiders.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          72.

CONTINUED:

Wade closes the door behind them and locks it.       Chris and
Harlan aren't happy to hear that LOCK TURN.

They sneak across the roof toward the base of the
antenna.

                           CHRIS
             It looks clear.

Harlan starts climbing. Chris stands guard at the
bottom. Neither of them sees the horde of spiders
climbing up the side of the building toward the roof.


INT. VICTORIA'S SECRET - MALL - NIGHT

Mike collects perfume. Packing it into his pockets like
grenades. Ashley is nearby, checking out the lingerie.

                           ASHLEY
             I didn't know you wore cologne.

                            MIKE
             I don't.   It's spider repellent.

Sam steps in through the door.

                           SAM
             Let's stay together, guys.

                           ASHLEY
                    (holds up a teddy)
             Can I get this?

                            SAM
             Move it!

The kids run out to join their mom.       After they go...

The grill of an air vent is pushed open. A huge spitting
spider pushes its way through. Dropping to the floor.
Another spider follows.


EXT. MALL - ROOF - ANTENNA - NIGHT

Harlan is high up on the antenna. He has a cell phone in
hand. It still indicates: "NO SERVICE." He keeps
climbing.


EXT. MALL - ROOF - NIGHT

Chris sees spiders flood onto the roof.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                           73.

CONTINUED:

                           CHRIS
             We've got company!

He tries to COCK the SHOTGUN.        Ejecting a shell out the
side.

                           CHRIS
             This always looks so easy on TV!

Chris gets it figured out just in time to BLAST an
attacking spider. He fades back toward the antenna.
SHOOTING.


EXT. MALL - ROOF - ANTENNA - NIGHT

Harlan checks the phone.

                           HARLAN
             I've got a signal!

He dials 911.


EXT. MALL - ROOF - NIGHT

Chris is surrounded by spiders.        He starts climbing up
the antenna.

                           CHRIS
             They're coming!


EXT. MALL - ROOF - ANTENNA - NIGHT

Harlan is on the phone.       He hears...

                              OPERATOR (V.O.)
             911 Emergency.

                           HARLAN

             Nevada! We're being attacked by
             giant spiders! The entire town
             has been overrun!

Chris yells up to him.

                            CHRIS
             No!   Don't say that!

                           OPERATOR (V.O.)
             This is Emergency Services. Not

CONTINUED:

CLICK. The LINE GOES DEAD. Chris climbs up beside him.
He FIRES several BLASTS at the approaching spiders.

                              CHRIS
             What happened?

                           HARLAN
             They didn't believe me!

                              CHRIS
             What a shock!     Try again!

The spiders are closing in as Harlan re-dials.

             911 Emergency.

             There was a massive explosion!
             Everybody's dead!

                           OPERATOR (V.O.)
             Sir, your number has been flagged
             as a source of a crank call. I'm
             afraid I must terminate this
             conversation.

CLICK.

                           HARLAN
             She hung up on me!

                              CHRIS
             Climb!

Chris FIRES the SHOTGUN.       The spiders are closing in.


INT. MALL - NIGHT

Sam gazes up at the skylight. She can see the silhouette
of Chris and Harlan climbing the antenna. Pursued by
spiders.

                              SAM
                    (sotto)
             Oh my God...

Ashley screams in horror nearby.

                           ASHLEY
             They're inside!

                                                 (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

Sam whirls to see Ashley pointing at several spiders
coming out of Victoria's Secret. Sam runs over to fight
them.

                             WADE
             Over here!

He faces off against more spiders coming through the Home
and Garden store.


EXT. MALL - ROOF - ANTENNA - NIGHT

Harlan is at the top. Chris is a bit lower. The spiders
are still coming. Chris SHOOTS at them. His GUN RUNS
DRY. He flips it around and butt-strokes an approaching
arac.

A spider fires a web at Harlan.       Nails the poor guy.   And
drags him off the antenna.

Harlan falls off the antenna, back toward the spiders.
Chris reaches out and grabs him. Holding Harlan's hand.

                             CHRIS
             I've got you!

Harlan makes eye-contact with Chris.       They're both about
to be killed unless...

                           HARLAN
             Defend the human race!

                             CHRIS
             No!

Harlan jerks away from Chris's hand. He cannonballs down
into the horde of spiders. Splattering several of the
beasts along with himself.

Chris throws the useless shotgun at an approaching arac
and climbs even higher. He pulls out his machete and
begins hacking at the guide-wires that hold the antenna
upright.

The spiders close in. Chris slices one wire. The
antenna quivers. Chris slices another wire. The antenna
shakes.


INT. MALL - NIGHT

Deputy Pete is standing with Sam and the kids when he's
jerked off his feet and hauled into the maw of an
arachnid.

                               SAM
             Ashley!   Mike!

She sees Mike and Ashley avoid an arac by taking refuge
inside the tunnels of the jungle gym.

Sam FIRES the GUNS like Annie Oakley, putting spiders
down left and right, trying to reach her kids.

Floyd the barber confronts a spider with his chain-saw.

                           FLOYD
             Having a bad hair day?!

The spider charges.     Floyd slices its legs off.

                           FLOYD
             How about a little off the top!

He slices another arac.


EXT. MALL - ROOF - ANTENNA - NIGHT

Chris dodges a spider's webline.       Several more come at
him.

                           CHRIS
             You're going down!

Chris cuts the last wire and hikes out over the skylight.
The antenna keels over. Chris hangs tight as he drops
toward the glass.


INT. MALL - NIGHT

Sam looks up to   see Chris come crashing down through the
skylight on the   antenna. The antenna tilts in at a sixty
degree angle.    Chris hangs off the end. Orb weavers ride
their weblines   down to the floor of the mall.

Mike peeks out from the top of the jungle gym. He sees a
hundred spiders coming in on webs. Flooding out of the
stores. The devil-spawned monsters are everywhere!

                               MIKE
             Arac attack!

Chris leaps from the antenna to a nearby web. He slides
down it like a pole, squashing the orb weaver at the
bottom. Sam runs to his side.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                      77.

                           SAM
             Did you get help?!    Is anybody
             coming!?

                           CHRIS
             We're on our own!

Sam tosses him a gun and they head toward the jungle gym.

The waitress roller-skates away from the spiders. She
slaloms clear of several spitters. But gets tackled by a
jumper.


INT. MALL - JUNGLE GYM

Ashley and Mike are hiding.

                           ASHLEY
             I can't stay in here!

Ashley starts to move out   of the tube. She discovers the
end has been covered with   web. She pushes it. Something
on the other side pushes   back. Ashley scrambles back.
Mike is already moving.    The kids flee through the tubes
to get away.

                           ASHLEY
             What are they doing?

                           MIKE
                    (checks Cassiopeia)
             They're trapping us like ants in a
             log! Once they have all the exits
             blocked, they'll come in through
             the last one!

They see a way out, head for that exit, only to find a
spider coming through it. Mike tosses one of his perfume
grenades at the spider, covering their retreat.

Another spider comes after them through one of the tubes.
Mike chucks another perfume bottle. The spider cowers.

                           MIKE
             We've gotta go!

Ashley finds a hole that leads to the slide.

                           ASHLEY
             Here!

She starts down with Mike close behind. A large spider
looms at the end. Ashley tries to arrest her slide. But
it's no use. At the last second Sam's boot kicks the
arachnid clear.

                                                       78.

INT. MALL - NIGHT

Ashley and Mike pour out of the slide. Chris and Sam
finish off the spider and then run with the kids.

Emma runs parallel to them across the playground's
sandbox. Only to be yanked under by a trapdoor spider.

Hank sees this and goes after the spiders with all his
tools. Getting revenge with a nail gun in each hand.

                        HANK
          It's tool time!

Floyd is still going crazy, slicing spiders with his
chain-saw, he lets out a victorious yell until a hungry
spider descends on him from above and knocks him to the
floor.

Chris passes a clothing store displaying Levi 501s.    He
stops for a moment to look at the jeans.

                        SAM (O.S.)
          Chris!

Chris continues on.

All of the survivors meet in the middle of the mall and
prepare for Custer's last stand. Spiders charge from all
directions.

Mike throws his perfume grenades. Sam and Chris SHOOT.
Others use their make-shift weapons.

Norman pulls out a joint and sparks it.    Mike sees this
and gets an idea.

                        MIKE
          Where do you grow your weed?!

                        NORMAN
          Dude, if I tell you, I have to
          kill you.

Norman takes a hit on his reefer.

                        MIKE
          They're going to kill us, you
          stoner!

Norman sees the army of spiders closing in.

                        NORMAN
          Over here!

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                           79.

CONTINUED:

Norman opens    an access door. Sam and the other survivors
run over and    crowd through it. Norman shuts the door
behind them.     The groups of pursuing spiders collide and
begin ripping    each other to pieces in a feeding frenzy.


INT. MALL - ACCESS STAIRS - NIGHT

Norman leads the survivors down the tight hallway.

                           WADE
             Where are you taking us?

                              NORMAN
             To Shangri-la.


INT. MALL - BASEMENT POT ROOM - NIGHT

Norman leads the survivors into a basement room full of
pot paraphernalia. Hookahs. Weed growing in hydroponic
units under battery powered lights. Psychedelic posters.

                           NORMAN
             You aren't going to arrest me for
             this are you?

                              SAM
             Not today.

The group can hear SPIDERS BASHING at the upstairs door.

                           WADE
                    (to Norman)
             Oh great! Now you've trapped us!

Chris moves to the bottom of the stairs.

                           CHRIS
             We should be able to hold them off
             for a little while.

Suddenly a loud BANGING ERUPTS on the wall behind them.

                           ASHLEY
             They're coming through the wall!

The group tightens up. Back to back. Ready for the end.
Suddenly a human hand punches through the wall.

                              CHRIS
             What the hell?

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                      80.

CONTINUED:

Bret Hale rips through the drywall. Filthy but alive.
Standing in a horizontal mine shaft. He sees Sam's gun
pointed right at him.

                           BRET
             I didn't touch her!     I swear!

Sam looks at Ashley.

                           ASHLEY
             Don't waste your bullets.

Wade embraces his son.

                           WADE
             I thought you were a goner, boy!

Chris steps to the opening for a closer look at the mine.

                           CHRIS
             We can get out this way!

                           ASHLEY
             Aren't the spiders in there?

                           MIKE
             Not until daylight.

The BANGING on the upper door gets more INTENSE.

Norman grabs a flashlight and a bunch of battery powered
grow lights from his weed farm. He passes them out to
the group.

Chris takes the flashlight and leads the way into the
mine shaft. Bret is shocked as the others follow him.
The group uses the grow lights, and flashlights.

                           BRET
             You're going back in there?!       Are
             you all crazy!?

                              WADE
             Come on, Bret!

                            BRET
             No way!   I'm not going!

Bret is alone in the room as the upper DOOR IMPLODES and
spiders flood downstairs. Bret dives through the
opening.

                                                     81.

INT. MINE TUNNEL - NIGHT

Bret runs past Sam and Chris. Sam FIRES her SHOTGUN at
the first spider that enters the tunnel. Her GUN CLICKS
DRY. She un-holsters her PISTOLS and FIRES.

                           CHRIS
          Cover me!

                        SAM
          What are you going to do?!

Chris uses the machete to cleave into the tunnel's upper
support beam. More spiders come into the tunnel. Sam
FIRES desperately. Chris keeps on hacking.

                           SAM
          Hurry!

Sam's GUNS CLICK DRY. Spiders charge. Chris swings the
machete hard. The ROOF COLLAPSES onto the attacking
spiders.

Chris and Sam leap back. Landing in a heap. Clouds of
dust swirl around them. They are tangled up for an
awkward beat. Their faces just inches from each other...

                        SAM
          Hold that thought.

They manage to disengage and move on.


INT. MINE TUNNEL - NIGHT

Chris and Sam move toward the bobbing lights of the few
remaining survivors.

                        WADE
          We're trapped again!

                        CHRIS
          At least they can't follow us.

                        SAM
          Which way do we go?

                        CHRIS
          I think we're in one of the old
          tunnels.

                        SAM
          Can you get us out of here?

                        CHRIS
          Don't worry, Sam.

Chris takes point with the others following nervously.

                                                       82.

INT. MINES - JUNCTION - NIGHT

A boarded-up shaft entrance. Suddenly the WOOD
SPLINTERS. Chris and the others bash through. They file
into a slightly more open area with two branching
tunnels. The place is stacked from floor to ceiling with
barrels of toxic waste.

                        CHRIS
          I don't believe it...

Mike recognizes the BioHazard warning label he saw on the
barrel in the drainage ditch.

                        MIKE
          I've seen one of these before!

                           ASHLEY
          What are they?

                           CHRIS
          Toxic waste.

                        SAM
          Where did you see it, Mike?

                        MIKE
          The creek where Joshua gets his
          spider food. There was one in the
          water.

Chris starts toward the sloping tunnel.

                        CHRIS
          We can get out this way!

                        BRET
          No, we can't.
                 (turns to Wade)
          Isn't that tunnel blocked off,
          Dad?

Chris and the others look at Wade.

                        WADE
          Uh... yeah... he's right.   We
          can't get out that way.

                           CHRIS
          You did this?

                        WADE
          I knew you'd never sell... We're
          under my property so...

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                          83.

CONTINUED:

                           SAM
             You put all of us at risk.

                           WADE
             I didn't have a choice! I was
             broke! They gave me a hundred
             grand!

Sam punches him.     Knocking Wade to the ground.

                           SAM
             I think our lives are worth a
             little more than that.

                           CHRIS
             We're wasting time.

Chris heads toward the only exit available. The others
follow. Wade staggers to his feet. Stumbling after
them.


INT. MINE TUNNEL - NIGHT

Chris leads the group down a tunnel. They come across
bits of vintage mining gear. A string of old light bulbs
runs along the roof into both tunnels.

                           CHRIS
             One end of these lights should be
             connected to a generator. That'll
             be near the entrance.

They continue down the tunnel.     Entering...


INT. MINES - TARANTULA DEN - NIGHT

A large cavern. Animal carcasses litter the ground.
Some human remains. Dead pets. Dead ostriches.

                           WADE
             My birds! You see, Sam? I wasn't
             lying! That's what I can put on
             the insurance form... giant
             spiders!

                           ASHLEY
             Ewww... what's that smell?

The others are reacting strongly.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          84.

                            CHRIS
             Methane.   This cavern is full of
             gas.

                           ASHLEY
             What does that mean?

                           CHRIS
             One spark and we're all dead.

Norman swallows his glowing joint.

Chris shines his flashlight on a pile of mummy bundles.

                           MIKE
             That's what I was talking about,
             Chris. Presents from the male
             tarantula to the female.

                           BRET
             So the female's around here?

Bret looks around nervously.

The group moves closer. They sine their lights on a
horrifying sight. Joshua's corpse is a deflated flesh
balloon. Yellowed teeth sneer from a shattered skull.
He's completely desiccated. Every ounce of liquid
drained away.

Mike hides his eyes.     Ashley comforts him.

                           SAM
             That one just moved!

Chris runs over and slices it open with his machete.       The
web comes away to reveal a human hand.

                           CHRIS
             There's somebody in here!

Chris cuts away more web as the other survivors help.
They finally reveal Gladys.

                            CHRIS
             Gladys!

The woman's body begins to spasm.

                           CHRIS
             Gladys, please...
                    (to the others)
             Can anybody help her?!

                                                 (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

Suddenly Ashley pushes her way forward.

                           ASHLEY
             Her breathing is shallow.       She's
             going into arrest.

Ashley proceeds with CPR. Just like she saw on TV.
Suddenly Gladys snaps out of it. Gasping for air.

                             CHRIS
             It's okay.    It's okay.

Gladys starts to get a grip. Trying to focus on Chris.
From this angle Chris look like he has a golden halo.

                             GLADYS
             Am I... dead?

                             CHRIS
             You're okay.

                           GLADYS
             I'm not in heaven?

                             CHRIS
             No...

                           GLADYS
             Then what's with all the gold?

Gladys points behind Chris's head to the wall of the
cavern. The group turns their lights on it. The
reflection is dazzling. Veins of gold criss-cross the
cavern walls.

                             WADE
             Gold! Gold!     Look!    It's
             everywhere!

                             SAM
             Is it real?

Chris checks it out.

                           CHRIS
             Jesus... it's the mother lode...
             He was right. My dad was right...

Chris helps Gladys to her feet.         They share an emotional
look of recognition.

                             GLADYS
             So were you.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

Wade chips away at the gold.

                           WADE
             Get as much as you can!

Bret looks at Ashley.

                           BRET
             Nice work, Doc.

Ashley acknowledges him. Bret chips gold with Wade.           Sam
puts her hand on Ashley's shoulder.

                           SAM
             You saved my life.

Ashley smiles.

Gladys leans over to Norman.

                           GLADYS
             Have you got a smoke, kid?

                           NORMAN
             The man says this cavern is full
             of highly flammable methane gas.
             I smoke to get high, not to die.

                           SAM
             Spiders!

The group sees a cluster of normal-sized tarantulas
scuttling out of the shadows.

                           NORMAN
             What's the big deal?

Norman steps on the closest one, grinding it under his
boot. He stomps around, crushing as many as he can.
Mike watches this curiously. Taking a look at one of the
squashed bodies.

                           MIKE
             I think you should stop.

                           NORMAN
             Why?

                        MIKE
          They don't have hair. They aren't
          fully grown tarantulas.

Chris and Sam look over.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                           MIKE
             They're giant babies!

Norman freezes. He hears SOMETHING MOVING around in the
dark. And then a spine chilling... GROWL.

Chris reacts to the noise.    He can guess what's coming...

The FEMALE TARANTULA steps out of the shadows. Consuela
has grown to be as big as a Volkswagen MicroBus. By far
the largest spider we've seen yet. Covered in hair.
Massive eyes. Her two fangs are the size of machetes.

Mike's eyes go wide at the sight of his old nemesis.

                           MIKE
             Consuela.

                           CHRIS
             Consuela?

The fur on Consuela's back seems to undulate. There is
something weird there. A lot of weird things. In
fact... her entire back is littered with hundreds of baby
tarantulas.

As Consuela advances, she flicks several dart-sized
quills off her belly right into Norman. A dark stain
spreads across the drug dealer's shirt.

                           NORMAN
             Bummer...

Consuela pierces Norman with her fangs, holding him
tight. Babies flood of her back and onto the doper,
chewing him to pieces like ravenous piranhas.

                           CHRIS
             Go!

The group flees toward the opposite end of the cavern.        A
male tarantula drops down to block their escape. Sam
BLOWS it away. Wade and Bret are still chipping away
bits of gold.

                           CHRIS
             Leave it!

                           WADE
             So you can keep it all!?   Hell no!

Wade gets a nugget off the wall. He only has a
nanosecond to admire it before Consuela suddenly looms
behind him.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                          88.

CONTINUED:

                              BRET
             Dad!

Bret reaches out toward his father. Wade reaches for
him. Consuela's fangs suddenly protrude from Wade's
chest and he's hauled backward. The tarantula flings
Wade into the cave.

                              CHRIS
             Bret, come on!

Bret runs after the others. But he sees Consuela firing
more quills at the group. Directly at Ashley. Bret
leaps into harm's way. He's turned into a pin cushion.

                              ASHLEY
             Bret!

Ashley goes to his side.

                              BRET
             I'm sorry I...

Bret dies.     Sam drags Ashley away from him.


INT. MINES - NIGHT

The survivors flee along the tunnel. Chris jumps up to
rip down the string of light bulbs from the ceiling.

                           SAM
             We have to get out!

                           CHRIS
             This is our chance to kill them
             all.

Chris smashes the bulb at the end of the strand.

                           CHRIS
             When the power comes on, the bulb
             will ignite the methane and torch
             them!

                           SAM
             Where did you get an idea like
             that!?

Chris looks at Gladys.

                           GLADYS
             I blew up the kitchen.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                           CHRIS
             Keep going up the tunnel. There
             should be a generator at the exit.
             Start it up and await for my
             signal to throw the switch.

                           SAM
             And the toxic waste...

                           CHRIS
             Will be buried under tons of rock!
             Go!

                           SAM
             What about you?

                           CHRIS
             I need to set the fuse as close to
             the spiders as I can. That should
             give us time to get clear.

Sam and Chris share a brief beat. And then Chris pulls
down the lights, dragging them back toward the
tarantula's den.

                           SAM
             He has a cute butt.    Don't you
             think?

                           GLADYS
             U.S.D.A. choice.


INT. MINES - TARANTULA DEN - NIGHT

Chris comes through with his light bulb fuse. Consuela
and her babies are feasting on the bodies of Bret and
Wade Hale.

Chris finds a vent in the ground.       He sprinkles dust over
it to identify a faint draft.

                           CHRIS
             Bingo.

He positions the shattered light bulb beside this gas
jet.


INT. MINE TUNNELS - NIGHT

Mike helps Gladys up the tunnel. Sam and Ashley are
behind. Suddenly a male tarantula steps out of the
shadows, separating the groups.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                        90.

             Keep going!

Sam and Ashley flee down another tunnel.


INT. MINES - TARANTULA DEN - NIGHT

Chris finishes preparing the booby trap. He gets up to
leave. Only to find Consuela coming toward him.

                           CHRIS
             I hate spiders.

Chris runs out of the cavern.


INT. MINE TUNNEL - NIGHT

Chris bails out of the cavern and starts running.


INT. MINE TUNNELS - NIGHT

Sam and Ashley flee the male tarantula. Sam stumbles
over something on the ground. It's Bret Hale's lost
motorcycle. Ashley looks back and sees the tarantula
coming after them.

                           ASHLEY
             Hurry!

Sam lifts the MOTORCYCLE upright and climbs on. She
STARTS it and REVS the ENGINE. Ashley leaps aboard. Sam
accelerates along the shaft, away from the spider. The
bike's headlight illuminates their path.

The male tarantula scurries after the bike.

Sam rides the motorcycle along the shaft. Ashley hangs
on tight. They've put some distance between themselves
and the male tarantula. A dead-end looms before them.
Ashley screams as her mom stops on a dime and does a 180.

Sam rides back the way they came, heading straight toward
the male tarantula. Ashley looks over her mother's
shoulder at the giant spider coming in the opposite
direction.

                           ASHLEY
             Oh shit.

                                              (CONTINUED)

Sam lifts the bike into a wheelie as the tarantula nears.

                             SAM
             Banzai!

With perfect timing, she brings the front wheel down hard
onto the tarantula's back. Crunch! The spider is
roadkill. Sam steers them down another tunnel.


EXT. MINE TUNNEL EXIT - NEAR WADE'S RANCH - DAWN

Mike and Gladys gather at a generator just shy of the
tunnel exit. Mike tries to start the generator. It
won't catch.

                             MIKE
             It needs gas!

                           GLADYS
             There's a ranch!

Gladys heads over toward Wade's ranch.


INT. MINE TUNNEL - DAWN

Chris runs along the tunnel. Consuela charges after him,
Chris reaches up, smashing more light bulbs as he runs.


EXT. MINE TUNNEL EXIT - NEAR WADE'S RANCH - DAWN

Mike is at the generator as Sam and Ashley ride up on the
motorcycle.

                             MIKE
             It needs gas!

Sam tips over the motorcycle, trying to get gas out of
the tank. It's clear this is not going to work.

                             ASHLEY
             Hurry!


INT. MINE TUNNEL - DAWN

Chris runs.     Smashing light bulbs.   Consuela close
behind.

                           CHRIS
             Start the generator!

                                                     92.

          He's coming!

                          ASHLEY
          Hurry, Mom!

Sam has dumped some fuel into the generator.   She tries
to start it. It won't turn over.


INT. MINE TUNNEL - DAWN

Chris ducks as Consuela fires quills at him.   He keeps
going.


INT. MINE TUNNEL EXIT - DAWN

Sam sees Chris at the bottom of the tunnel. She tries to
start the generator again but it refuses to cooperate.

                        CHRIS
          Throw the switch!

                        SAM
          I don't have any power!

                          ASHLEY
          Yo, Mom!

Sam turns as Ashley throws her the STUN GUN. Sam catches
it and brings it down to the light bulb cable... ZAPPING
it.


INT. MINE TUNNEL - DAWN

As Chris runs, the light bulbs illuminate sequentially,
traveling past him into the cavern.


INT. MINE TUNNEL - DAWN

A broken light bulb sparks. The filament ignites the
gas-filled tunnel. A ball of flame spreads throughout
the mines.


INT. MINES - TARANTULA DEN - DAWN

A huge column of flame blasts into the chamber. All the
gold is illuminated. Consuela's babies are burned like
popcorn.

                                                           93.

EXT. MINE TUNNEL EXIT - NEAR WADE'S RANCH - DAY

Sam looks back to see Chris running toward her. Consuela
is on his heels. The glow of a fireball is right behind
them.

                          SAM
          Come on!

Chris looks over his shoulder at Consuela and the flames.

                          SAM
          Chris!

Chris makes it to Sam just ahead of the conflagration.


EXT. DESERT - NEAR WADE'S RANCH - DAY

Sam and Chris dive out of the mine opening. A pillar of
flame shoots out behind them.   Ashley and Mike are
nearby. The town is visible just a mile away.


EXT. TOWN - DAY

The spiders retreat from daylight. Scuttling back into
the buildings. Heading down into the mine shafts.


INT. VARIOUS MINE TUNNELS - DAY

The chain reaction spreads through the mines.      Jets of
flame blast up tunnels.

Torching any unlucky spiders looking for a home.
Rupturing the very earth around them.


EXT. DESERT - NEAR WADE'S RANCH - DAY

The EARTH BEGINS TO SHAKE VIOLENTLY.

                          ASHLEY
          Earthquake!

                        CHRIS
          No! It's a chain reaction! The
          whole valley is going to blow!

                        MIKE
          We'll never get out in time!

Gladys drives up in     Wade's humvee.   Cigar in mouth.

                           GLADYS
             Let's get the fuck out of here!

The survivors pile into the truck as the town begins to
BLOW UP in the distance.

Chris is just about to climb aboard when... A webline
shoots out of the nearby mine shaft. Consuela lives!
The spider is charred and bloody. But she's primed for
revenge.

Chris is yanked off his feet and hauled toward her.            He
fumbles for his machete and hacks at the webline.
Cutting himself free just before getting impaled on
Consuela's fangs.

Consuela knocks away Chris's machete and lunges down at
him. Chris kicks her belly with both his feet. Consuela
begins to shudder. Jagged cracks appear in her charred
carapace. Chris kicks and tears at the failing armor.
He thinks he's harming the tarantula, but he's actually
helping it!

Mike and the others watch from the humvee.

                           MIKE
             Oh no... she's molting!

Consuela's blistered shell cracks as she shrugs the
damaged skin away from her body. Chris is amazed to see
the spider has grown a full size larger and become
totally rejuvenated!

Consuela comes after Chris.        He defends himself with the
machete.

Shining steel makes contact with the dripping fangs.
Once again Consuela punts away the machete. She prepares
the death blow. It looks like curtains for Chris.

                               MIKE
             Consuela!   No!     Bad!   Bad
             Consuela!

The massive spider stops in shock.            Chris looks back to
see Mike has returned.


TARANTULA POV

The familiar multi-perspective spider vision.            The
tarantula seems to recognize Mike.

                                                       95.

BACK TO MIKE

He throws his Cassiopeia PDA at the spider's face...

Chris uses this moment of confusion to grab his machete
and drive it deep into the spider's unprotected
abdomen...

The tarantula screams.

Chris leaps up and runs, scooping up Mike.   They dive
into the back of the humvee.

Consuela tries to follow but is mortally wounded. She
collapses in the dust. The TOWN EXPLODES in the b.g.
The earth itself begins to collapse.


INT. HUMVEE - DRIVING ACROSS DESERT - DAY

Gladys accelerates as the town sinks in the distance.
BUILDINGS EXPLODE. Jets of flame burst upward. The mall
is sucked into the widening pit of collapsing earth. The
humvee is just a cart length ahead of a wave of crumbling
desert.


EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The humvee reaches open road. The survivors watch out
the back as Prosperity disappears into a massive
sinkhole.


EXT. HIGHWAY/INT. HUMVEE - MOVING - DAY

The group sits in a long beat of abject shock. And then
Chris looks down to see his tight pants have finally
ripped.

                        CHRIS
          I really need some pants that fit.

The group smiles.    Happy to be alive.

                          MIKE
          Look out!

Everyone looks to the road ahead. A familiar bunny
rabbit hops across the highway. Gladys HONKS and swerves
to avoid it.


EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The bunny gets clear as the humvee drives away toward
safety.

The rabbit continues its trek for a moment, and then is
grabbed by a large trap-door spider.

                                           FADE OUT.

               Suddenly we are hit by the loudest, booming, rolling concussion
               you have ever heard. The buildings begin to shake, swaying wildly.
               The Bonaventure Hotel implodes, collapses inward in the thudding,
               slamming freight train of an earthquake. The 4-level Interchange
               as the Santa Monica Freeway shatters, crumbles, pulling exit
               ramps, cars, trees, and nearby buildings with it.
               
               SEQUENCE OF RAPID CUTS
               
               Buildings shaking. Streets buckling. Cars rolling, crashing.
               People running. Gas mains exploding. Buildings convulsing and
               dropping like tinder against an inferno.
               
               THE SANTA MONICA PIER
               
               As the tsunami sweeps in from the ocean, smacking into the
               shoreline like the hammer of God, plunging us into darkness.

               terrifying figures climbs atop a mountain of debris. They raise
               their weapons into the night sky.

               A red line tracks along the mountainous areas surrounding the

               A Salesman with a chin-mike speaks non-stop, unintelligible
               Chinese. A frenzied crowd gathers around him, waving money,
               placing bets.
               
               Two men sit at either end of a long table. They are in deep
               shadows, facing each other. We only get glimpses of them: One fat.
               Mirrored sunglasses. Chinese. His fingers tap on the table. A
               cockroach scurries past. Ammo belts. A sheathed combat knife the
               size of your arm. .45 automatics in holsters.
               
               The other, dressed in black. An eye-patch. Dangerous. A flash of
               two six-guns in holsters. A futuristic gunfighter. The cockroach
               dashes past his fingers. WHAP! He squashes it.
               
               The crowd goes nuts, placing bets, yelling and screaming in a
               dozen languages.
               
               The salesman places three different shaped, clear shot glasses in
               front of the two men. Then he leans over to...
               
               A VAT OF POISONOUS SNAKES. He reaches in, grabs a cobra, pulls it
               out. The cobra hisses and squirms. Deftly, the salesman continues
               to talk non-stop into his chin-mike as he milks the cobra venom
               into the first glass.
               
               He pulls out an ice-pick, jabs it into the snake's throat, and
               bleeds a thick green-white liquid into the second glass. Finally,
               he slits open the cobra with a large knife, and cuts out the heart
               and liver. Tossing aside the dead snake, the salesman squeezes the
               heart and liver with his fingers. The juice drips into the third
               glass.
               
               Now the salesman stirs the glasses. The poison is clear. The blood
               is milky-green. The heart and liver are red. He places the glasses
               on the table between the two men.
               
               The two men stare at each other, motionless. The crowd continues
               placing bets at a fevered pitch. A titanium white tube floats
               above the center of the table. A laser beam of light shines from
               one end.
               
               The salesman leans over and flicks on side with his finger,
               sending the tube spinning on its axis like a bottle, the light
               circling the room before stopping on the fat man's forehead.
               
               The fat man reaches slowly toward the glasses. His hand shakes
               slightly. He hesitates. Finally he takes the glass with the red
               liquid (the heart and liver), lifts it to his lips, pauses, then
               gulps it down.
               
               The crowd explodes. More bets.
               
               The salesman leans over and spins the light tube again, this time
               it lands on something black, an eye-patch. Pull back to reveal a
               man with an eye-patch.
               
               The man with the eye-patch reaches forward, his hand paused
               between the remaining two glasses. He takes the one filled with
               milky-green blood and downs it fast. The crowd roars.
               
               One glass left. The two men stare at it intently.
               
               The salesman spins the light tube with more force than before. It
               circles again and again, slowing down, speeding up, finally
               stopping on the fat man.
               
               The salesman begins yelling over the din of the crowd, shouting at
               the fat man. The fat man reaches for the glass of clear poison.
               His trembling fingers hover above it. Then he quickly withdraws
               his hand.
               
               The crowd reacts, boos, as...
               
               The man with the eye-patch smiles. A slightly, cynical smile. And
               without hesitation, he reaches out, grabs the glass of poison, and
               drinks it down. The crowd surges forward, but the salesman stops
               them with a sweep of his arm. All bets are off.
               
               The two men stand from the table. Take several steps away toward
               the end of the alley. Stand facing each other. Two gunfighters.
               
               Flashes of the two men. A piece of a black military boot. A hand
               positioned over a six-shooter. Mirrored sunglasses. A sweaty,
               trembling lip. And the eye-patched man's one good eye, blue and
               clear, staring - hard and calm as a sunny day...
               
               The draw. It happens in an instant. The alley thunders with
               gunfire. The guns buck and flash. Then silence. The two men stand
               there for a beat, until one of them, the fat man, slumps, falls
               face first into the alley, dead.
               
               The crowd goes completely ape shit as SNAKE PLISSKEN emerges from
               the shadows of the alley, holsters his guns, grabs his take of the
               money...
               
               SNAKE PLISSKEN. Long hair. A black eye-patch. A tight-lipped
               grimace. The impression of coiled aggression and intense cynicism.
               The toughest, most dangerous man on planet earth. A legend.
               
               PLISSKEN strolls out of the alley into the crowd. He counts his
               money, pockets it, as a cigarette girl approaches him. PLISSKEN
               stops her, pays for a pack of cigs. As she eyes him...
               
               CLOSEUP OF PLISSKEN'S ARM
               
               ... the cigarette girl touches him, pricks his skin with her
               fingernail. A drop of blood appears.
               
               PLISSKEN turns, stares after her, as the sound of helicopters
               rises from above in the night sky. The crowd suddenly starts to
               disperse.
               
               Helicopter searchlights blast down on the street. PLISSKEN is
               suddenly caught in the glare. He starts to move away...
               
               KACLANG!
               
               Out of the blackness above a huge steel net drops out of nowhere.
               The net slams down on top of PLISSKEN, trapping him, driving him
               down to the pavement with its weight... PLISSKEN struggles inside
               the net as black figures - United States Police Force Officers -
               rush toward him, grab the net, tightening it. More cops move for
               him as we SLOWLY FADE TO BLACK...

               troops, the works. ON A LARGE ASPHALT FIELD, opposite the main

               A throng of policemen gather at the edge of Rotor City yelling and

               Hold one! The door is opening!
               
               The door of the helicopter transport slowly lowers like a
               drawbridge. Out of its black belly comes...
               
               SNAKE PLISSKEN. A steel collar is clamped around his neck. Eight
               lengths of chain stretch to eight armed guards who escort Plissken
               down the ramp. Plissken is bruised, badly beaten and tortured, his
               face a mess, but he doesn't seem to care. A line of battle-ready
               cops stand with their guns aimed right at Plissken's head as he is
               marched into camp. An army of camcorders move ahead of the Police
               Anchor as he scampers along in front of PLISSKEN, interviewing
               him.
               
               POLICE ANCHOR
               Hello, Plissken. Welcome to L.A.
               
               Celebrating cops cheer as Plissken is lead to...
               
               A SIGN ABOVE A CONCRETE BUNKER - DEPORTATION CENTER
               
               The bunker has one large opening, into which hundreds of deportees
               march. Guards in towers monitor the condemned as they trudge out
               of fenced-in containment areas, down walled corridors to the
               bunker entrance.
               
               The deportees are minorities, the poor, prostitutes, pimps,
               thieves, adulterers, atheists - the Morally Guilty, outcasts of
               society. Single mothers carry babies. Teenage runaways huddle
               together. There are abortion doctors, drug dealers, pornographers,
               the prisoners of a massive cultural war.
               
               As Plissken is marched toward the entrance, a loudspeaker blares
               out:
               
               POLICE VOICE (V.O.)
               You are now entering the Deportation
               Center. You have been found guilty of
               moral crimes against the United States of
               America.
               
               A great cheer goes up from the cops as the Police Anchor conducts
               his interview...
               
               POLICE ANCHOR
               S.D. Bob Plissken. Special Forces, Black
               Light, Texas Thunder. Two Purple Hearts.
               Youngest man ever decorated by the
               President.
               
               Plissken's face remains so impassive as to be almost blank.
               

               INT. SODIUM VAPOR CORRIDOR - DEPORTATION CENTER - NIGHT
               
               A glowing, vaporous-orange corridor. More cops gather to watch
               Plissken as he is escorted into the bowels of the Deportation
               Center.
               
               POLICE ANCHOR
               You've been convicted of 27 moral crimes,
               Plissken. The murder of an Internal
               Revenue agent. The kidnapping of a bank
               president. Gun fighting for profit. The
               list goes on and on...
               

               INT. CONCRETE HALLWAY - DEPORTATION CENTER - NIGHT
               
               Deeper into the Deportation Center. Camera tracks along the
               deportees, some bleeding, some wrapped in rags. Plissken, the
               Police Anchor, camcorders and the armed escort move through the
               dark, low concrete passageway.
               
               POLICE ANCHOR
               You used to respect the law. Served your
               country like no man before you. Role model
               to a generation.
               
               The Police Anchor leans in as close as he dares to Plissken's
               face.
               
               POLICE ANCHOR
               What happened to you, war hero? You were
               the best we had.
               
               STEEL-WALLED HALLWAY - DEPORTATION CENTER - NIGHT
               
               Steel walls. Deeper into the Deportation Center. The deportees
               here are in worse shape. Some appear to be dead. Plissken and his
               entourage continue along, as the speaker echoes a pre-recorded
               message...
               
               POLICE VOICE (V.O.)
               You are sentenced to permanent expulsion
               beyond the borders of the U.S. You now
               have the option to repent of your sins and
               be electrocuted on the premises. If you
               elect this option, notify the Cleric
               Sergeant in your Processing Area.
               
               Plissken and his entourage pass deportees kneeling and praying in
               front of cloaked cleric cops, government holy men. Beyond, through
               opened doorways, see Death Row deportees being strapped into
               futuristic electric chairs.
               
               POLICE ANCHOR
               The whole world's watching. Every good and
               decent person who works and hard and
               follows the rules. What would say to them?
               
               Plissken's expression is blank.
               
               POLICE ANCHOR
               What would you say to all of us who
               believed in you, who looked up to you, who
               thought you stood for right over wrong,
               good over evil? Be my guest. What do you
               have to say, Plissken?
               
               PLISSKEN

               Call me Snake.
               
               The guards move Plissken through a doorway, and the huge steel
               doors slam shut on the Police Anchor and the camcorders.
               

               INT. CORRIDOR - PROCESSING AREA - NIGHT
               
               Malloy, Brazen, and a 3rd man, tall, charismatic, grim, move
               urgently along a corridor.
               
               BRAZEN
               ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a
               database of 5 million sociopathic
               personalities. He hit the bottom of the
               curve.
               
               MALLOY
               Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can
               pull it off - not an army, not a man.
               
               BRAZEN
               Zero emotional developments. Total lack of
               compassion. A highly developed
               psychopathic instinct to survive.
               
               3RD MAN
               Let's get this over with.
               

               INT. CONCRETE CELL - NIGHT
               
               The cell door slams shut. Plissken turns around. Writ and leg
               irons. He looks around.
               
               In the concrete cell he sees a simple table with an overhead light
               above it. A watch lies on the table. Plissken shuffles over, picks
               up the watch, examines it.
               
               The cell door opens. Malloy, Brazen, and the 3rd Man enter the
               room unarmed. The door closes.
               
               Malloy and Brazen move forward, to the edge of the light. The 3rd
               Man stays back in the shadows by the door.
               
               MALLOY
               How you doin' Plissken?
               (no reply)
               You like the watch?
               
               PLISSKEN
               You assholes didn't bring me here to give
               me this for 20 years of dedicated service.
               What'ya want?
               
               Malloy looks back to the 3rd Man in the shadows...
               
               3RD MAN
               Get to it.
               
               Malloy raises a control unit, pushes the button. The lights go
               down and a computer-enhanced image appears on the wall...
               
               

               INT. PROTOTYPE DEFENSE LAB - SURVEILLANCE CAMERA
               
               From the point of view of a surveillance camera. The lab is huge.
               Banks of processors, disk drives, test bays, prototype assembly
               areas. High tech. A group of government officials is being given a
               tour. Utopia, 17, the President's daughter is among them. Pretty,
               virginal, she wears a "True Love Waits" button on her flowered
               dress.
               
               MALLOY
               At 1030 hours Wednesday, a group of
               government officials began a tour of the
               Livermore Defense Lab. The President's
               daughter, Utopia, was among them.
               
               Plissken continues to watch the image on the wall...
               
               MALLOY
               An hour later, she boarded Air Force 3 to
               Washington.
               
               The 3rd Man reacts as the image in front of Plissken changes...
               

               INT. MAIN CABIN OF 747 - CAMCORDER
               
               From the point of view of a camcorder. Utopia stands inside the
               main cabin of a plush, government 747. In one hand she holds a
               black anodized box the size of a transistor radio with a button on
               top. In the other, a machine gun.
               
               UTOPIA
               (to the camcorder)
               To the American people - it is time to
               rise up and demand the surrender of the
               President and his corrupt theocracy of
               lies and terror.
               
               MALLOY
               At 1140 hours, she hijacked the plane. We
               scanned the videotape on VR. Check it out.
               
               Inside the surveillance room the President stares grimly as Malloy
               presses a button. Suddenly the image in front of Plissken spreads
               out all around him. He is in a virtual reality re-creation.
               

               INT. MAIN CABIN OF 747 - VIRTUAL REALITY
               
               Plissken stands manacled in the main cabin. A group of secret
               service men and congressmen watch as a flight attendance operates
               a camcorder. He's videotaping Utopia as she rants into the camera.
               She's pent up with such anxiety she's like a panther in a cage.
               
               UTOPIA
               Today is Day One of a brand new world. The
               days of the empire are finished.
               (beat)
               To the President - my father, you know
               what this is.
               
               She holds up the anodized box with the red button and thrusts it
               at the camcorder.
               
               UTOPIA
               You know what it will do. Unless you
               abdicate your throne by tomorrow night, I
               will use it - on you.
               
               CONGRESSMAN
               Utopia, please. Give us the prototype. If
               something should happen -
               
               UTOPIA
               It will be in my hands - and the hands of
               my lover.
               
               She says "lover" with all the drama a 17-year-old virgin can
               muster. The others are shocked.
               
               UTOPIA
               Yes, my lover. My man. The only real man
               I've ever known. I'm on my way to his
               arms.
               
               She moves to the rear of the main cabin, bends down, opens a small
               hatch in the floor, scrambles down...
               
               WHAM! The VR image suddenly disappears and Plissken is again
               standing inside the concrete cell. Malloy and Brazen stand in
               front of him.
               
               MALLOY
               Somehow during the tour, she came into
               possession of a prototype transmitting
               device. We don't know how.
               
               BRAZEN
               Utopia became depressed after her mother's
               suicide, began to withdraw into her
               virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up
               her own little world in cyberspace and
               stay in it for days at a time.
               (hits a button)
               Somebody else was in there with her.
               
               AN IMAGE APPEARS
               
               In front of Plissken: A computer-rendered VR picture of clouds and
               sunshine, green grass and happy animals frolicking. A Garden of
               Eden. There, coming toward us, is CUERVO JONES. South American
               terrorist. Fiercest warrior of the Third World. He wears a
               gleaming ancient Aztec battle helmet. Bandoliers strapped around
               him.
               
               MALLOY
               Cuervo Jones. Shining Path. Peruvian
               terrorist. Runs the biggest baddest gang
               in L.A.
               
               Cuervo Jones takes off the helmet He is blindingly handsome,
               charismatic. He smiles, reaches out his arms to camera as if to
               embrace it. The image suddenly pops back to the beginning - it's
               on a loop. The image disappears.
               
               The lights in the cell come up.
               
               BRAZEN
               Utopia made tapes of her VR experiences,
               then tried to erase them. She missed this
               fragment on the end of her last tape.
               Cuervo Jones must have tapped into the VR
               master data bank - and then went prowling
               around for innocent blood, someone
               vulnerable to corrupt. Utopia was lonely,
               looking for something to believe in.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Sad story. You got a cigarette?
               
               MALLOY
               Shut up, Plissken.
               
               PLISSKEN
               What's the little black box do?
               
               MALLOY
               Top secret. Only on a need to know.
               
               PLISSKEN
               And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm
               goin' to Hollywood.
               
               MALLOY
               That's right, big shot. Unless you do what
               we want you're not coming back.
               
               PLISSKEN
               So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A.,
               find the President's daughter, secure the
               box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm
               free?
               
               MALLOY
               That's the deal.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll
               like L.A.
               
               After a couple of beats, the 3rd Man appears next to Malloy and
               Brazen. He stares at Plissken for a moment, holds up some papers.
               
               3RD MAN
               If you bring out the prototype, you'll
               receive a full pardon for every immoral
               act you have ever committed in the United
               States. Just like in '97. Remember New
               York, Plissken?
               
               PLISSKEN
               (looks at him)
               Who are you?
               
               MALLOY
               It's the President, for Christ's sake!
               
               PRESIDENT
               I give you my word. Put the prototype into
               my hands, and you're a free man.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I can see you're real concerned about your
               daughter.
               
               PRESIDENT
               Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Well, I'll think it over.
               
               PRESIDENT
               You're running out of time.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I've been doin' that all my life. Might as
               well do it in L.A. Everybody else there
               is.
               
               MALLOY
               Well, enjoy it, war hero, cause you got 10
               hours to live.
               
               Malloy, Brazen, and the President turn to leave...
               
               PLISSKEN
               Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
               
               MALLOY
               Having second thoughts?
               
               PLISSKEN
               Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in
               me this time.
               
               MALLOY
               You don't understand. It's already in you.
               
               PLISSKEN'S FACE
               
               As an image of the cigarette girl in New Las Vegas flashes
               suddenly. Her fingernail scratches his arm. He tightens.
               
               MALLOY
               The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an
               undercover cop. She injected you with
               incentive toxin. Right now it's swimming
               in your bloodstream. It'll start to take
               effect in 9 hours.
               
               BRAZEN
               It's a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus.
               Genetically engineered. 100% pure death.
               Complete nervous system shutdown. You
               crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. Not
               a pretty sight.
               
               Plissken takes a step toward him. Malloy holds up a large
               hypodermic.
               
               MALLOY
               Of course there's an anti-toxin.
               Neutralizes the virus immediately upon
               injection.
               (beat)
               We'll give it to you, but you have to do
               us this little favor.
               
               TWO BEATS...
               
               ...and then Plissken attacks the President, hurls himself across
               the room, throwing the chain around the President's neck...
               
               Plissken passes right through the President, causing his image to
               waver slightly, then falls on his ass.
               
               PRESIDENT
               Didn't think we were that stupid, did you?
               

               INT. SURVEILLANCE ROOM
               
               The real Malloy, Brazen, and President stand in front of a laser
               camera in a small room offering a view of the cell through a
               transparent portion of the wall.
               
               MALLOY
               We're holographs.
               
               INSIDE THE CELL
               
               Plissken stares at the three images in front of him, then at the
               camera lens on the wall...
               
               PLISSKEN
               Get this crap out of me.
               
               MALLOY
               I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working
               with you, Plissken.
               
               PLISSKEN
               (beat)
               Call me Snake.
               

               INT. BRIEFING ROOM - COMMAND HQ - NIGHT
               
               Plissken checks through various tactical survival items and
               weapons laid out on a table. Brazen watches as Malloy show shim a
               high tech submachine gun.
               
               BRAZEN
               Very sweet little weapon. Core burner.
               Magnesium ammo. 500 extra rounds.
               (moves on)
               Two 9mm handguns.
               (holds up a silver pill)
               Oral projectile. Mouth dart. Hold it in
               your mouth for ten seconds, the coating
               dissolves, it becomes a weapon.
               
               Malloy breaks open the silver pill. Inside is s small, lethal
               looking dart.
               
               BRAZEN
               Urolite. It'll stun the enemy for several
               seconds.
               
               Plissken picks up a small, computerized compass.
               
               MALLOY
               Tracer. Utopia has a kidnap chip implanted
               in her arm. You can locate her with this.
               
               Brazen hands Plissken a large black clip.
               
               BRAZEN
               This clips right onto your 9mm. Ammo
               enhancers. Like miniaturized grenades.
               Blows through anything.
               
               Plissken snaps the clip onto his pistol, then unsnaps it.
               

               EXT. POLICE COMPLEX - NIGHT
               
               Plissken suits up. Submachine gun, handguns, six-guns. He, Brazen
               and Malloy walk quickly across the complex.
               
               MALLOY
               L.A. is in a constant state of warfare.
               Gangs fighting for the right to rule.
               
               BRAZEN
               Heavy Third World connections. They get
               weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers -
               everything is pumped into the island from
               the south.
               
               MALLOY
               Some areas have power - they're on line to
               San Onofre.
               

               EXT. ROTOR CITY - NIGHT
               
               As Brazen's command helicopter takes off...
               

               INT. COMMAND HELICOPTER - NIGHT
               
               Plissken stares at a photo of the anodized prototype.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I'll need to know more about this thing.
               
               MALLOY
               Only a handful of people are aware of its
               existence. Let's just say it's the
               ultimate defensive weapon.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Defense against what?
               
               MALLOY
               There's a war about to be declared, or
               didn't you know?
               
               Plissken shrugs.
               
               MALLOY
               Third World wants to live like we do - and
               they plan on taking what they want. The
               Cubans and Brazilians are ready to invade
               Miami. If the Africans and Colombians make
               a run at the border, we got a full scale
               attack on the United States.
               
               PLISSKEN
               So what does this thing do?
               
               MALLOY
               All you need to know is get it back here
               by 5 a.m.
               

               EXT. WALL - ACCESS TUNNEL - NIGHT
               
               The Command helicopter lands near a large access tunnel inside the
               containment wall.
               

               INT. ACCESS TUNNEL - NIGHT
               
               Plissken, Brazen and Malloy walk through the dark, dank tunnel.
               Armed guards stand at the ready. A hatch in the tunnel floor
               stands open. A ladder disappears down into the darkness.
               
               MALLOY
               (points to the open hatch)
               You're going over by submarine. One-man
               submersible. Nuclear powered.
               
               Plissken arranges his gear, climbs into the hatch opening.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Where do I put ashore?
               
               MALLOY
               Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through
               the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl.
               You should be able to pick up Utopia's
               tracer there.
               (beat)
               Once you go inside, you're on your own.
               (beat)
               You know what you have to do with the
               girl, don't you?
               (beat)
               We have to spare this nation her trial -
               for treason.
               
               PLISSKEN
               So you want me to take her out?
               (Malloy nods)
               Is that an order from the President?
               
               MALLOY
               Let's just say it's what's best for the
               country.
               
               PLISSKEN
               By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
               
               MALLOY
               A medical team will be standing by.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Not you?
               
               MALLOY
               No.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Good.
               
               KABLAMM! He fires, ripping hellish blasts at Malloy. There's no
               damage. Malloy laughs.
               
               MALLOY
               Thought you might try that. First clip is
               filled with blanks. Goodbye, Plissken.
               
               Malloy kicks the hatch and it slams down on top of Plissken.
               Brazen pushes a control button, sealing it shut.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE BAY - NIGHT
               
               Plissken climbs down the ladder into a small submarine bay. Below
               him on a launching rig is a sleek, black one-man submarine shaped
               like a dart. The submarine's hatch is open. Plissken climbs
               inside.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE - NIGHT
               
               Plissken seals the hatch behind him. He has to lie flat on his
               stomach to operate the sub. He quickly hits various switches and
               buttons, powering up the cockpit.
               

               INT. COMMAND HQ - MAIN CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
               
               Malloy and Brazen move to a surveillance-command post.
               
               PLISSKEN (V.O. RADIO)
               Com check.
               
               Malloy picks up the microphone.
               
               MALLOY
               I'm here, Plissken.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE - NIGHT
               
               Plissken looks at the wrist watch. It ticks down ominously. Eight
               hours and counting down...
               
               MALLOY (V.O.)
               Stand by for launch. Ignitor.
               (Plissken pushes a button)
               Fuel rod injection.
               
               Plissken pulls a lever, watches his dials. A deep humming sound
               grows louder inside the sub.
               
               PLISSKEN
               She's in the green.
               
               MALLOY (V.O.)
               Lock fuel rods.
               
               PLISSKEN
               (hits a switch)
               Locked.
               
               MALLOY (V.O.)
               Nuclear turbine to 75% power.
               
               Plissken turns a throttle-like control with his left hand.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE BAY - NIGHT
               
               Out of the rear tubes of Plissken's sub comes a roaring blue glow.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE
               
               PLISSKEN
               75% power.
               
               MALLOY (V.O.)
               Hands on switches and counting.
               5...4...3...2...1. Launch.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE BAY
               
               The rear tubes roar. Suddenly the sub is shot forward through a
               long, circular tunnel.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE
               
               Plissken braces himself as the cabin lurches, vibrates with the
               force.
               

               EXT. THE WALL - NEWHALL PASS - NIGHT
               
               A door in the wall opens, revealing the circulator tunnel. In a
               roaring explosion, the sub rockets out of the tunnel, shot from
               the wall like a cannonball. The submarine is airborne for several
               seconds, then drops down, and slams into the San Fernando Sea.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE
               
               Plissken is rocked with the impact. He guides the sub with hand
               controls. In front of him on a screen is a schematic diagram of
               the underwater landscape of the San Fernando Valley.
               

               EXT. UNDERWATER - 405 FREEWAY - NIGHT
               
               In the underwater darkness, see the broken remains of the 405
               Freeway, as the subs creams past, its nuclear wake churning in the
               water.
               

               INT. COMMAND HQ - MAIN CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
               
               Malloy, Brazen and other cops follow Plissken's course on a
               gigantic computer screen.
               
               MALLOY
               Plissken, watch your speed. Lots of
               obstructions down there.
               

               EXT. UNDERWATER - VAN NUYS CITY HALL - NIGHT
               
               As the sub rockets past the ruins of the Van Nuys City Hall,
               barely missing it.

               Plissken...
               
               Plissken ignores him, carefully maneuvering the sub with his
               controls.
               
               MALLOY (V.O.)
               Plissken... do you copy?
               

               EXT. UNDERWATER - THE VENTURA FREEWAY - NIGHT
               
               Camera follows the sub as it streaks along just above the
               submerged ruins of the Ventura Freeway. See the ghostly shapes of
               cars, trucks, busses below, smashed and overturned.
               

               INT. COMMAND HQ - MAIN CONTROL ROOM
               
               They watch the sub, a red blip on the screen, move along the
               freeway.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE
               
               Plissken twists his hand throttle, pouring on the power to 90%.
               

               EXT. VENTURA & HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY INTERCHANGE - UNDERWATER - NIGHT
               
               The sub rips through the water, faster and faster, goes into a
               hard bank to the right as the Ventura Freeway turns into the
               Hollywood. A sign at the edge of the Hollywood Freeway reads:
               "SPEED LIMIT 55". The sub screams past.
               

               INT. COMMAND HQ - MAIN CONTROL ROOM
               
               Brazen points to a readout showing the submarine's engine status.
               
               BRAZEN
               His reactor's starting to overheat.
               
               MALLOY
               Plissken, slow down the sub. You're
               overloading the power plant.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE
               
               Plissken glances at the gauge. His nuclear turbine readout: green,
               moving to yellow, into red. He pushes it up to 102%.
               
               MALLOY (V.O.)
               Plissken...?
               
               Plissken's eye turns back to the computer map in front of him. One
               the screen: the red blip representing the sub is headed right
               toward a building. Plissken pulls hard on the controls.
               

               EXT. UNDERWATER - UNIVERSAL CITY - THE BLACK TOWER - NIGHT
               
               The sub smacks into the side of the Black Tower, powers through
               it, blasts out the other side through a window, tilting and
               wobbling. The sub rights itself momentarily but is slammed
               downward out of frame by a huge, dark, slimy object.
               
               KING KONG looms overhead - his fist rising and falling with the
               currents. Plissken has maneuvered himself into the wreckage of the
               Universal Studios Tour.
               
               The sub zips through the King Kong ride into Back To The Future,
               passing 1950's signage from that film, dodging a rusting Delorean.
               It slams into the open mouth of JAWS, shattering the model into a
               million pieces.
               
               The sub continues on, bouncing through the narrow openings of the
               Earthquake Ride - broken pipes, cracked sidewalks, split walls -
               hard to tell what was the ride and what was The Big One.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE
               
               Plissken hangs on, as small jets of water spray into the cockpit
               through tiny cracks in the hull.
               

               EXT. UNDERWATER - MOVING WITH THE SUBMARINE - NIGHT
               
               The sub suddenly tips upward, rising for the surface.
               

               EXT. SHORELINE - CAHUENGA PASS - NIGHT
               
               The sub explodes out of the water, lands belly first on a hillside
               with a hard thump.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE
               
               Plissken presses the hatch controls. The sub begins to slide
               backwards down toward the water.
               

               INT. SUBMARINE
               
               Plissken struggles, then rips open the hatch, scrambles out. The
               sub slowly slips backwards, down into the water. As the rear
               exhaust tubes hit the surface, a blast of steam. Plissken leaps
               out of the hatch. The sub sinks faster and faster. He scampers up
               the side, leaps for ground... and lands on the hillside, as the
               sub sinks into the sea, bubbling, churning, hissing.
               
               A bleeping sound. He takes out his pocket walkie, raises the
               antenna.
               
               MALLOY (V.O.)
               Plissken...?
               
               PLISSKEN
               I'm here.
               
               MALLOY (V.O.)
               Where's the submarine? It's disappeared
               off our screens.
               
               PLISSKEN
               It's history. I gotta go.
               
               Plissken clicks off the walkie, pockets it, turns to climb up the
               hillside when...
               
               WHAM! Standing above him is a dark figure. Hooded. Carrying
               something huge and rounded at the ends.
               
               Plissken raises his submachine gun...
               
               ... as PIPELINE steps closer. He's a surfer in a black wetsuit.
               Carries a surfboard. A rifle is slung across his shoulder.
               Pipeline's face is raw, burned - too many hours surfing in the UV.
               
               PIPELINE
               Too bad about your boat, man.
               (Plissken doesn't move)
               Supposed to be some swells out here
               tonight. Big ones.
               (beat)
               You like to surf?
               
               Realizing Pipeline is no danger, Plissken moves past him up the
               hillside.
               
               PIPELINE
               You look kinda familiar.
               (beat)
               You hang out around here much?
               
               But Plissken's moved off into the darkness.
               

               EXT. MULHOLLAND DRIVE - NIGHT - RAIN
               
               Plissken reaches old Mulholland Drive, now dark and desolate.
               Shells of houses stand nearby, black and empty. It has begun to
               rain.
               
               The sound of gunfire. Plissken ducks behind a tree...
               
               Two old cars come zooming up Mulholland, side by side. Windows
               down. Guns blazing at each other. They pass Plissken, continue
               down Mulholland, ripping each other apart with gunfire. Plissken
               darts across Mulholland, down the mountainside.
               

               EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - NIGHT - RAIN
               
               The rain pours down as Plissken makes his way down a steep
               incline.
               
               CRACK! A dark figure steps out from behind a tree. Plissken spins,
               submachine gun ready. It's Pipeline.
               
               PIPELINE
               Hey, man. I know who you are. You're Snake
               Plissken. Man, I can't believe you're
               really here.
               
               More gunfire from above on Mulholland...
               
               PIPELINE
               Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
               
               PIPELINE
               (points)
               Down that way.
               
               Plissken starts down.
               
               PIPELINE
               Be careful. Some real strange dudes
               hangin' out there these days.
               
               Plissken continues moving, now just a blurry figure in the rain.
               
               PIPELINE
               Hey Snake - what're you doin' around here,
               man?
               (as Plissken disappears)
               I heard they busted you up real good in
               Cleveland...
               

               EXT. HILLS ABOVE THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL - NIGHT - RAIN
               
               The rain is coming down in a torrent as Plissken makes his way
               down the hillside. Then, all at once, the rain lets up, then
               stops. The trees drip with moisture. Suddenly, a huge KATHUMP from
               above him. Plissken looks back. A huge mudslide is roaring its way
               down the hill toward him.
               
               Plissken races down the hill, but the mudslide cascades downward
               like a freight train, catches up with him, sweeps him off his
               feet... and Plissken goes riding down the hill, rumbling and
               sliding in the mud.
               

               EXT. STAND OF TREES - NIGHT
               
               The mudslide hits a flat area near a stand of trees, spreads out,
               slows. A completely mud-covered, black Plissken climbs out of the
               goo. He's dripping with it. His one good eye shines in the
               moonlight. He takes a couple steps toward the edge of the treeline
               when...
               
               A VOICE (SPINAL) (V.O.)
               Shut-up, fuck! Stop makin' noise!
               
               Plissken spins. He's standing right next to SPINAL, the leader of
               the Black Cowboy Gang. Dressed in black, boots with spurs, black
               duster, black cowboy hat, he carries an automatic rifle. He looks
               just like Charles Barkley.
               
               Plissken looks around, realizes he's in the middle of a small army
               of Black Cowboys, crouched behind the trees, waiting in ambush.
               Covered with mud, Plissken blends right in.
               
               SPINAL
               Take cover, fool.
               
               Plissken jumps behind a tree, looks down the hillside.
               
               PLISSKEN'S POV - THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL
               
               Below his position is the Hollywood Bowl. A huge cross is on
               stage, and the cross is on fire.
               
               CLOSER - HOLLYWOOD BOWL
               
               A group of white hooded men, the K.K.K., stand in front of the
               burning cross holding a ceremony. Next to the cross on stage, a
               hooded K.K.K. string quartet begins playing a Hayden concerto.
               
               Plissken reacts.
               
               SPINAL
               Let's take him.
               
               A Black Cowboy raises his M79 grenade launcher, as the others
               quickly race down the hillside. He fires.
               
               THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL
               
               A 40mm armor-piercing grenade leaves a blazing fire trail as it
               rockets toward the burning cross and - KABLAMMO! A fireball blows
               pieces of the cross into the air. The K.K.K. spin around...
               
               A blast of lightning illuminates the Black Cowboys attacking from
               the hills. They open fire. A K.K.K. Grand Dragon is picked off his
               feet, buffeted in mid-air, flesh and robe shredded by gunfire. A
               hail of bullets hits the K.K.K. They return fire, but are
               overwhelmed. They are hit, jerking and twisting. Fire from the
               Black Cowboys is withering, racking the hooded figures like bolts
               of lightning. The Black Cowboys keep advancing, firing, as it
               starts to rain again.
               
               Through the cloudy wash of dribbling rain water, the firefight
               continues. Four K.K.K. leap out from behind a row of seats and
               jump Plissken, knocking his gun to the ground. In a blinding
               flash, using hands, feet, and head, Plissken sends them flying. As
               he reaches down to pick up his submachine gun, he sees that the
               rain is washing the mud off his body...
               
               AND SO DOES SPINAL, who stands nearby, watching as Plissken is
               washed clean by the rain. Spinal raises his weapon, then stops.
               
               SPINAL
               Hey. I know you. Snake Plissken.
               
               Plissken slowly stands, his submachine gun in his hand. Behind
               them, the firefight is almost over. The K.K.K. scatter into the
               rain...
               
               SPINAL
               Hey, what's going down, Snake?
               
               PLISSKEN
               I'm looking for somebody.
               
               SPINAL
               Who ain't?
               
               Plissken pulls out his tracer. It is blipping red, just south of
               the Bowl.
               
               SPINAL
               Say, is it true what they say about
               Cleveland, man?
               
               Plissken doesn't answer. He moves on through the rain...
               
               SPINAL
               Later, Snake. Thanks for the help. You can
               always shift down and mojo with us
               anytime.
               

               EXT. VINE AVENUE - NIGHT
               
               The ruins of the Capital Records building. The rain has stopped
               again. Plissken is a lone figure walking along the street. In the
               distance, the sound of thumping music.
               

               EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD AT HIGHLAND - NIGHT
               
               Pandemonium! Music blares. It's the old Supremes hit, "Love is
               Like An Itchin' In My Heart." Crowds dance in the street. It's
               like a block party. Black, Latino and Native American gangs
               celebrate. Plus the usual Hollywood Boulevard street traffic.
               Plissken moves through the carnival. Gorgeous hookers stand under
               the marquee of the ruined Chinese Theater. The marquee now reads:
               "SAFE SEX", "NO CONDOMS NEEDED", "POLYPROPYLENE ORIFICES",
               "SATISFACTION GUARANTEED"
               
               One of the hookers struts in front of Plissken.
               
               CLOSEUP - THE HOOKER
               
               Opening her mouth, she gives a sensuous puff. A polypropylene
               orifice attached to the inside of her lips expands outward like a
               small, pink balloon. She sucks it back in and puckers, kissing the
               air. Plissken turns, as the sounds of car engines rises.
               
               HIS POV - COMING DOWN HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD
               
               ... is a caravan of vehicles. The crowd parts to let them through,
               cheering insanely. Plissken ducks into an alley, watches...
               
               The caravan passes Plissken's position. Two men on horseback lead
               a convoy of rumbling, fuming old cars, buses, motorcycles - all
               scarred and ripped and jerry-rigged - bumps down the Boulevard.
               
               Plissken watches from his spot in the alley, as a blonde-haired
               hooker joins him, rubs his arm. She has no polypropylene, at least
               none that we can see.
               
               BLONDE HOOKER
               It's winnin' time, baby. How about you and
               I do some celebrating?
               
               PLISSKEN
               What's going on?
               
               BLONDE HOOKER
               You must be new around here.
               (beat)
               You look familiar. Have I done you before?
               
               Plissken grabs the hooker.
               
               PLISSKEN
               What's happening?
               
               BLONDE HOOKER
               Easy, man, easy. It's Cuervo Jones' gang.
               Mescalito Justice. He's the big boss man
               'round here tonight.
               (whispers)
               He's gonna take down the police and make
               'em kiss his fine ass.
               
               Plissken lets her go, stares...
               
               HIS POV - A CADILLAC
               
               ... is perched ten feet off the ground on monster truck wheels.
               Severed doll heads are glued all over the hood, and a large
               glittering disco ball spins atop the roof, catching shards of
               light and flicking them back into the night...
               
               Behind the disco ball stands the real Cuervo Jones, at least. And
               there next to him is Utopia. She's dressed in black lace underwear
               and bra, garters and stockings. A Playboy fantasy. She holds the
               prototype. Delgado, Cuervo Jones' second-in-command, stands behind
               her. He is huge and evil. Dressed like Pancho Villa.
               
               Plissken stares as the Cadillac passes. The hooker cheers along
               with the rest of the crowd, and doesn't notice that Plissken's
               moved off...
               
               Several motorcycles bring up the rear of the caravan. Mescalitos
               ride with their women slung behind them. As the last bike passes,
               Plissken darts out of the alley, yanks the woman off the back of
               the cycle, jumps on.
               
               ON THE MOTORCYCLE
               
               The Mescalito biker turns to react...
               
               WHACK! Plissken takes him out with a head-butt, shoves him off the
               bike, hops up on the seat.
               
               KAVROOM! Plissken guns the motorcycle and it roars off, around the
               other bikers, toward the head of the caravan. Plissken zooms
               along, makes the turn onto La Brea Avenue with the caravan...
               

               EXT. LA BREA AND SUNSET BOULEVARDS - NIGHT
               
               As the caravan turns west onto Sunset, Plissken blasts around the
               corner.
               
               ON PLISSKEN
               
               Coming right behind him are four Mescalitos on Harleys - chains,
               iron bars, and swords in their hands. Plissken stares up ahead.
               
               HIS POV - THE CADILLAC
               
               ... is just a few feet away. Cuervo Jones and Utopia.
               
               Plissken guns it when suddenly two Mescalitos pull up on either
               side of him. One of them swings a chain. Plissken grabs it with
               one hand, and with his other hand, aims his submachine gun and
               fires! The Mescalito and bike go flying, and Plissken holds on to
               the chain.
               
               Atop the Cadillac, Cuervo Jones reacts to the sound of gunfire. He
               turns to see...
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               As the other Mescalito riding behind him swings a chain. Plissken
               swings his. The two chains snap together, intertwining. Then
               Plissken squeezes his hand-brake. He screeches to a stop. The
               Mescalito keeps going, and is yanked over backward by his own
               chain, off the Harley. Finally the Harley flops over, skids,
               explodes. Plissken guns it again, takes off after the Cadillac.
               
               Two more Mescalitos pull up on either side of Plissken. They take
               aim at him with their automatic rifles. Plissken pulls a sudden
               wheelie, lifts the front of his bike up into the air, rides on the
               back wheel. The two Mescalitos fire - directly into each other.
               They fall and their bikes go crashing to the pavement.
               
               Plissken surges the bike forward, coming up on a Mescalito on
               horseback who turns and fires. Plissken ducks and the bullet rips
               through the rear tire. The tire blows and the bike swerves out of
               control. Plissken leaps from the bike and grabs the back of the
               saddle.
               
               THE HORSE
               
               Plissken pulls himself up behind the Mescalito and wrestles for
               control of the mount. Plissken grabs the reins and wraps them
               around the Mescalito's neck, squeezing until his eyes burst.
               Plissken slams his arm against the Mescalito, throwing him off the
               saddle, bouncing onto the pavement.
               
               Plissken gallops ahead, circling a lasso high above his head,
               pounding down on a biker. The lasso takes flight and finds it
               mark, the biker's neck. Plissken pulls the lasso taut, ties the
               end to the saddle horn, rides his mount parallel to the biker.
               
               THE BIKE
               
               With one quick yank to the lasso, Plissken pulls the biker off,
               jumps on the bike and smacks the hell out of the horse's rump.
               
               THE HORSE
               
               Takes off down the street, dragging the biker by the neck.
               
               THE CADILLAC
               
               Speeds up as Plissken moves up to the Mustang five cars behind. He
               swings off the bike and jumps onto the trunk. Plissken climbs up
               to the roof, leaps on the hood, then jumps to the trunk of the car
               in front - leapfrogging, jumping to the next car, the next car...
               
               MESCALITOS
               
               Lean out their car windows, firing at him, but Plissken keeps
               moving toward the Cadillac...
               
               SUDDENLY A HAND
               
               Reaches out a car window and grabs Plissken's submachine gun.
               Plissken turns to snatch it back -
               
               WHEN CUERVO JONES
               
               Leaps from the Cadillac and takes Plissken down to the roof.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Snake Plissken.
               
               They struggle. Cuervo raises his machete. Plissken grabs his
               wrist, flips him over, knocks the machete off into the street,
               smacks Cuervo in the face.
               
               A BOLAS-SWINGING MESCALITO
               
               Comes roaring up on his bike, throws the bolas...
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               As the bolas hit him, wrap around his neck, the balls thunking him
               in the face, sending him flying...
               
               KAWHAP! Plissken hits the pavement hard. He skids, rolls, and at
               last slams into the edge of the sidewalk. The caravan rumbles away
               down Sunset. The hand in the car window still holds Plissken's
               submachine gun.
               
               Cuervo crouches on the roof, hissing at Plissken.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Later, Snake. We finish it later.
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Lies there for several beats, then climbs to his feet.
               
               HIS POV - THE CARAVAN
               
               ... disappears up Sunset.
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Stands alone in the deserted street. The ruins of a supermarket,
               cheap motels, liquor stores - all empty, desolate.
               
               He looks over to see the broken remains of his pocket walkie.
               After a beat, he starts moving up Sunset, checking his two 9mm
               handguns, slipping them into their holsters.
               

               EXT. SUNSET AND DOHENY - NIGHT
               
               On the border of Beverly Hills, Sunset stretches off into the
               darkness beyond the intersection. A slight wind blows litter
               aimlessly along. There are occasional sounds: Creaks, distant
               clangs.
               
               Plissken approaches the intersection. He carries Utopia's compass
               homing device. It is silent. The small screen's blank. Then
               Plissken glances at his wrist watch.
               
               CLOSE - WRIST WATCH
               
               Three hours gone.
               
               Plissken stands for a moment, staring off down Sunset...
               
               VOICE (V.O.)
               Snake Plissken, right?
               
               He spins around.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               
               Sits in an old beach chair on the sidewalk, a map to the stars
               sign in front of him. In his late 50's, he's a petty thief, con
               man. He's been hustling tourists and everybody else all his life.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Wow! Snake Plissken!
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie listens to WAYWARD WIND by Gogi Grant on a
               small, metal-plated portable radio. He clicks off the radio,
               rises, walks over to Plissken.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               You're a star in your own right, you know
               that? Hey, I'm Map To The Stars Eddie. How
               you doin'?
               
               PLISSKEN
               Where'd they go?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Man, I'd love to have your autograph,
               Snake.
               
               He searches around in his pockets, comes up with pen and paper.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               I've been hearing about you ever since
               that New York deal back in the 90's.
               You're one smooth operator.
               (offers pen and paper)
               Could you sign one to Wolf, one to Death's
               Head, one to Slasher Smith...?
               
               Plissken grabs him by the throat.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Where are they?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Who? You mean Cuervo Jones? He's the man
               with the juice, Snake. Got the President's
               daughter. Setting up a citywide truce. Big
               doings.
               
               Plissken draws a 9mm and points it at Map To The Stars Eddie's
               forehead.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Location.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where
               the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've
               been there, y'know.
               
               Plissken releases him, as suddenly the tracer beeps. On the device
               Plissken sees a small red pulsing dot. West.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Nice little gizmo you got there.
               (whispers conspiratorially)
               Look, Snake. I've got connections in this
               town. You need something, I'm your man.
               
               Without a word Plissken turns, walks away down Sunset Boulevard
               toward Beverly Hills.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Hey - you can't go there, Snake. You can't
               walk through Beverly Hills.
               
               Plissken's figure disappears...
               

               EXT. SUNSET - SIGN - NIGHT
               
               The old Beverly Hills sign. It's been painted over in dripping red
               letters: "QUIET - SURGICAL ZONE - STAY OUT"
               
               Plissken ignores the sign, keeps walking down a completely dark
               Sunset Boulevard.
               
               

               EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD - BEVERLY HILLS - NIGHT
               
               Plissken walks past the once-beautiful mansions along Sunset. Now
               they are dark, ruined.
               
               CLOSER - BEVERLY HILLS MANSION
               
               As a twisted, mechanical hand sewn awkwardly to the flesh of the
               wrist pulls aside a window curtain. The face behind the window is
               in shadows, but we can just make out its pale, discolored
               features. The other hand brings up a walkie-talkie...
               
               SENTRY
               (into walkie)
               Specimen moving west on Sunset.
               

               EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - SUNSET AND BEVERLY DRIVE - NIGHT
               
               Plissken moves into the intersection of Sunset and Beverly Drive.
               The ruins of the old Beverly Hills Hotel are ahead and to his
               right. He stops, stares down Sunset...
               
               HIS POV - A FIGURE
               
               Emerges from the shadows. This is the gatekeeper. Strange,
               mismatched body parts. A black-skinned arm attached to a pale
               white body. His face is unnaturally smooth - too many face lifts.
               He carries a torch.
               
               GATEKEEPER
               Halt!

               Where are you going?

               Are you here for the auction?
               
               BEHIND PLISSKEN
               
               Figures have suddenly moved out into the street, all with
               mismatched body parts - heads too large for their torsos, female
               body parts mixed with male heads, all sewn together with large,
               uneven stitches. Plissken is surrounded.
               
               GATEKEEPER
               Welcome to Beverly Hills.
               
               Plissken raises his gun, starts to move, when suddenly a figure
               rises behind him out of the shadows...
               
               A MULTI-COLORED FLESH HAND
               
               Raises a lead pipe, brings it down hard...
               
               ON PLISSKEN'S HEAD
               
               THUNK! He goes out like a light.
               
               As Plissken slumps unconscious to the street, the figures move for
               him. Their arms lock around him, drag him away with amazing speed
               - a pack of wolves on a deer.
               
               CLOSEUP - PLISSKEN - NIGHT
               
               Plissken bolts awake, to find himself tied to a cross. It's
               lurching back and forth as though the ground is moving.
               

               EXT. RODEO DRIVE - BEVERLY HILLS - NIGHT
               
               Plissken is being carried down Rodeo Driveon the cross by a throng
               of surgical failures. They carry torches. Dressed in tatters.
               Their faces look only partially human sewn together raggedly.
               
               Rodeo Drive is a bizarre marketplace of body parts. The once
               beautiful storefronts of famous designers are now in shambles.
               Human body parts are on display like filets of fish on ice.
               
               Gucci now offers body pieces fashioned from spare car parts and
               Armani displays more eclectic, high priced pieces sewn together
               like sculptures in their windowfronts. A giant rift runs down the
               street's center. Acrid smoke rises.
               
               The throng stops at an intersection, and Plissken's cross is
               anchored in the middle of the street. Surrounding the intersection
               are patients of every size, age, sex.
               
               Plissken looks over, sees another cross being carried up and
               planted right next to his. A beautiful girl is tied to this cross.
               This is TASLIMA, 20's, Iranian, the face of a Persian princess.
               She's dressed in black leather, and basically has an IQ of around
               50.
               
               TASLIMA
               Hi, Snake. It's so great to meet you. My
               name's Taslima. I'm a fan of yours.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Are you crazy?
               
               TASLIMA
               A little bit. But pretty soon I'm gonna be
               dead. So are you, Snake.
               
               Plissken looks across the street. Our of the ruins of the once
               famous red door of Elizabeth Arden come an arm of women facialists
               with acid-burned faces from one-too-many skin peelings wielding
               knives, saws, horrible-looking carving instruments...
               
               TASLIMA
               I can't believe I got caught.
               (sighs)
               I run with Midnight Jihad. Iranian gang.
               Only they kicked me out, cause I screw up
               sometimes. I forget stuff.
               
               Plissken struggles with his bonds.
               
               TASLIMA
               I left my boyfriend's place tonight, took
               a wrong turn...
               (sighs again)
               Oh, Snake, I'm really kind of out of it
               sometimes.
               
               OUT OF THE RED DOOR come more interns and nurses carrying surgical
               pans and pushing gurneys to collect dismembered body parts.
               
               The throng of facialists, patients, interns and nurses surround
               Plissken and Taslima on the crosses. They move back to the
               sidewalks as the auction for body parts cut freshly from Plissken
               and Taslima is about to begin. The gurneys are wheeled into place
               and set up as large cutting tables. The facialists take their
               positions behind the tables waiting to carve fresh meat.
               
               PLISSKEN
               What are they?
               
               TASLIMA
               They live here, used to be like us. But
               after too many silicon implants, their
               muscles turned to jelly. The only way they
               survive is to have body parts transplanted
               over and over again.
               (whispers)
               Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills
               gets out alive.
               
               PLISSKEN
               No screamin' shit.
               
               TASLIMA
               Oh no, it's the Doctor.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Who?
               
               TASLIMA
               The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
               
               THE DOCTOR, THE SURGEON GENERAL OF BEVERLY HILLS
               
               Steps out into the street. He appears incredibly gorgeous, a hunk
               of a man, put together by the finest body parts available in
               Beverly Hills - a millennium Fabio - but upon closer examination,
               he's got no lower jaw. Instead, there is a rusting metal grid-work
               attached beneath each ear. It never moves. He can actually speak
               through a metal box attached to his windpipe.
               
               THE DOCTOR
               
               Stands in front of them. He raises his hands to quiet the crowd.
               He walks around the cross, admiring the beautiful bodies before
               him. He tickles the fine flesh with his right hand, which is made
               up of 10 gleaming scalpels which form a 360 degree cutting edge.
               
               THE DOCTOR
               I've never seen more beautiful specimens.
               There will be no auction tonight. These
               body parts will go to those who need them
               the most.
               
               The crowd gumbles.
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Turns his head sideways, to a small hidden pocket near his neck.
               With his teeth, he pulls out the silver mouth dart, slips it onto
               his tongue, closes his mouth.
               
               The doctor raises his gleaming scalpel hand and steps toward
               Plissken.
               
               THE DOCTOR
               What a beautiful blue eye. It's a shame
               you only have one.
               
               A nurse brings over a small step-ladder. The doctor positions it
               in front of Plissken, slowly climbs up the rungs until he is face
               to face with him. The doctor looks ready to pluck Plissken's good
               eye from its socket with his scalpel tips.
               
               FFFTTT! Plissken spits the mouth dart!
               
               WHACK! The dark hits the doctor squarely in the forehead. He
               freezes, his scalpel hand raised, his eyes clouding. He falls
               forward.
               
               The scalpel hand swings, misses its mark, and instead hits the
               rope tied around Plissken's wrist. WHATCK! The rope's cut!
               
               Plissken grabs the scalpel hand with his free hand, cuts his other
               hand and legs loose in a flash and pushes the doctor backward off
               the step-ladder.
               
               WHUMP! Plissken falls to the intersection, almost at the same time
               as the doctor hits the pavement.
               
               The patients are stunned. Motionless. They stare at their doctor
               lying in the street, moaning, moving slightly.
               
               Snake starts to run...
               
               TASLIMA
               Snake, help me.
               
               SNAKE
               Why?
               
               TASLIMA
               I don't know.
               
               Almost on a whim, Plissken cuts her free. Then he runs. Taslima
               follows him.
               
               Plissken heads toward a side street, looks over his shoulder, sees
               Taslima following...
               
               PLISSKEN
               Don't follow me.
               
               TASLIMA
               You need help.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Like hell I do.
               
               Then Plissken comes to a dead stop.
               
               HIS POV - DOWN THE STREET
               
               Comes a mass of patients right at him. Taslima grabs Plissken,
               pulls him with her. They take off down a dark cobblestone
               street...
               

               EXT. DARK ALLEY - NIGHT
               
               Plissken and Taslima run as behind them the patient horde gives
               chase. They stop at another small alley between two large
               buildings.
               
               TASLIMA
               Down this way.
               
               They disappear into the small alley.
               

               EXT. SMALL ALLEY - CUL DE SAC - NIGHT
               
               It's long and narrow and completely enclosed by the buildings on
               either side. Suddenly Plissken and Taslima come to the end - a 75
               foot high four-story building blocking the passageway to Wilshire.
               
               PLISSKEN
               This is a dead end.
               (looks at her)
               You took us into a dead end!
               
               TASLIMA
               I just thought you wanted to get away. I
               didn't know you wanted to go someplace.
               
               KACLANK! They turn...
               
               The doctor staggers down the alley, the dart still sticking from
               his forehead. Behind him, the patients follow...
               
               Plissken shoves Taslima toward a broken window.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Go!
               
               He follows Taslima through the window.
               

               INT. SECOND FLOOR BALCONY - NIGHT
               
               Plissken and Taslima climb dilapidated stairs, move along the
               balcony railing. A torn and tattered Roy Lichtenstein painting
               hangs crooked on a wall. Twenty foot high bright red letters -
               "CAA" - lie strewn across the marble floor. Various offices are
               wrecked and dark, scripts lay all over the place.
               
               They stop at a dark hallway. Taslima moves cautiously ahead.
               
               TASLIMA
               Be careful of the bald cats. They live in
               these buildings.
               
               PLISSKEN
               The what?
               
               Plissken reaches for his other 9mm in its holder, but his hands
               are trapped by the doctor's body. Closer and closer moves the claw
               dagger toward Plissken's good eye.
               
               Taslima scrambles, picks up Plissken's 9mm, then stares at the two
               men.
               
               PLISSKEN
               (yelling)
               Are you gonna stand there? Give me the
               gun!
               
               Taslima starts to hand it to him. Both Plissken and the doctor
               fight to reach it. Finally, it's in Plissken's grasp. He blasts
               three times - each one hitting. The doctor shudders, rolls away.
               
               Plissken gets to his feet. He blasts one more time for good
               measure, then follows Taslima down the hallway...
               

               INT. FIRST FLOOR - REAR EXIT - NIGHT
               
               They come down a flight of stairs, stop at the rear door.
               
               PLISSKEN
               How do we get out of here?
               
               TASLIMA
               Sewers. Come on.
               
               She pushes open the door...
               

               EXT. BEVERLY HILLS STREET - NIGHT
               
               Plissken and Taslima run from the building, as a chorus of wails
               rises. Patients swarm around the building in pursuit.
               
               Taslima stops at a sewer grate in the street.
               
               TASLIMA
               Down there.
               
               Plissken lifts the grating. Taslima jumps in, followed by
               Plissken...
               

               INT. SEWER TUNNEL - NIGHT
               
               Dim, greenish light. Plissken and Taslima begin running down the
               sewer tunnel. Through the hole behind them drop patients, giving
               chase. Plissken and Taslima race through a half-filled storm drain
               seeping with slime. They turn a corner into another tunnel, and
               run smack into a horde of patients. Instantly, the patients
               overpower them. Hands reach out and drag them down...
               
               Suddenly, from down the tunnel comes an unearthly sound, a weird
               whispery screech like a demon unleashed from the underworld. It
               gets louder and louder. The patients freeze, then begin screaming
               and, as the sound gets louder still, they all disappear, escaping
               back down the tunnel.
               
               FROM DOWN THE TUNNEL
               
               An eerie light appears, coming nearer and nearer every moment.
               
               TASLIMA
               Snake - what is it?
               
               PLISSKEN
               How the hell am I supposed to know? This
               is your damn city.
               
               Slowly, the light takes form. It is a single, gigantic eye -
               floating in pitch-black darkness. It continues coming - growing
               larger and larger. Suddenly the sewer begins to echo with a
               blasting, ringing sound. Music!
               
               It's incredibly LOUD SALSA MUSIC!
               
               From out of the tunnel drives an ancient golf cart.
               
               On a metal pole in front is a huge, lighted eye such as an
               optometrist might use to advertise his services. Salsa music
               blares at top volume from loudspeakers strapped to the sides of
               the cart. At the wheel of the vehicle is a large man dressed in
               jeans, cowboy boots and a flak vest, wearing a gas mask. A lariat
               is hooked to his belt.
               
               He pulls up near Plissken and Taslima, shuts off the motor and the
               music, lifts a shotgun from the seat beside him, climbs down. He
               holds the gun on them.
               
               Removing his head gear, his face becomes visible. He is PENDEJO
               BOB, a Mexican wearing sunglasses under the gas mask. He takes off
               the sunglasses, and his apparently blind in one eye. He looks like
               Los Lobos' lead guitarist.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               What're you doing in here?
               
               PLISSKEN
               Looking to get out.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Which way?
               
               With a grunt of curiosity, Pendejo Bob moves up to Plissken.
               Suddenly his blind eye flashes on like a tiny, built-in spotlight.
               With it, he examines Plissken's face.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               You're Snake Plissken.
               
               TASLIMA
               Yes. Isn't he cool?
               
               There is a clicking sound and the lighted eye is extinguished.
               Pendejo Bob extends his hand.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               An honor, Snake. Amigo. They call me
               Pendejo Bob.
               
               Plissken doesn't shake. From down the tunnel the shouts and
               footfalls of the patients gets closer...
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Those damn patients are coming back. You'd
               better climb aboard.
               
               Plissken and Taslima climb into the rear of the golf cart. Pendejo
               Bob spins the cart, takes off in the other direction.
               

               INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGE - NIGHT
               
               The golf cart streaks along through a dark sewer passage. The only
               light comes from the eye on the front of the vehicle.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               I use the eye and the music to scare em
               off. They're so whacked out, man, it works
               great. Chased a whole bunch of em right
               off the edge there a few months ago.
               
               He points to a sheer, pitch-black drop-off on one side of the
               passage.
               
               TASLIMA
               (she peers over the side)
               How far down does it go?
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Don't know - never do hear em land.
               Earthquake opened it up.
               
               The golf cart creaks into a narrow tunnel...
               
               INSIDE THE TUNNEL
               
               Guards, Hispanics in biker denims, fatigues, with rifles and
               sunglasses, line the walls. They watch as the golf cart passes. Up
               ahead is a door marked: "SEWAGE RECLAMATION CONTROL"
               

               INT. SEWER RECLAMATION CENTER - CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
               
               The cart pulls into the remains of a mammoth underground control
               center. It's lined with ladders, catwalks, machines full of gauges
               and levers. A few are still working - most are broken and covered
               with dust and grime.
               
               Filling the room is an underground enclave: Men, women, children,
               all Hispanic, living in tents and lean-to's, cooking over open
               fires next to old rusted cars on blocks, lots of weapons, lots of
               sunglasses. Also, high-tech, futuristic rifles, cannons, grenade
               launchers - an amazing arsenal. Crates of explosives are stacked
               everywhere.
               
               The golf cart comes to a stop and they get off.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               I own this whole place. Used to work here
               in the old days. I was right in this room
               when the big one hit. What a mess. We were
               waist high in shit.
               (turns proudly to them)
               Everybody else ran, but not me. I stayed
               at my post. Now it's all mine. I brought
               my whole family, my amigos, down here to
               live with me.
               
               TASLIMA
               Gun runners.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Hey, it's a living, baby.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat
               to China, take an airplane to Brazil?
               (looks at Taslima)
               Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?
               
               TASLIMA
               I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Y'know, L.A.'s not such a bad place,
               Snake. We got our problems, sure - but
               this is paradise, man.
               
               Pendejo Bob leans in close and whispers conspiratorially to
               Plissken.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns?
               Explosives? I can get you a crate of
               hellfire grenades, no problem - five
               hours.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               All the sewers are collapsed under Venice.
               You have to go topside. Right up there.
               
               He leads Plissken and Taslima to a ladder that goes up into the
               darkness. A line of men steadily climb up, one after the other,
               carrying crates of weapons.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Comes out near the Santa Monica Freeway.
               Just follow the signs. Get off at the
               Lincoln Exit, turn left.
               
               Pendejo Bob interrupts the line of men. Plissken starts up the
               ladder, followed by Taslima...
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Nice to meet you, Snake. You too, Miss.
               You're welcome down here anytime. Anytime
               at all.
               

               EXT. STREET UNDER SANTA MONICA FREEWAY OVERPASS - NIGHT
               
               Plissken, gun in hand, sticks his head out of the open grate.
               Taslima follows. The Hispanic men who have climbed up out of the
               sewers load their weapons crates into various low-rider cars in
               heavily-armed groups. They rumble off into the night.
               
               Taslima points to a freeway on-ramp.
               
               TASLIMA
               The freeway's over there. But, Snake - I
               don't think it's such a good idea.
               
               Plissken starts toward the on-ramp. Taslima doesn't move.
               
               TASLIMA
               The freeways are dangerous.
               
               He keeps walking.
               
               TASLIMA
               Goodbye, Snake.
               
               Plissken stops, turns back, looks at her - a half-smile. It's as
               close to 'thank you' as he gets.
               
               TASLIMA
               Sun's coming up in a few hours.
               
               She walks up to him.
               
               TASLIMA
               UV's gonna be bad today. I have a friend
               who's got a place near here. We can crash
               there if you want, Snake.
               (she moves close to him)
               I'd love to take care of you. Make you
               feel good.
               
               Without an answer Plissken turns and walks away...
               

               EXT. SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - NIGHT
               
               As far as the eye can see there are lines of rusting cars and
               trucks, bumper to bumper like a giant junkyard rush hour.
               
               Plissken walks up the on-ramp, onto the freeway. He strides past
               rows of junked cars. A few of them have people inside...
               
               There is a Mercedes rusted to its frame, its driver an 80-year-old
               in sunglasses, drinking from a bottle. A pickup truck full of old
               illegal aliens packed in like sardines. Someone cooks from a
               barbecue grill. An RV. An old man sits in the opened doorway,
               staring at Plissken as he passes. Two old ladies in housecoats
               stare at him through the windows.
               
               CLICK, CLICK! A sound behind Plissken. He spins, 9mm ready...
               
               It's Taslima, running to catch up with him.
               
               TASLIMA
               I changed my mind. I'm going with you,
               wherever you're going.
               
               PLISSKEN
               (gestures to the cars)
               What the hell is this?
               
               TASLIMA
               The freeway.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I know that. There are people in some of
               these cars.
               
               TASLIMA
               It's where they live. I guess after
               everything happened, they just needed to
               do what they'd always done before. During
               the daytime, they just pull down the
               shades on their windows and sleep.
               
               Plissken continues walking. Taslima catches up...
               
               TASLIMA
               What are you gonna do in Venice?
               
               PLISSKEN
               Find Cuervo Jones.
               
               TASLIMA
               No! Stay away, Snake. He's mucho muerte.
               
               Suddenly a shot rings out. Taslima is struck and falls. Plissken
               drops between the cars and crawls over to her.
               
               TASLIMA
               Run, Snake...They're coming.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Who?
               
               She touches his hand and looks at him softly.
               
               TASLIMA
               I don't know.
               
               Taslima dies. Plissken stares at her for a moment.
               
               More shots ring out - landing very close to him.
               
               FREEWAY EMBANKMENTS
               
               From out of the heavy bushes along the freeway storm a dozen
               Mescalitos moving quickly - firing as they go. Behind them grinds
               an ancient garbage truck mounted with a 50-caliber machine gun.
               Atop the truck is Delgado. He wears a flame thrower on his back.
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Returns fire, rolls under a car and begins crawling. All around
               him people jump out of their cars, begin firing back at the
               Mescalitos.
               
               THE GARBAGE TRUCK
               
               Smashes through a rusting Volkswagen, heading straight toward him.
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Reaches the edge of the freeway, dives for the bushes.
               
               AS THE GARBAGE TRUCK
               
               Roars past, firing into the vehicles on the freeway, the people
               running, screaming...
               

               EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT
               
               Clawing his way through the undergrowth, Plissken bursts onto a
               side street. Behind him come the Mescalitos on foot. Plissken
               runs, firing back every step of the way...
               
               AHEAD ON THE STREET
               
               Suddenly, in the blowing mist in front of him, a car screeches
               into view. It's a perfectly restored, 1966 Cadillac convertible.
               Candy-apple red. The stereo blasts "Last Night" by the Satellites.
               
               And behind the wheel is Map To The Stars Eddie.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Hop in, Snake!
               
               THE UNDERGROWTH
               
               As the garbage truck bursts through. Delgado is behind the machine
               gun, blasting away, burning up the street. Bullets are flying
               everywhere as Plissken runs to the Cadillac and dives into the
               back seat. He's still not fully inside when Map To The Stars Eddie
               roars away in a blaze of rubber and smoke.
               
               DELGADO
               
               Takes aim with his flame thrower... KAWHOOSH!
               
               A GIANT TONGUE OF FLAME
               
               Shoots out from the nozzle like a flaming spear. It streaks down
               the street, just missing the tail of the Cadillac as it swerves
               around a corner...
               

               INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie races along a dark street. Plissken climbs
               into the front seat.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Hey, Snake - that was great. They almost
               burned your ass off!
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie drives like Satan himself. Plissken is
               almost thrown out as they spin around curves, up onto sidewalks.
               Delgado and the garbage truck can't keep up with them. Finally,
               the Mescalitos are left far behind as Map To The Stars Eddie slows
               down to a cruise of 70.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Too many people know where you're going,
               Snake. That's not good. Delgado and his
               men were back there waiting for you.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Delgado?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Cuervo Jones' right-hand man. One tough
               hombre. You don't understand, Snake.
               Cuervo Jones wants to unify the island.
               We're on the move, man. Big time.
               

               EXT. DARK INTERSECTION - NIGHT
               
               The Cadillac smashes through an intersection, knocking two old
               junked cars out of the way.
               

               INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
               
               Plissken jams his 9mm into Map To The Stars Eddie's ear.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Stop the damn car.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               No way.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I said pull over.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               All right. Anything for you, Snake.
               (beat)
               Although I was going to take you to Cuervo
               Jones' place.
               
               Plissken lowers the gun.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Where is it?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Right over there.
               
               He points. Plissken looks off, as Map To The Stars Eddie hits a
               button on the steering wheel with his finger.
               
               ON THE DASHBOARD
               
               A small panel in front of Plissken flips down, revealing a two-
               inch machine gun barrel. Before he can do anything, four rounds
               rip straight into his chest, blasting him into the seat.
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Grits his teeth and gasps. His gun drops. Blood runs from four
               holes in his shirt. His face grows red as he fights for air.
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie pushes the button again and the panel
               closes up over the barrel.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Pretty neat, huh? This is Cuervo's car. He
               lets me use it sometimes.
               (looks at Plissken)
               Not to worry, Snake. You were just shot
               with a fun-gun. You feel it?
               
               Plissken gulps for air.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Pure mesh, man. 100-proof artery choker.
               
               Plissken slumps back, collapses in the seat.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Like Cuervo says, when the hit pulls you
               down to one inch from death, that is
               living, man.
               
               PLISSKEN'S POV - THE DRUG
               
               Kicks in hard. Surreal colors float through the dark, devastated
               streets of Venice.
               
               Plissken fights desperately against the drug, but he can't move.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               You should've talked to me first, Snake. I
               could've set this whole thing up. I'm
               actually Cuervo's agent, you know.
               
               As Plissken sags, losing consciousness, Map To The Stars Eddie's
               voice begins to fade...
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               And I'd love to represent you, too. We
               could make a bundle together. I know I
               could really help your career...I mean,
               you're a legend and all - but the last
               couple years, man, it's like you've fallen
               off the face of the earth.
               
               ON PLISSKEN'S FACE
               
               As the world crashes to black!
               
               FADE IN:
               

               EXT. INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL LAX - NIGHT
               
               Like a giant, scorched daddy-long-legs, the architectural identity
               of the LA airport rises above the empty parking lot littered with
               the skeletal remains of burned-out cars and airport shuttles. The
               wrecks of old 747s lie twisted and bent across the tarmac.
               
               BEHIND IT
               
               Surrounded by Mescalitos with torches and guns, sits the former
               Bradley Terminal defaced with graffiti, the sign now reading:
               "MESCALITO JUSTICE HALL"
               
               PLISSKEN'S GOOD EYE
               
               Opens. Looks around fuzzily.
               

               INT. MESCALITO JUSTICE HALL - NIGHT
               
               He is in Cuervo Jones lair. Huge. Torch-lit. Plissken lies in the
               center of the room, chained to a treadmill. He is surrounded by
               Mescalitos.
               
               In one corner of the room is lots of high-tech equipment.
               Computers. A VR simulator. Most of the Mescalitos are gathered
               around a big screen TV. They watch the 207th Annual Academy Awards
               from Carefree, Arizona.
               
               Cuervo Jones strides toward Plissken. Map To The Stars Eddie
               scurries along at his side.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't
               I? All I'm asking for is what you
               promised.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               We'll see.
               
               Cuervo Jones stops in front of Plissken. Sees that he's awake.
               Holds out a glass filled with red liquid.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Carrot juice?
               (no response)
               Laced with tequila, Snake. Good for you.
               No?
               (no response)
               Your health.
               
               Cuervo Jones downs the carrot juice. Plissken lifts his head,
               grimaces. Sweat pours down his face. He gasps for air.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               You're coming out of it, Snake. It hurts
               real bad.
               (beat)
               That's good.
               
               He kneels down next to Plissken.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Dying isn't good enough for you. You need
               pain. You'll never make it to where you
               want to go without a little pain.
               
               He stands, considers Plissken for a moment.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Snake Plissken. American outlaw. So
               typical of American idealism. The old
               west, Snake.
               
               Cuervo Jones tosses the glass to Map To The Stars Eddie. He's
               beginning to enjoy the moment, performing for Plissken.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Man against the sky. The individual.
               Freedom. No wonder they hate you so much
               in America, Snake. You remind them of what
               they used to be.
               
               Cuervo Jones walks to a door, opens it. Beyond is a huge courtyard
               filled with people - families, teenage runaways, the elderly,
               illegal aliens, orphans - people with nowhere to go. They are
               being fed and cared for by Mescalitos.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Here is the real L.A., Snake.
               
               Plissken lifts his head to see.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               The poor. The old. The lost. People
               without hope.
               
               He crosses back to Plissken...
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Do you know what they want? One word.
               Liberation.
               (beat)
               They want a chance to live - before it's
               all gone. They've been hated for too long
               -
               (smiles)
               Now it's their turn.
               
               He gestures to his men, who move to Plissken and begin carefully
               unlocking him from the treadmill.
               
               Still wobbly, Plissken crawls to his feet...
               
               As Utopia comes bounding up from the big screen TV. Still dressed
               in her racy underwear, she gives Cuervo Jones a kiss. She still
               carries the prototype with her.
               
               UTOPIA
               Cuervo! LaToya Jackson just won Best
               Actress.
               
               Cuervo Jones reaches out to take the prototype from her. She holds
               on to it.
               
               UTOPIA
               You said I could hold it.
               
               He yanks it out of her hands, more violently than she expected.
               Recovering, she casts a contemptuous glance at Plissken.
               
               UTOPIA
               Who's that?
               
               CUERVO JONES
               You never heard of Snake Plissken?
               
               Utopia takes a couple steps closer, squints.
               
               UTOPIA
               He doesn't look like his picture.
               (frown)
               I bet he's fake.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
               
               UTOPIA
               Are we going to eat soon? I'm starved.
               
               Cuervo Jones gives her a slap on the butt, which startles Utopia.
               
               UTOPIA
               Ooww!
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Go on now. Do as I say.
               
               Plissken watches as Utopia walks away, out of the terminal.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               I'm going to show her what it means to be
               a woman - for the first time in her
               pathetic little life.
               (smiles)
               Given her love, Snake. Everybody needs
               love.
               
               He moves slightly closer to Plissken - though not too close.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               You want to hook up with us? Join the
               revolution? We're all getting out of here
               tomorrow night.
               (holds up the prototype)
               We're gonna rule the world. Come with us,
               Snake.
               
               Plissken says nothing. His good eye glares.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               No? Too bad. Well, I told you we'd finish
               it later. So guess what? It's later.
               
               He motions to his men, who grab Plissken and drag him away...
               

               INT. BAGGAGE CLAIM AREA - NIGHT
               
               The baggage claim area is an industrial wasteland filled with
               machinery and hanging cables and wires. A door opens and Plissken
               is hurled in. The door slams shut.
               
               Plissken stands a moment, trying to get his balance, when a man
               steps out of the shadows. It is Delgado.
               
               DELGADO
               You're mine now, Snake. All mine.
               
               Delgado slowly moves towards Plissken, swinging two huge gleaming
               machetes around his head. Plissken steps back, glances at his
               wrist watch. 4 hours and 20 minutes gone.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Shit.
               
               Plissken looks up as Delgado flings a machete at him. He just
               barely dives out of the way, rolls on the floor...
               
               Delgado charges toward him, machete poised like a bayonet.
               Plissken rips off an edge guard from the baggage carousel and
               wings it at Delgado. The machete is blocked with a direct hit. KA-
               CLANG!
               
               Delgado is thrown sideways. Plissken runs, launches himself
               through the air, twisting his body sideways, and lands a hard kick
               right in Delgado's face. Delgado goes sprawling. One of the
               machetes CLANKS to the floor...
               
               Plissken grabs the machete, just as Delgado rises...
               
               WHOOSH! Plissken's arm is a blur as he throws...
               
               THUMP! The machete sticks out of Delgado's chest. He looks down at
               it in horror, then crumbles to the floor.
               

               EXT. MESCALITO JUSTICE HALL - NIGHT
               
               The caravan is starting up again. Wearing hot pants, a tank top
               and full-length mink coat, Utopia is escorted up a ladder by
               Cuervo Jones to the opened door of the Cadillac perched up on
               those monster truck wheels. The other Mescalitos mount up in their
               cars and motorcycles, and roar away from the terminal.
               
               Above, on top of the terminal, see a figure move.
               
               TOP OF MESCALITO JUSTICE HALL
               
               It's Plissken. He grabs an electrical wire and throws it over the
               side...
               
               PARKING LOT - A MESCALITO GUARD
               
               Stands watching the caravan pull away. He doesn't see the wire
               dangling behind him, and Plissken shinnying down it.
               
               Beat. Beat.
               
               WHACK! Plissken takes him out with one blow, lowers himself to the
               ground, takes his rifle.
               
               Plissken quickly moves down the dark street after the caravan.
               

               EXT. THE FORUM - NIGHT
               
               Cuervo Jones' caravan comes rolling down Manchester, into a vast
               parking lot toward the Forum. Portions of the gigantic sports
               arena have been damaged in the earthquake, but crowds still pour
               into the entrances.
               
               The caravan pulls up at the Forum Club entrance. Cuervo Jones,
               Utopia, Map To The Stars Eddie and the others enter.
               
               AS PLISSKEN
               
               Approaches, ducks behind an old junked car.
               
               THE FORUM - DAMAGED WALL
               
               Plissken sneaks up to a crumbled, broken wall of the Forum, crawls
               inside through a large crack...
               

               INT. LOCKER ROOM - THE FORUM - NIGHT
               
               Plissken's in the backstage area, near the locker rooms. Hear
               cheering from the main arena. Slowly Plissken moves to a door,
               opens it, steps out...
               

               INT. FORUM HALLWAY - NIGHT
               
               The cheering is louder is Plissken makes his way along the dingy
               hallway.
               
               Now the sound of gunfire from someplace up ahead. Plissken tenses.
               
               Suddenly from down the hallway come two Black Muslims carrying a
               body on a stretcher. As they pass, Plissken notices the body is
               wearing a bloody basketball uniform full of bullet holes.
               
               He moves forward...
               

               INT. FORUM ARENA - NIGHT
               
               Plissken peers into the main arena. A basketball game is underway.
               The Korean Dragons sit on one side, the Black Muslims on the
               other. They cheer wildly for their respective teams. Pipeline is
               in the crowd, enjoying the game...
               
               Plissken moves closer, among the crowd along the baseline. The
               whole place is lit by torches and clumsily-wired lighting. Above
               his head is the shot clock, slowly ticking down.
               
               There's blood everywhere on the floor. The referees wear bullet-
               proof body suits and helmets. Trainers with stretchers stand by.
               
               THE SHOT CLOCK
               
               Ticks down: 5 - 4...
               
               A BLACK MUSLIM
               
               Dribbles the ball towards the basket.
               
               THE SHOT CLOCK
               
               Ticks down: 3 - 2...
               
               A whole row of Korean Dragons with rifles stand and take aim.
               
               
               THE BLACK MUSLIM
               
               Pulls up into a jump shot, releases the ball into the air. It
               sails through the basket just as the horn goes off, beating the
               24-second violation.
               
               The Black Muslim crowd cheers. The Korean Dragons sit down.
               Plissken watches...
               
               CUERVO JONES, UTOPIA AND THE OTHERS
               
               Moving through the seats on the Korean Dragon side of the court.
               Map To The Stars Eddie stands near the baseline, listening to the
               game on his silver portable radio...
               
               THE REFEREE
               
               Hands the ball to a Korean Dragon guard. The Korean Dragon
               dribbles the ball down court, into the corner and passes it off.
               The Korean Dragons can't get a shot off...
               
               THE SHOT CLOCK
               
               Above Plissken's head ticks down: 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1... HONK!
               
               THE KOREAN DRAGON
               
               Guard still has the ball - the shot clock horn has gone off - 24
               second violation.
               
               A whole row of Black Muslims with rifles stand up, take aim, and
               fire!
               
               BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!
               
               The Korean Dragon guard is riddled with bullets. He falls dead on
               the floor. The Trainers with stretchers quickly collect his body
               and hurry off the court.
               
               Ball boys quickly wipe up the blood with mops.
               
               ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
               (sound of effect of breaking
               glass)
               Shot clock!
               
               The Black Muslim crowd is cheering and screaming! "I Love L.A."
               begins playing on the loudspeaker.
               
               The players wear do-rags and black uniforms that look a whole lot
               like the black leather that Plissken wears. One of the players,
               JAMAAL, notices Plissken.
               
               JAMAAL
               Hey - Snake Plissken, you knew my brother
               Abdul. He was with you in Cleveland.
               
               The other players react, greet Plissken, slapping his hand,
               thumping chests, high-fiving each other.
               
               JAMAAL
               Welcome aboard, Snake.
               
               But Plissken pays no attention. He sees:
               
               CUERVO JONES AND UTOPIA
               
               Sitting in the Korean Dragon section near the other end of the
               court.
               
               CLOSER - CUERVO JONES AND UTOPIA
               
               Sit next to Xi-Ping, the leader of the Korean Dragons, a fierce
               man with green and brown psychedelic camouflage on his face.
               Utopia watches the game while the two men confer. Cuervo Jones has
               a firm grip on the prototype.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               The time is now. We are the strongest. If
               we go together, the others will come.
               (beat)
               We go for everything, Xi-Ping. But we go
               together. What do you say?
               
               Xi-Ping nodes. They clasp hands...
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Realizes he's got to get to the other side of the court. He jumps
               into the huddle with Jamaal, peering at him with his one good,
               cold eye.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Your brother died owing me, so I'm taking
               it out in trade. I need a favor...
               
               JAMAAL
               Sure, Snake. Anything.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I need to get across the court now...
               without drawing attention to myself.
               
               JAMAAL
               Like you ain't gonna stick out like a sore
               thumb. But we'll do what we can, Snake.
               Use the clock. Screen and roll. Now let's
               kick some butt!
               
               The players knock fists. Plissken puts on a do-rag. Yelling, they
               move onto the court, creating a shield for Plissken.
               
               JAMAAL
               (whispers)
               You play much pick-up ball, Snake?
               
               Plissken's watching Cuervo Jones and Utopia at the other end.
               
               JAMAAL
               Whatever happens, watch the shot clock,
               man.
               
               The referee blows his whistle. A Black Muslim guard inbounds the
               ball. The game is underway.
               
               Plissken ducks down the court using the rest of his team as cover.
               They go into a set play.
               
               The game is a cross between basketball and kung-fu. Players use
               slashing fists, spin-kicks, elbows and hard back-hands. It's full
               combat.
               
               The Korean Dragon guarding Plissken chops him. Plissken knocks him
               flat. No foul.
               
               Utopia sees Plissken, nudges Cuervo Jones.
               
               UTOPIA
               It's that weird guy again.
               
               Cuervo Jones grabs her and heads for the exit...
               
               Plissken sees this, stops playing, moves after them... when
               suddenly the basketball lands right in his hands!
               
               JAMAAL
               Snake! Shot clock!
               
               THE SHOT CLOCK
               
               Ticks down: 4 - 3 - 2...
               
               A whole row of Korean Dragons with rifles stand up, take aim at
               Plissken. Cuervo Jones watches expectantly...
               
               Plissken spins, executes a beautiful-looking jump shot. The horn
               sounds just as it leaves his hand...
               
               THE BASKET
               
               Swish. Nothing but net.
               
               The Korean Dragons sit back down, put away their rifles,
               disappointed. Cuervo Jones, Utopia, Xi-Ping and their henchmen
               quickly leave. The Black Muslims go crazy, and Plissken dashes
               toward one of the exits. He stops, sees...
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               
               With his portable radio, trying to get out of the arena, hiding
               behind a crowd of Dragons. Plissken races through the crowd, grabs
               Map To The Stars Eddie.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Hey, Snake, man... Great shot!
               
               Without hesitation, Snake whacks him across the jaw. Map To The
               Stars Eddie goes down like a sack of laundry. Plissken grabs him
               by the collar, drags him off toward an exit...
               

               EXT. FORUM PARKING LOT - NIGHT
               
               Cuervo Jones, Utopia, Xi-Ping and their men rush out to the
               caravan of waiting vehicles. Xi-Ping has his own armada of
               vehicles and an army of evil-looking guards. Cuervo Jones pulls
               Xi-Ping aside.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               That man in black. He's very dangerous.
               
               XI-PING
               One eye?
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Yes. We gotta dump him.
               
               XI-PING
               What does he want?
               
               CUERVO JONES
               (glances at the prototype)
               I'm betting the cops sent him in. Man, I
               do not need this. I got a war to win.
               
               ANOTHER EXIT - THE FORUM
               
               As Plissken drags Map To The Stars Eddie out into the night,
               crouches behind a row of cars, watches Cuervo Jones' caravan start
               their engines.
               
               Plissken shakes Map To The Stars Eddie, waking him...
               
               PLISSKEN
               Where are they going?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               (groggy)
               Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me,
               Snake. I can help you.
               
               Plissken shoves the barrel of his pistol up against Map To The
               Stars Eddie's temple.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Bankrupt City. The Happy Kingdom.
               (beat)
               Snake, Cuervo's hooked up with Xi-Ping. He
               is primetime, man - Mister Bad News. The
               rest of the city's joining up with 'em.
               (beat)
               You're shit outta luck, Snake.
               
               Plissken reaches into a pocket, comes out with the large black
               clip, slips it on his 9mm pistol.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Not yet.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               I could've helped you. We coulda made a
               deal with Cuervo. If you'd listen...
               
               Without looking, Plissken slams his elbow into Map To The Stars
               Eddie's jaw with a WHACK! He flops unconscious on the pavement...
               
               Cuervo Jones' caravan led by that huge Cadillac on monster wheels,
               moves away from the Forum toward an exit. Plissken moves after
               them, ducking behind the row of cars...
               
               FORUM EXIST
               
               The caravan picks up speed as it approaches the exit...
               
               Plissken appears behind an old truck, just as the Cadillac moves
               past him. He crouches on the balls of his feet, and as the rear of
               the Caddy drifts closer, he springs...
               
               And grabs on to the rear bumper. The monster wheels spin like
               huge, black scythes on either side of him. Plissken reaches under
               the Caddy, finds a purchase on the undercarriage, and swings under
               the Cadillac. He hangs dangling above the street by one hand as
               the caravan pulls out onto Manchester. With the other he raises
               his 9mm and aims it at the undercarriage, right about where the
               front seat should be...
               
               BLAM, BLAM, BLAM, BLAM!
               

               INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
               
               The front seat explodes, bullets screaming upward through the
               leather seats, tearing and shredding fabric and flesh, killing the
               driver and Xi-Ping instantly!
               
               In the back seat sit Cuervo Jones and Utopia. The Caddy begins to
               swerve, the wheel spinning. Cuervo Jones lunges forward across the
               seat and grabs it.
               
               Under the Cadillac, Plissken continues to fire: BLAM, BLAM, BLAM,
               BLAM!
               
               The front seat disintegrates. Metal, leather, padding fly
               everywhere. Cuervo Jones ducks against the door, covering his face
               with one hand, still grasping the wheel with the other.
               
               KAWHUMP!
               
               The entire front seat and floor underneath it fall down out of the
               Cadillac and hit the street below. The bodies of the driver and X-
               Ping flop under the monster wheels.
               
               Plissken swings over to the hole and pulls himself up into the
               opening that used to be the front seat. Cuervo Jones stares at him
               in total shock, but before he can speak...
               
               Plissken rips the prototype out of his hands! Then jumps into the
               back seat next to Utopia. Then grabs her and turns to the side
               door. Cuervo Jones releases the wheel for a moment, turns to grab
               Plissken...
               
               But Plissken opens the side door, kicks it wide, and with Utopia
               under his arm, slides across the seat...
               
               ... and sails out of the Cadillac...
               
               CUERVO JONES
               No!
               
               Plissken and Utopia fly through the air, and land with a thud on
               top of a Mescalito car as the Cadillac begins to swerve wildly.
               Cuervo Jones grabs the wheel, desperately tries to control the
               Caddy... but fails. The Cadillac careens off the street, slams
               into the palm tree, spins around and crashes into the remains of a
               hot dog stand.
               
               ON THE ROOF OF THE MESCALITO CAR
               
               Plissken and Utopia roll and tumble. He still has a hold of her,
               and she fights him tooth and nail...
               
               UTOPIA
               Lemme go...!
               
               INSIDE THE MESCALITO CAR
               
               The driver swerves, hits the brakes... and the car hops the curb,
               slides along the sidewalk, burning rubber.
               
               PLISSKEN AND UTOPIA
               
               Are thrown forward. They tumble off the roof... across the hood...
               and land on the sidewalk in front of the car. They roll to a stop,
               as the car screeches to a stop, inches from their heads, as the
               caravan suddenly puts on its brakes.
               
               Screaming tires. Cars jackknifing, spinning in a massive traffic
               collision...
               
               Cuervo Jones emerges from the remains of the Cadillac.
               
               Plissken drags Utopia into the street, grabs the lid of a manhole
               in the street, pries it up...
               
               Mescalitos pour out of their vehicles, as Cuervo Jones charges
               into the street, pointing at Plissken...
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Kill him, kill him...!
               
               Plissken lifts Utopia to her feel, hauls her over to the manhole
               opening, and dives inside... just as the Mescalitos open fire! The
               street around the manhole opening explodes with screaming hot
               lead...
               

               INT. SEWER TUNNEL - NIGHT
               
               Plissken and Utopia land in the half-filled storm drain. He gets
               to his feet, pulls her with him, and heads off sloshing through
               the water. The sound of gunfire echoes above them...
               

               EXT. MANCHESTER AVENUE
               
               Cuervo Jones and the Mescalitos charge the open manhole as Map To
               The Stars Eddie appears groggily shuffling up the street from the
               Forum...
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               (grins to himself)
               Good thinkin', Snake.
               
               He heads off down the street...
               

               INT. SEWER TUNNEL
               
               Plissken and Utopia race along through the water. He literally has
               to drag her with him. They turn a corner, go down another slimy
               drain away from the main tunnel...
               

               INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGE - NIGHT
               
               The black belly of the sewer system. Plissken and Utopia move
               along, slow as they come to...
               
               THE SHEER, PITCH-BLACK DROP OFF
               
               One side of the passage, the same one we saw earlier on our
               journey with Pendejo Bob.
               
               Plissken spins Utopia around, pushes her backward toward the drop-
               off, his eye burning into her...
               
               Her feet reach the very edge.
               
               Plissken holds her there. Utopia's face is a mask of sheer terror.
               She gulps air in staccato bursts...
               
               Beat. Beat.
               
               Plissken can't do it. He can't push her off.
               
               He releases her, backs up, looks at the prototype, then pulls one
               of his revolvers from its holster, cocks the hammer, aims...
               
               UTOPIA
               My... father sent you... didn't he?
               (beat)
               He sent you to kill me...
               
               Plissken raises the pistol. She's dead in his sights.
               
               UTOPIA
               Didn't he?
               (begins to cry)
               
               But Plissken can't. He can't kill her. The toughest man on planet
               Earth can't kill this 17-year-old runaway.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Shit.
               
               Plissken sags, clicks the hammer back, holsters the gun. He stares
               at her.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Get out of here.
               
               Utopia wipes her eyes, confused, afraid.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I said go!
               
               Slowly Utopia moves from the edge of the drop off, starts away
               down the tunnel, then stops, looks back at Plissken. She stares at
               the prototype in Plissken's hand...
               
               UTOPIA
               Don't take it back. Don't give it to him.
               Please. Let me have it.
               
               Plissken glances at the prototype, then at her.
               
               PLISSKEN
               What does this thing do?
               
               UTOPIA
               (her eyes grow wide)
               No!
               
               KABLAM!
               
               Plissken's shoulder explodes as a bullet tears through his flesh!
               He spins, drops the prototype...
               
               ... as Map To The Stars Eddie emerges from the darkness of the
               sewer tunnel. He holds a gun in one hand, aims...
               
               KABLAM!
               
               He fires again, hits Plissken's leg.
               
               Plissken staggers backward toward the edge of the drop off, as Map
               To The Stars Eddie moves quickly forward...
               
               ... and snatches the prototype from the wet floor.
               
               Plissken's gun hand is useless, numb from the shoulder wound. He
               slowly, painfully transfers the pistol to the other hand, tries to
               raise it...
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               So long, Snake.
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie takes aim - a head shot ...
               
               Plissken spins, and dives off the edge...
               
               ... down into the drop off...
               
               PLISSKEN'S BODY
               
               Airborne. Falling through black space. Down, down, down, straight
               to hell below, until we can't see him anymore as the darkness
               swallows him up...
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie steps to the ledge, looks down, as Cuervo
               Jones and his Mescalitos slog up through the tunnel.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Where is he?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               He jumped. Down there.
               (beat)
               He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed
               Plissken.
               
               Cuervo Jones looks over the edge, at the silent blackness below.
               Then he turns to Map To The Stars Eddie.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Give it to me.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               You said I could be Vice-President,
               Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               (extends his hand)
               Give it.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Sure, Cuervo, but look here. I've done it
               all, man. I killed Plissken, I got your
               girl back, I got it all. Just for you,
               Cuervo. Just for you.
               
               Dead silence. Cuervo Jones stands with his hand extended. Finally
               Map To The Stars Eddie gives up, starts to hand Cuervo the
               prototype...
               
               ... but slips on the wet floor...
               
               ... and drops the prototype with a CLANK!
               
               CLOSE - PROTOTYPE
               
               A red light comes on, blinks urgently.
               
               PROTOTYPE VOICE
               (tiny, filtered)
               I am now armed and ready for use. Use
               extreme caution. The location of the
               effected blast area can only be determined
               by the orbital position of the SatStar
               Ring.
               
               Everyone in the tunnel is frozen, unable to move. Slowly Cuervo
               Jones picks up the prototype, stares at it, then breaks into a
               smile...
               
               CUERVO JONES
               This is turning out to be my lucky day.
               (stares coldly at Map To The
               Stars Eddie)
               Get this asshole outta here.
               
               Several Mescalitos grab Map To The Stars Eddie, pull him back
               along the tunnel.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Cuervo, wait. Please...
               
               Cuervo Jones turns to Utopia, who stands numbly staring off at the
               drop-off. He walks over to her, then slaps her hard, viciously,
               across the face.
               
               Utopia reacts to the stinging slap.
               
               UTOPIA
               Cuervo...?
               
               CUERVO JONES
               You're my woman, you understand? You don't
               let anybody take you away from me without
               a fight.
               
               UTOPIA
               I tried...
               
               CUERVO JONES
               (in her face)
               Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you
               give your life. You fight till you're
               dead. Then I forgive you.
               (screams)
               Understand?
               (shakes her)
               Understand?
               
               UTOPIA
               Yes...
               
               He shoves her down the tunnel...
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Let's go.
               
               The others follow them...
               

               EXT. MANCHESTER AVENUE - NIGHT
               
               As Cuervo Jones and Utopia emerge from the manhole cover, hear the
               sound of hundreds of helicopters rise.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               (looks up)
               Look, baby. They're all mine.
               
               POV - THE SKY
               
               Above Manchester and the Forum is filled with helicopters. All
               models, all makes, mostly the older, discarded military Blood
               Phoenix 14-bladed attack choppers that scream through the
               blackness like scythe-slashing robot bugs. They are on their way
               southeast, toward Orange County.
               

               EXT. SKY VIEW OF L.A. BY NIGHT
               
               Looking out at L.A. from above Mount Lee, see the Hollywood Sign,
               and wave after wave of helicopters thundering across the city.
               
               ANGLE ON THE TWIN TOWERS OF CENTURY CITY
               
               They're like buck teeth, sheered off and crumbling, stuck up in to
               the sky. Chopper roar overhead. A group of vagrants cluster around
               a camp fire on the top floor of one of the towers. They're
               watching a futuristic big-spin lotto on a large screen TV. The
               sound of the choppers brings them to the edge of the building -
               the walls of the floors beneath have been torn away. Desk,
               furniture, rugs, everything hangs out over the empty space.
               

               EXT. FIREBASE SEVEN - NIGHT
               
               Pandemonium. Troops, vehicles, helicopters, everything is in
               urgent motion. A loudspeaker voice blares:
               
               POLICE VOICE (V.O.)
               Full stage battle alert. All personnel to
               battle stations.
               

               INT. HALLWAY INTO COMMAND HQ - MAIN CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
               
               Malloy, the President and Brazen charge down a hallway into
               Command HQ. The place is jumping. Full scramble alert.
               
               MALLOY
               A sky full of enemy choppers on radar.
               Moving over the city to the southeast.
               
               A COM Officer rushes up to Malloy...
               
               COM OFFICER
               Commander - massive vehicle and troop
               movement on the ground. All major streets
               leading to the southeast.
               
               PRESIDENT
               What're they doing?
               
               Malloy looks at the President grimly.
               
               MALLOY
               Getting ready to invade.
               
               PRESIDENT
               (beat)
               So where's Plissken?
               
               DARKNESS
               
               Creaking. The WHOOSH of something swinging through the air...
               
               A huge blue eye opens. Looks around.
               
               DARKNESS
               
               Plissken's boot is hooked in a twisted wire mesh...
               
               DARKNESS
               
               And then Plissken swings like a pendulum, hanging from a long
               strand of wire mesh attached somewhere above in the blackness.
               
               Plissken's eye blinks.
               
               THE DARKNESS
               
               Begins to reveal details: slimy walls. Below, a black pit of hell.
               Wind gushing.
               
               And then a light stabs across the void...
               
               CLOSE - PLISSKEN
               
               ... The light hits Plissken's good eye...
               
               The light is from inside the eye of Pendejo Bob. He stands on a
               small ledge, at the mouth of a cave leading into the howling pit.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Hey, Snake. You okay?
               (unhooks the lariat)
               I heard gunfire down here...
               (begins to swing the rope)
               Never been down this far before...
               (swings the rope in a huge
               arc)
               Grab this.
               
               Pendejo Bob tosses the lariat. The noose flies across the pit, and
               Plissken grabs it with his good hand.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Now hang on.
               
               Plissken wraps his good hand and arm in the noose, as Pendejo Bob
               jerks the line hard. Plissken is in mid-swing, and the rope
               jerking pulls him abruptly in the opposite direction...
               
               Plissken's boot slips out of the wire mesh...
               
               And Plissken falls like a brick, stops abruptly as the line
               catches, and swings against the side of the pit. He dangles with
               only his one good arm holding on to the rope.
               
               Pendejo Bob pulls the line upward, straining against Plissken's
               weight. Slowly Plissken rises, a tug at a time, hauled up the edge
               of the pit toward the cave above...
               
               ... when suddenly he passes another opening, a storm drain below
               Pendejo Bob. He swings into the drain, grasps the side with his
               hand, and pulls himself in...
               
               Pendejo Bob stares down at his rope disappearing into the side of
               the pit.
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Hey, Snake...where are you?
               
               Plissken crawls into the slimy drain, pulls the rope off of him.
               Ahead in the darkness is the rushing of water. He turns on weak
               legs, back toward the pit behind him. Bleeding. Numb in one hand.
               His leg on fire.
               
               PLISSKEN
               (yells)
               I'm in another opening... Storm drain...
               There may be another way up to you...
               
               Plissken crawls along the drain. The sound of rushing water gets
               louder.
               
               He comes to the edge of the drain. Right below him is another
               drain filled with water rushing through it like a river.
               
               Plissken is stuck. He turns, in great pain, and starts back toward
               the pit... when suddenly everything starts shaking. Booming. It's
               a small earthquake, a pre-shock.
               
               SNAP!
               
               Suddenly the concrete bottom on which he stands gives way, cracks,
               disintegrates...
               
               And Plissken falls backward into the rushing water, and is pulled
               suddenly downstream into the drain, disappearing from sight...
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               
               Stands silently above, listening...
               
               PENDEJO BOB
               Snake...
               (no reply)
               Snake!
               
               Booming. The whole pit shudders, shaking. Another earthquake.
               Pendejo Bob drops the rope, turns and dashes away down the
               vibrating storm drain...
               

               EXT. STORM DRAIN - WILSHIRE CANYON - NIGHT
               
               Black oil-slicked water rushes in the moonlight, out of a huge
               opening in what appears to be a canyon wall.
               
               CLOSE ON THE EDGE OF THE DRAIN
               
               As an arm shoots out, clutching the edges of the drain.
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Emerges from the hole, slides out, tumbles down to a water-filled
               canyon bottom. He lies there for a moment, trying to focus his
               eye. Stabbing pain in his shoulder and leg. Finally he rises
               unsteadily to his feet, looks around, trying to get his bearings.
               He finds himself at the bottom of...
               
               THE WILSHIRE CANYON
               
               Straight down Wilshire Boulevard is an enormous canyon, a river
               bottom gouged out of concrete in the big earthquake. At least 30
               feet deep, it is a vast trough leading past skyscrapers and
               buildings above, off into the distance.
               
               Plissken warily glances at his watch: 1 hour 10 minutes to go.
               
               Suddenly Plissken is struck by a pair of headlights. Pipeline's
               dune buggy comes bumping along the canyon bottom, sloshing through
               water, pulling up next to Plissken.
               
               PIPELINE
               Snake. Saw you at the game tonight. Great
               shot.
               (stares at him)
               You look like shit.
               
               Plissken hobbles over to the dune buggy as Pipeline gets out.
               
               PIPELINE
               You feel those pre-shocks, Snake?
               
               Pipeline unties the various surfboards he has lashed to the rear
               of the buggy. He lifts one down and slings it under his arm.
               
               PIPELINE
               Could be a big one comin' any minute
               now...

               Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
               
               PIPELINE
               Long gone. You'll never catch up with him
               now, Snake.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Where?
               
               PIPELINE
               Anaheim. Headquarters for everything. The
               whole town's gonna be there. Things
               changin' fast around here, Snake. It's not
               the same as the old days, man.
               
               A thumping sound skyward. More choppers thunder over them, on
               their way southeast. Plissken grabs Pipeline with his good hand...
               
               PLISSKEN
               Take me there...
               
               But he's too weak. His hand slides off. Plissken sinks to his
               knees. Pipeline stares at him.
               
               PIPELINE
               You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need
               help.
               (bends down, helps Plissken
               to his feet)
               You should talk to Hershe. She hates
               Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they
               split up.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Who?
               
               PIPELINE
               Hershe. She lives downtown with Mojo
               Dellasandro in the big boat. Down that
               way.
               
               Pipeline points down the canyon to the east.
               
               PIPELINE
               She's connected with the Black Cowboys,
               and they don't take shit from nobody...
               
               Suddenly that booming, shuddering rumble begins. The canyon starts
               to shake. The water in the canyon floor sloshes wildly.
               
               PIPELINE
               Yo', man. It's a big one.
               
               And the earthquake hits like a roaring sledgehammer. The walls of
               the canyon crack. Plissken and Pipeline are thrown to the ground.
               
               Skyscrapers above them on Wilshire rock and tremble in the quake.
               Pieces of the building sheer off, fall. A parking garage caves in.
               
               Thunder shakes the earth around Plissken and Pipeline. The canyon
               floor splits open. Water pours into the cracks. Huge boulder-sized
               chunks of concrete tumble down the canyon walls.
               
               And then suddenly it all stops.
               
               The booming subsides. The earth stops shaking. Plissken and
               Pipeline get to their feet, look around. The water around them
               continues to slosh about violently.

               Tsunami, Snake.
               
               His eyes wide, a smile on his face, Pipeline hurries over to the
               dune buggy, grabs another surfboard from the back, hands it to
               Plissken.

               Surf's up big time.
               
               Now there is another deep sound rising, coming from the west
               behind them: A bass roar that slowly climbs from the very bottom
               of the register upward, as if some massive wall of doom were on
               its way...
               
               Pipeline kneels, positions his surfboard in his hands.
               
               PIPELINE
               Get ready, Snake. It's gonna be some kinda
               ride.
               
               Plissken looks behind him...
               
               POV - THE FRONT EDGE OF THE TSUNAMI
               
               Is blasting down the Wilshire Canyon, coming right for them. It is
               a 25-foot wall of ocean water, moving fast, bellowing like a
               thunderclap.
               
               Plissken sees he can't climb out of the canyon in time, moves over
               to Pipeline, kneels down...
               
               PIPELINE
               Let the front edge pick you up. Don't get
               on your board till it peaks.
               
               Behind them, the tsunami slams along the canyon, coming right for
               them.
               
               PIPELINE
               Don't lose it, man. You slip off your
               board and it's the Big Wipeout, you know
               what I mean?
               
               The roaring is so loud it's like being on the inside of a cannon
               barrel. The tsunami is 100 feet away... 75 feet... 50 feet... 25
               feet... It rolls up right behind them...
               
               PIPELINE
               Hang on, Snake!

               YAAAAAAA!!!!
               
               THE FRONT EDGE
               
               Of the tsunami sweeps under them. Pipeline and Plissken push off
               from the canyon floor just as the water shovels them upward like a
               cow catcher on a train. The water sweeps them up until they
               disappear under the blackness...
               
               Until suddenly Pipeline pops up on top of the tsunami, riding on
               his surfboard, arms outstretched, feet braced.
               
               And then Plissken pops up beside him, surfing clumsily on top of
               the tsunami wave, kneeling on his surfboard.
               
               They blast down Wilshire Canyon at 80 miles an hour. Plissken is
               wobbly on the surfboard, but he manages to stay on top of the
               wave. Finally, he gets the hang of it, glances over at Pipeline,
               who grins from ear to ear.
               
               PIPELINE
               Awesome, Snake. AWESOME, man!
               
               Plissken looks up ahead...
               
               HIS POV - MOVING THROUGH WILSHIRE CANYON
               
               Five feet from street level. An old van speeds along what's left
               of Wilshire Boulevard, right on the canyon's edge. It veers around
               debris in the street, changes lanes suddenly, hell bent for
               leather.
               
               Plissken and Pipeline move closer and closer to the van as the
               tsunami sweeps them along.
               
               Now they move alongside the van and Plissken stares over...
               
               CLOSER - THE VAN
               
               Behind the wheel is Map To The Stars Eddie, driving like a
               lunatic, his teeth bared and set, madder than shit.
               
               Plissken's eye widens, burns.

               See you later.
               
               And suddenly Plissken shifts his weight, and the surfboard tips
               and slides sideways, across the surface of the tsunami all the way
               over to the edge, right next to the van. Map To The Stars Eddie
               glances to his left...
               
               HIS POV - PLISSKEN
               
               Is surfing the tsunami not 10 feet away from him.
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie stares in absolute horror. Plissken tips
               the board again, and slides another 5 feet closer...
               
               AS MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               
               Jams the pedal, and the van screams forward...
               
               AS PLISSKEN
               
               Stands up and leaps from the surfboard...
               
               For a moment he is airborne, leaping across the gap to the van...
               and slams into the side of the van. He grabs on to the roof, hangs
               on with one hand, his body whipping against the rocking, bucking
               side. Map To The Stars Eddie starts swerving, trying to throw
               Plissken off.
               

               EXT. VAN - WILSHIRE BOULEVARD
               
               The van shoots back and forth across Wilshire, Plissken dangling
               inches from the tsunami-filled canyon. Plissken pulls himself up
               and crawls onto the roof...
               
               INSIDE THE VAN
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie pulls his gun, cocks it...
               
               When suddenly Plissken's hand snakes down from the roof, reaches
               in the driver's window, grabs his hair, and slams his forehead
               into the steering wheel with a THOCK!
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie goes out like a light. He slumps over in
               the seat... but his foot is stuck on the accelerator.
               
               Plissken grabs the wheel with his left hand, and manages to steer
               the van from the roof. The van lurches wildly, hits a chunk of
               concrete in the street, skids, fishtailing violently from the
               impact. It smashes against the curb, screeches and bumps along
               concrete.
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie's foot is bumped right off the accelerator,
               and the van slows to a wobbling, grinding stop.
               
               Plissken slowly climbs down from the roof, opens the driver's
               door, shoves Map To The Stars Eddie out of the way, and jumps in.
               

               INT. VAN - NIGHT
               
               Plissken pulls out into the street and speeds off down Wilshire.
               Map To The Stars Eddie starts to come around.
               
               Plissken grabs his gun, cocks it, puts the barrel up against Map
               To The Stars Eddie's temple just as he comes to.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Listen up. I need directions. Downtown.
               Somebody named Hershe.

               Sure, Snake. No problem.

               You gonna kill me?
               
               PLISSKEN
               Later.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot
               you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God,
               man.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Cease fire with the bullshit.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Right. Keep goin' straight. Two blocks
               down, turn right.
               
               CLOSE ON A TV SCREEN
               
               Cuervo Jones' image fills the screen. He addresses the camera,
               holds the prototype in his hands.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Abandon your firebases by 0500 hours. Have
               the news media standing by for my

               PULL BACK from the TV screen to reveal we are in...
               

               INT. MAIN CONTROL ROOM - COMMAND HQ - NIGHT
               
               Malloy, the President, Brazen, and the other Controllers and
               Police Personnel stare silently at their TV screens.
               
               BRAZEN
               He must be bouncing the signal from one of
               our communications satellites.
               
               PRESIDENT
               That means CableNet has already picked it
               up. This thing's going live all over the
               country.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               (on the TV)
               It's a brand new day comin' up this
               morning, and I'm just so proud to be
               leading the parade. See you soon, putos.
               
               SSSZZZ. The image blinks off into static.
               
               A grim silence.
               
               MALLOY
               The prototype appears to be armed, Mr.
               President.
               (the President nods grimly)
               Shall I begin evacuation?
               
               PRESIDENT
               Does he know how to activate it?
               
               MALLOY
               Well, yeah. All you have to do is push the
               button.
               
               BRAZEN
               What about Plissken? He could still be -
               
               PRESIDENT
               Forget him. He's dead.
               
               MALLOY
               That may not be true, Mr. President.
               (beat)
               He's one tough case. Plissken's been dead
               so many times I can't count. But he never
               stays down.
               
               A long beat.
               
               MALLOY
               There are two choices, Mr. President. Wait
               for Plissken, or surrender. It's your
               decision.
               
               The President sighs heavily.
               

               EXT. DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT
               
               Jammed next to the remains of the Bonaventure Hotel is the Queen
               Mary, permanently dry-docked between the broken skyscrapers by the
               Big One.
               
               The van stops next to a huge hole in the side of the ship.
               

               INT. QUEEN MARY - NIGHT
               
               The glow of Map To The Stars Eddie's flashlight takes him and
               Plissken deeper and deeper into the hulking remains of the ship.
               

               INT. DECK OF SHOPS - NIGHT
               
               They walk through a dimly lighted area lined with shops. Their
               glass display windows are covered with layers of impenetrable
               dirt.
               

               INT. LONG CORRIDOR - NIGHT
               
               They enter a long, narrow corridor. At the end is a doorway. There
               is light in the room beyond.
               

               INT. VICTORIAN SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT
               
               Plissken and Map To The Stars Eddie enter a long room lit by gas
               jets on the walls. In it is a crumbling, Victorian swimming pool.
               A heavy mist rises from the pool's surface and hangs over
               everything.
               
               At the far end is a group of people. Spinal and the Black Cowboy
               Gang. Boots, spurs, dusters, and guns.
               
               Mojo Dellasandro. Jamaican Voodoo witch doctor. A brutal, scowling
               face. And a beautiful woman in a bathing suit, her back facing us.
               
               Plissken and Map To The Stars Eddie approach.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Hey, Hershe. How're you doin'?
               
               The woman turns and faces them. This is HERSHE, an absolutely
               drop-dead, gorgeous transvestite who looks completely convincing
               as a woman but talks in Isaac Hayes' voice.
               
               SPINAL
               (eyes brightening)
               Hershe - it's Snake Plissken.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Yeah, Hershe. I brought him to see you.
               
               Plissken walks right up to Hershe, has no reaction at all to the
               transvestite.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I need a favor.
               
               HERSHE
               What's in it for me?
               
               Plissken stares, a glimmer of recognition on his face.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Wait a minute. I know that voice.
               (beat)
               You're Carjack Malone.
               
               HERSHE
               Not anymore.
               
               SPINAL
               You two know each other?
               
               Plissken is seething. Hershe remains calm, glacial.
               
               PLISSKEN
               You owe me. You left me holdin' everything
               back there in Cleveland.
               
               SPINAL
               (astounded)
               Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
               
               PLISSKEN
               Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O'Shay.
               
               HERSHE
               I was called away on urgent business,
               Snake.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Don't lie to me.
               
               HERSHE
               All right, so I made another deal.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I got a new deal for you.
               
               Plissken raises Map To The Stars Eddie's gun, aims it right
               between Hershe's eyes.
               
               PLISSKEN
               You help me, you live.
               
               The others tense, hands on guns.
               
               SPINAL
               I wouldn't be doin' that, Snake.
               
               HERSHE
               We have a little arrangement. Anything
               happens to me, you're dead.
               
               PLISSKEN
               I'm already dead.
               
               HERSHE
               (long beat)
               I see your point. What's the favor?
               
               PLISSKEN
               (looks at his watch)
               Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the
               Kingdom. I got one hour.
               
               HERSHE
               Dream on, blue eye.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Say goodnight, Carjack.
               
               Plissken cocks his gun, starts to squeeze the trigger...
               
               HERSHE
               Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.
               
               SPINAL
               Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two
               armies. No one gets near him.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               And he's got the prototype. And the girl.
               He holds all the cards.
               
               HERSHE
               Exactly what is this prototype? What does
               it do?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               You push the button, it sends a signal to
               a ring of space defense satellites.
               They're orbiting bombs. Nukes. They
               explode. Huge space burst.
               (beat)
               EMP. Electromagnetic Pulse. It happens
               instantly when a nuke is airburst. EMP
               shuts down every power source below the
               satellites - instantly. All electrical
               devices, computers, cars, airplanes,
               cities. It's the dark ages again.
               
               HERSHE
               So whoever has it runs the show.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               They were gonna use it on South America,
               Africa, Asia - any country hostile to the
               United States.
               
               SPINAL
               Only Cuervo's got it now.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               And that ring of satellites will be in
               position over the U.S. at 5:00 a.m. this
               morning.
               
               PLISSKEN
               How do you know all this?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               I used to represent the guy who invented
               it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit.
               
               A long silence.
               
               HERSHE
               So what's the deal, gorgeous?
               
               PLISSKEN
               We get the girl and the prototype. And we
               get out.
               
               SPINAL
               All of us?
               
               PLISSKEN
               Yeah.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Me too?
               
               PLISSKEN
               (stares at him hard)
               We'll see.
               
               HERSHE
               Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we
               gonna go? What's the payoff?
               
               SPINAL
               I'd like to get out but I don't have
               enough money.
               
               PLISSKEN
               The President's promised to give whoever
               helps me 1 million dollars.
               
               SPINAL
               Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of
               them.

               Uh-uh. Bluebacks.
               
               This gets everyone's attention.

               Aw, come on, Snake.

               Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear

               HERSHE
               I don't know, sounds thin to me.

               Plissken, Hershe, Map To The Stars Eddie, Spinal and the Black
               Cowboy Gang stand on the top deck of the Queen Mary. Mojo
               Dellasandro straps each man into his own hang glider rig. The wind
               whips around them. The hillsides in the distance are on fire.
               
               They look like strange oversized moths lined up on the edge of the
               deck. The wind picks up Map To The Stars Eddie's rig. He bumps up
               and down, side to side, buffeted wildly until Mojo Dellasandro
               brings him back down to the decking.

               Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack?
               
               HERSHE
               My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you
               understand, cowboy?
               
               As Mojo Dellasandro passes out various weapons to the men, Map To
               The Stars Eddie leans over to Plissken, their hang glider rigs
               thumping clumsily into each other. Eddie holds up that small,
               metal-plated portable radio he was carrying when we first met him.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               I got an idea, Snake.
               (shows Plissken the radio)
               This looks like the prototype, right?
               
               PLISSKEN
               Yeah, kinda.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on
               Cuervo.
               
               PLISSKEN
               If he lets you get close enough.
               
               HERSHE
               The wind's up. Let's go.
               
               The men brace themselves. Map To The Stars Eddie looks like he
               wants to die.
               
               Hershe looks over at Plissken and grins.
               
               HERSHE
               See you in hell, Snake.
               
               PLISSKEN
               If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without
               me.
               
               With that Plissken launches himself off the deck, sailing out over
               open space, then down toward the street...
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Gliding through the air, as the wind picks him upward. He arcs
               away from the street level, up toward the remains of the downtown
               skyscrapers. Behind him, one after another, the group takes off
               into the wind, diving, rising with the wind.
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie makes a rapid suicidal dive right down
               toward the pavement below. He screams like a madman until the wind
               lifts him at the last possible second.
               

               EXT. TOPS OF SKYSCRAPERS - NIGHT
               
               The group of hang gliders sweep past the buildings. A bracero
               family is having dinner by candlelight two feet from the edge of a
               sheer precipice, as the side of the skyscraper they live in has
               been torn off. They wave to Plissken as he passes.
               
               Two floors down, someone has hooked up huge speakers and a
               croaking male voice is singing a Barbra Streisand hit to a
               background track.
               
               A beautiful girl in a sheer diaphanous gown dances far out on a
               narrow girder, waving a scarf at the moon.
               
               Plissken and the others now fly in formation, like avenging bats
               through the night, except for Map To The Stars Eddie who keeps
               rising and plunging violently, barely in control.
               

               EXT. DISNEYLAND - NIGHT
               
               An army of vehicles and people pour into Disneyland - but it's a
               Disneyland gone to hell. A huge sign reads: "THE HAPPY KINGDOM"
               
               The gates no longer exist. The overhead tram lies broken on the
               ground. Slowly vehicles drive straight inside...
               
               A battered old limousine carries Cuervo Jones and a grim-looking
               Utopia past the ruins of the train and around the ghost-town
               square of Main Street. Ahead is the fairy castle, broken and
               crumbling, like some relic from a nightmare. Around it are the
               thrill rides, tossed in to a jumbled mass by the force of the
               original earthquake.
               
               Crowds are waiting. Gangs of every conceivable description. Ethic
               gangs. Female gangs. Gangs of children. Also families with
               hangers-on. As soon as the limousine appears, the crowds begin
               cheering.
               

               INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
               
               Cuervo Jones stares out at the masses.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               They're simple people. They love a party.
               (turns to Utopia)
               We're gonna throw them one hell of a party
               when we get to America. Right?
               
               Utopia is silent, sullen. Cuervo raises his hand to her and she
               jumps, cowering.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Put a smile on your face.
               
               A terrified smile spreads across Utopia's face.
               

               EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT
               
               As the limousine inches down Main Street, suddenly a wall of
               headlights pop on. 100 or so battered old vintage Chevys rev their
               engines, begin bouncing up and down wildly on hydraulic lifts.
               Gangs begin cheering, firing their weapons into the air like New
               Year's Eve.
               
               At the end of Main Street is a huge open area - almost an arena,
               beyond which are parked a literal army of helicopters.
               
               As the limousine stops, and Cuervo Jones emerges, Utopia on his
               arm, the cheering begins, a wall of sound through the park. Three
               Black Muslims step out to greet Cuervo, dressed in turban-like
               headgear and sunglasses, wearing black capes and carrying old
               Thompson machine guns. They stop, give the right-handed power
               salute. One of them, BIVOUAC, speaks to Cuervo.
               
               BIVOUAC
               Cuervo Jones. Welcome, my Brother.
               
               Cuervo Jones turns to the crowd, extends his arms.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Are you ready for the New World?
               
               And the loudest, longest cheer you've ever heard goes up.
               

               EXT. SKIES ABOVE DISNEYLAND - NIGHT
               
               Plissken and the group sail through the sky like silent avenging
               angels toward Disneyland below them and several miles away.
               
               PLISSKEN
               
               Glances at his wrist watch. Only 20 minutes left. Map To The Stars
               Eddie swings wildly over in his direction, manages to stabilize
               his glider for a few moments.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Is that what I think it is?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Yeah. The place kept changing owners.
               Finally went bankrupt. That thing in Paris
               killed 'em.
               
               Hershe and Spinal sweep over next to Plissken and fly in close
               formation.
               
               HERSHE
               Snake. We need some kind of diversion.
               
               A beat later all of them look over at Map To The Stars Eddie.
               

               EXT. MAIN STREET - THE ARENA - NIGHT
               
               Cuervo Jones leads Utopia toward a large attack helicopter out in
               front of all the others. The choppers are all starting up,
               roaring, blades turning.
               
               Suddenly shooting down out of the sky is a screaming, yelling, Map
               To The Stars Eddie diving out of control, eyes wide as he passes
               Cuervo Jones and Utopia.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Cuervo. Hey, man, I made it! I made it!
               Wait for me...
               
               KAWHUMP!
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie crash lands into the ruins of a fast food
               restaurant - KACRUNCH!
               
               A beat or so later he staggers out of the rig, dizzy and confused.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Hey Cuervo...
               
               Cuervo Jones turns to Bivouac.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Would you please kill him for me?
               
               BIVOUAC
               My pleasure.
               
               Bivouac raises his machine gun...
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Cuervo, wait! I got news. There's about to
               be an attack.
               
               Cuervo holds up his hand, stopping Bivouac. Everyone tenses. Map
               To The Stars Eddie races over...
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               You're about to get hit, Cuervo. It's
               Plissken.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               You told me he was dead.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               I thought he was, but he came back.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Where?
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie moves close to Cuervo, out of breath,
               looking like he may faint...
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Oh Cuervo...
               
               CUERVO JONES
               (long beat)
               What?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               (stalling)
               It's so good to see you again.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               Where's Plissken?
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               He's... near.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               You're stalling, Eddie.
               (grabs him)
               Talk, you little gringo!
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               (eyes wide)
               Cuervo, look out behind you!
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie suddenly grabs Cuervo as if to protect him,
               and manages to wrap himself around the prototype in Cuervo's hand.
               At the same moment Bivouac and the Black Muslim open fire on an
               old storefront behind Cuervo Jones. The place is shredded.
               
               Cuervo Jones pulls Map To The Stars Eddie up off the ground, and
               grabs what looks like the prototype out of his clutches.
               
               CUERVO JONES
               You've lied to me for the very last time.
               
               Cuervo Jones pulls out a pistol, cocks it, aims at Map To The
               Stars Eddie's face...
               
               KABLOOM! No, not the pistol. A huge explosion rocks Main Street.
               
               WHOOSH! Suddenly out of the night sky Spinal and the Black Cowboys
               dive right down across Main Street.
               
               KABLAM! Another explosion sends everyone scurrying for cover.
               
               Spinal pulls the pin on a grenade, throws it...
               
               BLAMM! BLOOM! Explosions erupt everywhere!
               
               Cuervo Jones grabs Utopia, turns to run toward to the lead
               helicopter when...
               
               Plissken roars down out of the sky and his him full force. Cuervo,
               Plissken and the hang glider go tumbling and crashing in a heap.
               
               SERIES OF FAST CUTS:
               
               Chaos and pandemonium. Hershe dives down over the gangs, ripping
               hellfire from his automatic rifle.
               
               People running. Explosions.
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie grabs Utopia.
               
               Plissken and Cuervo Jones get to their feet and have at it!
               
               Through flames and running people Plissken and Cuervo battle.
               
               In Cuervo's hand is a long black knife. Just as he's plunging it,
               Plissken steps aside and grabs him. Locked together, they battle
               savagely.
               
               The knife cuts Plissken's chest.
               
               Cuervo moves for Plissken's throat.
               
               Plissken smashes him in the face.
               
               They both grip the knife in a deadlock.
               
               From above, Spinal dives down and hurls a grenade. Cuervo and
               Plissken disappear in a huge flash of fire and smoke as the
               grenade erupts out of the pavement nearby.
               
               When the smoke clears, three things are on the ground. Plissken.
               Cuervo Jones. The prototype.
               
               Instantly Plissken and Cuervo dive for the prototype. Plissken has
               it, kicks Cuervo in the face, drags himself to his feet and takes
               off running (as fast as a man can run with one bullet in his leg)
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie drags Utopia toward the lead helicopter, as
               Hershe comes in for a landing.
               
               Spinal comes in for a landing, continues to throw grenades. The
               other Black Cowboys land, provide covering fire.
               
               Plissken races for the chopper. Behind him, Cuervo Jones is on his
               feet and in pursuit.
               
               Hershe opens fire at Cuervo. Cuervo dives behind a smoking,
               burning Chevy.
               

               INT. HELICOPTER COCKPIT
               
               As everyone scrambles in. A Black Cowboy is hit by gunfire, slides
               down the bulkhead and out the door.
               
               Plissken jumps in the left seat, takes the controls. Utopia and
               Map To The Stars Eddie both climb in the right seat together. The
               others are in the back, firing back at the gangs. Plissken pulls
               in power.
               
               CLOSE - ROTOR R.P.M. GAUGE
               
               The needle's at 100% plus. Full power.
               

               EXT. LEAD HELICOPTER
               
               The lead chopper shudders, trying to get off the ground. Gunfire
               continues.
               

               INT. HELICOPTER
               
               The ship shakes violently.
               
               PLISSKEN
               She's overloaded! We're too heavy.
               
               HERSHE
               (screams from the rear
               compartment)
               Somebody get off!
               
               SPINAL

               Who?
               
               All eyes quickly move to Map To The Stars Eddie...
               
               KABLAM!
               
               Bullets rip through the windscreen.
               
               POV - AN ARMY OF GANGS
               
               Is moving, through the smoke, charging the ship!
               

               INT. LEAD HELICOPTER
               
               The ship trembles. Plissken moves his feet, jams in the left tail-
               rotor pedal all the way.
               

               EXT. THE LEAD HELICOPTER
               
               Rotates, turns around 180 degrees on the ground, pushed by the
               tail rotor force.
               
               THE CYCLIC CONTROL
               
               As Plissken inches it forward...
               
               THE HELICOPTER
               
               Begins sliding across the ground, skids grinding along the
               pavement, sparks flying - slowly at first, now picking up speed...
               
               In the cockpit, the ship lurches and jumps and slams! Everyone is
               bounced around.
               
               The helicopter moves fast now - faster -
               
               LOW ANGLE ON THE SKIDS
               
               As they rise up, an inch off the ground - then two inches - then a
               foot -
               
               Cuervo Jones emerges from the smoke, running ahead of the other
               gangs, barreling toward the ever-so-slowly rising chopper...
               
               THE LEAD HELICOPTER
               
               As it lifts - five feet - climbing...
               
               The helicopter pulls away from the charging gangs and Cuervo's
               sprinting figure.
               
               POV THROUGH WINDSCREEN
               
               See the Matterhorn ahead, coming closer and closer. Hershe leans
               out the door.
               
               HERSHE
               We're not gonna make it over the fuckin'
               mountain!
               
               The helicopter moves right toward the edge of the Matterhorn, 15
               feet... 10... Plissken tries to maneuver out of the way... 8
               feet... 5...
               
               The helicopter wobbles over the top of the mountain, the right
               skid catching on the Matterhorn's edge! A horrible cracking sound,
               and the right skid is ripped off from its front mounting, hanging
               half off the ship!
               
               On the ground, Cuervo Jones jumps into one of the waiting
               helicopters as now the gangs race into ships and begin lifting off
               into the sky. Finally Cuervo's chopper lifts off...
               

               EXT. FIREBASE SEVEN - NIGHT
               
               An alarm horn sounds. Everyone is on the move.
               

               INT. MAIN CONTROL ROOM - COMMAND HQ - NIGHT
               
               A crowd surrounds a computer screen with a small green blip moving
               over a grid of L.A.
               
               COM OFFICER
               Aircraft leaving the island, sir. It's
               passed into restricted space, heading this
               way.
               
               Malloy, the President, and Brazen exchange glances.
               
               PRESIDENT
               Is it Plissken?
               
               Nobody knows.
               
               COM OFFICER
               Commander, I'm getting radio contact with
               the aircraft.
               
               MALLOY
               Boost it.
               
               The COM Officer flips a switch, and we hear Plissken's voice
               booming through HQ.
               
               PLISSKEN (V.O.)
               Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in.
               
               PRESIDENT
               Thank God.
               
               MALLOY
               (grabs a radio mike)
               Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the
               prototype?
               

               INT. LEAD HELICOPTER - NIGHT
               
               PLISSKEN
               (into his radio)
               Yeah, I got it.
               
               Plissken glances at the transistor radio in his hand, shoves it in
               his boot, reaches his hand out to Map To The Stars Eddie.
               
               PLISSKE
               (to Map To The Stars Eddie)
               Now give me the real one.
               
               Utopia stares into Plissken's eye.
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie shrugs innocently
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               I couldn't make the switch, Snake. I don't
               have it.
               
               Suddenly Utopia reaches into Map To The Stars Eddie's coat and
               pulls out the real prototype. She hands it to Plissken
               
               UTOPIA
               Now we're even, Snake.
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie makes a lunge for it, but Plissken whacks
               him in the face. His head bobs slowly back and forth for a moment,
               then he slumps in the seat.

               company.
               
               Malloy and the others look at the computer screen. Plissken's
               green blip is followed by hundreds of other green blips all
               rapidly closing in on him...

               PLISSKEN
               I think we've burned off enough fuel. We
               may be lighter enough to hover. Just
               barely.
               
               HERSHE
               Can you land?
               
               PLISSKEN
               No. The right skid's broken. If I try to
               set it down she'll crash. I have to stay
               in a hoverwhile you jump off.
               (beat as Plissken looks at
               Utopia)
               Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give
               her your dress.
               
               HERSHE
               (ice cold)
               My name is no longer Carjack. Will you
               please get that through your fucking head?
               
               SPINAL
               Holy shit.
               
               They look, as suddenly the night sky on either side of them is
               filled with gang helicopters!
               

               EXT. SKY OVER THE SAN FERNANDO SEA - NIGHT
               
               The lead helicopter is surrounded by enemy choppers. Above, below,
               on either side.
               
               Right next to Plissken, Cuervo's chopper pulls up just ten feet
               away. Cuervo grins out at Plissken evilly, unhooks himself from
               his seat...
               
               On the other side, another chopper with Bivouac and the Black
               Muslims pull up. In the rear compartment, a Black Muslim aims what
               looks like a huge harpoon gun mounted to the floor.
               
               KAWHAM!
               
               The line shoots out and a gleaming grappling hook slams into the
               side of Plissken's chopper, the prongs clawing in, holding. In the
               lead helicopter, the Black Cowboys, Spinal and Hershe aim their
               weapons.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Don't shoot! They can drag us down into
               the sea.
               
               Cuervo Jones leaps from the opened door of his chopper, flies
               through space, lands on Plissken's door with a WHUMP! He smashes
               through the side window and grabs Plissken.
               
               KABLAM! KABLAM! Gang choppers open fire, riddling the rear
               compartment with bullets. Spinal and several Black Cowboys are
               hit!
               
               Plissken fights Cuervo through the door.
               
               PLISSKEN
               (to Utopia)
               Take the controls!
               
               Utopia stares at him.
               
               UTOPIA
               What do I do?
               
               But Cuervo wrenches the door open, grabs Plissken, and pulls him
               out of the seat. Utopia grabs the controls.
               
               The lead helicopter goes wild, lurching and swinging and dropping.
               Plissken and Cuervo are locked in a death grip, hanging on to the
               doorway, one foot in, one foot out.
               
               Plissken embraces Cuervo and throws them both over the edge...
               
               They fall through space, locked together, until...
               
               WHAP! They are jolted to a dead stop, swinging in mid-air,
               Plissken's arm wrapped around the dangling right skid.
               
               The lead helicopter bucks and spins and swings, Plissken and
               Cuervo suspended below, struggling to the death, whipped back and
               forth by the helicopter's gyrations.
               
               In the cockpit, Utopia grabs the controls. The ship is shaking,
               swinging like a pendulum. Hershe is hit with gunfire, flops in the
               rear compartment. Map To The Stars Eddie slowly regains
               consciousness, stares in horror at Utopia.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Where's Plissken?
               
               Outside, Cuervo clutches Plissken around the neck, struggling and
               thrashing. Plissken head butts him, dazing him for a second...
               
               KA-CRACK! The dangling skid is breaking loose from its mounting on
               the helicopter above. Plissken and Cuervo Jones stare up, then at
               each other, then both begin pulling themselves up the skid,
               climbing hand over hand, in a desperate race...
               
               Both men reach the bottom of the helicopter and leap across to the
               left skid as the dangling right skid breaks off and falls into the
               San Fernando Sea. Plissken and Cuervo kick at each other. Plissken
               slides away from him, looks up... sees the grappling hook stuck
               into the side of the helicopter...
               
               Plissken swings up, straddling the skid. He reaches up and begins
               prying loose the grappling hook. Cuervo's coming right up behind
               him, reaching for him, a huge knife in his hands. He raises the
               knife - when Map To The Stars Eddie leans out of the cockpit door,
               lowers a gun and aims it right at Cuervo.
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               Hey, Cuervo.
               
               Cuervo looks at him, starts to say something, eyes bulging...
               
               MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
               If you get to America - let's do lunch.
               
               KABLAM! KABLAM! The shots hit, and Cuervo buckles, falls backwards
               off the skid, plunging downward toward the surface of the San
               Fernando Sea... KASPLASH!
               
               Plissken rips out the grappling hook...
               
               AS BOOM!
               
               Map To The Stars Eddie is hit with gunfire, dies, falls out of the
               seat, out of the door, out of the helicopter - plunges to the
               water below.
               
               Plissken jumps back inside the cockpit.

               Police battle helicopters thunder toward them. In unison, the
               police helicopters launch their missiles from gun platforms.
               Burning, white-sulfurous napalm shells streak across the darkness
               and hit enemy choppers. The sky around the lead helicopter is
               filled with explosions, waves of rolling fire, falling flaming
               wrecks plunging past, as enemy choppers begin to hit the water.
               
               It is a dreamlike, slow-motion ballet. Huge black police gun ships
               circle lazily around the enemy choppers, their flex-guns and
               rockets spitting blue-white fire. The pound the living hell out of
               the enemy choppers. In f.g. Plissken's helicopter sweeps over the
               wall.

               Malloy, the President, Brazen and the rest the Firebase watch as
               Plissken's helicopter approaches, then zooms right over Rotor City
               and heads for the distant treeline.

               Plissken's helicopter comes in, lower and lower, into a hover five
               feet above the ground. Inside, Plissken pulls in all the power
               he's got.
               
               PLISSKEN
               It's taking all the power we've got to
               hover.

               PLISSKEN
               Jump out. Head for the treeline and
               disappear.
               
               Utopia stares at him.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Go!
               
               Utopia jumps out of the helicopter... lands on the ground and
               takes off running into the darkness. Inside...
               
               PLISSKEN
               All right, baby. Don't be too rough on me.
               We're gonna land.
               
               Plissken slowly drops the collective control. The left skid sets
               down, and the ship continues to descend, tips, begins to roll.
               Inside, as the chopper rolls over, Plissken braces himself. As the
               blades hit the ground, the chopper goes wild. The fuselage jumps
               and twists in a grinding fury. Smoke and debris fly. The blades
               snap off...
               
               FROM BEHIND PLISSKEN - INSIDE
               
               Looking out the front, the blades smash through the windscreen,
               barely missing the top of Plissken's head. Plissken is splattered
               with glass, a piece of metal debris protrudes from the fleshy part
               of his biceps. Blood pours. The rear compartment explodes into
               flames as the engine grinds into the gas tank. Fire billows into
               the cockpit, engulfing Plissken...
               
               Outside, Plissken pulls himself out of the door. He is on fire.
               Dives away from the copper and rolls across the ground just as the
               flaming mid-section of the ship explodes in a roaring fireball.
               
               Plissken climbs to his feet, smoking, wounded...
               
               ... as Malloy, the President, Brazen, and a squad of police arrive
               in vehicles. They slowly get out...
               
               ... as Plissken limps toward them...
               
               PLISSKEN
               Where's the anti-toxin...?
               
               PRESIDENT
               Give me the prototype.
               
               Plissken reaches into his boot, hands it to the President.
               
               MALLOY
               Hold it, Plissken. Now give us the real
               one.
               
               Plissken reaches down into his other boot, comes out with Map To
               The Stars Eddie's transistor radio. The President hurls the real
               prototype away, walks to Plissken and grabs the phony. Plissken
               glances at it lying on the ground.
               
               Nobody moves. Plissken looks at their faces.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Give me the goddamn shot!
               
               Suddenly everyone begins to smirk. A couple cops laugh.
               
               MALLOY
               It was all a fake, Plissken.
               
               Plissken stares at him. More laughter.
               
               BRAZEN
               You were injected with glucose. There is
               no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going
               to die - at least not from anything we
               gave you.
               
               MALLOY
               C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's
               phony, you know that.
               
               Plissken moves toward the President, stops inches away.
               
               MALLOY
               Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride,
               and you came through. Not bad for a
               dirtbag like you.
               
               PRESIDENT
               You're free, Plissken. But if you even so
               much as break wind on a country road I'll
               crush you like a bug.
               
               The President glares at Plissken, turns, walks away.
               
               COP (O.S.)
               Commander...
               (Malloy looks at him)
               Look what we found.
               
               Across the clearing come two policemen dragging Utopia along with
               them. They bring her up in front of Malloy. Utopia glances at
               Plissken.
               
               MALLOY
               You didn't finish the mission, Plissken.
               We'll have to do that for you.
               
               Plissken, Malloy and Brazen watch as Utopia is taken away. Finally
               Plissken turns to Malloy.
               
               PLISSKEN
               Got a smoke?
               
               MALLOY
               You're gonna have to learn to respect the
               law, Snake. The United States is a no-
               smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking,
               do drugs, no women unless you're married,
               no guns, no foul language. It's a brand
               new day for you, Snake.
               
               PLISSKEN
               The name's Plissken.
               
               Plissken walks away. Follow his feet as they stop next to the
               prototype lying in the grass...
               

               INT. STEEL-WALLED HALLWAY - DEPORTATION CENTER - NIGHT
               
               Utopia is being strapped into an electric chair by her police
               guards. The guards step back from Utopia. One of them walks over
               to a huge switch on the wall.
               

               EXT. FIREBASE SEVEN - DAWN
               
               TRACKING SHOT WITH PLISSKEN
               
               He holds the real prototype, calmly pushes the button.
               

               EXT. SPACE - DAWN
               
               The ring of space satellites hover silently above the Earth. See
               the United States, North America below, as a beautiful sunrise is
               beginning.
               
               Suddenly the satellites explode into white...
               

               EXT. FIREBASE SEVEN - DAWN
               
               As the sky is lit white. Malloy, Brazen, and the cops look up. All
               vehicles stop. Lights out. Sounds of motors running down.
               

               INT. STEEL-WALLED HALLWAY - DEPORTATION CENTER - DAWN
               
               Darkness. No power. Everyone looks around. Utopia smiles.
               

               EXT. FIREBASE SEVEN - DAWN
               
               The daylight is coming as police helicopters fall from the sky,
               crashing. Panic. Policemen run everywhere. A duty sergeant races
               up to Malloy...
               
               DUTY SERGEANT
               We're being attacked, Commander. The north
               wall.
               

               EXT. WALL - DAWN
               
               All of L.A. has arrive at the wall in boats. Gangs lean ladders,
               use ropes and hooks - they scale the wall. Pendejo Bob leads the
               charge. Pipeline is right behind him.
               

               EXT. TOP OF THE WALL - DAWN
               
               Gunfire. A pitched battle as cops try to repel the horde of L.A.
               invaders as they pour over the wall.
               

               EXT. FIREBASE SEVEN - DAWN
               
               The Firebase is overrun by invaders. Hand-to-hand combat. World
               War III has begun. Panicked cops race for the trees, abandoning
               their positions.
               

               INT. STEEL-WALLED HALLWAY - DEPORTATION CENTER
               
               The Third World warriors free Utopia from the electric chair. She
               joins them as they swarm through the halls...
               

               EXT. HILLSIDE - FIREBASE SEVEN - DAWN
               
               Plissken is at the edge of the Firebase, moving out into the
               hillside. Camera tracks with him towards the rising sun.
               
               A smile crosses Plissken's face. He tosses the prototype down a
               ravine, and walks away into the sunrise.
               
               FADE OUT
               
               THE END

FADE OUT 1997

EXT. STATUE OF LIBERTY SECURITY CONTROL -- NIGHT.
A Jeep pulls up outside the base.  It comes to a stop and the driver
pulls out a walkie-talkie.

DRIVER
This is Gotham 4, North Bay, Station 17.  I have an escape in progress.
An object in mid-bay moving toward the wall.

TILT UP -- WALL
EXT. CLOSE UP -- SIGN "New York Maximum Security Penitentiary Manhattan
Island"

CONTINUED TILT UP -- EXT. WALL -- NIGHT
Two guards watch for the escapees in question.

EXT. MANHATTAN ISLAND -- NIGHT
A helicopter flies over the bay towards Manhattan Island.

EXT. BOAT -- NIGHT
The two escapees paddle, trying to get across the bay.

EXT. HELICOPTER -- NIGHT
The search light WHITES OUT THE SCREEN

EXT. BOAT -- NIGHT
The two escapees continue paddling.  THEY'VE BEEN CAUGHT.

HELICOPTER PILOT
You have 10 seconds.  Turn around.  Start back to the island.

INT. HELICOPTER -- NIGHT
The pilot targets the boat on a computer screen in front of him.

EXT. BOAT -- NIGHT
Two shots are fired directly in front of the escapees as a warning.
They ignore them and continue paddling away from the island.

INT. HELICOPTER -- NIGHT
EXT. CLOSE UP -- PILOT'S HAND
The pilot FIRES AGAIN.

EXT. BOAT -- NIGHT
The boat EXPLODES.

EXT. HELICOPTER -- NIGHT
Following the helicopter as it returns to the base.

EXT. BASE -- NIGHT
Rehme walks back to the main base, pulling out his walkie-talkie on the
way.

REHME
Gotham 4, confirm the kill.

HELICOPTER PILOT
Circled the base.  Over.

REHME
Security, this is Rehme.  We have confirmation from Gotham 4.  We have a
kill in midharbor.  South of the battery.  Two in the water dead.

SECURITY
Two confirmed.

REHME
Very well.

EXT. BASE -- NIGHT
Rehme walks into a building labeled "LIBERTY ISLAND SECURITY CONTROL and
picks up a phone.

REHME
Air traffic, this is Rehme . . .

EXT. AIR TRAFFIC -- NIGHT
The helicopter lands.  In the background, a BUS FULL OF PRISONERS comes
up.

EXT. BUS -- NIGHT
S.D. "SNAKE" PLISSKEN gets off the bus, looks around, and is escorted by
three guards into the base.  He looks like the essence of cool.  His
hair is long, wavy, and ratty, he lost his left eye somewhere along the
line, and he's got a two-day beard thing going on.  He's wearing a black
spandex/kevlar type shirt with zippers across the shoulders, and a pair
of camouflage pants with lots of pockets.  His jacket is a brown leather
jacket that has seen far better days, and he's wearing a pair of
handcuffs that have, instead of the links we're used to, a straight
metal bar between them.  He's not resisting anything, but the police are
not taking any chances.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
Plissken and the guards follow a winding stairway down to the main
floor.

VOICE
Attention.  You are now entering the debarkation area.  No talking.  No
smoking.   The next scheduled departure to the prison is in two hours.
You now have the option to terminate and be cremated on the premises.
If you elect this option, notify the duty sergeant in your processing
area.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
EXT. CLOSE UP ON SIGN -- "No talking.  No smoking.  Follow the ORANGE
line."
EXT. CLOSE UP ON SNAKE.  He is not impressed.
STEADICAM VIEW OF THE HALL, SNAKE'S P.O.V. Guards, guards, more guards.
Who cares.

As Snake rounds the corner:

O.S. GUARD
Hold it.

Snake stops, turns, directs an impertinent glance at the speaker.  He's
still not impressed by any of this.

FADE OUT.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
FADE IN.
EXT. BASE -- NIGHT
Rehme waits as a limo pulls up.  Out steps BOB HAUK.

REHME
We've got a small jet in trouble, over restricted air space.

HAUK
Where is it?

REHME
Seven miles out and closing.

The two of them walk AWAY.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
Hauk and Rehme walk down the stairs.  They turn TOWARD US and walk into
the AIR TRAFFIC ROOM.  Dozens of men sit in front of radar transmission
screens, wearing headsets and working.   Following Hauk and Rehme into
the room:

INT. AIR TRAFFIC ROOM -- NIGHT

REHME
We've been on the board for the last twenty minutes.  We haven't been
able to reach them.  There was a transmission ten minutes ago.  He
identified as "David 14."  Then all of a sudden he was cut off.

Hauk and Rehme stand behind a CONTROLLER.

CONTROLLER
David 14, acknowledge.  David 14, we are sending Air Rescue.  Squawk
7700, contact on 121.5.
(to Hauk and Rehme)
There's still no reply.
(to his headset)
Bayonne.  I have a mayday in restricted space.

O.S. CONTROLLER
New York, I have it.

Hauk pulls Rehme aside.

HAUK
Who is it?

REHME
I don't know.

HAUK
You have the code?

REHME
There's no David 14 on the computer.

HAUK
Unlisted?

REHME
Unregistered code.  We telexed Washington.  Still waiting for a reply.

CONTROLLER
I think I've got him, sir.

Hauk and Rehme walk back over to the controller.  He patches a voice-
over through.

REBEL VOICE
It's too late, assholes.  All your imperialist weapons and lies can't
save him now.  We're going down.  We're going to crash.

CONTROLLER
David 14, acknowledge!

CODEMAN
The code's coming in, sir.

Hauk and Rehme dash over to the codeman.  He shows them a display.
"Aircraft Identified.  Code: David14.  Decode: AIR FORCE ONE."

"Air Force One" blinks as Hauk and Rehme look at each other in shock.

EXT. PLANE -- NIGHT
The plane is flying over New York.

INT. COCKPIT -- NIGHT
The REBEL has killed the pilot and copilot and is working on her own.

REBEL
Tell this to the workers when they ask where your leader went . . .

She pulls out a slip of PAPER and proceeds to read.

REBEL
We, the soldiers of the national liberation front of America, in the
name of the workers and all the oppressed of this imperialist country
have struck a fatal blow to the racist police stick!

INT. PLANE -- NIGHT
A secret service AGENT taps on the door with his rifle as the rebel
continues.

REBEL
What better revolutionary example than to let the president perish in
the inhuman dungeon of his own imperialist prison?

The agent runs back down the plane to the President and his advisers.

AGENT
(to 2ND AGENT)
Unlock the pod!

2ND AGENT immediately runs off.

PAN LEFT TO PRESIDENT.

AGENT
She's bolted the door.

PRESIDENT
Can't you shoot off the lock?

AGENT
No, sir, she's pressurized the cabin.

PRESIDENT
How about lifting the door off of the hinges?

AGENT
No, sir.

EXT. CLOSE UP -- The President's wrist as he handcuffs his briefcase to
it.

PRESIDENT
Get me to the pod.

The President and all his advisors stand up and move to the back of the
plane.

INT. POD ROOM -- NIGHT
The pod opens.  An expert attaches a locating device to the President's
wrist.

EXPERT
Sir, this is a locating device to trace you if you become separated from
the pod.  I'm activating it now.

SCREENS on the pod begin to light up as the President gets into the pod.
He pushes a few buttons.

PRESIDENT
God save me and watch over you all.

EXT. BASE -- NIGHT
A guard watches as Air Force One descends into New York.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
Rehme and Hauk watch a computer simulation of the plane.

VOICE
Computer simulation tracking Air Force One.

EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT
The plane goes down.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
EXT. CLOSE UP -- MONITORS
As the plane smashes into a building, a red dot drops through the
building.  It's the pod.

O.S. MAN
It's down!

HAUK
It's the escape pod.

REHME
40 degrees, 50 yards from impact.

HAUK
I'm going in.

EXT. BASE -- NIGHT
Helicopters prepare for, and execute, launch, and fly into New York.  A
guard watches them.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
Rehme watches monitors as Hauk talks.

HAUK
1-W-Larry.  Over the battery.  We're moving down.  Direct sight ahead.

EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT
The helicopters land.  A swarm of policemen run out, and Hauk hangs
back.  He follows with a second swarm.  The first swarm assumes a
defensive position near the pod.  Hauk examines the pod.  It's
definitely empty, and the rest of the jet is surrounded in flames.

An odd LAUGH from nowhere.

WEIRDO walks out of the darkness.  He nods his head to Hauk.

WEIRDO
You touch me... he dies.  If you're not in the air in thirty seconds...
he dies.  You come back in... he dies.

Weirdo takes a package out of his shirt and unwraps it to reveal the
President's middle finger, complete with ring.

WEIRDO
Twenty seconds.

HAUK
I'm ready to talk.

WEIRDO
Nineteen.  Eighteen.

HAUK
What do you want?

WEIRDO
Seventeen.  Sixteen.

HAUK
Let's go.  Let's go!

Weirdo grins in triumph as the police force swarms back to the
helicopters and hauls ass out of New York.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
Rehme stands behind a desk, talking on the phone.  Hauk is in the
foreground, looking pensive.

REHME
Yes, he's right here, Mr. Vice President.

Hauk picks up a phone.

HAUK
This is Bob Hauk.  ...We can't.  If we move in with choppers, they'll
kill him.  We're lucky if he's not dead already... They don't want
anything yet.  By the time they figure out what they want, it'll be too
late.

REHME
Tell him we have to go with your plan now.

Hauk waves him off.

HAUK
We can't wait until tomorrow.  If we have to move in and take the
island, it's a last resort.  It's 8:45.  I want permission to try a
rescue.  Thank you.

INT. HAUK'S OFFICE -- NIGHT
Hauk calmly arms a .45 pistol.  He looks up from his desk.

HAUK
All right.

OVERPROTECTIVE SECURITY GUARD
He's dangerous, sir.

HAUK
(with quiet confidence)
I know.  I'll be OK.

HAUK'S P.O.V.
We see the silhouette of an unmistakable figure.  It's Snake Plissken
all right, live and in the flesh.  The guards leave.  Snake walks into
Hauk's office and sits down in the chair across from Hauk.  He raises
his cuffed hands to Hauk as if to say "Take these off me, asshole," but
he doesn't actually say anything.  Hauk shakes his head.

HAUK
I'm not a fool, Plissken.

SNAKE
(coooooool)
Call me Snake.

Hauk puts on his glasses and proceeds to read a file.

HAUK
S.D. Plissken.  American Lieutenant.  Special Forces Unit, Black Flight.
Two Purple Hearts, Leningrad and Siberia.  Youngest man to be decorated
by the President.  You robbed the federal reserve depository.  Life
sentence, New York Maximum Security Penitentiary. I'm ready to kick your
ass out of the world, War Hero.

Snake could not care less.  He reaches forward with his still-cuffed
right hand, picks up a cigarette, picks up a match with his left hand,
strikes the match and takes a drag from his cigarette.  He lets out a
calm breath and says:

SNAKE
Who are you?

HAUK
Hauk.  Police Commissioner.

SNAKE
Bob Hauk...

HAUK
Special Forces Unit.  Texas Thunder.  We heard of you, too, Plissken.

SNAKE
Why are we talking?

HAUK
I have a deal for you.  You'll receive full pardon for every criminal
act committed in the United States.

Hauk shows Snake the pardon.  Snake's eye lights up.  This is something
he wants.  He's interested now, and can't hide it.

HAUK
(pressing his advantage)
There was an accident about an hour ago.  A small jet went down inside
New York City.  The President was on board.

SNAKE
(re-establishing control over the conversation)
President of what?

HAUK
That's not funny, Plissken.  (beat)  You go in, find the President and
bring him out in 24 hours, and you're a free man.

We sense amusement from Snake.  This is not the first time the
government has asked him for a favor.  But he's not a soldier or a "War
Hero" anymore.  He knows they need him more than he needs their pardon.
He's holding the cards now, and he knows it.

SNAKE
Twenty-four hours, huh?

HAUK
I'm making you an offer.

SNAKE
Bullshit.

HAUK
Straight just like I said.

SNAKE
I'll think about it.

HAUK
No time.  Give me an answer.

Snake turns away.  Hauk is pushing way too hard, and Snake is determined
to be in the driver's seat.

SNAKE
Get a new president.

HAUK
We're still at war, Plissken.  We need him alive.

SNAKE
I don't give a fuck about your war... or your president.

HAUK
Is that your answer?

SNAKE
I'm thinking about it.

HAUK
Think hard.

Snake pauses to take a draw on his cigarette.  Next question:

SNAKE
Why me?

HAUK
You flew the Gullfire over Leningrad.  You know how to get in quiet.
You're all I've got.

SNAKE
I guess I go in one way or the other.  Doesn't mean shit to me.  Give me
the paper.

HAUK
When you come out.

SNAKE
Before.

HAUK
I told you I wasn't a fool, Plissken.

SNAKE
Call me Snake.

INT. WEAPONS ROOM -- NIGHT
Rehme talks as we PAN ACROSS a table full of weapons.  We see two guns,
a belt, grenades, several pouches full of various stuff, a flashlight, a
Uzi, throwing stars, and more.  Snake surveys them with a cool
expression.

REHME
Some of them have cars.  They took old junkers that were left behind and
converted them to steam.  We think they may also have a gasoline source
in there, and power.  Greenhouses, rigged up generators.  Some areas
have streetlights. The crazies.  Live in the subways.  Complete control
of the underground.  They're night raiders.

Snake's not into this.  He'll figure it out when he gets there.  He
picks up a bracelet with an eagle on it.

HAUK
Tracer.  Sends a radio signal for fifteen minutes.  You push it, we can
track you on radar.  Just like Leningrad.  But they added something.  A
safety catch.

Snake pushes the safety catch.  Simple enough.  And yes, there's the
button.  This is familiar.  He smiles.

INT. HALL -- NIGHT
Snake has his jacket slung over his shoulder now.  He walks down the
hall to the medical room with Hauk.  Rehme has disappeared.

SNAKE
Where am I landing?

HAUK
Top of the world trade center.  Only place you can land.  They won't see
it, and you can take off from a free fall.  On the roof there's a
service elevator.  It's still operational.  We use it to infiltrate the
prison.  There's a power box.  It'll activate the elevator down to
fifty.  From there on down
you walk.

Snake shrugs on his jacket.  He knows Hauk is just trying to assert his
authority, and it's not working very well.

HAUK
You can locate the President by his vital signs bracelet, on his wrist.
It sends out a sig pulse.  Use this.

He hands Snake a homing device.

HAUK
Homing device.  Shows directions and distance.

INT. MEDICAL ROOM -- NIGHT
Snake and Hauk walk into the room.  They're met by a young medic.

HAUK
Strong antitoxin.  Stops bacteria and viral-proofs you for 24 hours.

Snake braces himself against a table.  The medic is holding an
injection-type tech gizmo.

MEDIC
Take off the jacket.

SNAKE
I'll be OK.

HAUK
Let's go, Plissken.

Snake shrugs off his jacket, disoriented by the place.  He's nervous.
His hackles are up.

SNAKE
I don't like needles.

Hauk straps a timer gauge onto Snake's left hand.  He activates it and
the time blinks on.  It's counting down as we speak.

HAUK
Twenty-two hours, twenty-nine minutes, fifty-seven seconds...

SNAKE
We talked about twenty-four.

HAUK
In twenty-two hours the Hartford Summit meeting will be over.  China and
the Soviet Union will go back home.  The president was on his way to the
summit when his plane went down.

Snake snorts.

HAUK
He has a briefcase attached to his wrist.  The tape recording inside has
to reach Hartford in 22 hours.

SNAKE
What's on it?

HAUK
You know anything about nuclear fusion?

Snake turns away.  No.  Nuclear fusion is not his area of expertise.

HAUK
It's about the survival of the human race, Plissken.  Something you
don't give a shit about.

Hauk steps aside.  The medic swabs Snake's neck on both sides.

MEDIC
I'm going to inject you.  It'll sting for a second or two...

He raises a couple of hypos and injects Snake with them.  Snake jumps a
little; clearly, this is not one of the world's most pleasant things.

HAUK
That's it, Plissken.

Snake gets off the table.  The medic turns around.

MEDIC
Tell him.

SNAKE
Tell me what?

Hauk thinks he's got him this time.  Snake doesn't like that.

HAUK
That idea you had about turning the Gullfire around 180 degrees and
flying off to Canada.

Hauk shakes his head.  Snake puts his jacket down and turns to the
medic.

SNAKE
What did you do to me, asshole?

HAUK
My idea, Plissken.  Something we've been fooling around with.  Two
microscopic capsules lodged in your arteries.  They're already starting
to dissolve.  In twenty-two hours, the cores will completely dissolve.
Inside the cores are that heat-sensitive charge.  Not a large explosive.
About the size of a pinhead.  Just big enough to --
(he gestures)
open up both your arteries.  I'd say you'd be dead in ten or fifteen
seconds --

Hauk stops talking because Snake has grabbed him by the throat.

SNAKE
TAKE THEM OUT NOW.

MEDIC
They're protected by the cores.  Fifteen minutes before the last hour is
up we can neutralize the charge with X-rays.

Snake lets go of Hauk to look at his watch.  22:57:38.  37.  36.  This
is his life he's watching tick away.

HAUK
We'll burn out the charges IF you have the President.

SNAKE
What if I'm a little late?

HAUK
No more Hartford Summit.  And no more Snake Plissken.

SNAKE
When I get back I'm going to kill you.

HAUK
The Gullfire's waiting.

EXT. RUNWAY -- NIGHT
Snake pulls up in a Jeep.  He walks up to the tiny plane called the
Gullfire.  Two guards stand by to make sure he just gets in the plane
and does his job.  He throws his cigarette out onto the runway and
closes the overhead window.

INT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT
Snake turns on his monitors.

SNAKE
I'm ready.

HAUK
21 hours.

SNAKE
Suppose he's dead, Hauk.  If I come back without him, you'll burn these
things out?

INT. BASE --- NIGHT
Hauk and Rehme exchange a glance; Hauk's been expecting this question to
come up.

HAUK
Get them both back, Plissken.

INT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT
Snake doesn't like the response, but figures he can't do anything about
it.

HAUK
Remember, once inside you're on your own.

SNAKE
Oh, you mean I can't count on you?

HAUK
No.

SNAKE
Good.

EXT. RUNWAY -- NIGHT
A larger plane hauls the Gullfire into the air; the Gullfire is
essentially a big hang glider.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
Hauk checks Snake's life clock, "Master Life Clock".
20:17:43... 42... 41....

INT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT
Snake's watch reads 20:17:40... 39... 38... 37... 36... 35...
He starts controlling the plane.  He flips the tracer open and hits the
button, testing it.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
The master life clock shows the test confirmation.

COMPUTER
Tracer test confirmed at 20 hours, 17 minutes, 30 seconds.

Hauk, Rehme and the Vice President nod with relief.

EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT
Snake takes the plane in.

INT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT
Snake looks over his monitors.  He sees New York coming up.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
Hauk waits at his microphone.

HAUK
Are you picking up the target blip?

INT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT

SNAKE
Right on course.

EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT
The plane aims for the World Trade Center.

INT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT

SNAKE
It's been a while . . .

The plane is aiming right at a building.

HAUK
How's your altitude?

Snake calmly angles the plane up.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT

HAUK
Plissken?  Plissken?  Plissken, what are you doing?

INT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT

SNAKE
Playing with myself.  I'm going in.

Snake targets the World Trade Center.  He checks his instruments.

EXT. WORLD TRADE CENTER -- NIGHT
The plane comes down.  It hits hard.  Snake puts on the brakes, adds a
grappling hook, and finally comes to a stop right at the edge.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT

HAUK
Plissken?  Plissken?

EXT. WORLD TRADE CENTER -- NIGHT
Snake walks over to the elevator.  He uses the power box to get the
elevator started.  He looks around, and the doors open.  He gets in the
elevator.  The doors close.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
Snake's voice comes through the radio.

SNAKE
I'm inside the World Trade Center on the 50th floor.  Just like
Leningrad, Hauk.

HAUK
Is the glider intact?

INT. WORLD TRADE CENTER -- NIGHT
Snake stands with his walkie-talkie in the middle of the graffiti-
covered building.

SNAKE
Yeah, but taking off is for shit.  I'll work it out.

HAUK
You'll have to use the east stairwell.  It'll take you a little while to
get to ground level.

Snake checks his life clock.  19:22:44. 43. 42.

HAUK
Call me when you get outside.

Snake puts his walkie-talkie away as someone runs past.  He doesn't
notice.  He walks on.

FADE OUT.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
FADE IN.
EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT
Snake walks along with his tracer.  He goes through alleys and streets.
He draws his gun as he walks by a group of people.  He's armed and ready
to fight.

EXT. PLANE CRASH -- NIGHT
The plane is still burning.  Smoke is coming from everywhere.  The plane
is severed in the middle.  The crash is very impressive.  Snake walks
and notices a few people go by.  He pulls out his walkie-talkie.

SNAKE
I'm at the plane.  Nobody else made it, Hauk.

Something beeps.  His tracer.

SNAKE
Wait a minute.

He looks at his tracer.  A small red dot lights up in the southeast
corner.

SNAKE
I've got his pulse.  Right up ahead, moving northwest.

He puts away his walkie-talkie and checks his life clock.  18:50:18.
17.  16.

DISSOLVE TO:
Images.  Snake holding the tracer.  He gets closer and comes up to a
building, formerly a theater.  He walks in.

INT. THEATER -- NIGHT
The pulse keeps getting stronger.  Snake walks in.  He holds his gun at
the ready.  There's a truly horrible musical going on.

INT. STAGE -- NIGHT

ACTORS
This is hell!  This is hate!  (etc.)

Snake looks around.  No sign of the president, but there is a CABBIE
enjoying the show.  Time to move on.  He enters against his better
judgment, but he's just passing through, so that's OK.

INT. STAIRWELL -- NIGHT
Snake keeps moving, but there's a noise.  He turns around, aiming his
gun.  Cabbie holds up his hands.

CABBIE
Hey!  You're Snake Plissken, ain't you?

SNAKE
What do you want?

CABBIE
Nothin'.

Snake lowers his gun.

CABBIE
I thought you were dead!

Snake moves on.

CABBIE
Hey!  You don't want to walk around down there, Snake!

INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT
The signal from the tracer keeps getting closer and closer.  Snake walks
past a gang beating up and stripping a semi-conscious girl.  He doesn't
take much notice.  He keeps going.  He sees a BUM sitting by a fire.

BUM
Hi, Chief.  Nice night.  Nice boots.  Niiiiice boots.  Hey.

A guy tries to sneak up behind Snake.  Snake knocks him out and points
his gun at the bum.

BUM
Easy now, chief.  I'm walking.  I'm walking.

The bum walks away.  Snake keeps going.  A man beats up another man at a
sink.  The beatee is wearing the President's life tracer.  Snake kicks
the beater and knocks him out.

SNAKE
Mr. President . . .

The man wearing the life tracer looks up and smiles.  He's a DRUNK.

DRUNK
I'm the President?  Sure, I'm the President.  If I knew where I got this
thing --
(indicates the tracer)
I'd be the President.

SNAKE
Where did you get it?

DRUNK
I woke up, and there it was, just like a miracle . . .

Snake slams the tracer against the sink.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
The President's life signs all fail.

OFFICIAL
Oh my god . . .

MEDIC
It . . . It may be just an impact on the mechanism itself . . .

INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT
Snake pulls up his walkie-talkie.

SNAKE
Hauk?!

INT. BASE -- NIGHT

HAUK
I'm right here, Plissken.

SNAKE
I don't know who you assholes are looking at, but it's NOT the
President.

INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT
Snake holds the walkie-talkie up to the drunk.

DRUNK
(to the tune of Joy to the World)
Hail to the chief . . . La la la la la la . . .

SNAKE
All right, get your machine ready.  I'm coming out.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT

HAUK
18 hours, Plissken.

INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT

SNAKE
Listen to me, Hauk.  The President is DEAD, you got that?  Somebody's
had him for dinner!

INT. BASE -- NIGHT

HAUK
Plissken, if you get back in that glider I'll shoot you down.  You climb
out, I'll burn you off the wall.  You understand that, Plissken?

INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT
Snake stares at his walkie-talkie.

SNAKE
A little human compassion . . .

EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT
Snake walks on.  He's in an area with streetlights.  He keeps going.

EXT. POD -- NIGHT
Snake stares at the pod.  No clues.  He looks around.  Nothing.  As he
comes back up, he sets up a chair and sits down heavily.  He touches his
neck.  It's like he can feel the cores dissolving.

A crazy walks past, bangs on manhole covers.  Snake doesn't know what
he's doing, but he doesn't like it.  Especially not when the manhole
covers start to rise up.  He runs off.

EXT. CHOCK FULL OF NUTS -- NIGHT
Snake finds the restaurant, and runs inside.  No one follows.

INT. CHOCK FULL OF NUTS -- NIGHT
Snake backs into a corner.  The floor is weak and starts to go out from
under him once.  He gets into the shadows.  There's someone there.

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
You a cop?

Snake levels his gun at her.

SNAKE
No . . .

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
You've got a gun.  You got a smoke?

Snake tosses her his cigarettes.  She lights one.

SNAKE
Keep your hand over it.

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
It's all right if we're quiet.  They won't hear us.
(reacting to the cigarette)
Hey, this is a real one.  You just get in?

SNAKE
What's going on out there?

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
Crazies.  It's the end of the month.  They're out of food.

SNAKE
Do you live here?

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
Skulls?  You kidding?  I'm with the Turks now.  I just got caught in the
street after dark and now I'm stuck here all night.

SNAKE
A plane crashed seven hours ago.  Did you see it?

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
No.

SNAKE
Shit.

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
You're a cop.

SNAKE
I'm an asshole.

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
Hey, wait a minute.  I know who you are.  Yeah!  But I heard you were
dead.

SNAKE
I am.

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
Wow, Snake Plissken.  All right!  What you doing in here with a gun,
Snake?

SNAKE
Looking for somebody.

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
Who?

SNAKE
The President.

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
Come on!  He really here?

SNAKE
Somewhere.

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
When you find him, are you gonna take him out?

SNAKE
Mm-hm.

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
Take me out with you, Snake.

SNAKE
Why?

GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
I can think of lots of reasons why . . .

She makes a move to kiss him, but there's a noise.  They split up, but
she gets sucked through the floor.  Snake tries to save her, but it's
too late.  He gets the hell out of there.

INT. BUILDING -- NIGHT, EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT, EXT. ALLEYS -- NIGHT
Snake runs through the building, breaks a window, and climbs up a fire
escape to get to a new floor.  He breaks a window to get in, then pulls
a cabinet in front of the window.  He shoots through the cabinet,
causing some crazy to scream.  He busts down a door, shoots open part of
a wall, busts through that, climbs out a window, and climbs down a
telephone pole.  He then climbs up a wall.  On the way he drops his
walkie-talkie.  He runs down an alley, and as he does, Cabbie pulls up.

CABBIE
Where you goin', buddy?

Snake points his gun at Cabbie.  He looks behind him, then gets in the
cab.

INT. CAB -- NIGHT
Snake notices a tape player which is playing the theme from "American
Bandstand."

CABBIE
Bad neighborhood, Snake!  You don't want to be walking from the Bowery
to 42nd street at night!  I've been driving a cab here for 30 years and
I'm telling you, you don't walk around here at night!  Yes, sir!
They'll kill you and strip you in ten seconds flat.  Usually I'm not
down around here myself, but I wanted to catch that show.

Cabbie lights a rag stuffed down the neck of a bottle which is full of
gasoline.

CABBIE
This stuff is like gold around here, you know.

EXT. CAB -- NIGHT
Cabbie throws the bottle into the alley, where it explodes.

INT. CAB -- NIGHT

CABBIE
Hey, Snake, when'd you get in?  I didn't even know they caught you.
(laughs)
Ohhh, Snake Plissken in my cab.  Wait'll I tell Eddie!  Hey, hang on,
Snake.

EXT. CAB -- NIGHT
Cabbie makes a sharp turn.

INT. CAB -- NIGHT

CABBIE
Hey, what were you doing back there, Snake?

SNAKE
Looking for somebody.

CABBIE
Well, why didn't you ask me?  Hell, I know everybody in this town.  Yes,
sir.  I've been driving this cab for thirty years, this very same cab.

Snake points his gun at Cabbie.

SNAKE
I'm GONNA ask you.  Now where's the President?

CABBIE
The Duke's got him!  Everyone knows the Duke's got him!  You don't have
to put a gun to my head.  I'll tell you!

SNAKE
Who's the Duke?

CABBIE
The DUKE!  The Duke of New York!  A-Number-1!  The big man, that's who!

SNAKE
I want to meet this Duke.

CABBIE
You can't meet the Duke, are you crazy?  Nobody wants to meet the Duke!
You meet him once and then you're dead!

Snake points the gun more insistently.  Tough.

EXT. BRAIN'S BUILDING -- NIGHT
Cabbie parks the cab and he and Snake walk up to Brain's building.

CABBIE
I hate to leave her on the street.  Usually I don't leave her alone at
all.  But you're a special case, Snake.

He and Snake walk up to the door.  Cabbie knocks on the door with his
shoe.

CABBIE
It's OK, Snake.  It's a better neighborhood.  You can relax.

Relax?  Snake checks his life clock.  17:40:46. 45. 44.  Relax, my ass.

SNAKE
Thanks.

CABBIE
Boy, they got a great place here.  Like a fortress!

SNAKE
They?

From the inside, someone answers.

MAGGIE
Who is it?

CABBIE
It's me!

MAGGIE
Who's me?

CABBIE
Cabbie!

MAGGIE
What do you want?

CABBIE
Somebody wants to see Brain, it's important --

MAGGIE
No way, Cabbie --

CABBIE
No, it's Snake!  Snake Plissken!

Maggie opens the door.  She stands there and surveys the pair.

MAGGIE
YOU'RE Plissken?

CABBIE
He wants to see Brain.

MAGGIE
Why?

SNAKE
I want to meet the Duke.

Snake and Maggie exchange a glance.  She leads them in.

INT. BRAIN'S -- NIGHT

CABBIE
Hey, what do you think of this place, Snake?  It used to be a public
library.  Oh, that Brain, he's the greatest!  Mr. Fabulous!  Duke loves
him.

SNAKE
(gesturing at Maggie)
Who's that?

CABBIE
That's Maggie.  Brain's squeeze.  The Duke gave him to Brain just to
keep him happy . . . see what I mean?

Snake can tell that Maggie's more than just Brain's squeeze; she's his
bodyguard, too.  She looks like she'd be willing to kill to protect
Brain.

MAGGIE
Heard you were dead.

INT. BRAIN'S ROOM -- NIGHT

CABBIE
Brain?  Brain!  I brought somebody to see you!

Snake looks at Brain.  He knows this guy.

SNAKE
Harold Helman.

Brain puts down his book and stands up.

BRAIN
Snake?

MAGGIE
"Harold"?

SNAKE
Where you been, Harold?  It's been a long time.

MAGGIE
You never told me you knew Snake Plissken, Brain.

CABBIE
Isn't that great?  Hey, Brain, I could use some gas if you can spare
some . . .

No one pays attention.  Snake advances on Brain.  Brain sits down.

SNAKE
I'm glad you remember me.  Yeah.  A man should remember his past.
Kansas City, four years ago.  You ran out on me.  You left me sitting
there.

BRAIN
You were late.

SNAKE
We were buddies, Harold.  You, me, and Fresno Bob.  You know what they
did to Bob?

His face changes.  He suddenly kicks Brain's chair into the wall and
points his gun.

Maggie draws a knife and starts advancing on Snake.

SNAKE
You want to see him sprayed all over that map, baby?
(to Brain)
Where's the President?!

BRAIN
Swear to god, Snake, I don't know --

SNAKE
Don't fuck with me!

BRAIN
Why do you want to know?

SNAKE
I want him.

BRAIN
Working for the man now, huh?

SNAKE
Then I'll just beat it out of your squeeze --

BRAIN
Mm-hm.  Maggie doesn't know EXACTLY where he is and unless you know
EXACTLY PRECISELY where he is you'll never find him.

Snake takes his gun away.  He contemplates Brain.

SNAKE
Listen, I'll take you out of here.  Yeah.  Jet glider just a couple of
blocks down the street.  And all you gotta do is get me to him.

Everyone realizes the importance of this.

CABBIE
No kidding?  On the level?  Will you take me, too?

BRAIN
We've got to deal somewhere else.

SNAKE
No glider.

MAGGIE
We've got the President.  And the Duke's taking everybody out of here.

SNAKE
Never happen.  See, I know something you and the Duke don't know.  We've
only got so long before Mr. President don't mean a whole lot.

BRAIN
You're lying.

MAGGIE
Maybe he's not . . .

BRAIN
I know him!  Look at his face, he's lying!

SNAKE
Right, Harold.  I'm lying.  So I might as well have some fun and keep
looking by myself.

He cocks his gun and points it at Brain again.

MAGGIE
Brain --

SNAKE
Talk to him, baby --

MAGGIE
Brain, he'll kill us both if you don't tell him --

CABBIE
(panicking)
Brain, you've got to tell him!

MAGGIE
(panicking)
Brain, you've got to tell him --

CABBIE
(panicked)
Tell him, tell him, tell him --

BRAIN
ALL RIGHT!!!

Snake lowers the gun.

SNAKE
You always were smart, Harold.

BRAIN
Just one thing right now.  Don't call me "Harold."

EXT. BUILDING -- NIGHT
Snake, Maggie, Cabbie and Brain all walk out.

SNAKE
So you work for this Duke, huh?

BRAIN
Yeah.  Make gas for him.  Figure out things for him.

SNAKE
Like what?

BRAIN
(showing off)
Like how to get across the 69th street bridge -- it's mined, but I know
where they're planted.

MAGGIE
We got a diagram from a guy that got all the way across . . . before
they shot the poor bastard.

BRAIN
We got a crew up there now clearing the way across the first barricade.

CABBIE
What a sight, Snake!  The whole camp rolling right across the bridge and
the President right out front!  Oh, that would have been so fine . . .

MAGGIE
(ironically)
Yeah, it would have been . . .

CABBIE
Yeah, but we're going with Snake now.

The three of them cross into the street.  Cabbie panics.

CABBIE
That's the Duke!  I know the sound of his engines.  Don't cross the Duke
-- everybody knows that.

We get one glimpse of the Duke's car.  Then we realize that Cabbie is
gone and his cab is racing away.

MAGGIE
Cabbie, you slime!

The Duke's car heads right for us.

MAGGIE
No, Brain!

The two of them run off.  After a while, Snake follows.  The three of
them hide.  The Duke's car is an old Chrysler with chandeliers suspended
over the headlights.  It's in a caravan of three, leading the way.  A
fourth car comes up later.  The Duke is sitting in the passenger seat of
a car with Weirdo in the back.  The Duke gets out of the car, Weirdo at
his side.  The Duke is wearing a cowboy hat, sunglasses, a snazzy
jacket, bluejeans, and boots.  He looks TOUGH.  He sends Weirdo to knock
on the door.

MAGGIE
He's looking for you, Brain.

SNAKE
What does he want?

BRAIN
He wants my diagram of the bridge.  When he finds out I'm with you he's
going to want my life!  Shit, Plissken, I knew I shouldn't have listened
to you --

SNAKE
We've got to get to the President NOW, while he's busy.

BRAIN
Forget it, he's on the other side of town and we got no wheels.  The
deal is off --

SNAKE
Just calm down.

EXT. CAR -- NIGHT
A lone man sits, looking bored.  Snake subtly goes up to him, knocks him
out, and gets him out of the car.  He briefly considers shooting the guy
on the hood of the car.  Instead, the guy on the hood of the car walks
around.  Snake knocks him out a second alter and then drives to get
Brain and Maggie.  He knocks the other guy out of the car.

BRAIN
(panicked)
I think they saw us!  Turn left, turn left here!

INT. CAR -- NIGHT

MAGGIE
Brain, this is Broadway.

BRAIN
I know, I know, the Duke'll take Seventh Avenue, Broadway is five
minutes --

MAGGIE
No!!!

BRAIN
Yes!!!  Just keep driving!

SNAKE
What's wrong with Broadway?

EXT. BROADWAY -- NIGHT

SNAKE
(to the car)
Come on sweetheart . . .

People start throwing bricks.  Snake hands his gun to Brain, who passes
it to Maggie, holding it like a dead rat (or like a macho guy would hold
a purse).  Snake drives as fast as he can, gunning off the bystander who
gets on the car.  A bystander grabs Brain.

BRAIN
Maggie!

Maggie protects him.  She shoots the people grabbing at him.  Snake
angles the car through a pile of scrap metal and drives away.  He glares
at Brain.  Everyone seems visibly shaken.

SNAKE
Hold on.

Snake backs the car through a bunch of piled cars.  He takes off, the
car a bit worse for wear but at least they got away from the crowd on
Broadway.

EXT. TRAINS -- NIGHT
Brain points to the cars as Snake watches.

BRAIN
He'll be in the third car from the end, by the last campfire.

Snake looks around.  The Duke's caravan passes.  There are more cars
than there were before.

BRAIN
It's all right.  He's got to go in the front way.  It'll take him five
minutes.  If you're not back to the car in four minutes you're on your
own.

SNAKE
When we get there, Harold, you just keep talking.

They drive off.  Snake gets to the trains.  No one notices.  Maggie and
Brain get out of the car and Snake ducks into the train car.

BRAIN
Hi, guys.  Hi . . . how's it going?  Cooled off a little, huh?

HEAD DUDE
What do you want, Brain?

BRAIN
Duke told us to wait inside.  He's on his way here now.

HEAD DUDE
He didn't say nothing to us about it.

BRAIN
Well, you can't expect him to tell everybody in the joint, now can you?
That's why he's the Duke.

The camera angles back to show Snake walking on top of the railroad
cars.  He hasn't found the President yet. But he doesn't have time to
wonder if Brain double-crossed him.

HEAD DUDE
Why don't we wait outside here for him?

BRAIN
Why don't we wait inside for him?

HEAD DUDE
'Cause I got orders, that's why.

BRAIN
What are your specific orders, by the way?

HEAD DUDE
Specific orders, Brain, was for me not to let no one go inside.

BRAIN
How's the President holding up, by the way?  Any political discussion
you've had with him?

INT. PRESIDENT'S TRAIN CAR -- NIGHT
Two guards sit with the President, talking.  The first guard is by the
President.  The second is looking out the window.

SECOND GUARD
That Brain is a real pain in the ass.  He's always sniffing around like
a dog.

FIRST GUARD
He comes up with the gas.

The second guard looks out the window.  Snake grabs him by the neck, and
breaks it.  The first guard doesn't notice, but the President does, and
that tips off the guard.

FIRST GUARD
What are you looking at?

He turns and Snake throws a star at him.  It lodges right in his brain,
but not fast enough.  Snake is hit in the leg with a crossbow arrow.

Snake limps over to the President and starts uncuffing him.  The
president still has the briefcase.  This is it, this is the big time.
Snake keeps calm.

PRESIDENT
Are you from the outside?

SNAKE
Stop shaking.

PRESIDENT
I can't!  Who are you?

SNAKE
Hauk sent me.  We've got to move fast.

PRESIDENT
Move fast?  You're goddamned right I'll move fast.

SNAKE
Quiet!

Snake limps away, President in the lead.

EXT. TRAIN -- NIGHT
Snake and the President keep moving.  Suddenly, Snake gets jumped.  Ten
guys surround him and the President, and though Snake fights well, it's
not well enough.  Brain comes out with Maggie.

BRAIN
They got him.  Now watch him.

The Duke steps out from the car, followed by Weirdo.

DUKE
Friend of yours, Brain?

BRAIN
He had a gun on me, Duke, there was nothing I could do.

DUKE
(not believing it for a second)
Uh-huh.

Weirdo points accusingly as he and Duke walk away.

BRAIN
Maggie . . .

Duke walks up to Snake.  Snake isn't giving in even though he's pretty
sure he's beat.

DUKE
Who are you?

Snake doesn't answer.  Duke grabs the arrow still lodged in his right
leg and pulls on it.  Snake writhes in agony.

DUKE
I said who are you?

BRAIN
Snake Plissken, Duke.  The Man sent him in here.  Something's going down
. . . we need him.

Duke recognizes the name.  He is impressed.  He lets go of the arrow.
Snake hates him more than ever.

DUKE
Snaaaaaake Plissken.  I've heard of you.

He raises a crowbar over his head and smacks Snake with it, knocking him
out.

DUKE
I heard you were dead.

EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT
A helicopter flies over the city.

INT. HELICOPTER -- NIGHT
The pilot looks at a grid-view of New York.

SURVEILLANCE 4
This is surveillance 4 to security control.  Nothing on the infrared
body scan.  Nothing in the searchlight. There aren't any fires on the
street.  Nobody moving down here.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
Hauk, Rehme and the Vice President wait.

SURVEILLANCE 5
Surveillance 5 . . . security control . . . negative on infrared body
scan . . . no movement in the searchlight . . . nothing strange going on
down there.

They look at the Master Life Clock.  12:27:39.  38. Where's Plissken?

INT. ROOM -- DAY
Plissken lies unconscious on a bed, crossbow pointed at his head.  Three
guards are at the ready.

INT. BASE -- DAY

VICE PRESIDENT
We've got to go in now.

HAUK
We hold.

VICE PRESIDENT
You're countermanding my orders, Hauk.

HAUK
This is my prison, I'll give the orders.

VICE PRESIDENT
I override all that!

HAUK
Just try.

EXT. NEW YORK -- DAY
Unbelievable smog.  Helicopters fly.

SURVEILLANCE ?
...still negative on the scan.

SURVEILLANCE 4
This is Surveillance 4 to Security Control.  Nothing on the infrared
body scan.  Negative on the sweep.

EXT. WALL -- DAY
Hauk stands on the wall, listening.

SURVEILLANCE 10
Surveillance 10.  Still negative on the scan.

SURVEILLANCE 5
Surveillance 5 still negative.

SURVEILLANCE 4
This is Surveillance 4 to Security Control.  Nothing on the infrared
body scan.  Negative...

INT. ROOM -- DAY
Snake begins to come to.  We hear gunshots and cheering.  The guards go
to announce Snake's consciousness.

INT. HANGAR -- DAY
Brain and Maggie move to the center of the gunshots and cheering

INT. TARGET PRACTICE -- DAY
The Duke sits firing with Plissken's gun at the President, whose
briefcase is still chained to his arm.

INT. ROOM -- DAY
Snake sits up.  There are LOTS of crossbows aimed at him.

GUARD
Don't move, Snake.

Snake turns to face him.  He stands up.  We see for the first time
exactly why he's called "Snake" Plissken.  There's a snake tattooed on
his stomach.  The snake's tail disappears into his pants, but we have a
good idea of where it leads and what it becomes.  Ah ha.

Snake's life clock is gone.  He has no idea how much time he's got.
Shit.

INT. TARGET PRACTICE -- DAY

DUKE
I want that diagram, Brain.

BRAIN
Oh. It's at my place, Duke.  Duke, that Plissken said something about a
time limit.

DUKE
What time limit?

BRAIN
(gesturing at President)
On him.

DUKE
That's a lot of crap.
(to the President)
What did I teach you?

PRESIDENT
(weakly)
You... You are... the Duke of New... New York... You're... A-Number-One.

DUKE
I can't hear you.

PRESIDENT
YOU ARE... THE DUKE OF NEW YORK... YOU'RE A-NUMBER-ONE!

DUKE
(to Brain)
Get me the diagram.

BRAIN
Duke... Don't kill Plissken.  We need him.

The Duke points the gun at Brain, but doesn't even give him a glance.

DUKE
Get moving, Brain.

Brain moves, and Weirdo laughs that odd laugh.  The Duke fires at the
President's briefcase.  Papers and a tape fall out.  Weirdo looks down
and kicks the tape away.  He picks it up and holds it to his ear, then
puts it in his pocket.  Guards come and unstrap the President.  The Duke
has decided to take Snake a bit more seriously than he had.

Which is not saying much.

EXT. NEW YORK -- LATE AFTERNOON
Helicopters fly above ground.  A group stands with a car, gesturing
wildly.

INT. HELICOPTER -- LATE AFTERNOON

PILOT
People out below in the park.  Can you see them?

INT. BASE -- LATE AFTERNOON

PILOT
Surveillance 2 to Security Control.  We're getting that readout, mostly
in the infrared.

Hauk and Rehme immediately check out the monitor.  At least something's
going on.

PILOT
We have a visual sighting on it.  It's a crowd of prisoners in Central
Park.  They're waving at us.  Signaling us in the food drop area.
They're waving us down.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK -- LATE AFTERNOON
The prisoners wave the helicopters down.  A group of guards lands and
runs over to the station wagon.  They get the briefcase which has been
sawed off the President's handcuffs.

INT. ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON
Snake is awake and surrounded by guards.  The cheers are louder.

INT. BRAIN'S -- LATE AFTERNOON
Maggie walks across the room, loading a gun.  It's one of Snake's.

BRAIN
I still can't figure out whether that son of a bitch Plissken was
telling the truth or not.  God, I hate that guy.

Brain stands in front of his maps.

MAGGIE
He got in somehow.

BRAIN
Yeah, yeah, but how?  You gotta land the glider and take off.
(he gestures at the map)
You can't do it in Central Park, there's too many trees.  Port
Authority's too low to the ground.  Unless it was some...
(he gets it... they don't call him "Brain" for nothing)
Someplace high up.  World Trade Center.  That's it.  There we go.  The
World Trade Center.  And it's gonna be a hell of a lot easier for me to
take off than it was for him to land.

INT. BASE -- LATE AFTERNOON
Hauk reads the note left in the briefcase.

HAUK
"Amnesty for all prisoners in New York City in exchange for President.
69th Street Bridge tomorrow, 12 Noon.  No bullshit or he's dead."

VICE PRESIDENT
Where's the tape?

HAUK
Not here.

He reaches inside and removes a pair of goggles.

REHME
They're Plissken's.

Yeah, they were on the table.  He never did use them, though, and only
half of them is necessary in his case anyway.

VICE PRESIDENT
So much for your man, Hauk?

Hauk hesitates.  This is the last thing he wants.

HAUK
Warm up the choppers.  We're moving in.

EXT. BASE -- SUNSET
Helicopters prepare for takeoff.

INT. BASE -- SUNSET
Hauk sits at the microphone.

HAUK
Plissken?

The master life clock reads 1:56:38. 37. 36,

INT. ROOM -- SUNSET
Snake slowly gets to his feet.  He's still groggy, but it's time for him
to move.

GUARD
Come on, get up!

Snake limps through a hallway and into a stadium.

INT. STADIUM -- SUNSET
Boos greet Snake as he walks in.  In the center of the room is a
fighting ring.  Snake climbs in, not without effort.  A huge and
extremely ugly man climbs into the ring, amid loud cheers.  Snake
notices that the huge ugly dude is wearing his life clock.  In the
balcony above is the Duke.  The Duke stands up and raises his arms, and
everyone gets silent.

DUKE
They sent in their best man.  And when we roll down the 69th street
bridge tomorrow on our way to freedom, we're gonna have their best man
leading the way.  From the neck up.

The crowd cheers.

DUKE
On the hood of my car!

More cheers.

DUKE
Let's do it!

Ugly and Snake take bats.  They circle each other.  Ugly strikes at
Snake.  Snake ricochets off the ring.  He rolls around, fighting for his
life.

INT. BUILDING -- SUNSET
Brain and Maggie walk around.  They knock on a door and Weirdo answers.
He's wearing Cabbie's hat.

WEIRDO
Hello.

BRAIN
Where'd you get the hat?

WEIRDO
Got it from Cabbie.

BRAIN
Yeah?

WEIRDO
Traded him.

BRAIN
For what?

WEIRDO
What are you so nervous about?

BRAIN
I'm here to see the President.

WEIRDO
Who says?

BRAIN
The Duke.

WEIRDO
No he doesn't.

BRAIN
Well... I'll have to tell him you said that.

Weirdo doesn't really believe it.  If it's not true, so what?

But if it IS true, the Duke will have him tortured to death.

WEIRDO
Wait a minute.  Why?

BRAIN
He's got something hidden in his clothing.  The Duke wants it.

WEIRDO
What?

BRAIN
I'll show you.

WEIRDO
You'll tell me.

BRAIN
Cyanide capsules.  The Duke don't want a dead president.

Brain pushes his way in.

INT. ROOM -- SUNSET

BRAIN
Gentlemen.  Mr. President.

Weirdo lets the door slide closed.  Brain starts checking the
President's clothes.  The President has been dressed in a wig and tied
to a chair with an American Flag on it.

WEIRDO
Cyanide?

BRAIN
Yeah.  He might try to take it tomorrow.

Weirdo walks up to Brain.

WEIRDO
That's bullshit.  You're not supposed to be in here, Brain --

Brain stabs Weirdo, who dies with a gasp.  Maggie dispatches of the
three guards.  She smiles.  Brain unties the President's hand.  The
President snatches off the wig in a rage.

INT. TOURNAMENT -- SUNSET
Snake notices a guard wearing the eagle tracer.  A trash can lid and a
bat with spikes on it is handed to him.  The next round begins.

EXT. HOUSE -- EVENING
Brain, the President, and Maggie sneak out.  A guy in a cowboy hat
notices.

INT. TOURNAMENT -- EVENING
Ugly and Snake keep fighting.  Snake is not doing very well.  But he's
catching up.  As Ugly tries to hit him, he nails Ugly in the groin, then
in the back of the head.  The crowd begins cheering "SNAKE!  SNAKE!"
The Duke can't believe it.  Snake runs to the guard with the tracer and
activates it.

INT. BASE -- EVENING
The Master Life Clock begins blinking "Tracer Status: ACTIVATED."

COMPUTER
Tracer activated at one hour, thirty-five minutes, twenty-seven seconds.

Rehme jumps out of his seat.

REHME
Hauk!!

INT. TOURNAMENT -- EVENING
Snake limps around, getting his stuff back together.  He looks at his
life clock.  1:34:54.  53.  He doesn't have much time.

The guy in the cowboy hat runs up to the Duke and yells for attention.
Duke immediately gets up and leaves, as do his hangers-on.

GUY IN COWBOY HAT
LISTEN!!!  LISTEN!!!  LISTEN!!!

The crowd shuts up.

GUY IN COWBOY HAT
THE PRESIDENT'S GONE!  BRAIN TOOK HIM!

The crowd rushes out.  Snake limps out of the ring and runs off as fast
as he can.

EXT. BASE -- EVENING
Rehme catches up to Hauk at the last second.  Hauk has been stalling.

REHME
(shouting over noise)
Hauk!  Plissken's tracer!

Hauk runs up to the head helicopter pilot.

HAUK
Get on the radio!  Keep them down!  Nobody move!

INT. BASE -- EVENING
Two monitors show Snake's tracer.

REHME
He's approaching the World Trade Center.

HAUK
I knew that son of a bitch was alive.

REHME
He's inside.

INT. WORLD TRADE CENTER -- EVENING
Snake limps around.  He notices a cab.  Fifty flights of stairs with
his leg shot to hell.  He hesitates only for a second, then starts up.

INT. BASE -- EVENING
The Vice President, Hauk and Rehme all stand, staring at the monitors.

VICE PRESIDENT
It's gone.

HAUK
The signal only lasts for 15 minutes.  Download the choppers.  We're in
a standby situation.

Rehme runs off.

VICE PRESIDENT
Anybody could have pushed that button.

HAUK
Only Plissken knew there was a safety catch.  Now we'll give him a
little more time, just to make sure.

The master clock shows 59:44. 43.

EXT. WORLD TRADE CENTER -- NIGHT
Snake gets out of the elevator.  Maggie, Brain, and the President all
take cover behind a chimney and try to get a gang to stop chopping down
the glider.  It doesn't work.  The glider floats away.

BRAIN
Goddamned redskins!  They're savages, Mr. President!

Snake runs to get them.  They get in the elevator.

INT. WORLD TRADE CENTER -- NIGHT
Snake has the President by the arm and is leading everyone out.

BRAIN
Listen, Snake, I swear to god, I thought you were dead --

SNAKE
Yeah, you and everybody else.

He grabs Brain by the tie and aims the gun at his head.

SNAKE
That's your car in the lobby?  The keys!  Quick!  Quick!  Diagram of the
bridge!  Hey, hey, hey --

Snake takes all the abovementioned items.

BRAIN
I'm the only one who knows how to read that, Snake --

SNAKE
Stay out of my way, Harold.

BRAIN
Besides, you can't read and drive at the same time.  You need us!

Snake is tired.  He's pissed.  He's got half an hour to live if that.
He doesn't have time for Brain's shit, and he lets him know it.

SNAKE
You shouldn't have double-crossed me again, Brain.  Come on, let's go --

He suddenly notices there's nothing on the end of the President's chain.
He holds it in front of the President's face.

PRESIDENT
They sawed it off...

SNAKE
The tape?

PRESIDENT
Gone... I don't know where...

BRAIN
I do.

Snake shoots him a look.  Bullshit, his eyes say, but maybe Brain is
telling the truth.  Maybe.

BRAIN
Swear to god, Snake, I know where it is.  Just take us to the car and
I'll take you right to it.

SNAKE
Shit...

He tosses the diagram of the bridge to Brain.  They go down the stairs.
Snake's in bad shape, but it's everyone else who's complaining.

MAGGIE
Don't talk.  Breathe.

PRESIDENT
Come on, come on, we're wasting time!

Snake gets into the car.  It won't start.

BRAIN
What's wrong?

SNAKE
Dead, Harold.

BRAIN
What?!

Snake hands the keys to Brain.

SNAKE
Here, take these.

Snake looks under the hood.  There's a man with a crossbow pointed
straight at him.  Shit.  They've been caught.  Again.

DUKE
Car trouble?

Snake looks over the hood.  There's the Duke.  With a dozen guards.
Brain steps out.

BRAIN
Hi, Duke.

DUKE
This whole deal of yours is over, Snake.  You and Brain just say good-
bye to each other.

The Duke turns away and loses aim of his gun for a moment.  At that
moment, Snake pulls a gun and fires at the steam vent.  At the same
time, Maggie slams the hood shut on the guard with the crossbow.  Steam
flies everywhere, enough for cover.  The four of them run for it.  The
Duke runs after them.

EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT
A cab pulls up.  Its radio is playing "American Bandstand".  Guess who's
driving?  You got it!

The group of four runs up to the cab.  Snake runs around and makes
Cabbie scoot over.  He wants to drive.  Cabbie looks shocked.

PRESIDENT
GO, GO!

The Duke and his followers arrive too late.

INT. CAB -- NIGHT

BRAIN
(trying to explain the map)
...and then there's three more...

Snake waves him off.  Cabbie's trying to make conversation.

MAGGIE
They're behind us --

BRAIN
They come in groups of threes!

Snake pops the American Bandstand tape out of the tape player and puts
it in his pocket.

SNAKE
Where's the tape, Brain?

CABBIE
What tape?

SNAKE
Where is it?

BRAIN
Tape...

PRESIDENT
The tape from the briefcase!

CABBIE
Oh, that tape!

He pulls it out of his pocket.

CABBIE
Here it is!

Cabbie hands it to Snake.  Brain laughs, trying to cover his ass.

BRAIN
You traded away your hat for it!

CABBIE
How'd you know?

BRAIN
See, see!

Snake pops it into the deck.  It begins spewing out information.  It's
the right one.  He slips it into his pocket.

PRESIDENT
Here, give me that tape!

HA!  No way!

SNAKE
Not just yet.

Snake checks his life clock.  23:20. 19. 18. 17.  Didn't that guy say 15
minutes before the last hour was up?  But Hauk said they'd been playing
with this, so the 15 minutes was built in already.  Still, 23 minutes.
That's cutting it pretty fucking close.

EXT. CAB -- NIGHT
Snake races as fast as the cab can go.

INT. CAB -- NIGHT
Snake checks to make sure they're not being followed too closely.
They're not.  The Duke is behind, but he's FAR behind.

CABBIE
Easy... easy!

BRAIN
Go for it, Snake!

EXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT
Snake jumps the car over the first obstacle.  Cabbie looks like he's
having a heart attack.

Snake swerves on Brain's direction.  So far so good.  A mine goes off,
but it's behind them.

The Duke goes forward.  He's going by the seat of his pants.  But he
knows the general direction of how Snake went.  A mine goes off behind
him, too.

INT. CAB -- NIGHT
Brain reads the map.  Cabbie continues to freak out.

CABBIE
You've got to slow down a little, Snake...

BRAIN
I think there are three mines ahead, Snake.

MAGGIE
You think?!

EXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT
The Duke continues in pursuit.

INT. CAB -- NIGHT

BRAIN
Stay left, stay left, stay left, and then jog right when I tell you.

CABBIE
You're pushing her too hard, Snake.

BRAIN
OK, OK, NOW!

EXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT
The cab explodes, being cut right in half.  Everyone makes it except
Cabbie.  Cabbie had been driving that very same cab for thirty years.
He died with it.

The President, Snake, Maggie and Brain all keep going on foot.

BRAIN
I said JOG RIGHT!... you asshole.

Brain leads the way as they keep crossing the bridge.

BRAIN
Stay to the right, stay to the right, now jog left.  Hold it, left...
left... LEFT, DAMMIT!

The other three go right.  Brain goes left and a mine explodes under
him.  Maggie walks up to the body in shock.  Snake limps up to her.

MAGGIE
Brain...

SNAKE
Keep moving...

The Duke's car is coming.  Snake checks his life clock

SNAKE
Maggie... he's dead.  Come on.

Maggie calmly holds out her hand.  Snake smiles and hands her his gun.
His grin grows.  It's one of respect for what she's about to do.  He
runs off after the President.

Maggie walks around to Brain, then steps in front of him.  She points
the gun at the Duke's car.  The first three shots don't connect.  The
fourth nails the headlight, and then the Duke runs her over.  He keeps
going.

INT. BASE -- NIGHT
Rehme runs up to Hauk and the Vice President.

REHME
Station 19!  They spotted two cars on the 69th street bridge.

HAUK
Is it Plissken?

REHME
Taxicab and a Cadillac.  Taxi hit a mine.  There's four people on foot.

VICE PRESIDENT
Fourteen minutes...

HAUK
Get a jeep with a winch over there fast.

He pulls out a phone.

HAUK
Strombaerden!  Get over to Station 19.  They're coming across the
bridge.

EXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT
The President and Snake run on.

EXT. WALL -- NIGHT
A jeep pulls up.  Rehme's voice comes up over the loudspeaker.  The
guards on the jeep ready the winch.

REHME
 This is Rehme, Security Control.  We are in a standby situation.
Repeat.  We are in a standby situation.  All helicopters, down.  Wall
guard, do not fire on prisoners.  Repeat, do not fire on prisoners.  All
vehicles, stand by.  Repeat, stand by.

EXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT
Snake and the President are close enough to the wall to hear all this.

EXT. WALL -- NIGHT
The wall guards grab the rope and prepare to lower it for the President
and Snake.

EXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT
Snake pushes the President up to the wall.  The winch comes down and
Snake helps the President into it first.  The President goes up and
over.  Snake's life clock reads 1:32.  But he doesn't have time to watch
seconds tick away because the Duke is right behind him firing at him.
Snake ducks for cover.  The wall guards die.  The winch comes down
again, and the Duke sees it.  He starts toward it.  Snake tackles him
and beats him up, dazing him but not knocking him out.  He grabs the
winch.

EXT. WALL -- NIGHT
A hand stops the winch from moving.

EXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT
Snake comes to a stop.  He panics and starts pulling on the winch line.
The Duke comes to and stands up.  But he can't get anywhere because the
President has found a machine gun and is now firing away.  He is very
accurate.  He nails the Duke right away but keeps firing.

PRESIDENT
(manic voice)
Yeah, hey, Number One!  You're the Duke!  You're the Duke!

The President calms down somewhat.

PRESIDENT
You're... the Duke... You're A-Number-One.

The President starts the winch again.  Snake climbs up and gets over as
fast as he can without injuring himself.

EXT. WALL -- NIGHT
Hauk and the medic pull up with the machine.  Hauk interrupts the medic.

HAUK
The tape, Plissken.

Snake reaches into his pocket, grabs the tape, and hands it to Hauk.  He
is furious.  As soon as Hauk has the tape, he lets the medic come back.
He holds up two medal pads to Snake's neck.  They buzz, they buzz
louder, and then he takes them away.

MEDIC
That's it.

Snake continues to pant and fume.  He stares at them, then lifts his
wrist to look at his life clock.  2 seconds.  One second.

Beep.

Nothing.

Snake lowers his wrist.

EXT. PRESIDENT'S PRESS CONFERENCE SITE -- NIGHT
A jeep pulls Rehme up.  He jogs to the President, who is being shaved
and prepared for broadcast.

REHME
I radioed ahead, Mr. President.  They know the situation.  They're
waiting for your broadcast.

PRESIDENT
Yeah.

Snake approaches.  The President nods.

PRESIDENT
Oh, it's all right.

Snake walks up and looks the President straight in the eye.

PRESIDENT
I, uh... I want to thank you.  Anything you want... you just name it.

SNAKE
Just a moment of your time.

AIDE
Three minutes, sir.

PRESIDENT
Yes?

SNAKE
We did get you out.  A lot of people died in the process.  I just
wondered how you felt about it.

PRESIDENT
I want to thank them.  This nation appreciates their sacrifice.

The President is full of shit after all.  Snake has reason for his
cynicism.  The President is uncomfortable with Snake's glare and it
shows.

PRESIDENT
Look, uh, I'm on the air in...
(questioning his aide)
Two and a half minutes?

AIDE
Yes, sir.

Snake lights a cigarette and walks away.  Rehme watches.

EXT. BASE -- NIGHT
Snake walks away.  Hauk stands nearby.  Snake stops in his tracks.

HAUK
You going to kill me now, Snake?

SNAKE
I'm too tired.  Maybe later.

HAUK
I've got another deal for you.  I want you to think it over while you're
resting.  I want to give you a job.  We'd make one hell of a team,
Snake.

SNAKE
(glaring)
The name's Plissken.

He limps away.

EXT. PRESIDENT'S PRESS CONFERENCE SITE -- NIGHT
The President looks suitably freshened up.  He's even smiling a little.

AIDE
You're on camera, Mr. President.

PRESIDENT
Good evening.  Although I shall not be present at this historic summit
meeting, I present this, in the hope that our great nations may learn to
live in peace.

He pops in the tape and presses the "PLAY" button...

...and out comes "American Bandstand".

The President's face goes slack.  His career's over.

EXT. BASE -- NIGHT
Snake keeps limping.  He pulls a tape out of his pocket, yanks the
magnetic tape out, winds it around his hand, rips it to shreds, and
throws the tape away.

FADE OUT.

INT. PUBLISHING HOUSE RECEPTION AREA - DAY

It's grand and modern.  Random House-Knopf-Taschen is etched
on the wall in large gold letters.  An old woman enters
carrying a tattered manuscript, maybe a thousand pages.  She
seems haunted, hollow-eyed, sickly.  The young receptionist,
dressed in a shiny, stretchy one-piece pantsuit, looks up.

		RECEPTIONIST
	Oh, hi.

		OLD WOMAN
		(apologetically)
	Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought
	I'd see --

		RECEPTIONIST
	I think he's in a conference.
	Unfortunately.  I'm really sorry.

		OLD WOMAN
	Would you just try him?  You never know.
	As long as I'm here.  You never know.

		RECEPTIONIST
	Of course.  Please have a seat.

The old woman smiles and sits, the bulky manuscript on her
lap.  She stares politely straight ahead.

		RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)
		(quietly into headset)
	It's her -- I know, but couldn't you just
	-- Yes, I know, but -- I know, but she's
	old and it would be a nice -- Yes, sorry.
		(to old woman)
	I'm sorry, ma'am, he's not in right now.
	It's a crazy time of year for us.

The receptionist gestures toward a Christmas tree in the
corner.  Its ornaments are holograms.

		OLD WOMAN
	This book -- It's essential that people
	read it because --
		(gravely, patting the
		 manuscript)
	-- It's the truth.  And only I know it.

		RECEPTIONIST
		(nodding sympathetically)
	Maybe after the holidays then.

INT. TILED HALLWAY - DAY

The old woman carries her manuscript haltingly down a subway
hall.  She stops to catch her breath, then continues and
passes several archway with letters printed above them.  When
she arrives at one topped by an LL, she slips a card in a
slot.  A plastic molded chair drops into the archway.  She
sits in the chair; it rises.

INT. TUBE -DAY

The woman is still in the chair as it slips gracefully into a
line of chairs shooting through a glass tube.  The other
chairs are peopled with commuters.  We stay with the woman as
she and the others travel over New York City in the tube.
There are hundreds of these commuter tubes crisscrossing the
skyline.  The woman glances at the manuscript in her lap.
It's called:

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

This serves as the movie's opening title.  The other credits
follow, as the old woman studies commuters in passing tubes.
Their faces are variously harsh and sad and lonely and blank.

INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

SUBTITLED: FIFTY YEARS EARLIER

Every doctor's office waiting room: chairs against the wall,
magazines on end tables, a sad-looking potted plant, generic
seascape paintings on the walls.  The receptionist, Mary, 25,
can be seen typing in the reception area.  Behind her are
shelves and shelves of medical files.  The door opens and
Clementine enters.  She's in her early thirties, zaftig in a
faux fur winter coat over an orange hooded sweatshirt.  She's
decidedly funky and has blue hair.  Mary looks up.

		MARY
	May I help you?

		CLEMENTINE
		(approaching reception area)
	Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr.
	Mierzwiak.  Clementine Kruczynski.

		MARY
	Yes, please have a seat.  He'll be right
	with you.

Clementine sits.  She looks tired, maybe hungover.  She picks
up a magazine at random and thumbs without interest.

INT. INNER OFFICE AREA - CONTINUOUS

Mary pads down the hallway.  She knocks on a closed door.

		MIERZWIAK (O.S.)
	Yes?

Mary opens the door, peeks in.  Howard Mierzwiak, 40's,
professional, dry, sits behind his desk studying some papers.

		MARY
	Howard, your one o'clock.

		MIERZWIAK
		(not looking up)
	Thanks, Mary.  You can bring her in.

She smiles and nods.  It's clear she's in love.  It's equally
clear that Mierzwiak doesn't have a clue.  Mary turns to
leave.

		MIERZWIAK (CONT'D)
		(looking up)
	Mary...

		MARY
		(turning back)
	Yes?

		MIERZWIAK
	Order me a pastrami for after?

		MARY
	Cole slaw, ice tea?

		MIERZWIAK
		(nodding)
	Thanks.

		MARY
	Welcome, Howard.

She smiles and heads down the hall.  Stan, 30's, tall,
spindly, and earnest in a lab coat pops out of a doorway.

		STAN
	Boo.

		MARY
	Hi.

She glances back nervously at Mierzwiak's open door.

		STAN
	Barely seen you all morning, kiddo.

He leans in to kiss her.  She cranes her neck to keep him
off.

		MARY
		(reprimanding whisper)
	Stan... c'mon...

		STAN
	Sorry.  I just --

		MARY
		(somewhat guiltilly)
	It's just...y'know... I mean...

		STAN
	I know.  Anyway --

		MARY
	Anyway, I've got to do my tap
	dance here.

She indicates the door to the reception area.  Stan nods.

		STAN
	See you later, alligator.

		MARY
	'kay.

		STAN
	Hey, if you're ordering lunch for
	Mierzwiak, would you --

		MARY
	I better do this, Stan.

Stan nods again and Mary opens the door to the waiting room.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	Ms. Kruczynski?

		CLEMENTINE (O.S.)
	Hi.

After a moment, Clementine appears in the doorway.  Mary
leads her down the hall, not looking back.

		MARY
		(professionally courteous)
	How are you today?

		CLEMENTINE
	Okay, I guess.

		MARY
		(at Mierzwiak's office)
	Here we are.

Mierzwiak steps out from behind his desk.

		MIERZWIAK
	Ms. Kruczynski, please come in.

Clementine enters the office.  Mary smiles at Mierzwiak and
closes the door, leaving them alone.

INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Mierzwiak directs Clementine to a chair next to a coffee
table and a conspicuously placed box of tissues.  Mierzwiak
sits across from her.  He smiles.

		MIERZWIAK
	How are you today?

		CLEMENTINE
	Okay, I guess.

		MIERZWIAK
		(nodding sympathetically)
	Well, why don't you tell me what's going
	on?  Do you mind if I turn this on?

He indicates a tape recorder.

		CLEMENTINE
	I don't care.

He turns it on, smiles at her, gestures for her to begin.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Well, I've been having a bad time of it
	with um, my boyfriend, I guess.

		MIERZWIAK
	You guess he's your boyfriend?  Or you
	guess you're having a bad time with hm?

		CLEMENTINE
	What?  No.  I don't like the term
	boyfriend.  It's so gay.

Mierzwiak nods.  He's attentive, pleasant, and neutral
throughout.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Maybe gay isn't the right word.  But,
	anyway, it's been rough with him...
	whatever the fuck he is.  Heheh.  My
	significant other... heh heh.  And I
	guess on a certain level, I want to break
	it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like
	this constant questioning and re
	questioning.  Do I end it?  Should I give
	it more time?  I'm not happy, but what do
	I expect?  Relationships require work.
	You know the drill.  The thing that I
	keep coming back to is, I'm not getting
	any younger, I want to have a baby... at
	some point... maybe... right?  So then I
	think I should settle -- which is not
	necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's
	a good guy.  It's not really settling.
	Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of
	movies, y'know?  That I have some
	completely unrealistic notion of what a
	relationship can be.  But then I think,
	no, this is what I really want, so I
	should allow myself the freedom to go out
	and fucking find it.  You know?  Agreed?
	But then I think he is a good guy and...
	It's complicated.  Y'know?

		MIERZWIAK
	I think I know. I think we can help.  Why
	don't you start by telling me about your
	relationship.  Everything you can think
	of.  Everything about him.  Everything
	about you.  And we'll take it from there.

She nods, thinks.

		CLEMENTINE
	Um, well, he's a fucking tidy one --

EXT. COMMUTER TRAIN STATION

SUBTITLE: TWO WEEKS LATER

The platform is crowded with business commuters.  Joel is
among them.  He is in his 30's, gaunt, and holding a
briefcase.  The platform across the tracks from him is empty.
Suddenly he turns and makes his way through the crowd.  He
climbs the stairs, crosses the overpass to the empty
platform.  Soon an almost empty train pulls up to that
platform.  Joel gets on and watches the business commuters
through the dirty window as his train pulls out of the
station.

EXT. MONTAUK TRAIN STATION - LATER

Joel talks on a phone.  The wind howls around him.  He tries
to shield the mouthpiece as he talks.

		JOEL
	Hi, Cindy.  Joel.  Listen, I'm not
	feeling well this morning.  No.  Food
	poisoning, I think.  Sorry it took me so
	long to call in, but I've been vomiting.

EXT. BEACH - DAY

Joel wanders the windy, empty beach, with his briefcase.  He
passes an old man with a metal detector.  They nod at each
other.

Later: Joel looks out at the ocean.

Later: Joel sits on a rock and pulls out a notebook.  He
opens it and writes with a gloved hand.

		JOEL
	January 13th, 2006.  Today I skipped work
	and took the train out to Montauk.
		(thinks)
	It's cold.
		(thinks some more)
	The sky is gray.
		(thinks some more)
	I don't know what else to say.  Nothing
	happens.  Nothing changes.  I saw Naomi
	last night.  We had sex.  It was weird to
	fall into our old familiar sex life so
	easily.  Like no time has passed.  After
	two years apart suddenly we're talking
	about getting together again.  I guess
	that's good.

He has no other thoughts.  He glances up, spots a female
figure in the distance, walking in his direction.  She stands
out against the gray in a fluorescent orange hooded
sweatshirt.  It's Clementine.  He watches her for a bit, then
as she nears, he goes back to his writing, or at least
pretends to.  Once she passed, he watches her walk away.  She
stops and stares out at the ocean.  Joel writes.

		JOEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
	If I'm constitutionally incapable of
	making eye-contact with a woman I don't
	know.  I guess I'd better get back to
	Naomi.

Later: Joel walks up near the beach houses closed for the
season.  He peeks cautiously in a dark window.

Later: Joel digs into the sand with a stick.

INT. DINER - DAY

It's a local tourist place, but off-season empty.  Joel sits
in a booth and eats a grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of
tomato soup.  An elderly couple drink coffee at the counter.
Clementine enters, looks around, takes off her hood.  Joel
glances at her bright blue hair.  She picks an empty booth
and sits.  Joel studies her discreetly.  The waitress
approaches her with a coffee pot.

		WAITRESS
	Coffee?

		CLEMENTINE
	God, yes.  You've saved my life!

The waitress pours the coffee.

		WAITRESS
	You know what you want yet?

		CLEMENTINE
		(laughing)
	Ain't that the question of the century.

The waitress is not amused.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	You got grilled cheese and tomato soup?

		WAITRESS
	Yeah.  We're having a run on it.

The waitress heads to the grill.  Clementine fishes in her
bag, brings the coffee cup under the table for a moment,
pours something in, then brings the cup back up.

		CLEMENTINE
		(calling)
	And some cream, please.

Clementine looks around the place.  Her eyes meet Joel's
before he is able to look away.  She smiles vaguely.  He
looks embarrassed, then down at his journal.  Clementine
pulls a book from her purse and starts to read.  Joel glances
up, tries to see the cover.  It's blue.  He can't read the
title.

EXT. BEACH - DAY

Joel stares out at the ocean.  Far down the beach Clementine
stares at it, too.  Joel glances sideways at her then back at
the ocean.

EXT. MONTAUK TRAIN STATION PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON

Joel sits on the bench waiting for a train.  Clementine
enters the platform, sees Joel, the only other person there.
She waves, sort of goofily enthusiastic, playing as if
they're old friends.  He waves back, embarrassed.  She takes
a seat on a bench far down the platform.  Joel stares at his
hands, pulls out his journal and tries to write in order to
conceal his awkwardness.

INT. TRAIN - A BIT LATER

Joel sits at the far end of the empty car and watches the
slowly passing desolate terrain.  After a moment the door
between cars opens and Clementine enters.  Joel looks up.
Clementine is not looking at him; she busies herself deciding
where to sit.  She settles on a seat at the opposite end of
the car.  Joel looks out the window.  He feels her watching
him.  The train is picking up speed.  Finally:

		CLEMENTINE
		(calling over the rumble)
	Hi!

Joel looks over.

		JOEL
	I'm sorry.

		CLEMENTINE
	Why?

		JOEL
	Why what?

		CLEMENTINE
	Why are you sorry?  I just said hi.

		JOEL
	No, I didn't know if you were talking to
	me, so...

She looks around the empty car.

		CLEMENTINE
	Really?

		JOEL
		(embarrassed)
	Well, I didn't want to assume.

		CLEMENTINE
	Aw, c'mon, live dangerously.  Take the
	leap and assume someone is talking to you
	in an otherwise empty car.

		JOEL
	Anyway.  Sorry.  Hi.

Clementine makes her way down the aisle towards Joel.

		CLEMENTINE
	It's okay if I sit closer?  So I don't
	have to scream.  Not that I don't need to
	scream sometimes, believe me.
		(pause)
	But I don't want to bug you if you're
	trying to write or something.

		JOEL
	No, I mean, I don't know.  I can't really
	think of much to say probably.

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh.  So...

She hesitates in the middle of the car, looks back where she
came from.

		JOEL
	I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down
	here.  I didn't mean to --

		CLEMENTINE
	No, I don't want to bug you if you're
	trying to --

		JOEL
	It's okay, really.

		CLEMENTINE
	Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe.
	I have a long trip ahead of me.
		(sits across aisle from Joel)
	How far are you going?  On the train, I
	mean, of course.

		JOEL
	Rockville Center.

		CLEMENTINE
	Get out!  Me too!  What are the odds?

		JOEL
	The weirder part is I think actually I
	recognize you.  I thought that earlier in
	the diner.  That's why I was looking at
	you.  You work at Borders, right?

		CLEMENTINE
	Ucch, really?  You're kidding.  God.
	Bizarre small world, huh?  Yeah, that's
	me: book slave there for, like, five
	years now.

		JOEL
	Really?  Because --

		CLEMENTINE
	Jesus, is it five years?  I gotta quit
	right now.

		JOEL
	-- because I go there all the time.  I
	don't think I ever saw you before.

		CLEMENTINE
	Well, I'm there.  I hide in the back as
	much as is humanly possible.  You have a
	cell phone?  I need to quit right this
	minute.  I'll call in dead.

		JOEL
	I don't have one.

		CLEMENTINE
	I'll go on the dole.  Like my daddy
	before me.

		JOEL
	I noticed your hair.  I guess it made an
	impression on me, that's why I was pretty
	sure I recognized you.

		CLEMENTINE
	Ah, the hair.
		(pulls a strand in front of her
		 eyes, studies it)
	Blue, right?  It's called Blue Ruin.  The
	color.  Snappy name, huh?

		JOEL
	I like it.

		CLEMENTINE
	Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were
	wondering.

		JOEL
	Yeah.  Tom Waits says it in --

		CLEMENTINE
	Exactly!  Tom Waits.  Which song?

		JOEL
	I can't remember.

		CLEMENTINE
	Anyway, this company makes a whole line
	of colors with equally snappy names.  Red
	Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution.
	That'd be a job, coming up with those
	names.  How do you get a job like that?
	That's what I'll do.  Fuck the dole.

		JOEL
	I don't really know how --

		CLEMENTINE
	Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.

		JOEL
	You think that could possibly be a full
	time job?  How many hair colors could
	there be?

		CLEMENTINE
		(pissy)
	Someone's got that job.
		(excited)
	Agent Orange!  I came up with that one.
	Anyway, there are endless color
	possibilities and I'd be great at it.

		JOEL
	I'm sure you would.

		CLEMENTINE
	My writing career!  Your hair written by
	Clementine Kruczynski.
		(thought)
	The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.

		JOEL
	You sure?  That doesn't sound --

		CLEMENTINE
	I think.  Anyway, I've tried all their
	colors.  More than once.  I'm getting too
	old for this.  But it keeps me from
	having to develop an actual personality.
	I apply my personality in a paste.  You?

		JOEL
	Oh, I doubt that's the case.

		CLEMENTINE
	Well, you don't know me, so... you don't
	know, do you?

		JOEL
	Sorry.  I was just trying to be nice.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah, I got it.

There's a silence.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	My name's Clementine, by the way.

		JOEL
	I'm Joel.

		CLEMENTINE
	No jokes about my name?  Oh, you wouldn't
	do that; you're trying to be nice.

		JOEL
	I don't know any jokes about your name.

		CLEMENTINE
	Huckleberry Hound?

		JOEL
	I don't know what that means.

		CLEMENTINE
	Huckleberry Hound!  What, are you nuts?

		JOEL
	I'm nut nuts.

		CLEMENTINE
		(singing)
	Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my
	darlin' Clementine?  No?

		JOEL
	Sorry.  It's a pretty name, though.  It
	means "merciful", right?

		CLEMENTINE
		(impressed)
	Yeah.  Although it hardly fits.  I'm a
	vindictive little bitch, truth be told.

		JOEL
	See, I wouldn't think that about you.

		CLEMENTINE
		(pissy)
	Why wouldn't you think that about me?

		JOEL
	Oh.  I don't know.  I was just... I don't
	know.  I was... You seemed nice, so --

		CLEMENTINE
	Now I'm nice?  Don't you know any other
	adjectives?  There's careless and snotty
	and overbearing and argumentative...
	mumpish.

		JOEL
	Well, anyway... Sorry.

They sit in silence for a while.

		CLEMENTINE
	I just don't think "nice" is a
	particularly interesting thing to be.

The conductor enters the car.

		CONDUCTOR
	Tickets.

Joel hands the conductor his ticket.  The conductor punches
it and hands it back.

		CLEMENTINE
	What is nice, anyway?  I mean, besides an
	adjective?  I guess it can be an adverb,
	sort of.

The conductor turns to Clementine.  She fishes in her bag.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	It doesn't reveal anything.  Nice is
	pandering.  Cowardly.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	And life is more interesting than that.
	Or should be.  Jesus God, I hope it is...
	someday.
		(to conductor)
	I know it's here.

The conductor and Joel watch as she gets more agitated.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	I don't need nice.  I don't need myself
	to be it and I don't need anyone else to
	be it at me.

		JOEL
	Okay.

		CLEMENTINE
	Shit.  Shit.  I know it's here.  Hold on.

She dumps the contents of the bag onto the seat and sifts
frantically through.  Joel sees the book she was reading in
the diner.  It's The Play by Stephen Dixon.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Damn it.  DAMN IT!
		(there it is)
	Oh.  Here.

She hands the conductor the tickets, smiles sweetly.  He
punches it, hands it back to her, and walks away.

		CONDUCTOR
	Next stop Southampton.

The conductor heads into the next car.  Clementine shoves
stuff back into her purse.  Her hands are a little shaky.
She pulls a airline-sized bottle of alcohol from her pocket,
opens it, and downs it.  Joel is watching all of this but
pretending not to.  She looks out the window for a while.
The train pulls into the station.  The doors open.  Nobody
gets on.  The doors close.  The train pulls out.

		CLEMENTINE
	Joel?  It's Joel, right?

		JOEL
	Yes?

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm sorry I... yelled at you.  Was it
	yelling?  I can't really tell.  Whatever,
	I'm a little out of sorts today.

		JOEL
	That's okay.

		CLEMENTINE
		(stares out window)
	My embarrassing admission is I really
	like that you're nice.  Right now,
	anyway.  I can't tell from one moment to
	the next what I'm going to like.  But
	right now I'm glad you said, "that's
	okay" to me.  That was nice of you.

		JOEL
	It's no problem.  Anyway, I have some
	stuff I need to --

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh, okay.  Well, sure, I'll just...
		(stands, throws bag over
		 shoulder)
	Take care, then.

		JOEL
		(pulling journal from
		 briefcase)
	Probably see you at the book store.

		CLEMENTINE
		(heading toward other end of
		 car)
	Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.

Clementine sits and stares out the window.

INT. TRAIN - LATER

There are a few more people in the car now.  Clementine has
inched a few seats closer to Joel.  She watches him.  His
head is immersed in his journal.

INT. TRAIN - LATER

It's dark out.  The train is pretty crowded.  Joel stares out
the window.  Clementine sits closer still to Joel, eyes him.

EXT. TRAIN STATION - EVENING

The doors open and Joel emerges along with others.  He heads
to the parking lot, arrives at the car.  There's a big dented
scrape along the driver's side.  He gets in.

INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Joel drives.  He passes Clementine walking.  She looks cold.
He considers, slows, rolls down his window.

		JOEL
	Hi.  I could give you a ride if you need.

		CLEMENTINE
	No, that's okay.  Thanks, though.

		JOEL
	You're sure?  It's cold.

		CLEMENTINE
	I don't want to take you out of your way.

		JOEL
	It's okay.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah?

He pulls over.  She climbs in.  They drive.

		JOEL
	Where do you live?

		CLEMENTINE
	You're not a stalker or anything, right?

		JOEL
	Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were,
	but no.

		CLEMENTINE
	You can't be too careful.  I've been
	stalked.  I've been told I'm highly
	stalkable.  I don't need that.

		JOEL
	I'm not a stalker.

		CLEMENTINE
		(beat)
	You know Wilmont?

		JOEL
	Yeah.

		CLEMENTINE
	Wilmont.  Near the high school.

Joel turns.  They drive in silence.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of
	nutso.  I'm not really.

		JOEL
	It's okay.  I didn't think you were.

There's a silence.

		CLEMENTINE
	So you like bookstores, huh?

		JOEL
	I like to read.

		CLEMENTINE
	Me too.  It is Rain Dogs, by the way.

		JOEL
	Yeah?  I can't remember that album very
	well.  I remember liking it.  But --

		CLEMENTINE
	The song's 9th and Hennepin.  I spent
	most of the train ride trying to
	remember.  "Till you're full of rag water
	and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill
	out/Over the side to anyone who'll
	listen."  Remember?

		JOEL
	Sort of, um...

		CLEMENTINE
	Remember?  "And you take on the dreams of
	the ones who have slept there/And I'm
	lost in the window/I hide on the
	stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in
	your hat..."
		(starts to cry)
	Oh, shit.  I'm so stupid.  Sorry.

		JOEL
	What?

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm just a bit of a wreck.  "I sleep in
	your hat" makes me cry.
		(pointing to a house)
	Me.

Joel pulls over.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Thanks very much.  That was very nice of
	you.

		JOEL
	Well, I wouldn't want to be --

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh, geez, I'm full of shit.  I already
	told you that.
		(pause)
	Anyway.  See Ya.

Clementine opens the car door.

		JOEL
	Take care.

		CLEMENTINE
		(turning back)
	Hey, do you want to have a drink?  I have
	lots of drinks.  And I could --

		JOEL
	Um --

		CLEMENTINE
	Never mind.  Sorry, that was stupid.  I'm
	embarrassed.  Good night, Joel.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Joel stands in the living room, somewhat nervously.  He tries
to calm himself by focusing on the surroundings.  He looks at
the books on her shelves.  Clementine is in the kitchen.  We
see her as she passes by the doorway several times, preparing
drinks and chatting.

		CLEMENTINE
	Thanks.  I like it, too.  Been here about
	four years.  It's really cheap.  My
	downstairs neighbor is old so she's
	quiet, which is great.  And the
	landlord's sweet, which is bizarre, but
	great, and I have a little porch in the
	back, which is great, because I can read
	there, and listen to my crickets and...

Clementine is in the living room now with two gin and tonics.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Two blue ruins...

Joel is looking at a framed black and white photograph of
crows flying.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	You like that?

		JOEL
	Very much.

		CLEMENTINE
	This... someone gave that to me, just
	like, recently.  I like it, too.  I like
	crows.  I think I used to be a crow.

She caws and hands Joel a drink.

		JOEL
	Thanks.  That was good, that crow sound.

		CLEMENTINE
	Do you believe in that stuff?
	Reincarnation?

		JOEL
	I don't know.

		CLEMENTINE
	Me neither.  Oh, there's an inscription
	on the back.
		(takes it off the wall, reads:)
	The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust
	of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my
	heart/A change of mood/And saved some
	part/Of a day I rued.

		JOEL
	Frost?

		CLEMENTINE
		(impressed)
	Yeah.  I'm not, like, a Robert Frost
	lover by any stretch.  His stuff seems
	strictly grade school to me.  But this
	made me cry for some reason.  Maybe
	because it is grade school.  Y'know?

		JOEL
	It's pretty.

		CLEMENTINE
	I miss grade school.  I don't know why
	I'm calling it grade school all of a
	sudden.  When I went we called it
	elementary school.  But I like grade
	school better.  Sounds like something
	someone from the forties would call it.
	I'd like to be from then.  Everyone wore
	hats.  Anyway, cheers!

		JOEL
	Cheers.

They click glasses.  Clementine giggles and takes a big gulp
of her drink.  Joel sips.  She plops down on the couch and
pulls her boots off.

		CLEMENTINE
	God, that feels so fucking good.  Take
	yours off.

		JOEL
	I'm fine.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah?  Well, have a seat, anyway.

Joel sits in a chair across the room.  Clementine finishes
her drink.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Ready for another?

		JOEL
	No, I'm okay for now.

She heads toward the kitchen with her glass.

		CLEMENTINE
	Well, I'm ready.  Put some music on.

Joel crosses to the CD's and studies them.

		JOEL
	What do you want to hear?

		CLEMENTINE (O.S.)
	You pick it.

		JOEL
	You just say.  I'm not really --

		CLEMENTINE (O.S.)
	I don't know!  I can't see them from
	here, Joel!  Just pick something good.

Joel studies the unfamiliar CD's.  He picks up Bang On a Can
performing Brian Eno's Music for Airports to look at.
Clementine reenters with her drink.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Oh, excellent choice.

She grabs it and sticks it in the CD player.  The music is
dreamy and haunting and slow.  Clementine falls back onto the
couch, closes her eyes and sips her drink.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Mmmmmmm.  Way to go, Joel.  You pick
	good.

Joel sits down in his chair and drinks.  There's a silence,
which seems fine to Clementine but makes Joel anxious.

		JOEL
	Well, I should probably get going.

		CLEMENTINE
	No, stay.  Just for a little while.
		(opens her eyes, brightly)
	Refill?

		JOEL
	No.  I --

		CLEMENTINE
	I know a man who needs a refill.

She grabs Joel's drink from his hand, takes it into the
kitchen.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D) (O.S.) (CONT'D)
	God bless alcohol, is what I say.  Where
	would I be without it.  Oh, Jesus, Mary,
	and Joseph, maybe I don't want to think
	about that.

She giggles.  Joel looks around the room again.  There are
several potatoes dressed as women in beautiful handmade
costumes: a nurse potato, a stripper potato, a schoolteacher
potato, a housewife potato.  Clementine returns with Joel's
drink and a refill for herself.

		JOEL
	Thanks.

		CLEMENTINE
	Drink up, young man.  It'll make the
	whole seduction part less repugnant.

Joel looks a little alarmed.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	I'm just kidding.  C'mon.

She sits back on the couch, closes her eyes.  Joel watches
her, looks at her breasts.  She opens her eyes, smiles
drunkenly at him.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.

		JOEL
	Yeah?

		CLEMENTINE
	Well, I go to a psychic and she's always
	telling me I'm psychic.  She should know.
	Do you believe in that stuff?

		JOEL
	I don't know.

		CLEMENTINE
	Me neither.  But sometimes I have
	premonitions, so, I don't know.  Maybe
	that's just coincidence.  Right?  Y'know,
	you think something and then it happens,
	or you think a word and then someone says
	it?  Y'know?

		JOEL
	Yeah, I don't know.  It's hard to know.

		CLEMENTINE
	Exactly.  Exactly!  That's exactly my
	feeling about it.  It's hard to know.
	Like, okay, but how many times do I think
	something and it doesn't happen?  That's
	what you're saying, right?  You forget
	about those times.  Right?

		JOEL
	Yeah, I guess.

		CLEMENTINE
		(dreamy beat)
	But I think I am.  I like to think I am.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	It's helpful to think there's some order
	to things.  You're kind of closed
	mouthed, aren't you?

		JOEL
	Sorry.  My life isn't that interesting.
	I go to work.  I go home.  I don't know
	what to say.

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh.
		(considers this)
	Does that make you sad?  Or anxious?  I'm
	always anxious thinking I'm not living my
	life to the fullest, y'know?  Taking
	advantage of every possibility?  Just
	making sure that I'm not wasting one
	second of the little time I have.

		JOEL
	I think about that.

She looks at him really hard for a long moment.  Joel tries
to hold her gaze, but can't.  He looks down at his drink.
Clementine starts to cry again.

		CLEMENTINE
	You're really nice.  I'm sorry I yelled
	at you before about it.  God, I'm an
	idiot.

		JOEL
	I do have a tendency to use that word too
	much.

		CLEMENTINE
	I like you.  That's the thing about my
	psychic thing.  I think that's my
	greatest psychic power, that I get a
	sense about people.  My problem is I
	never trust it.  But I get it.  And with
	you I get that you're a really good guy.

		JOEL
	Thanks.

		CLEMENTINE
	And, anyway, you sell yourself short.  I
	can tell.  There's a lot of stuff going
	on in your brain.  I can tell.  My
	goal... can I tell you my goal?

		JOEL
	Yeah.

		CLEMENTINE
		(ala Paul Simon)
	What's the goal, Joel?
		(laughs)
	My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow
	through me?  Do you know what I mean?
	It's like, there's all these emotions and
	ideas and they come quick and they change
	and they leave and they come back in a
	different form and I think we're all
	taught we should be consistent.  Y'know?
	You love someone -- that's it.  Forever.
	You choose to do something with your life
	-- that's it, that's what you do.  It's a
	sign of maturity to stick with that and
	see things through.  And my feeling is
	that's how you die, because you stop
	listening to what is true, and what is
	true is constantly changing.  You know?

		JOEL
	Yeah.  I think so.  It's hard to --

		CLEMENTINE
	Like I wanted to talk to you.  I didn't
	need any more reason to do it.  Who knows
	what bigger cosmic reason might exist?

		JOEL
	Yeah.

		CLEMENTINE
	You're very nice.  God, I have to stop
	saying that.  You're nervous around me,
	huh?

		JOEL
	No.

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm nervous.  You don't need to be
	nervous around me, though.  I like you.
	Do you think I'm repulsively fat?

		JOEL
	No, not at all.

		CLEMENTINE
	I don't either.  I used to.  But I'm
	through with that.  Y'know, if I don't
	love my body, then I'm just lost.  You
	know?

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	With all the wrinkles and scars and the
	general falling apart that's coming
	'round the bend.
		(beat)
	So, I've been seeing this guy...

Joel looks slightly crestfallen.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
		(off his reaction)
	Well, for the last week, anyway!  He's
	kind of a kid.  Kind of a goofball, but
	he's really stuck on me, which is
	flattering.  Who wouldn't like that?  And
	he's, like, a dope, but he says these
	smart and moving things sometimes, out of
	nowhere, that just break my heart.  He's
	the one who gave me that crow photograph.

		JOEL
	Oh, yeah.

		CLEMENTINE
	That made me cry.  But, anyway, we went
	up to Boston, because I had this urge to
	lie on my back on the Charles River.  It
	gets frozen this time of year.

		JOEL
	That's scary sounding.

		CLEMENTINE
	Exactly!  I used to do it in college and
	I had this urge to go do it again, so I
	got Patrick and we drove all night to get
	there and he was sweet and said nice
	things to me, but I was really
	disappointment to be there with him.
	Y'know?  And that's where psychic stuff
	comes in.  Like, it just isn't right with
	him.  Y'know?

		JOEL
	I think so.

		CLEMENTINE
	I don't believe in that soulmate crap
	anymore, but... he says so many great
	things.  We like the same writers.  This
	writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to.
	And he's cute.  It's fucked up.  Joel,
	you should come up to the Charles with me
	sometime.

		JOEL
	Okay.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah?  Oh, great!

She sits closer to him.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic --
	night picnics are different -- and --

		JOEL
		(shy)
	Sounds good.  But right now I should go.

		CLEMENTINE
		(pause)
	You should stay.

		JOEL
	I have to get up early in the morning
	tomorrow, so...

		CLEMENTINE
		(beat)
	Okay.

Joel puts on his overcoat.  Clementine heads to the phone
table, pulls out a notepad.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	I would like you to call me.  Would you
	do that?  I would like that.

		JOEL
	Yes.

She scribbles her phone number, hands it to him.  He puts it
in his pocket.  He stands there uncomfortably for a moment,
then forces himself to speak.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	I don't think your personality comes out
	of a tube.  I think the hair is just... a
	pretty topping.

She tears up, swallows, and kisses him on the cheek.  He's
surprised and pleased and nervous.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
		(shyly formal)
	So, I enjoyed meeting you.

		CLEMENTINE
	You'll call me, right?

		JOEL
	Yeah.

		CLEMENTINE
	When?

		JOEL
	Tomorrow?

		CLEMENTINE
	Tonight.  Just to test out the phone
	lines and all.

		JOEL
	Okay.

We stay with Clementine as she watches Joel tromping through
the snow and getting in his car.

INT. JOEL'S CAR - NIGHT

Joel speeds through the suburban Rockville Center
neighborhood.  There is no snow on the ground.  He seems
different, somehow foggy and disoriented.

SUBTITLE:  THREE DAYS EARLIER

He arrives at his apartment building and parks.

EXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Joel gets out of his car, spots a van parked across the
street.  There are two dark figures inside.

		VOICE-OVER
	Them.

He hurries inside the building.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel enters, dumps his overcoat on a chair, turns off the
lights, crosses to look furtively out the window.  It's
snowing in large flakes which seem to fall only in the beam
of a streetlight.

		JOEL
	It was snowing.

		VOICE-OVER
	There are two of them.  Couldn't make
	them out.  The orange glow of a
	cigarette.

Joel squints to see inside the van.  Two dark figures talk.
One sucks on a cigarette and s dim orange light momentarily
illuminates the interior.  The figure in the driver seat
rolls down his window and gives a cheery wave to Joel.

		JOEL
	The driver waved.  So casual, friendly.

		VOICE-OVER
	I'm like a joke to them.

Joel pulls away from the window, his face blanched.

		VOICE-OVER
	I guess they figure they can act like
	they want.  They don't have to worry
	about me remembering.

He paces, mulling things over.  As he does, the scene starts
to change, almost as if it is drying out.

		JOEL
	I might be making a mistake.

		VOICE-OVER
	Maybe I'm making a mistake.  Maybe I just
	need to learn to live with this.  First
	of all, I'll get over it.  Secondly, it
	happened.  Those who do not remember
	history are condemned to repeat it.  Who
	said that?  Churchill?  I'm not sure.
	But I don't care.  She did it to me.  I
	have to rid myself of this.  Fuck her.

		JOEL
	Fuck you, Clementine.

The colors bleach, the surroundings become slightly vague.
Even Joel's persona and voice-over seem to alter, his
emotional intensity becoming diffused.  Joel does not seem
aware of this.  He stops pacing, takes a small vial from his
pocket, dumps the lone pill onto his palm.  He looks at it.
It's pink.  There's some illegible initials stamped on it.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Pink.
		(beat)
	There was a number on it.  I remember.
	AL 1718?
		(beat)
	I have to follow through with this.  I
	have no choice.

		VOICE-OVER
	The pill was pink, I remember.  It had
	some letters and numbers on it.  What
	were they?  AL 1718?  AL something.  Four
	digits.  I don't like taking pills when I
	don't know what they are.  I have no
	choice.

He swallows it, peeks out the window again, takes off his
clothes, slips into a pair of pajamas fresh from the store
packaging.  He sits on the edge of the bed, dials the phone.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	We're sorry, the number you have
	dialed...
		(beat)
	Screw you, Clementine, for doing this ...

		RECORDED VOICE
	We're sorry, the number you have dialed
	is no longer in service.  If you think
	you have reached this recording in error
	-

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Bye.

Joel hangs up and lies on his back on the bed.  By now the
scene is lifeless, almost a husk.  He hears the apartment
building door open.  He hears footsteps.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	It's them.

		VOICE-OVER
	It's too late.

His eyelids are getting heavy.  He closes his eyes.

BLACK.

He hears a key in his apartment door.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Fuck.

INT. BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

Joel sits in the bookstore coffee shop.  It's a jarring
transition, visually and emotionally.  Joel is in the midst
of some traumatic state of mind.
He fingers the vial with the pink pill in it as he watches
Clementine stack books on shelves.  Her hair is bright orange
now.

		JOEL
	I should maybe talk to you.

		VOICE-OVER
	Clementine.  I should just maybe talk to
	her.

Joel rises and heads toward Clementine.

		JOEL
	I love you and if you knew that... if I
	told you what happened...  I'll explain
	everything, what we meant to each other.
	I'll tell you everything about our time
	together.  You'll know everything again
	and...

		VOICE-OVER
	Maybe if I just explain what happened, I
	wouldn't have to go through this and I
	could tell you everything and it would be
	like you knew and we could rebuild and we
	could be happy again and...

Right before Joel gets there, Patrick, a skinny young man
approaches Clementine.  Joel stops, watches.  The young man
seems out of breath.  He glances over at Joel, then taps
Clementine on the shoulder.  She turns, annoyed, sees who it
is and her face lights up.

		JOEL
	Clementine.

		VOICE-OVER
	That's your look for me.

Clementine giggles, stands and pokes Patrick playfully in the
ribs.

		PATRICK
	I just thought I'd say hi.  I was in the
	neighborhood.

		CLEMENTINE
	You were not.

		PATRICK
	I was not.

Joel is mesmerized by their familiarity.  As he stands there,
the scene starts to dry out.
Clementine and Patrick continue their flirtation but it's
turning lifeless, as if they are just reciting lines.  The
bookstore start to lose its color and immediacy.

		CLEMENTINE
	Come over after I'm done here?

		PATRICK
	I can't.  I want to, but I have to study.

		CLEMENTINE
	You rat.

		PATRICK
	I really want to, but tonight's
	important.  Test tomorrow.

		JOEL
	How could she have done this to me?  How
	could anyone do this to anyone?

		CLEMENTINE
		(to Patrick)
	You didn't say anything about my hair.

		PATRICK
	It's so cool.  You're by far the most
	sensational person in the room.

		CLEMENTINE
	In the room?

		PATRICK
	In the world.

Joel seems dazed, in some sort of dream confusion, as he
realizes the world around him is looking increasingly odd.

		JOEL
	What's happening here?
		(looks at watch; it's 9:30)
	Oh, God!  I have to go home.  They'll be
	there soon.

Joel turns to leave.

INT. JOEL'S CAR - NIGHT

Joel drives fast, recklessly.  The intensity is back.  He's
weeping as he drives.

		JOEL
	Gotta get home.  How could she do this to
	me?
	How could she not care about what we
	meant to each other.  What a fuck!  What
	a fucking monster she is!

		VOICE-OVER
	Oh, God.  I miss her.  I can't believe
	she's with that guy now!  I'm never going
	to see her again.  I love her so much.
	What a fucking monster she is!

The scene is faded as he parks in front of his apartment
building, and gets out of the car.  Joel spots the parked
van.  We've seen this before, but it's dried out now.

		JOEL
	Them.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY

Joel trudges along carrying two big trash bags full of stuff.
He's been crying.  He looks behind him and finds himself
looking out the window of his apartment at the dark van on
the snowy street.  He turns back to the New York Street and
spots the address he was looking for: 610 11th Avenue.

INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

Joel sits in the small room with his bags.  A woman across
from him cradles a box full of belongings in her lap.  Her
eyes are red from crying.  Mary, the receptionist, pokes her
head through her window into the waiting room.

		MARY
	Hello again, Mr. Barish.  Good, you've
	got your stuff.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Joel walks with his bags behind Mary.

		MARY
		(not looking back)
	How are you today?
		(at lab)
	Here we are.

INT. LABORATORY - DAY

Joel enters.  Mierzwiak stands there with Stan in his lab
coat.

		MIERZWIAK
	Ah, Mr. Barish.  This is Stan.  He'll be
	in charge of your procedure tonight.

Stan nods professionally.

		STAN
	Mr. Barish.

		JOEL
	How exactly is this going to work
	tonight?

As Mierzwiak talks, the room colors start to fade,
Mierzwiak's tone of voice is also affected; it becomes dry
and monotonous.

		MIERZWIAK
	We'll start with your most recent
	memories and go backwards -- There is an
	emotional core to each of our memories --
	As we eradicate this core, it starts its
	degradation process --  By the time you
	wake up in the morning, all memories
	we've targeted will have withered and
	disappeared.  Like a dream upon waking.

		JOEL
	Is there any sort of risk of brain
	damage?

		MIERZWIAK
	Well, technically, the procedure itself
	is brain damage, but on a par with a
	night of heavy drinking.  Nothing you'll
	miss.

Joel looks quizzically at the eroding environment.  Suddenly
he gets it.

		JOEL
	It's happening now!  I'm already in my
	brain.

Mierzwiak looks at the fading room.

		MIERZWIAK
	Yes, I suppose you are.
		(back in his faded memory
		 persona)
	So, let's get started -- If we want the
	procedure underway tonight, we have some
	work to do.

Joel is sitting in a chair.  Electrodes connect him to some
electronic machinery monitored by Stan.  Mierzwiak watches
from the corner.

		STAN
	We use the articles you brought to create
	a map of Clementine in your brain.
	Tonight while you sleep we'll be able to
	trace the map and erase.

		JOEL
	But you're tracing and erasing now.  It's
	already started.  I'm home in my bed.

Stan pulls a snow globe from one of Joel's bags, shows it to
Joel.  The equipment registers Joel's reaction.

		STAN
	Very good.

Stan pulls out a potato dressed as a Vegas showgirl.  Joel
studies it.  The machines register his response.

		MIERZWIAK
	We'll dispose of these mementos when
	we're done here.  That way you won't be
	confused later by their unexplainable
	presence in your home.

Stan pulls out a coffee mug with a photo of Clementine
printed on it.  Joel looks at the cup.  The machines record
his reaction.

		STAN
	Good.  We're getting healthy read-outs.

The room, Stan, and Mierzwiak are now vague and wispy.

		STAN'S VOICE
	Patrick, do me a favor --

Joel is watching Stan.  Stan is not speaking, yet his voice
continues.

		STAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	-- and check the voltage levels, I'm not
	wiping as clean as I would like here.

Joel looks up.  Stan's voice seems to be coming from above.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel lies on his back in fresh pajamas.  His eyes are closed
and electrodes connect his head to several machines.  The
machines are operated by Stan, now in grubby street clothes
and in need of a shave, and by Patrick, dressed similarly.
The monitor on one of the machines traces a myriad of light
blips running like streams through an image of Joel's brain.
Stan presses buttons and operates a joystick, aiming for the
lines.  Patrick (who we saw earlier with Clementine at the
bookstore) studies a meter on one of the machines.

		PATRICK
	The voltage looks fine.

		STAN
	Then check the connections.

Patrick fiddles with some jacks.

		PATRICK
	Does that help?

		STAN
	Yeah, that looks better.  Thanks.

INT. LAB ROOM - DAY

The memory is becoming vague, characters' affects flat.  Stan
pulls out a pile of loose-leaf pages.  Mierzwiak smiles.

		MIERZWIAK
	Ah, your journal.  This will be
	invaluable.

		STAN
		(reading)
	December 15th, 2004.  I met someone
	tonight.  Oh, Christ:  I don't know what
	to do.  Her name is Clementine and she's
	amazing.  So alive and spontaneous and
	passionate and sensitive.  Things with
	Naomi and I have been stagnant for so
	long.

The scene is just a shell of itself as Stan rattles on.

		STAN'S VOICE
	I think we got this one.  Let's push on.

Joel looks up at the ceiling.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - DAY

Joel, snapped into a new memory, cries as he fills two large
plastic garbage bags with mementos of his relationship with
Clementine.  There are funny little gifts, wind-up toys, some
potatoes dressed as women, some clothing Clementine has left
there, some CD's.  He pulls a big clump of pages out of his
loose-leaf journal and dumps them in the bag.

He gets some clean loose-leaf paper and writes:

December 15, 2004   Nothing much happened today.  I stayed
home.  Naomi worked on her dissertation.

The scene is fading as he continues to write.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Joel looks for an office number.  He finds it.  The plaque on
the door reads Lacuna Ltd.  Joel enters.

INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

Joel enters the Lacuna waiting room.  Mary sits in the
reception area.

		MARY
	May I help you?

		JOEL
	My name is Joel Barish.  I have an
	appointment.

		MARY
	Please have a seat.  Dr. Mierzwiak will
	be right with you.

INT. OFFICE HALL - DAY

Mary leads Joel down the hall.

		MARY
		(without turning)
	How are you today?

		JOEL
	Not great.

		MARY
		(at Mierzwiak's office)
	Here we are.

Joel glimpses Mary smiling coquettishly at Mierzwiak.

INT. MIERZWIAK'S OFFICE - DAY

Joel and Mierzwiak are in the sitting area.  Joel looks at
the tape recorder.

		MIERZWIAK
	I'm sorry you saw one of our notification
	cards.  You never should have.

		JOEL
	Well... I did.

		MIERZWIAK
	We can help you through this.  Why don't
	you start now by telling me everything
	you can remember about your relationship
	with Clementine.

		JOEL
		(thinks, then:)
	It was a mess.  I don't know how it got
	this way...

		PATRICK'S VOICE
	It's kind of a dump, don't you think?

Joel looks up, trying to locate the voice.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Patrick is checking out the apartment.  Stan monitors the
equipment.

		STAN
		(uninterested)
	It's an apartment.

		PATRICK
	Not a dump, then, but kind of plain.
	Uninspired.  And there's a stale smell.
	Sort of stuffy.  I don't know.  Stuffy.

		STAN
	Patrick, let's just get through this.  We
	have a long night ahead of us.

		PATRICK
	Yeah.

Patrick returns to the bedside, focuses on the machines for a
moment.  He glances at the unconscious Joel.

		PATRICK (CONT'D)
	So who do you think is better-looking, me
	or this guy?

Stan glances sideways at Patrick.

INT. MIERZWIAK'S OFFICE - DAY

Mierzwiak sits with Joel in the sitting area.

		MIERZWIAK
	So we'll need you to go home and bring in
	everything you ever received from
	Clementine and anything that might remind
	you of her...

The scene is faded and disappearing fast.  It's gone.

INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - DAY

Joel gets off the elevator and approaches the receptionist.

		JOEL
	So then she just stops calling.

		VOICE-OVER
	I wasn't going to call her.  Not after
	the way she was.

		JOEL
	Any messages, Carmen?

Carmen the receptionist shakes her head.

Next day: Joel approaches the receptionist.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Any messages for me, Carmen.

		CARMEN
	Nothing, Joel.

		VOICE-OVER
	It's bullshit.  She's punishing me for
	being honest with her.

Joel is at his office desk on the phone.

		PHONE MACHINE VOICE
	You have no messages.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel enters, checks his phone machine: zero messages.

INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - DAY

Joel gets off the elevator, approaches Carmen, who is in
conversation with someone else.

		JOEL
	Sorry, Carmen.  Any messages?

Carmen shakes her head "no", goes back to her conversation.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel checks his machine: zero messages.

		VOICE-OVER
	That's it.  I'm just gonna--

Without a moment's hesitation, he dials the phone.

		VOICE-OVER (CONT'D)
	I'm gonna tell her I'm through playing
	games and --

		RECORDED VOICE
	The number you have dialed has been
	disconnected.

Joel's eyes bug.

INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Joel sits across Rob and Carrie, mid-40's.

		JOEL
	Why would she do that?

		VAGUE RECORDED VOICE
	-- If you think you have reached this
	recording in error, please check your
	number and dial again.

		CARRIE
	I don't know, honey.  It's horrible.

		JOEL
	She's punishing me for being honest.  I
	should just go to her house.

		ROB
	I don't think you should go there, Joel.

		JOEL
	Yeah, I don't want to seem desperate.

		CARRIE
	Maybe you need to look at this as a sign
	to move on.  Just make a clean break.

		JOEL
	I don't know.  I'm so... I can't believe
	she'd be so goddamn immature!

		ROB
	Joel, look, the thing is --

		CARRIE
		(agitated, interrupting)
	Joel, honey... We have to feed the dog.
	Would you just wait here?  Just a second.

Joel nods, confused, as Rob and Carrie leave the room and
close the door behind them.  Joel hears a hushed argument
ensue in the hall.  He notices the dog asleep on the floor.
He grabs a magazine off the coffee table, flips through it
distractedly as he paces, puts it down, picks up another.  A
subscription card falls to the floor.  He picks it up and is
about to shove it back in the magazine when he sees it is not
a subscription card at all.  It reads:

 Clementine Kruczynski has had Joel Barish erased from her
  memory.  Please never mention their relationship to her
		 again.  Thank you.

		     Lacuna Ltd.
		     610 11th Avenue, NY, NY

Joel stares at the card, incredulous.

Later: Rob and Carrie are now back in the room.

		CARRIE (CONT'D)
	You weren't supposed to see that.

		JOEL
	They can't erase memories.  It's a joke.
	It's a nasty Clementine hoax.

		CARRIE
	Sweetie, we called the company.

Joel just stands there.

Close-up of a vague dictionary page.

		VOICE-OVER
	Lacuna:  Noun.  A blank, a missing
	portion, especially in a manuscript.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel is on the phone pacing.

		CARRIE'S VOICE
	You can't tell her, Joel.  They explained
	that.  Like waking a sleepwalker.  It
	might have a devastating effect.

INT. JOEL'S CAR - NIGHT

Joel drives past vague local landmark.

		CARRIE'S VOICE
	Think about it: to be told you lived an
	existence of which you have no
	recollection.

		JOEL'S VOICE
	But what am I supposed to do?

		CARRIE'S VOICE
	Move on, sweetie.

		JOEL'S VOICE
	How can I?  How can I move on when I know
	I'm the only one to carry this love we
	had?  How do I do that?

INT. CAR - NIGHT

Joel in his parked car next to a fence surrounding a drive-in
movie closed for the season.  He weeps.  The windows fog up
until the outside is completely obscured.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY

Joel looks for an address.

INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

Joel gets off on the sixth floor.  He searches for a room
number.  As he turns the corner, he sees that the hallway is
faded, vague and mostly erased.  He keeps walking, comes to
the door marked Lacuna and opens it.  Inside he can see
vague, erased version of Mary the receptionist.

		MARY
		(dead monotone)
	Hi, May I help you?

These degraded, faded memories allow Joel to detach himself
and hear what's going on in his bedroom.

		STAN'S VOICE
	So, Mary's coming over tonight.

Joel looks up.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Stan works the joystick.  Patrick sits on the bed with Joel.

		PATRICK
	Yeah?

		STAN
	Just wanted to let you know.

		PATRICK
	I like Mary.  I like when she comes to
	visit.  I just don't think she likes me.

		STAN
	She likes you okay.

		PATRICK
	I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend
	over, too.  I have a girlfriend now.

		STAN
	You can if you want.

		PATRICK
	Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?

		STAN
		(re: memory on monitor)
	This one's history.  Moving on...

		PATRICK
	The thing is ... my situation is a little
	weird.  My girlfriend situation.

		STAN
	Patrick, we need to focus.

Stan aims the joystick.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel distractedly reads a book, checks the clock, goes back
to the book.  The door opens.  He looks up.  Clementine is
staggering in, drunk.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yo ho ho!

		JOEL
	It's three.

		VOICE-OVER
	Shit.  The last time I saw you.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing.  I
	kinda sorta wrecked your car...

		JOEL
	I can't believe you wrecked my car.

		JOEL
	You're driving drunk.  It's pathetic.

		CLEMENTINE
	...a little.  I was a little tipsy.
	Don't call me pathetic.

		JOEL
	Well it is pathetic.  And fucking
	irresponsible.  You could've killed
	somebody.

The scene is starting to degrade.  The acting becomes anemic.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	I don't know, maybe you did kill
	somebody.

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody.  It's
	just a fucking dent.  You're like some
	old lady or something.

		VOICE-OVER
	Right!  She called me an old lady here,
	too!  And I remember, I said...

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	And what are you like?  A wino?

		CLEMENTINE
	A wino?  Jesus, Are you from the fifties?
	A wino!
		(laughs)
	Face it, Joel.  You're freaked out
	because I was out late without you, and
	in your little wormy brain, you're trying
	to figure out, did she fuck someone
	tonight?

		JOEL
	No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked
	someone tonight.  Isn't that how you get
	people to like you?

This shuts Clementine up.  She is stung and she starts
gathering up her belongings, which are strewn about the
apartment.  Joel is immediately sorry he said this.  He
follows her around.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	I'm sorry.  Okay.  I didn't mean that.  I
	just... I was just... pissed, I guess.

Clementine is out the door.  Joel follows.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Joel looks at his dented car, looks at Clementine clomping
off in the distance.

INT. JOEL'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Joel drives to catch up with Clementine.  He rolls down his
window to talk to her.

		JOEL
	Let me drive you home.

		CLEMENTINE
		(without turning)
	Fuck you, Joel.  Faggot.

		JOEL
	Look at it out here.  It's falling apart.
	I'm erasing you.  And I'm happy.

She keeps clomping.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	You did it to me.  I can't believe you
	did this to me.  By morning you'll be
	gone.  Ha!

He stops the car, gets out.

EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

It's a street you might see in a dream, more an impression of
a quiet street than an actual one, with what little detail
there is obscured in darkness.  Joel wanders it.  In the
distance Clementine walks off, but as in an animated loop,
she doesn't get any farther away.  It's lonely.

		PATRICK'S VOICE
	See, remember that girl?  The one we did
	last week?  The one with the potatoes?

Joel looks up, startled.

		STAN'S VOICE
	Yeah, that's this guy's girlfriend.  Was.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Stan watches the screen.  Patrick paces, fidgets, looks at
the unconscious Joel.

		PATRICK
	I gotta tell you something.  I kind of
	fell in love with her last night.

		STAN
	She was unconscious, Patrick.

		PATRICK
	She was beautiful.  So sweet and funky
	and voluptuous.  I kind of stole a pair
	of her panties, is what.

		STAN
	Jesus, Patrick!

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

On the vague street Joel listens to Patrick and Stan.

		PATRICK'S VOICE
	I know.  It's not like... I mean, they
	were clean and all.

		STAN'S VOICE
	Look, just don't tell me this stuff.  I
	don't want to know this shit.

		PATRICK'S VOICE
	Yeah, okay.

		STAN'S VOICE
	We have work to do.

There's a click and Joel finds himself in --

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel and Clementine sit and eat dinner in front of the TV.
It's hard to make out what they're watching.
They sit on opposite ends of the couch.  They look bored.
The scene quickly degenerates.  The room fades.

		PATRICK'S VOICE
	Okay, but there's more.

Joel listens.

		PATRICK'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	After we did her, I went to where she
	worked and I asked her out.

Joel looks over at the faded Clementine across the couch.
She stares straight ahead at the TV.

		STAN'S VOICE
	Patrick... do you know how unethical...

		JOEL
	That must be the guy I saw you with.

		VOICE-OVER
	In the bookstore that night.  The skinny
	guy.

There's a click and Joel finds himself in --

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel watches TV.  Clementine walks by in her underwear, looks
at the TV.  She slips into a skirt.

		CLEMENTINE
	How can you watch this crap?

		JOEL
	Where are you going?

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.

The scene starts to fade.  Clementine puts on her shoes and
heads out the door.

EXT. ZOO - DAY

Joel and Clementine walk around unhappily.  They barely look
at the animals.  Clementine watches parents with babies.

		JOEL
	Oh shit.  I remember this.
		(to Clementine)
	Want to go?

		CLEMENTINE
		(pissy)
	I want to have a baby.

		JOEL
	Let's talk about it later.

		CLEMENTINE
	No.  I want to have a baby.  I have to
	have a baby.

		JOEL
	I don't think we're ready.

		CLEMENTINE
	You're not ready.

		JOEL
	Clementine, do you really think you could
	take care of a kid?

She turns violently toward him, glaring.

		CLEMENTINE
	What?!

		JOEL
		(mumbly)
	I don't want to talk about this here.

		CLEMENTINE
	Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!

Joel looks around.  People are watching.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	You can't fucking say something like that
	and say you don't want to talk about it!

		JOEL
	Clem, I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have --

		CLEMENTINE
		(screaming now)
	I'd make a fucking good mother!  I love
	children!  I'm creative and smart and I'd
	make a fucking good mother!

The scene starts to fade.  Clementine's rant continues but
becomes attenuated and vague.

		JOEL
	Oh, thank God.  It's going.

		CLEMENTINE
	It's you!  It's you who can't commit to
	anything!  You have no idea how lucky you
	are I'm interested in you!  I don't even
	know why I am!  I should just end it
	right here, Joel.  Leave you in the zoo.
	Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang
	out with!

She's crying now, but it's almost animatronic, no real
emotion in it.  The scene is a husk.

		JOEL
	It's going, Clementine.  All the crap and
	hurt and disappointment.  It's all being
	wiped away.

She looks up at him.

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm glad.

Their eyes lock.  She is fading before his eyes.

		JOEL
	Me, too.

INT. BAR - NIGHT

It's noisy and crowded.  Joel and Clementine sit at a small
table.  She is drunk and staring off, blankly.

		JOEL
	So, um --

		CLEMENTINE
		(swiveling head toward him)
	Would you get me another, Joely?

Joel sighs, stands, and heads to the crowded bar.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Thanky!  Thanky!

Joel is at the bar, trying to get the bartender's attention.

Joel is paying the bartender.  He turns with the drink to
head back to the table.  He sees Clementine flirting with a
man in Joel's seat.

Joel is at the table.  Clementine looks from her
conversation.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Joel, this is Mark.  He likes my boobs.
	He came over special to tell me that.
	Isn't that nice.  He doesn't think I'm
	fat.

The scene starts to fade.  Mark rises.

		MARK
	I didn't know she was with someone, man.

		CLEMENTINE
	S'okay, Mark.  Joel doesn't like my
	boobs.
		(stage whisper)
	I don't think he likes girls.

The bar gets quiet and vague.

		JOEL
	You're drunk.

		CLEMENTINE
	You're a whiz kid.  So perceptive, so --

Clementine keeps talking but there are no more intelligible
words, just a whisper -- like a breeze.

A doorbell buzzes.  Joel looks up.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Patrick opens the door.  Mary stands there in a winter coat,
carrying a backpack.

		MARY
		(coolly)
	Oh, hey, Patrick.

		PATRICK
	Hi, Mary.  How's it going?

She walks past him.

		STAN
	Hey, you.

Stan and Mary kiss.  She looks down at Joel as she takes off
her coat.

		MARY
	It's freezing out.

		STAN
	You found us okay?

		MARY
	Yeah.
		(re: Joel)
	Poor guy.
		(looking around)
	Have anything to drink?

		STAN
	We haven't checked.

		MARY
	Well, allow me to do the honors.  It's
	fucking freezing and I need something.

She heads into the kitchen.  Stan turns back to monitor the
slivers of light.

		PATRICK
	Mary hates me.  I've never been popular
	with the ladies.

		STAN
	Maybe if you stopped stealing their
	panties.

		PATRICK
		(guilty beat)
	Okay, There's more, Stan --

Stan looks over at Patrick.  Mary returns with a bottle of
scotch and two glasses.

		MARY
	Hey, hey.

She pours the whiskey.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did
	you?

		PATRICK
	Nah, I don't know.

Mary hands a glass to Stan.  She holds hers up in a toast.

		MARY
	Blessed are the forgetful, for they get
	the better even of their blunders.

Mary and Stan click glasses.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	Nietzsche.  Beyond Good and Evil.  Found
	it my Bartletts.

		STAN
	That's a good one.

		MARY
	Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard!  It
	seems really appropriate.

		STAN
		(a little sulky)
	It's a good one all right.

		PATRICK
	What's your bartlett's?

		STAN
	It's a quote book.

		MARY
	I love quotes.  So did Winston Churchill.
	He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's
	about Bartlett's.  Isn't that trippy?

		PATRICK
		(trying to engage)
	Yeah.  Cool.

		MARY
	"The quotations when engraved upon the
	memory give you good thoughts."

		PATRICK
	Very cool.  Trippy.

		MARY
	I like to read what smart people say.  So
	many beautiful, important things.

		STAN
	Yup.

		MARY
	Don't you think Howard's like that?
	Smart?  Important?

		STAN
		(beat)
	Yup.

		PATRICK
	Definitely!

		MARY
	I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.

Stan focuses on the monitor.  Mary pours herself another
drink.

		PATRICK
	Definitely.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

It's dark.  Joel and Clementine are in bed.  The memory is
already in the midst of being erased.  Clementine is talking
in a monotonous, robotic manner.

		CLEMENTINE
	You don't tell me things, Joel.  I'm an
	open book.  I tell you everything.  Every
	damn embarrassing thing.  You don't trust
	me.

		JOEL
	No, it isn't that.

		CLEMENTINE
	I want to know you.

		JOEL
	I just don't have anything very
	interesting about my life.

		CLEMENTINE
	Joel, you're a liar.

The scene is faded completely now and Joel just lies there
for a moment, registering Clementine's statement.

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Joel and Clementine eat dinner in silence.  Joel looks around
at other couples in the restaurant.  Some seem happy and
engaged.  Others seem bored with each other.  He turns back
to his food.

		JOEL
	How's the chicken?

		VOICE-OVER
	Is that like us?  Are we just bored with
	each other?

		CLEMENTINE
	Good.

He watches her as she downs her wine and pours herself
another glass.  She holds the wine bottle up to Joel.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	More?

		JOEL
	No.  Thanks.

There's a silence.

		CLEMENTINE
	How's the fish?

The scene is fading.

		JOEL
	It's good.

They continue to eat in silence as the scene dissolves.

		PATRICK'S VOICE
	Hi, Clementine! -- Why, what's wrong? --
	Oh, I'm sorry. -- Well, I'm not sure, I
	kind of have to study for my test --

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Patrick is on the phone next to Joel's bed.  Stan watches the
lights on the computer screen.

		PATRICK
	Hold on.  Let me ask my friend.
		(covering mouthpiece)
	Stan, can I leave for a little while?  My
	girlfriend is very --

		STAN
	Patrick, we're in the middle of --

		PATRICK
	She's right in the neighborhood.  She's
	upset.

Mary is in the kitchen.  She pokes her head out.  She's got
some pie on a plate.

		MARY
	Let him go, Stan.  I can help.

		STAN
		(sighing, to Patrick)
	Go.

		PATRICK
		(quietly)
	Mary hates me.
		(into phone)
	I'll be right over, Tangerine.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Candles are lit.  Joel and Clementine are under a blanket on
the living room rug listening to music.

		CLEMENTINE
	Joely...

		JOEL
	Yeah, Tangerine?

		CLEMENTINE
	Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?

		JOEL
	No.

		CLEMENTINE
	It's my favorite book.  Since I was a
	kid.  It's about these toys.  There's
	this part where the skin Horse tells the
	rabbit what it means to be real.
		(crying)
	I can't believe I'm crying already.  He
	says, "It takes a long time.  That's why
	it doesn't often happen to people who
	break easily or have sharp edges, or who
	have to be carefully kept.  Generally by
	the time you are Real, most of your hair
	has been loved off, and your eyes drop
	out and you get loose in the joints and
	very shabby.  But these things don't
	matter at all, because once you are Real
	you can't be ugly, except to people who
	don't understand."

She's weeping.  Joel is stroking her hair.  They kiss and
begin to make love under the blanket.  It's sweet and gentle
and then it starts to fade.

		JOEL
		(screaming)
	No!  Jesus, No!

He looks down and Clementine's tear-streaked face is fading.
She continues as if she's still being made love to, even
though Joel is completely beside himself.  He jumps up naked
and yells at the ceiling.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Please!  Please!  I've changed my mind!
		(looks down at fading
		 Clementine, then at ceiling)
	I don't want this.  Wake me up!  Stop the
	procedure!  Plea --

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel is unconscious on the bed, completely still.  Mary and
Stan watch the monitor and smoke a joint.  After a silence:

		MARY
	It's amazing, isn't it?  Such a gift
	Howard gave the world.

		STAN
		(a sigh)
	Yeah.

		MARY
	To let people begin again.  It's
	beautiful.  You look at a baby and it's
	so fresh, so clean, so free.  And
	adults... they're like this messy tangle
	of anger and phobias and sadness...
	hopelessness.  And Howard just makes it
	go away.

		STAN
	You love him, don't you?

Mary seems surprised, taken aback, caught.  She is silent for
a long moment.

		MARY
	No.
		(beat)
	Besides, Howard's married, Stan.  He's a
	very serious and ethical man.  I'm not
	going to tempt him to betray all he
	believes in.

Stan takes another drag on the joint, passes it to Mary.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Patrick, bundled up and carrying a full backpack, trudges
through the snow.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Clementine watches out the window as Patrick nears.  She's
crying.  He makes his way up her front stairs.  She swings
open the door and hugs him.

		PATRICK
	Oh, baby, what's going on?

		CLEMENTINE
	I don't know.  I'm lost.  I'm scared.  I
	feel like I'm disappearing.  I'm getting
	old and nothing makes any sense to me.

		PATRICK
	Oh, Tangerine.

		CLEMENTINE
	Nothing makes any sense.  Nothing makes
	any sense.

She pushes herself out of the embrace and looks at Patrick.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Come up to Boston with me?

		PATRICK
	Sure.  We'll go next weekend and --

		CLEMENTINE
	Now.  Now!  I have to go now.  I have to
	see the frozen Charles!  Now!  Tonight!

		PATRICK
	Um, okay.  I'll call my study partner.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yay!  It'll be great!  I'll get my shit.

She runs into the bedroom.  Patrick is at the phone and
realizes he doesn't know Joel's number.  After a moment's
thought, he *69's.  The phone rings.

		JOEL'S VOICE
	Hi, it's Joel.  Please leave a message
	after the beep.

Beep.

		PATRICK
		(whisper)
	Stan, it's Patrick.  Pick up.

		STAN'S VOICE
	Hey, where are you?

		PATRICK
	I got into a situation with the old lady.
	Can you handle things tonight alone?  I'm
	really sorry, man.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Stan is on the phone.  He's really stoned and watches Mary,
stoned herself, dancing in a sexy trance to something soft
and low on the stereo.

		STAN
	I can handle it.  He's pretty much on
	auto-pilot anyway.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

		PATRICK
	Thanks, Stan.  I owe you.

Patrick hangs up, rifles quickly through his backpack.  He
pulls out a silver bracelet, puts it in his pocket, then
pulls out a journal, flips through it, keeping an eye on the
bedroom door.  The handwriting is a woman's.  He finds what
he's looking for.  He reads:

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	I took Joel to walk on Charles River with
	me last night.  It was so beautiful and
	charming.  Joel was nervous about
	stepping onto the ice, but he wanted to
	please me so much -- he's so sweet --
	that he came out after me.    We lay down
	right in the center and watched the
	stars.  He took my hand and said "I
	could...

EXT. CHARLES RIVER - NIGHT

Joel and Clementine lie together holding hands on the frozen
river.  They look up at the stars.

		JOEL
	...die right now, Clem.  I'm just...
	happy.  I've never felt that before.  I'm
	just exactly where I want to be.

Clementine looks over at him.  Her eyes are filled with love
and tears.  Then they get vague.  The scene is being erased.
Joel is panicked.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Clem, no!  This can't keep happening.
	Please!  Oh, fuck!  Please!

Crazily, Joel runs off, passing through a series of decayed
scenes: He and Clementine arguing in a car, having sex on the
beach, laughing and holding hands at a movie, eating grilled
cheese and tomato soup together in bed, Joel watching her
sleep, them drinking at a bar.  He arrives at a decayed
version of his first meeting with Mierzwiak.

		MIERZWIAK
	We can help you through this.  Why don't
	you start now by telling me everything
	you can remember about --

		JOEL
	You have to stop this!

		MIERZWIAK
	What?  What do you mean?

		JOEL
	I'm trapped in my head and everything I
	love is being erased!  Stop it now!

		MIERZWIAK
	Yes, but... I'm just something you're
	imagining.  What can I do?  I'm in your
	head, too.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Patrick reads the journal.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	... and we made love right on the ice.
	It was absolutely freezing on my ass!  It
	was wonderful.

Clementine enters, dressed for the cold.  Patrick puts the
notebook away.

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm so excited.  Yay!

		PATRICK
	I'm excited, too.  Oh, and I wanted to
	give you this.  It's a little... thing.

Patrick pulls the bracelet from his pocket, hands it to her.

		PATRICK (CONT'D)
	I didn't have a chance to wrap it.

		CLEMENTINE
	It's gorgeous.
		(slipping it on)
	Just my taste.  I've never  gone out with
	a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I
	liked.
		(kisses him)
	Thanks.  So let's get going.  Long drive.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Stan and Mary have sex on the floor next to Joel's bed.

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Joel and Clementine are hiking, Clementine in front.

		CLEMENTINE
	Such a beautiful view.

		JOEL
		(looking at her)
	Yes indeed.
		(snapping out of memory)
	Fuck!  They're erasing you, Clem!

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh?

		JOEL
	I hired them to.  We're in my brain.  But
	I want it to stop, before I wake up and
	don't know you anymore.

		CLEMENTINE
	Wow.  Um, well... can't you just force
	yourself awake?

		JOEL
	I don't know.

He concentrates.  Nothing happens.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Aaargh!  It's horrible!  I'm trapped!

He starts to have a fit, banging against trees, stomping his
feet, screaming.  But even while he's doing this the memory
and Clementine are fading around him.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - DAY

It's raining out.  Joel is reading, slouched in a chair.  He
looks over at Clementine, stretched out on her belly in her
underwear.  She's reading, too.

		VOICE-OVER
	She's so sexy.

		JOEL
	I loved you on this day.  I love this
	memory.  The rain.  Us just hanging.

Clementine looks over at him, smiles.  Her brow furrows in
thought.

		CLEMENTINE
	What if you hide me?

		JOEL
	What do you mean?

		CLEMENTINE
		(formulating)
	Well... if they're looking for me in
	memories I'm in, what if you take me to a
	memory I'm not in?
		(proud)
	And we can hide there till morning.

Joel ponders this.  The scene and Clementine are beginning to
dissolve.  Joel grabs Clementine's hand.  She giggles with
glee.  He pulls her out of the scene as it degrades.

		JOEL
	Where?  Where?  Where?

He drags her through the landscape of already decayed
memories and turns off into:

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

The kitchen is dated and vague.  Joel and Clementine are in
an oversized playpen; they're adults but small.  Joel wears
footsie pajamas with some vague little animals on them.  He
holds a a red furry huckleberry hound doll.  Clementine is
still in her panties and bra.  An oversized woman in high
heels, seen from a low angle, hurries back and forth
preparing dinner.

		CLEMENTINE
	Jesus.  What's this?

Joel looks around at the kitchen, at his doll, at the woman.

		JOEL
	I must be about two.
		(oddly)
	I want my mommy.  She's busy.  She's not
	looking at me.
		(back to himself, re: doll)
	Look, my Huckleberry Hound doll!  I told
	you about this!
		(beat)
	I want my mommy!

He starts to cry.  Clementine tries to comfort him.  She hugs
him.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
		(crying still)
	I want my mommy.
		(adult, to Clementine)
	I don't want to lose you, Clem.

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm right here.

		JOEL
	I'm scared.  I want my mommy.  I don't
	want to lose you.  I don't want to
	lose...

		CLEMENTINE
	Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading.
	The memory.  I think we're hidden.

Joel sucks in some snot.  His mother scurries back and forth
clanging pots.  The room is not decaying.  Joel smiles.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Stan and Mary lie on the floor, their stoned minds wandering
after sex.  Stan suddenly perks up.  He looks at the monitor.

		STAN
	It's stopped.

		MARY
	What?

		STAN
	Listen, it's not erasing.

He makes his way, naked, to the computer screen.

		STAN (CONT'D)
	It's not erasing.  He's off the screen.

		MARY
	Where?

		STAN
	I don't know.  He's not on the map.

Stan tries to break through his marijuana haze.  He fiddles
nervously with the equipment.

		STAN (CONT'D)
	I don't know what to do!  I don't know
	what to do!  Crap.  Crap...

		MARY
	Well, what should we do?

		STAN
	I don't know!  I just said that!

		MARY
	Sor-ry
		(beat)
	We have to do something.  He can't wake
	up half done.

		STAN
	Shit!

He jerks the joystick spastically.  Mary, also naked, gets up
and looks over his shoulder at the screen.

		MARY
		(definitely)
	We should call Howard.

Stan turns and looks at her.  He's stoned and trying to
understand her motivation.

		STAN
	No way.  I can handle this.

		MARY
	This guy's only half cooked.  There's no
	time to fuck around, Stan.

Stan tries to think.  He paces.  Mary watches him.  Finally:

		STAN
		(without making eye contact)
	Okay.

He dials the phone, waits.

		STAN (CONT'D)
	Hello, Howard?

INT. MIERZWIAK'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

The room is dark.  A groggy Mierzwiak is in bed on the phone.
His wife lies beside him, eyes open, listening.

		MIERZWIAK
	Stan?  What's going on?

		STAN'S VOICE
	The guy we're doing?  He's disappeared
	from the map.  I can't find him anywhere.

		MIERZWIAK
	Okay, what happened right before he
	disappeared?

		STAN'S VOICE
	I was away from the monitor for a second.
	I had it on automatic.  I had to go pee.

		MIERZWIAK
	Well, where was Patrick?

		STAN'S VOICE
	He went home sick.

		MIERZWIAK
	Jesus.  All right, what's the address.

		STAN'S VOICE
	1062 Sherman Drive.  Apartment 1E,
	Rockville Center.

Mierzwiak writes it down on a bedside not pad.  He hangs up.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Stan hangs up the phone, looks at Mary.

		MARY
	He's coming?

		STAN
	You better go.

		MARY
	Hell no.

She starts getting dressed.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	Shit, I'm so stoned.  I don't want him to
	see me stoned.  Stop being stoned, Mary!

She hurries into the bathroom with her bag.

		MARY (CONT'D) (O.S.) (CONT'D)
	God, I look like shit!  God!

Mary slams the bathroom door.  Stan puts his head in his
hands.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Joel and Clementine are in the playpen.  Joel's oversized
mother reaches down as she hurries by and pats Joel on the
head.

		MOTHER
	How's my baby boy?

She's gone.

		JOEL
	I really want her to pick me up.  It's
	weird how strong that desire is.

Clementine holds his hand.  He looks over at her.

		CLEMENTINE
	You know, we're okay.  They're not
	finding us.  You'll remember me in the
	morning.  And you'll come to me and tell
	me about us and we'll start over.

		JOEL
	I loved you so much this day.  On my bed
	in your panties.  I remember I thought,
	how impossibly lucky am I to have you on
	my bed in your panties.

She kisses him.

		CLEMENTINE
	You remember what happened next?

		JOEL
	I came over to the bed and you smelled so
	good, like you just woke up, slightly
	sweaty.  And I climbed on the bed with
	you and you said something like --

		CLEMENTINE
	-- another rainy day.  Whatever shall we
	do?

He laughs.  She unbuttons his pajamas.  They begin to make
love.  Joel's mother hurries around the kitchen.  Joel stops,
looks at Clementine.

		JOEL
	There's this guy!

		CLEMENTINE
	What?

		JOEL
	There's this guy.  I heard him talking in
	my apartment.  He's one of the eraser
	guys.  And he fell for you when they were
	erasing you, so he introduced himself the
	next day as if he were a stranger and now
	you're dating him.

		CLEMENTINE
	Really?  Is he cute?

		JOEL
	He stole a pair of your panties while you
	were being erased!

		CLEMENTINE
	Gross! You must remember to tell me this
	in the morning.  I'm, like, so freaked
	out now.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S CAR - NIGHT

It's a rust bucket.  Clementine drives through the snow.
She's crying and holding Patrick's hand.

		CLEMENTINE
	What's wrong with me?

		PATRICK
	Nothing is wrong with you.  You're the
	most wonderful person I've ever met.

She glances gratefully over at him then starts to cry even
harder.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Stan works on trying to get the signal back.  His hair is
combed and he's dressed neatly, looking professional but
still stoned.  Mary is pacing nervously to and from the
window, looking out into the night.  She's dressed also, and
she's wearing more make-up now.  Her hair is pulled up into
some sort of style.  Suddenly she freezes at the window.

		MARY
	There he is.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Do
	I look okay?

She doesn't say anything.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	I'm still stoned.  Are you?  Crap.

She looks in the mirror.

		MARY (CONT'D)
		(to Joel)
	Your Visine didn't do shit, fella.

The doorbell buzzes.  Mary lunges for the door, then calms
herself before opening it.  Mierzwiak, holding an equipment
bag, looks surprised.

		MIERZWIAK
	Mary.  What are you doing here?

		STAN
	She came to help, Howard.

		MARY
	I wanted to learn as much about the
	procedure as possible, Howard.  I think
	it's important for my job...to help
	comfort the clientele.  You know.

Mierzwiak looks from Mary to Stan, nods, and enters.  Mary
closes the door.  Mierzwiak crosses to the equipment.

		MIERZWIAK
	Let's get to the bottom of this.  Shall
	we?

He sits down in front of the computer and does some fiddling.

		MIERZWIAK (CONT'D)
	Odd.

He fiddles some more.  Mary looks on, fascinated.

		STAN
	I tried that already.

		MIERZWIAK
	Did you try going through C-Gate?

		STAN
	Yeah.  Of course.

Mierzwiak ponders.  He unzips his equipment bag, pulls out
another laptop computer and plugs it in to the system.

		MIERZWIAK
	I'm going to do a Spectrum search
	throughout his memory, see if anything
	comes up.

Mierzwiak presses some more buttons.  The program starts up.
A much more complex and detailed human brain appears on this
screen.  It rotates.  Eventually Mierzwiak sees a small
distant light in the brain.  He zeroes in on it.

		MIERZWIAK (CONT'D)
	Okay, here it is.  I don't know why it's
	off the map like that, but --

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Joel is being bathed in the oversized sink by his oversized
mother.  Clementine sits in the water with him, laughing.
The mother doesn't seem to see her.

		MOTHER
	Little baby getting awwwl cleean.  Awl
	clean.

		JOEL
		(to Clementine)
	I love getting bathed in the sink.  It's
	such a feeling of security.

		CLEMENTINE
		(giggling)
	I've never seen you happier.

The elements of the scene flash explosively away:  Joel's
mother, his Huckleberry Hound doll, the details of the
kitchen, Clementine.   Joel is thrown into:

INT. CAR - NIGHT

He sits with Clementine in the parked car, outside a drive-in
movie theater.  The movie on the giant screen is partially
obscured by a fence.  Joel and Clementine drink wine.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Mierzwiak looks up from the computer screen.

		MIERZWIAK
	Okay, we're back in.

		MARY
	That was beautiful to watch, Howard.
	Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.

		MIERZWIAK
	Well, thank you, Mary.

		STAN
		(sighing)
	You get some sleep, Howard.  I'll take it
	from here.

		MIERZWIAK
	Yeah, probably a good idea.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

Clementine and Joel laugh as they try to give voice to what
the characters on the screen are saying.

		CLEMENTINE
	But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.

		JOEL
	Don't call me Antoine.  My name is Wally.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.

She starts to fade.  The scene starts to fade.  Joel
remembers their previous plan.

		JOEL
	They found us before.  The plan didn't
	work.  I don't know what to do now.

		CLEMENTINE
		(mouthing to woman on screen)
	Hide me somewhere deeper?  Somewhere
	buried?

Joel grabs her.  They run off just as the scene decays into a
husk behind them.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Stan is back at the controls.  Mierzwiak's at the door with
Mary.

		STAN
	Howard, they've disappeared again.

		MIERZWIAK
	Oh dear.

		MARY
	I'm so sorry, Howard, you must be tired.

He nods, distractedly.  She smiles to herself as he heads
back to the equipment.

EXT. SCHOOLYARD - AFTERNOON

Joel, now the size of a junior high school kid and dressed
accordingly, is peering around the corner of the school
building toward the bike rack.  Clementine is with him,
dressed as she was in the parked car.

		CLEMENTINE
	Look at you, cutey!  What are we doing?

		JOEL
	This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the
	shit out of me.

		VOICE-OVER
	I'm terrified.  I thought if I hung
	around the art room long enough, he'd go
	home and I could get my bike.

They head toward the bike rack.  Joel's is the only bike
remaining.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Poor Joel.

They're at the bike rack and a bunch of kids, including
giant, fat Joe Early come around the corner.

		JOE EARLY
	Hi, Jill.

		JOEL
	He calls me Jill.  Everyone calls me Jill
	after this.

The other kids laughs.

		JOEL
	Just shut up, Joe.  I'm going home.

		JOE EARLY
	I don't think so.  We're fighting.

		JOEL
	I don't want to fight you.

The kids start chanting, "fight, fight, fight..."  Joe Early
throws a wild punch that hits Joel in the side.  joel falls
and stays down, covering himself.

		JOE EARLY
	C'mon, Jill.  Get up, faggot.  C'mon.

Joel doesn't say anything.  He peeks humiliated at
Clementine.  She's watching him.  She's got a tear in her
eye.  She kneels down beside him, puts her arm around him.

		JOEL
	I'm too scared to even throw a punch.
	When I tell people this story I leave
	that part out.

The scene flashes violently to white and is gone.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Mierzwiak is at the machine.

		MIERZWIAK
	We got him back.  Stan, I think I'm just
	going to have to get through this
	manually.  We're running late.

EXT. BEACH - DAY

It's cold.  Joel and Clementine walk, all bundled up.  She
points at a house up the beach.

		CLEMENTINE
	Our house!  Our house!

She runs ahead, laughing.  The scene is decaying.  Joel
chases after her.

		JOEL
	Clem, c'mon, we've got to hide you.
	Remember?

He grabs her arm and yanks and they are in:

INT. BOY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

It's dark.  Joel, junior high school size, is in bed
masturbating.  Clementine is in there, too, in her winter
coat, still laughing from before.  She realizes what's going
on.

		CLEMENTINE
		(mock offended)
	Joel!

		JOEL
		(continuing to masturbate)
	I don't like it either, but I'm just
	trying to find horrible secret place to --

Joel's mother pops her head in the door.

		MOTHER
	Joel, I was just --
		(sees what's going on)
	Oh.  Um... I'll ask you in the morning,
	honey.  Have a good night.

The mother backs out, closes the door.  Joel cringes.
Clementine laughs, still in the mode of the memory she was
swiped from.  Flash!  It's all gone.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Joel and Clementine are laughing as she blows out the candle
on a slice of cheesecake in front of her.  Joel hands her a
small wrapped box.

		JOEL
	Happy Birthday.

		CLEMENTINE
		(unwrapping the gift)
	Thanks, Joely.  A present!  Oh boy!

She pulls out the bracelet.  It's the same bracelet Patrick
gave her.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Oh, Joel.  It's beautiful!
		(slip it on)
	I mean, you're the first guy who ever
	bought me a piece of jewelry I could
	honestly say that about.

He notices she's starting to fade.

		JOEL
	I scoured the city for it.

		CLEMENTINE
	I love it!

She leans across the table to kiss him.  He grabs her and
runs through the decaying scene and into the vague night.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

Joel is one of a group of five year olds.  He holds a hammer
and is poised to hit a dead bird in a red wagon.  The other
boys are goading him.

		BOYS
	C'mon, Joel, you have to.  Do it already.

Joel doesn't want to.  Clementine watches.

		JOEL
	I can't.  I have to go home.  I'll do it
	later.

		VOICE-OVER
	I didn't want to do this.  But I had to
	or they would've called me a girl.

Joel miserably smashes the bird repeatedly with the hammer.
Red jelly guts cover the hammer and the wagon bottom.  The
kids hoot.

		VOICE-OVER
	I can't believe I did that.  I'm so
	ashamed.

A live bird watches from a tree.  Clementine, still dressed
for her birthday dinner (wearing her new bracelet), pulls
Joel away from the other boys.  The two of them walk down
Joel's suburban street.

		CLEMENTINE
	It's okay.  You were a little kid.
		(beat)
	This is a great birthday present.
	Getting to see you as a boy.

She kisses him and they walk holding hands.

		JOEL
		(pointing)
	That's where I live.  Lived.

Joel looks down at her hand.  It's fading.  The bracelet is
gone.  Clementine is gone.  His childhood house is gone.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Mierzwiak works the equipment.  He has located a small area
of light in the brain imaging and eradicates them.

		MIERZWIAK
	I'm getting the hang of it.  I still
	understand it.  But I'm finding him
	quickly enough.  I'm hopeful there won't
	be too much peripheral eradication.

Mary sits on the bed.

		MARY
		(a little giggly)
	I like watching you work.

Stan sighs, grabs his coat.

		STAN
	I'll go out for a smoke.  If no one
	minds.

		MIERZWIAK
		(not looking up)
	That's fine, Stan.

Mary doesn't say anything.  Stan huffs and is out the door.
Mierzwiak continues to find and erase points of light.  Mary
gets up her courage to speak.

		MARY
	Do you like quotes, Howard?

		MIERZWIAK
	How do you mean?

		MARY
	Oh, um, like famous quotes.  I find
	reading them inspirational to me.  And in
	my reading I've come across some I
	thought you might like, too.

		MIERZWIAK
	Oh.  Well, I'd love to hear some.

Mary is thrilled, beside herself.  She tries to calm down.

		MARY
	Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed
	are the forgetful, for they get the
	better even of their blunders."

		MIERZWIAK
	Is that Nietzsche?

		MARY
	Yeah, yeah it is, Howard.  And here I was
	thinking I could tell you something you
	didn't know.

		MIERZWIAK
	It's a good quote, Mary.  I'm glad we
	both know it.

He smiles at her.  She's flustered, flattered.

		MARY
		(sputtering)
	There's another one I like, I read.  It's
	by Pope Alexander.

		MIERZWIAK
	Alexander Pope?

		MARY
	Yes, shit.  Oops, sorry!
		(puts hand over mouth)
	Sorry.  It's just I told myself I wasn't
	going to say Pope Alexander and sound
	like a dope and then I go ahead and do
	it.  Like I psyched myself out.

		MIERZWIAK
	It's no big deal.

		MARY
	You are such a sweetheart.

There's an embarrassed moment as that line hangs in the air.
Then Mary plunges ahead to bury it.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	Anyway, the quote goes "How happy is the
	blameless Vestal's lot!  The world
	forgetting, by the world forgot: Eternal
	sunshine of the spotless mind!  Each
	prayer accepted, and each wish resign'd".

She smiles, proud and embarrassed.

		MIERZWIAK
	That's lovely.

		MARY
	Really?  I thought it was appropriate
	maybe.  That's all.
		(beat, then quickly)
	I really admire the work that you do.  I
	know it's not proper to be so familiar
	but I guess since we're outside the
	workplace I feel a certain liberty to --

		MIERZWIAK
	It's fine, Mary.  I'm happy to hear it.

		MARY
	Okay.  Good.  Great.  Thanks.
		(blurting)
	I like you, Howard... an awful lot.  Is
	that terrible?

Mierzwiak seems momentarily taken aback, then returns to his
unflappable self.

		MIERZWIAK
	You're a wonderful girl, Mary.

She leans over and kisses him, then pulls away quickly.

		MARY
	I've loved you for a very long time.  I'm
	sorry!  I shouldn't have said that.

		MIERZWIAK
	I've got a wife, Mary.  Kids.  You know
	that.

		MARY
		(suddenly weepy)
	I wish I was your wife.  I wish I had
	your kids.

Mierzwiak comforts her with a hug.  It turns into kiss.  He
pulls away.

		MIERZWIAK
	We can't do this.

		MARY
	No you're right.  Once again.  You're a
	decent man, Howard.

He smiles sadly at her.  She smiles courageously at him.

		MIERZWIAK
	I want you to know it's not because I'm
	not interested.  If that means anything.

They look at each other a long while, then Howard goes back
to locating and eradicating blips of lights.

EXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Stan sits in the van and smokes a cigarette.  He has an
unobstructed view into Joel's bedroom window.  He watches
Mierzwiak and Mary.  They're talking as Howard works.  It
appears to be a very serious discussion.  A car pulls up
outside.  Stan turns to see.  A middle-aged woman gets out,
checks the address on Joel's building, approaches the only
lit window, watches Mierzwiak and Mary inside.  Mierzwiak's
resolve has apparently weakened and he and Mary kiss again.
This time it leads to groping, partial undressing, and
falling onto the bed alongside the unconscious Joel.  The
woman in the window is transfixed.  As Mierzwiak fumbles to
unzip his pants, he catches sight of the woman in the window.
He practically shrieks and jumps up.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

Joel and Clementine walking, hand-in-hand, look up
simultaneously.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Mary looks confusedly at Howard.

		MARY
	What?

She follows his eyes and sees the woman in the window, who
turns and walks off in a huff.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	Oh my God!

Mierzwiak is already in his coat.  He's out the door.

EXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

The woman is at her car.  Stan watches from the van.
Mierzwiak is hurrying to the woman.

		MIERZWIAK
	Hollis!  Hollis!

		HOLLIS (THE MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN)
	I knew it, Howard.  I don't even know why
	I bothered to copy the damn address.

		MIERZWIAK
	It didn't start out to be this.  I came
	here to work.  It's a one-time mistake.

Mary is right behind Mierzwiak now.  Hollis is in her car.

		MARY
		(heroically)
	Mrs. Mierzwiak, it's true.  And it's not
	Mr. Mierzwiak's fault.  I'm a stupid
	little girl with a stupid little crush.
	I basically forced him into it.  I swear.

Hollis turns, looks at Mary and then at Mierzwiak.

		HOLLIS
	Don't be a monster, Howard.  Tell the
	girl.

Stan is out of the van now, listening.  Mary shivers in the
cold, hugs herself.  There's a long silence.  Then:

		MARY
	Tell me what?

Hollis and Mierzwiak have locked eyes.  Mary looks back and
forth between them.  Hollis starts her car.

		HOLLIS
	Poor kid.  You can have him.  You did.

She drives off.  Mary watches Howard with increased
foreboding.

		MARY
	What, Howard?

		MIERZWIAK
	We... have a history.  I'm sorry.  You
	wanted the procedure.  You wanted it
	done... to get past.  I have to finish in
	there.  It's almost morning.  We'll talk
	later.

He shuffles inside.  Mary stands there, unable to digest
this, struggling in vain to remember.  Stan watches.

		STAN
	Let me take you home.

Mary shakes her head "no."  She walks off, dazed.

EXT. CHARLES RIVER - NIGHT

Clementine and Patrick lie on their backs on the frozen river
and look up at the night sky.

		PATRICK
	I could die right now, Clem.  I'm just
	happy.  I've never felt that before.  I'm
	just exactly where I want to be.

Clementine looks over at him.  Their eyes meet.  She sobs.

		CLEMENTINE
	I want to go home.

She hurries toward the shore, slips on the ice, gets up, and
continues, now running.

INT. COMMUTER TRAIN - NIGHT

Mary, in shock, sits in the empty fluorescent car.  She tries
to look out the window but can only see her own reflection.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

It's deathly silent as Mierzwiak and Stan work on completing
the job.  Mierzwiak locates a light hidden very deep in the
map of Joel's brain.  He targets it.

EXT. ROWBOAT - DAY

Joel, the size of a ten year old, sits fishing with his
oversized father.  Clementine is naked and in the boat, too.
She's reading The Play by Stephen Dixon.

		CLEMENTINE
	I love this book, Joel.  Thank you so
	much for telling me about it.

Joel is his father.  The father is drunk and sullen.  He
faces away from Joel, looks out at the lake.

		FATHER
	Don't be like me, son.  Don't waste your
	life.  You'll come to a point someday
	where it'll be too late.  You'll be sewn
	into your fate...

		JOEL
	It was horrifying, seeing my father like
	that.
	There was no hope for me if his life was
	such a failure.  And he saw failure in
	me, too, written in my future.

Clementine watches the frightened, confused Joel.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Joel, you're not sewn in.  He's wrong.

		FATHER
	...and there'll be nowhere to go except
	where you're headed, like a train on a
	track.  Inevitable, unalterable.

The scene poops out of existence with a flash of light.

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Joel finds himself eating Chinese food and sitting across
from Clementine.  He is ragged and jarred.

		JOEL
	I'm done, Clem.  I'm just going to ride
	it out.  Hiding is clearly not working.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah.

		JOEL
	I want to enjoy my little time left with
	you.

		CLEMENTINE
	This is our first "date" date.

		JOEL
	Do you remember what we talked about?

		CLEMENTINE
	Naomi, I guess.

		JOEL
	Yeah.

		CLEMENTINE
	What was I wearing?

		JOEL
	God, I should know.  Your hair was red.
	I remember it matched the wallpaper.

		CLEMENTINE
	Egad, were you horrified?

		JOEL
	No!  I think you were wearing that black
	dress, y'know, with the buttons.

She is wearing the black dress.

		CLEMENTINE
	No, you were with me when I bought that.
	At that place on East 6th.  It was later.

INT. DRESS SHOP - SHOP

The scene has already been erased.  It's just a decayed husk.
A vague Joel watches a vague Clementine model a black dress.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Clementine wears a generic black dress now.

		JOEL
	Right.  Something black though.

		CLEMENTINE
	I'll buy that.  Black's always good.

		JOEL
	We did talk about Naomi.

		CLEMENTINE
	I said: Are you sure?  You seem unsure.

		JOEL
	I'm sure, I said.

		CLEMENTINE
	But you weren't.  I could tell.

		JOEL
	I was so nervous.  I remember I couldn't
	think of anything to say.  There were
	long silences.

There is a long silence.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	I thought I was foolish.  I thought I'd
	mistaken infatuation for love.  You said:

		CLEMENTINE
	So what.  Infatuation is good, too.

		JOEL
	And I didn't have an argument.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

Joel and Clementine pull up to Clementine's house.

		JOEL
	I dropped you off after.  You said --

		CLEMENTINE
		(Mae West)
	Come up and see me... now.

		JOEL
	It's very late.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yes, exactly.  Exactly my point.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel and Clementine are in the midst of awkward shy sex.

		JOEL
	This was our first time.

The scene starts to fade.  Joel watches Clementine disappear.

INT. LACUNA RECEPTION AREA - NIGHT

Mary enters the dark room, frazzled.  She flips on the
fluorescent lights and searches the file folders, finds one
with her name on it.  Her jaw drops.  With a shaky hand, she
puts the tape into the player on her desk and presses "play."

		MIERZWIAK VOICE
	Okay, so just tell me what you remember.
	And we'll take it from there.

		MARY'S VOICE
		(shaky)
	Um, I liked you immediately.  At the job
	interview.  You seemed so... important
	and mature.  And I loved that you were
	helping all these people.  You didn't
	come on to me at all.  I liked that.  I
	was tongue-tied around you at first.  I
	wanted you to think I was smart.  You
	were so nice.  I loved the way you
	smelled.  I couldn't wait to come to
	work.  I had these fantasies of us being
	married and having kids and just...
		(starts to cry)
	...and so... then... when...
	that one day, when I thought you looked
	at me back... like... Oh, Howie, I can't
	do this?  How can I do this?

		MIERZWIAK VOICE
	It's what's best, Mary.  You know that.

Mary slumps to the floor.  We move into her eyes.

		MARY'S VOICE
	Yeah, I know.  Oh, God.  Okay, well, I
	was so excited...

A SERIES OF MURKY IMAGES.  NO DETAIL.

A flirtatious look from Mierzwiak.

		MARY'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	...Remember you bought me that little
	wind-up frog?

A vague shot of a wind-up frog.

		MARY'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	And you said...

A vague shot of Mierzwiak mouthing to Mary's voice.

		MARY'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	"This is for your desk.  Just a little
	token"

Back to Mary sitting on the floor, listening to the tape.

		MARY'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	I knew then... I knew something was going
	to happen... something wonderful.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel sits in the quiet living room.  The scene is fading.

		JOEL
	Naomi.

		VOICE-OVER
	On the couch.  Dark.  Quiet.  I wondered
	if I had made a terrible mistake.  I
	almost reached for the phone about a
	thousand times.  I thought I could take
	it back, erase it, explain I had
	momentarily lost my mind. Then I told
	myself we weren't happy.  That was the
	truth.  That what we were was safe.
	It was unfair to you and to me to stay in
	a relationship for that reason.  I
	thought about Clementine and the spark
	when I was with her, but then I thought
	what you and I had was real and adult and
	therefore significant even if it wasn't
	much fun.   But I wanted fun.  I saw
	other people having fun and I wanted it.
	Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one
	is really having fun; I'm being suckered
	by advertising and movie bullshit... then
	I thought maybe not, maybe not.  And then
	I thought, as I always do at this point
	in my argument, about dying.

INT. ROOM - DAY

An elderly man sits.

		VOICE-OVER
	I projected myself to the end of my life
	in some vague rendition of my old man
	self.  I imagined looking back with a
	tremendous hole of regret in my heart.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel sits.

		VOICE-OVER
	I didn't pick up the phone to call you,
	Naomi.  I didn't pick up the phone.

The scene dissolves.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - DAY

Namoi is red-eyed from crying.  She is packing things in
boxes.  Joel paces, steals glances at her, doesn't know what
to say.  She holds up a book.  The scene starts to fade.

		NAOMI
	Yours?

		JOEL
	You take it.  I don't know.

She tosses it in a box.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Naomi, I really value our relationship.
	I hope it's possible for us to stay in
	touch.

		NAOMI
	Don't do this to me now, Joel.  Really.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - DAY

Joel watches out the window as Naomi stuffs a final box in
the trunk of a car.  There's another woman down there with
her.  They get into the car and drive off.

INT. BORDER'S BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

Joel talks to Clementine.  The scene is fogging over.

		JOEL
	I told her today I need to end it.

		CLEMENTINE
	Is that what you want?

		JOEL
	I did it.  I guess that means something.

Clementine shrugs.  The scene fades.

EXT. PARK - DAY

Joel walks with Naomi.

		NAOMI
	So what's going on, Joel?

		JOEL
	I don't know, I've just been thinking,
	maybe we're not happy with each other.

		NAOMI
	What?

		JOEL
	Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort
	of, unhappy with each other and --

		NAOMI
	Don't say "we" when you mean "you."

		JOEL
	I think maybe, we're both so used to
	operating at this level that -- How can
	one person be unhappy?  If one person is
	unhappy, both have to be... by
	definition.

		NAOMI
	Bullshit.  Who is it?  You met someone.

		JOEL
	No.  I just need some space, maybe.

		NAOMI
	The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you
	think you have with this chick, once the
	thrill wears off, you're just going to be
	Joel with the same fucking problems.

		JOEL
	It's not somebody else.

		VOICE-OVER
	I hate myself.

Naomi walks off.  Joel watches her.  The scene fades.

INT. BORDER'S BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

Joel enters, looks around.  There's no sign of Clementine.
Joel approaches a male employee.

		JOEL
	Is there a Clementine who works here?

		MALE EMPLOYEE #1
		(calling to another male
		 employee)
	Mark, is Clem on tonight?

		MALE EMPLOYEE #2
	On my dick, bro.
		(turns, sese Joel, embarrassed)
	Oh, hey.  Yeah, I think she's upstairs in
	Philosophy.

Joel climbs stairs, searches the aisle, spots Clementine.

		JOEL
	Hi.

She turns.

		CLEMENTINE
	I didn't think you'd show your face
	around me again.  I figured you were
	humiliated.  You did run away, after all.

		JOEL
	Sorry to track you down like this.  I'm
	not a stalker.  But I needed to see you.

		CLEMENTINE
		(seemingly uninterested)
	Yeah?

		JOEL
	I'd like to... take you out or something.

		CLEMENTINE
	Well, you're married.

		JOEL
	Not yet.  Not married.

		CLEMENTINE
	Look, man, I'm telling you right off the
	bat, I'm high maintenance.  So I'm not
	going to tiptoe around your marriage or
	whatever it is you got going there.  If
	you want to be with me, you're with me.

		JOEL
	Okay.

		CLEMENTINE
	So make your domestic decisions and maybe
	we'll talk again.

She goes back to stacking.  Joel stands there helplessly.

		JOEL
	I just think that you have some kind
	of... quality that seems really important
	to me.

The scene is disintegrating.  Clementine's speech is
delivered without passion.

		CLEMENTINE
	Joel, I'm not a concept.  I want you to
	just keep that in your head.  Too many
	guys think I'm a concept or I complete
	them or I'm going to make them alive, but
	I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking
	for my own peace of mind.  Don't assign
	me yours.

		JOEL
	I remember that speech really well.

		CLEMENTINE
		(smiling)
	I had you pegged, didn't I?

		JOEL
	You had the whole human race pegged.

		CLEMENTINE
	Probably.

		JOEL
	I still thought you were going to save
	me.  Even after that.

		CLEMENTINE
	I know.

		JOEL
	It would be different, if we could just
	give it another go around.

		CLEMENTINE
	Remember me.  Try your best.  Maybe we
	can.

The scene is gone.

INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S CAR - NIGHT

Joel sits forlornly in the back seat.  Rob drives and Carrie
sits in the front passenger seat.  The car stops in front of
Joel's apartment building.

		JOEL
	Thanks, guys.

		CARRIE
	I hope you feel better, sweetie.

		JOEL
	Yeah.

		CARRIE
	Say hi to Naomi.

The car door closes.

INT. BUILDING STAIRWAY - NIGHT

Joel climbs the stairs.

		VOICE-OVER
	I hope she's not up.  I need to think.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The lights are off.  Joel sits on a chair near the window,
writing in his journal.  The streetlight illuminates the
paper.  Naomi sleeps in the bed.

		VOICE-OVER
	I met someone tonight at a party on the
	beach.  Her name is Clementine.  There is
	something alive about her.

Naomi turns over in bed, sees Joel.

		NAOMI
		(full of sleep)
	Hi.

		JOEL
	Hi.

		NAOMI
	How was it?

		JOEL
	You didn't miss much.  Rob Carrie say
	hello.

		NAOMI
	Hi, Rob and Carrie.

		JOEL
	Go back to sleep.

The room is starting to decompose.

		NAOMI
	Yeah.  Come to bed.  I'm cold.

		JOEL
	In a minute.

Naomi turns over.  Joel goes back to his writing.

		VOICE-OVER
		(more and more emotionless)
	I don't know what to do about this.  I've
	been feeling so alienated and numb
	lately.  Forever.  The thought of not
	acknowledging my feelings again seems
	self-destructive.
	How can I continue on this path toward a
	living death, a life filled with
	obligation and guilt and responsibility
	but joyless, hopeless?  I need to speak
	with Clementine.

The scene has turned to a husk.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

Joel is at his closet, putting on a sweater.  Naomi is at the
dining room table, papers spread out before her, writing.
Joel turns and watches her for a moment.

		JOEL
	So you don't mind?

		NAOMI
	I've got to finish this chapter anyway.

The scene is fading.

		JOEL
	Okay.  I wish you could come.

		VOICE-OVER
	This is it.  The night we met.  My God,
	it's over.

		NAOMI (CONT'D)
	Me, too.

He approaches Naomi, kisses her on the top of the head.  She
continues to write.

		NAOMI (CONT'D)
	Say hi to Rob and Carrie.  Have some fun!

		JOEL
	I hope you get your work done.

		NAOMI
		(sighing)
	Yeah.

INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S CAR - NIGHT

Rob drives.  Carrie fiddles with the radio dial in the front
passenger seat.  Joel sits in the back.

		CARRIE
	I'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it.  You
	okay?  You seem quiet.

		JOEL
	Just a little overworked, maybe.

		VOICE-OVER
	The trip to the party where I met
	Clementine.  My first memory of her is
	now my last memory of her.

Joel looks out the window.  Carrie turns around and says
something to Joel.  She is backlit, her hair a halo of frizz.

		JOEL
	I remember you turned around.  Your face
	was dark and your hair was backlit -- I
	could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me
	if things were okay between Naomi and me.

		CARRIE
	I did.  You said, things were fine.

		JOEL
	I remember.

		CARRIE
	This is the night you met Clementine,
	Joel.  I remember watching you walk down
	the beach with her and I thought, oh
	shit.

		JOEL
	Yeah, you told me that later.

		CARRIE
	I told you that later.

Joel looks out he window.  He sees the husk of a memory on
the darkened roadside.  It's Joel and Carrie in:

INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S KITCHEN - DAY

Faded.  Carrie and Joel sit at the table with coffee.

		CARRIE
	Who was the girl you walked off with?

		JOEL
	No one.

EXT. BEACH PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Rob, Carrie, and Joel emerge from the car, parked amidst a
small cluster of cars in an otherwise empty parking lot.

EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

Joel watches his shoes in the sand as he trudges along.

		CARRIE
	Is this the right way?

EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

Joel, Rob, and Carrie step out of the brush and see a bonfire
down the beach.  People and music can be heard.

EXT. BEACH - LATER

Joel sits on a log, a paper plate of chicken and corn on his
lap.  People warm themselves at the fire.  Joel watches
couples talking, kissing, Rob sharing a joint with a guy.

		JOEL
	You were down by the surf.  I could just
	make you out in the dark.

Joel looks down to the water.  There's Clementine, in her
orange hooded sweatshirt, looking out to sea.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Your back to me.  In that orange
	sweatshirt I would come to know so well
	and even hate eventually.  At the time I
	thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.

		VOICE-OVER
	I remember being drawn to you even then.
	I thought, I love this woman because
	she's alone down there looking out at the
	black ocean.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	But I went back to my food.  The next
	thing I remember, I felt someone sitting
	next to me and I saw the orange sleeve
	out of the corner of my eye.

A shot of the orange sleeve.  Joel looks up.

		CLEMENTINE
	Hi there.

		JOEL
	Hi.

		VOICE-OVER
	I was so nervous.  What were you doing
	there, I wondered.  Your hair was lime
	green.  Green revolution.

A shot of her green hair.

		JOEL
	You said...

		CLEMENTINE
	I saw you sitting over here.  By
	yourself.  I thought, thank God, someone
	normal, who doesn't know how interact at
	these things either.

		JOEL
	Yeah.  I don't ever know what to say.

		CLEMENTINE
	I can't tell you how happy I am to hear
	that.  I mean, I don't mean I'm happy
	you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm
	such a loser.  Every time I come to a
	party I tell myself I'm going to be
	different and it's always exactly the
	same and then I hate myself after for
	being such a clod.

		JOEL
	Even then I didn't believe you entirely.
	I thought how could you be talking to me
	if you couldn't talk to people?

		VOICE-OVER
	But I thought, I don't know, I thought it
	was cool that you were sensitive enough
	to know what I was feeling and that you
	were attracted to it.

		CLEMENTINE
	But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal
	ones, y'know?  I mean, what kind of
	people do well at this stuff?

		VOICE-OVER
	And I just liked you so much.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	You did?  You liked me?

		JOEL
	You know what I did.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah, I know.  I'm fishing.

		JOEL
	You said --

She picks a drumstick off of Joel's plate.

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm Clementine.  Can I borrow a piece of
	your chicken?

		JOEL
	And you picked it out of my plate before
	I could answer and it felt so intimate
	like we were already lovers.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	I remember --

		VOICE-OVER
	The grease on your chin in the bonfire
	light.

Shot of a smudge of chicken grease on Clementine's chin.

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh God, how horrid.

		JOEL
	I'm Joel.

		VOICE-OVER
	No, it was lovely.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Hi, Joel.  So no jokes about my name?

		JOEL
	You mean, like...
		(singing)
	Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my
	darlin', Clementine... ?  Huckleberry
	Hound?  That sort of thing?

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah, like that.

		JOEL
	Nope.  No jokes.  My favorite thing when
	I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound
	doll.  I think your name is magic.

She smiles.

		CLEMENTINE
		(eyes welling)
	This is it, Joel.  It's gonna be gone
	soon.

		JOEL
	I know.

		CLEMENTINE
	What do we do?

		JOEL
	Enjoy it.  Say good-bye.

She nods.

Joel and Clementine are walking near the surf.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	So you're still on the Zoloft?

		VOICE-OVER
	Next thing I remember we were walking
	down near the surf.

		CLEMENTINE
	No, I stopped.  I didn't want to feel
	like I was being artificially modulated.

		JOEL
	I know what you mean.  That's why I
	stopped.

		CLEMENTINE
	But my sleeping is really fucked up.

		JOEL
	I don't think I've slept in a year.

		CLEMENTINE
	You should try Xanax.  I mean, it's a
	chemical and all, but it works... and it
	works just having it around, knowing that
	it's there.  Like insurance.

		JOEL
	yeah?

		CLEMENTINE
	I'll give you a couple.  See what you
	think.

		JOEL
	Okay.

		CLEMENTINE
	Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?

		JOEL
	I love her.

		CLEMENTINE
	Really?  Me, too!  I don't meet people
	who even know who she is and I work in a
	book store.

		JOEL
	I think she's great.

		CLEMENTINE
	Me too.  There's this poem --

		JOEL
	Did this conversation come before or
	after we saw the house?

		CLEMENTINE
	I think, before.

		JOEL
	Seems too coincidental that way.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah, maybe.

Joel and Clementine wander near some beach houses closed for
the winter.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside
	gusts of wind,/And a house in which we
	don't live...

		JOEL
	Yeah, yeah.  It goes "Perhaps there is
	someone in this world to whom I could
	send all these lines"?

		CLEMENTINE
	Yes!  I love that poem.  It breaks my
	heart.  I'm so excited you know it.
		(pointing to houses)
	Look, houses in which we don't live.

Joel chuckles appreciatively.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	I wish we did.  You married?

		JOEL
	Um, no.

		CLEMENTINE
	Let's move into this neighborhood.

Clementine tries one of the doors on a darkened house.  Joel
is nervous.

		JOEL
	I do sort of live with somebody though.

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh.

She walks to the next house, tries the door.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Male or female?

		JOEL
	Female.

		CLEMENTINE
	At least I haven't been barking up the
	wrong tree.

She finds a window that's unlatched.  She lifts it.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Cool.

		JOEL
	What are you doing?

		CLEMENTINE
	It's freezing out here.

She scrambles in the window.  Joel looks around, panicked.

		JOEL
		(whisper)
	Clementine.

		VOICE-OVER
	I couldn't believe you did that.  I was
	paralyzed with fear.

The front door opens and Clementine stands there beckoning.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	C'mon, man.  The water's fine.  Nobody's
	coming here tonight, believe me.  This
	place is closed up.  Electricity's off.

		JOEL
	I hesitated for what seemed like forever.

		CLEMENTINE
	I could see you wanted to come in, Joel.

He walks cautiously toward the door.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	As soon as you walked in.  I knew I had
	you.  You knew I knew that, right?

INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Joel enters the darkened and Clementine closes the door
behind him.

		JOEL
	I knew.

		CLEMENTINE
	I knew by your nervousness that Naomi
	wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to
	criminally trespass.

		JOEL
	It's dark.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah.  What's your girlfriend's name?

		JOEL
	Naomi.

She's searching through drawers for something.  She pulls out
a flashlight, shines it in Joel's face.

		CLEMENTINE
	Ah-ha!  Now I can look for candles,
	matches, and the liquor cabinet.

		JOEL
	I think we should go.

		CLEMENTINE
	No, it's our house!  Just tonight --
		(looking at envelope on
		 counter)
	-- we're David and Ruth Laskin.  Which
	one do you want to be?  I prefer to be
	Ruth but I'm flexible.
		(opens cabinet)
	Alcohol!  You make drinks.  I'm going
	find the bedroom and slip into something
	more Ruth.  I'm ruthless at the moment.

She runs upstairs, giggling.  The room is drying out, turning
into a husk.

		JOEL
		(calling after her)
	I really should go.  I really need to
	catch my ride.

		VOICE-OVER
	I didn't want to go.  I was too nervous.
	I thought, maybe you were a nut.  But you
	were exciting.  You called from upstairs.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
		(flat)
	So go.

		JOEL
	I did.  I walked out the door.  I felt
	like I was a scared little kid.  I
	thought you knew that about me.  I ran
	back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my
	humiliation.  You said, "so go" with such
	disdain.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
		(poking her head downstairs)
	What if you stay this time?

		JOEL
	I walked out the door.  There's no more
	memory.

		CLEMENTINE
	Come back and make up a good-bye at
	least.  Let's pretend we had one.

Clementine comes downstairs, vague and robotic, making her
way through the decaying environment.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Bye, Joel.

		JOEL
	I love you.

She smiles.  They kiss.  It fades.

		CLEMENTINE
	I --

EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

Joel finds himself hurrying back to the bonfire.  This scene,
too, is disintegrating.  It dries up and Joel is just
standing there on a faded beach at night, the bonfire frozen
in the distance like a photograph.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

Joel sits in the back seat, Rob and Carrie are in the front.

		CARRIE
	Did you have fun?

Joel nods glumly.

Carrie continues to talk, but her voice goes under as Joel
studies the faded husks of memories, piled like refuse
outside the moving car window.  He sees dried-out version of
previous interactions with Clementine playing out in loops.
He looks back and sees the memory of his ride home from the
beach with Rob and Carrie.  It, too, is decaying.  Soon all
has crumbled into dust.  Everything goes black.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

Howard watches the monitor.  The last specks of light are
fading.  It grows dark.  He is tired, his eyes are hollow.
He turns to Stan, who is staring out the window at the dawn.

		HOWARD
	Okay.

Stan turns and wordlessly begins the clean-up.  He pulls the
electrodes off of Joel's scalp, coils cable, packs bags.
Howard dials the bedside phone.  He waits as it rings.

		HOLLIS'S VOICE
	Hi, you've reached the Mierzwiaks.  We
	can't come to --

Howard hangs up.

EXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - EARLY MORNING

Stan and Howard load the last of the equipment into the back
of the van.  He and Howard look at each other.

		STAN
	So, I've got to drop the van off.

		MIERZWIAK
	Thanks, Stan.  Thanks.

INT. PATRICK'S CAR - EARLY MORNING

Patrick and Mary are heading home from Boston.  Mary is
silent and depressed.  Patrick tries to break the silence.

		PATRICK
	You want to stop for coffee or something?

Mary shakes her head "no."  Long silence.

		PATRICK (CONT'D)
	Well, it was sure beautiful on that
	river.  Thanks for sharing it with me.

Mary doesn't say anything.  Silence.

		PATRICK (CONT'D)
	Well do it again soon.

EXT. PARKING STRUCTURE - EARLY MORNING

Stan pulls the van into space marked "Lacuna."  He gets out,
crosses to his car.  Mary is sitting on the hood.

		STAN
	Hey.

		MARY
		(beat)
	Do you swear you didn't know?

		STAN
	I swear.

		MARY
	And you never even suspected?  Never saw
	us behaving in any unusual way together?

		STAN
	Once, maybe.

She watches him closely, waiting for him to continue.

		STAN (CONT'D)
	It was here.  At his car.  I was coming
	back from a job and spotted you together.
	You seemed caught.  I waved.  You
	giggled.

		MARY
	How did I look?

		STAN
		(beat)
	Happy.  Happy with a secret.

Mary starts to cry.

		MARY
	And after that?

		STAN
	I never saw you together like that again.
	So I figured I was imagining things.

Mary says nothing.

		STAN (CONT'D)
	I really like you, Mary.  You know that.

		MARY
	Do you remember anything else?  What I
	was wearing?  Was I standing close to
	him?  Was I leaning against his car like
	I owned it?  How did he look at me when I
	giggled?  Tell me everything.

		STAN
		(thinking)
	You were in red.  That red sweater with
	the little flowers, I think.  You were
	leaning against his car.
		(thinking)
	He looked a little like a kid.  Kind of
	goofy and wide-eyed.  I'd never seen him
	look like that before.  Happy.  You
	looked beautiful.  You looked in love.

		MARY
		(heading toward the levator)
	Thanks, Stan.

She stops but doesn't turn to face him.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	You're nice.
		(beat)
	But I love him.  I knew I loved him.  Now
	I know.

He nods.  She waves, heads to the elevator.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Joel awakens.  The apartment is neat, like when he went to
sleep.  He gets out of bed and heads into the bathroom.

EXT. COMMUTER TRAIN STATION - MORNING

Joel waits on the crowded platform.  The platform across the
tracks is empty.  Joel's train arrives.  It's packed.  He
squeezes on with all the other commuters.

INT. OFFICE - DAY

Joel works in his cubicle over the light table.  He seems
distracted.  He dials his phone.  He's nervous.

		JOEL
	Hi... Naomi?  Yeah, hi!  How are you?  I
	know, I know.  It's been a long time.
	Not too much.  You?  Oh, that's great!
	Congratulations!  Maybe I could buy you
	dinner to celebrate?  Tonight?  I'm free.
	Okay, good!

INT. LACUNA RECEPTION AREA - DAY

Mary does paperwork at her desk.  She looks through her
reception window at the sad people waiting in the lobby with
their bags of stuff.

INT. MIERZWIAK'S OFICE - CONTINUOUS

Mierzwiak dials his phone and waits.  He hangs up.  Mary
enters with the papers.

		MARY
	I need this signed, Howard.

He takes it, unable to make eye contact.  He signs it, hands
it back.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	Thanks.
		(beat)
	So... do we talk about this... or what?

		MIERZWIAK
	I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary.
	I want to do the right thing here.

		MARY
	Do you love me?  Did you love me?
	Something.  I listened to my tape.  I
	can't believe I've been sitting right in
	front of it for a year.  It's like
	listening to someone else's story.  I
	mean, I hear myself talking about having
	sex with you and I can't even imagine you
	naked.  I can't even say "naked" to you!

		MIERZWIAK
	I have a family, Mary.

		MARY
	You made me have an abortion.

		MIERZWIAK
	It was a mutual decision.

		MARY
	You made me have you erased!  I loved
	you.  I love you!  How could you --

		MIERZWIAK
	I didn't make you.  You thought it best.
		(off her stare)
	But, look, I take full responsibility.

She looks at him for a long while.  Then, out of frustration,
she screams.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Joel sits across from Naomi.

		NAOMI
		(oddly cautious)
	So... you haven't been involved with
	anyone in all this time?

		JOEL
	It's been a pretty lonely couple of
	years.

		NAOMI
	I'm sorry.

		JOEL
	Well, it was my fault -- the break-up.
	I'm sorry.

		NAOMI
	Oh, sweetie.  It really does cut both
	ways.  We were taking each other for
	granted and --

		JOEL
	I miss you.

		NAOMI
	Miss you, too.
		(awkward pause)
	I have been seeing someone for a little
	while.

		JOEL
		(trying for enthusiasm)
	Oh!  Great.  That's great!

		NAOMI
	A religion instructor at Columbia.  A
	good guy.  He's a good guy.

		JOEL
	I'm sorry.  I really shouldn't have --

		NAOMI
	I'm glad you called.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Joel and Naomi are in bed having sex.  There are certain
sexual routines, habits, they have fallen back into almost
immediately.  She sticks her tongue in his ear in a way
that's trying to be sexual but just feels embarrassing to
him.  They finish and lie there.

		JOEL
	So you think the dissertation will get
	published?

		NAOMI
	I don;t know.  I'm not sure there's a big
	public demand for books on Calvinism and
	Misogyny.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Clementine lies in bed with Patrick.

EXT. COMMUTER TRAIN STATION - MORNING

The platform is crowded with business commuters.  Joel is
among them.
The platform across the tracks from them is empty.  Suddenly,
Joel turns and makes his way through the crowd.  He climbs
the stairs, crosses the overpass and makes his way to the
empty platform.  An almost empty train pulls into that
platform.  Joel gets on the train and watches the business
commuters through the dirty window as his train pulls out of
the station.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Mary gets out of bed.  She has been crying all night.  She's
a wreck.  She puts on some coffee then crosses into the
living room area.  Sitting there are piles of the files from
work.  She pulls the top one out, copies the name and address
onto an envelope stuffs the file and tape cassette in.  She
pulls another file out.  This one has Joel's name on it.  She
copies it onto an envelope.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel says goodbye to Clementine.

		CLEMENTINE
	So you'll call me, right?

		JOEL
	Yeah.

		CLEMENTINE
	When?

		JOEL
	Tomorrow?

		CLEMENTINE
	Tonight.  Just to test out the phone
	lines.

		JOEL
	Yeah.

Joel exits.  We stay on Clementine as she watches Joel head
to his car, tromping through the snow.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel enters, drops his overcoat on a chair, dials the phone.

		JOEL
	Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.

		NAOMI'S VOICE
	Hi.

		JOEL
	How's it going?

		NAOMI'S VOICE
	Good.  I called you at work today.  They
	said you were home sick.

		JOEL
	I know.  I had to take the day to think.

		NAOMI'S VOICE
	Yeah, I tried you at home.  Did you get
	my message?

		JOEL
	I just got in.

		NAOMI'S VOICE
	Long day thinking.

Joel flips on messages with volume down.

		JOEL
	Yeah, I suppose so.

		NAOMI ON MACHINE
		(cheerful)
	Hi.  They told me you were sick!  So...
	Where are you?!  I had a really nice time
	last night.  Just wanted to say hi, so...
	hi.  Call me.  I'm home.  Call me!

		NAOMI'S VOICE
	That's me.

		JOEL
	There you are.
		(pause)
	Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall
	back into this fast without considering
	the problems we had...

		NAOMI
	Okay, Joel.  I suppose you're right.

		JOEL
	I had a good time last night.  I really
	did.

		NAOMI
	So I'm going to get some sleep.  I'm glad
	you're okay.

		JOEL
	We'll speak soon.

		NAOMI
	'Night.

She hangs up and Joel stands there for a minute feeling
creepy, then he dials the number on a piece of paper.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	What took you so long?

		JOEL
	I just walked in.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	Hmmm.  Do you miss me?

		JOEL
	Oddly enough, I do.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	Ha Ha!  You said, I do.  I guess that
	means we're married.

		JOEL
	I guess so.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	Tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.

EXT. CHARLES RIVER - NIGHT

Clementine steps out onto it.  Joel follows nervously.

		CLEMENTINE
	Don't worry.  It's really solid this time
	of year.

		JOEL
	I don't know.

She takes his hand and he is suddenly imbued with confidence.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	This is so beautiful.

She squeezes his hand.

		CLEMENTINE
	Isn't it?

She runs and slides on the ice.  Joel is by himself now.

		JOEL
	I don't know.  What if it breaks?

		CLEMENTINE
	What if?

Clementine lies on her back and stares up at the stars.  Joel
is paralyzed.  He looks back at the shore.

		JOEL
	I think I should go back.

		CLEMENTINE
	Joel, come here.  Please.

He hesitates then gingerly makes his way over to her.  She
reaches for his hand and gently pulls him down.  He lies on
his back beside her, their bodies touching.  He wants to turn
to her, but out of shyness, doesn't.  She holds his hand.
They look up at the stars.  She smiles, doesn't say anything
and snuggles closer to him.

		JOEL
	Listen, did you want to make love?

		CLEMENTINE
	Make love?

		JOEL
	Have sex.  Y'know --

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh, um...

		JOEL
	Because I just am not drunk enough or
	stoned enough to make that happen right
	now.

		CLEMENTINE
	That's okay.  I --

		JOEL
	I'm sorry.  I just wanted to say that.
	This seems like the perfect romantic
	exotic place to do it and --

		CLEMENTINE
	Hey, Joel --

		JOEL
	-- and I'm just too nervous around you
	right now.

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm nervous, too.

		JOEL
	Yeah?  I wouldn't have thought that.

		CLEMENTINE
	Well, you obviously don't know me.

		JOEL
	I'm nervous because I have and enormous
	crush on you.

She smiles up at the sky.

		CLEMENTINE
	Show me which constellations you know.

MONTAGE

We see people going to their mailboxes, finding manila
envelopes.  One by one they open the envelopes and pull out
tapes.  We see stunned, confused, disbelieving reactions as
people listen to their tapes.

EXT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Joel drops Clementine off.  She kisses him.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Joel enters with his mail.  He opens a manila envelope, reads
the enclosed file, sticks the cassette tape in his stereo,
listens.  Joel dials the phone.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	Yeah?

		JOEL
	Did you send this?  Is it a joke?

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	I probably got the same thing as you.

		JOEL
	I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've
	met you.  Who would even know to do this?

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
		(matter of fact)
	Maybe it's true then.  It's my voice on
	the tape.

		JOEL
	That's what you have to say?  How could
	it be true?  I never even heard of any
	procedure like this.  It's a joke.

		CLEMENTINE
	Maybe.  Call someone who'd know.

MONTAGE

We see the people we saw opening envelopes, now on the phone.
We hear over and over:  "Is this true?", "Did this really
happen?", "Do I know you?", "Is it true?"

INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S KITCHEN - DAY

Carrie is on the phone.  She pauses nervously, then speaks:

		CARRIE
	Yes, Joel.  It is true.  We weren't
	supposed to say anything.  They say it's
	like waking a sleepwalker.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Joel hangs up.  He dials the phone.

		JOEL
	It's true.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	I know.  I spoke to my friend Magda.

Joel is immersed in the several page document.

		JOEL
	Look, I have to go.  I have to think.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	Joel, we've fucked.  We've made love.
	Like a million times.  And we were so
	sweet and shy and inept with each other
	last night.  Isn't that lovely?

Joel doesn't know what to say as this registers.  He just
stands there dumbly.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	Come over here, sweetheart.  Please.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - LATER

Joel and Clementine review their separate Lacuna packages
together.

		CLEMENTINE
	Says you were closed off, non
	communicative, never told me what you
	were feeling.

		JOEL
	Says you were a bully...

		CLEMENTINE
		(laughing)
	A bully?  Moi?

		JOEL
	That's what it says.  You drank too much,
	you picked on me for being passive and
	timid.

		CLEMENTINE
	Well, sounds like me.  Sorry, man.
		(reading)
	Says you were jealous and suspicious.

		JOEL
	Says you would sometimes disappear all
	night, then brag to me about your sexual
	conquests.

		CLEMENTINE
	Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or
	is that your way of putting it.

		JOEL
	I don't know.

		CLEMENTINE
	Doesn't sound like me.

		JOEL
	Says you were a slob, leaving trails of
	panties and dirty socks in your wake.

		CLEMENTINE
	Says you were constantly calling me a
	slob.
		(laughs)
	It's sexy that we were like a married
	couple, griping and overly-familiar and
	bored.  Don't you think?

		JOEL
		(considering)
	I sort of do.  But I only see it as a
	fantasy version of reality.  Cleaned up
	enough to be erotic.

		CLEMENTINE
	We should have sex.  It's old hat for us.

She smiles at nervous Joel.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	You know my body like the back of your
	hand.

She unbuttons her blouse.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Every curve, every freckle.

She takes off her shirt.  He stares at her.  He has clearly
never seen this body before.

		JOEL
	You're so beautiful.

She approaches him, kisses him, his arms wrap around her
waist for the first time.

INT. LACUNA LTD. WAITING ROOM - MORNING

Stan enters the waiting room, now crowded with people holding
their files, a stunned-looking lot.  There is a new woman in
the reception window.  The file cases behind her are bare.

		RECEPTIONIST
	May I help you?

		STAN
	I work here.  I used to work here.  Stan.
	Please just tell Howard I'm here to clean
	out my desk.

		RECEPTIONIST
		(into phone)
	Mr. Mierzwiak, Stan is here to -- Yes
	sir.
		(to Stan)
	He says he needs to see you.

INT. MIERZWIAK'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Stan enters.  Mierzwiak is pale and pacing.

		MIERZWIAK
	She should not have done this, Stan.  As
	mad as she was... as justifiably --

		STAN
	I don't know what you're talking about,
	Howard.

		MIERZWIAK
	Mary has stolen our files and is sending
	them back to people.

		STAN
	Jesus.

Mierzwiak turns up the volume on a small video monitor
looking in on the lab, where Patrick has clearly taken over
Stan's position.  He is in the process of interviewing a sad
young woman.

		YOUNG WOMAN
	... so I called everybody I know and
	asked them to tell me everything.  Now I
	know my entire history with him, but it's
	in the form of a story, I'm losing my
	mind.

		MIERZWIAK
	This is why people must never be told.
	It's like waking a --

		YOUNG WOMAN
	I don't know what to do.  Before I
	thought I was depressed for no reason.
	Now it's like I've been assigned a
	reason.

		PATRICK
	This never should've happened, ma'am.
	We'll take care of it.

		MIERZWIAK
	I know you don't like me much, Stan, but
	please talk to Mary.  She of all people
	should know this is a dangerous thing
	she's doing.

INT. OFFICE - DAY

Joel works over his light box.  His phone rings.

		JOEL
	Hi, it's Joel.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	Hey, lover.  Whatcha doing?

		JOEL
	I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I
	can till I can see you.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	God, I can't believe I ever hated you.

		JOEL
	You must have been crazy.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	Guess what I'm wearing.

		JOEL
	I don't know.  Panties and --

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	Your dried cum.

		JOEL
	Jesus.

		CLEMENTINE
	You're still excited by my irreverence.
	You haven't yet started to think of it as
	my "gratuitous need to shock."

		JOEL
	I can't stop thinking about you.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yay.  Meet me after work by the old mill.

		JOEL
	What old mill?  Is that somewhere we --

		CLEMENTINE
	I just wanted to say that.  Come by my
	house.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Mary opens the door.  Stan stands there with two cups of take
out coffee.

		MARY
	Oh.

		STAN
	Hi.

		MARY
	What do you want, Stan?

		STAN
	Can I... I brought some --

She steps aside for Stan to enter.  He does, looks around,
sees the tapes and the stuffed envelopes on the floor.

		STAN (CONT'D)
	What's this?

		MARY
	Nothing.

		STAN
	I know what it is.

		MARY
	Then why did you ask me?

		STAN
	I don't know.  I just -- there are a lot
	of really confused people showing up at
	the office.

		MARY
	They have a right to know.  Howard is a
	thief.  He steals the truth.
		(suddenly weeping)
	I can't remember my baby!  I can't
	remember my baby.  It existed and I can't
	even remember.  Do you understand that?

Stan doesn't know what to say.  He stands there dumbly.  Mary
slumps into a ball on a chair.

		STAN
	Mary, people come to him voluntarily.

		MARY
	I won't allow it.  Those who cannot
	remember the past are condemned to repeat
	it.  What do you think of that?  That's
	from my quote book.

		STAN
	The office is filled with people who want
	their memories re-erased.

		MARY
		(hysterically)
	Remember the Alamo!  Remember the Alamo!

		STAN
	Mary... please.  This is hurting people.

Long pause, then:

		MARY
		(small)
	I don't want to hurt people.
		(breaking down)
	But these things happened!  All these
	little sadnesses, the big ones.  What if
	no one remembers?  What does that do to
	the world?
		(beat, quietly)
	Someone has to remember, Stan.

They look at each other.

EXT. PARK - AFTERNOON

Vague elliptical images of a young girl on a swig.

		SAD WOMAN'S VOICE
	I was by myself in the park because my
	friend Davia was sick that day.  I was on
	a swing.  There was this smiling man
	walking a little bushy dog --

Vague shots of a man smiling, a scruffy dog on a leash.

		SAD WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	The man said something like, "He's
	friendly --"

Vague shot of the man, his voice overlapping with the
woman's.

		SAD WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	"-- he won't bite."

		MAN
	He won't bite.  You can pet him if you
	want...

Shot of the girl petting the dog.

		MAN
	Do you want to give him a biscuit?

The girl nods.

		MAN (CONT'D)
	They're in my car.  Why don't you --

		DISTRAUGHT WOMAN'S VOICE
	Excuse me?  Hello?

INT. LACUNA RECEPTION AREA - DAY

Mary, with a headset on, looks up, startled.  She switches
off the tape.  She has been crying.  There's a pile of tapes
next to her.  The distraught woman is standing there.

		MARY
	May I help you?

		DISTRAUGHT WOMAN
	I'm here for Dr. Mierzwiak.  My name is
	Helene Kernfeld.

		MARY
	Yes, please have a seat.  The doctor will
	be with you momentarily.

The woman sits.  Mary presses an intercom button.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	Howard, your 10:30.

She switches the tape back on.

		SAD WOMAN'S VOICE
	He took me to his car and ...

Vague shot of the girl being raped.

INT. COMMUTER TUBE - DAY

The old woman is staring off blankly, her giant manuscript in
her lap, as she travels over the New York skyline.  We move
into her eyes.

INT. VAGUE SPACE

Vague reenactments of memories intermingle in this undefined
space:

The young girl being raped by the man in the car.

A soldier on a battlefield looking at his slaughtered
friends.

A couple fighting, from the woman's point of view.

		MAN
	I...I... I... find you physically
	repulsive!  I can't even look at you!

They look at each other in silence.

A little boy being called "faggot" by an endless succession
of boys.

The aftermath of a car accident from the driver's POV.

Mary having an abortion.

INT. COMMUTER TUBE - DAY

The old woman and her chair lift out of the line of
commuters.

INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

It's modern and well-appointed.  The old woman enters, sits
behind the reception desk, drops her manuscript into the
drawer.   She takes some pills with water.  An old man
enters.

		OLD MAN
	How are you today, Mary?

		OLD WOMAN (MARY)
	Let's see... Still dying, Howard.

		OLD MAN (HOWARD)
	You don't have to jump down my throat.  I
	was trying to be nice.

		OLD WOMAN (MARY)
	Well, don't try.  It's unbecoming on you.

Old Howard mutters something and disappears into the back.
Old Mary pulls out a file from behind, removes a small disc,
places it in a machine on her desk, slips on earphones and
listens, somewhat wearily but attentively.  We watch the
color drain from her face, but don't hear the recording.
Another old woman enters the office.  Old Mary looks up,
seems a bit startled, conceals it, turns off the tape.

		OLD WOMAN (MARY) (CONT'D)
	May I help you?

		SECOND OLD WOMAN
	I'd like to make an appointment.

		OLD WOMAN (MARY)
	I think the doctor is free this morning.
	He can probably take you right away for
	an initial consultation.

The second old woman smiles gratefully.

INT. OLD MAN'S OFFICE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Old Howard works at his desk.  Old Mary enters with the
second old woman.

		OLD WOMAN (MARY)
	Dr. Mierzwiak, this is Clementine
	Kruczynski.  She'd like to talk to you.

Old Howard and the old Mary eye each other.

		OLD MAN (HOWARD)
	Hello, Ms. Kruczynski.  Nice to meet you.
	Please have a seat.

He indicates a sitting area.  She sits.  He joins her.

		OLD MAN (HOWARD) (CONT'D)
	Would you mind if I tape our discussion?

She shakes her hear.  He punches a couple of buttons on his
computer console.  A tape recorder starts up and his computer
screen lights up so only he can see it.  On it we see a whole
file on Clementine Kruczynski: a list of fifteen dates of
previous erasures stretching back fifty years, all of them
involving Joel Barish.

		OLD MAN (HOWARD) (CONT'D)
	So, why don't you begin by telling me why
	you've come here.

		SECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE)
	Well, I met this man, Joel, three years
	ago at a senior dance...  We'd both been
	alone for so long and...

INT. TUBE - NIGHT

The old woman (Mary) travels in the commuter tube over
Manhattan.  It's late, the tube is mostly empty.  She has
earphones on.

		SECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE) (V.O.)
	I remember Joel and I were having
	breakfast --

INT. VAGUE SPACE

An old man and the second old woman eat breakfast.

		SECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE) (V.O.)
	-- I said something like we should go
	upstate and see the leaves change...

The old man looks up from his cereal and stares blankly.  The
woman smiles, but there is no response... just a dead stare.

		SECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE) (V.O.)
		(CONT'D)
	He just stared at me as if I didn't
	exist.  As if I had never existed...

INT. TUBE - CONTINUOUS

The second old woman's (Clementine) voice drones tinnily on
in the distance.  The old woman with the earphones is dead,
her eyes glassy and unseeing.

		SECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE) (V.O.)
	-- his eyes used to be so filled with
	love.  But it was gone.  How can I go
	back to being alone after seeing love?  I
	was alone for so long.  What had I done
	with my life?  I was alone so long.

INT. SECOND OLD WOMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The old Clementine is unconscious on her bed, hooked up to
modern versions of the erasing machines.  Two young
technicians monitor the equipment.  The woman's bedside phone
rings.  Her machine picks up.  After a moment:

		OLD MAN'S VOICE
	Hi, it's Joel.  What's going on, Clem?
	Why won't you call me back?  Please call
	me.  We need to speak.

The machine clicks off.  One of the technicians reaches over
and presses the "erase" button on the machine.

BLACK.

THE END
INT. PUBLISHING HOUSE RECEPTION AREA - DAY

It's grand and modern.  Random House-Knopf-Taschen is etched
on the wall in large gold letters.  An old woman enters
carrying a tattered manuscript, maybe a thousand pages.  She
seems haunted, hollow-eyed, sickly.  The young receptionist,
dressed in a shiny, stretchy one-piece pantsuit, looks up.

		RECEPTIONIST
	Oh, hi.

		OLD WOMAN
		(apologetically)
	Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought
	I'd see --

		RECEPTIONIST
	I think he's in a conference.
	Unfortunately.  I'm really sorry.

		OLD WOMAN
	Would you just try him?  You never know.
	As long as I'm here.  You never know.

		RECEPTIONIST
	Of course.  Please have a seat.

The old woman smiles and sits, the bulky manuscript on her
lap.  She stares politely straight ahead.

		RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)
		(quietly into headset)
	It's her -- I know, but couldn't you just
	-- Yes, I know, but -- I know, but she's
	old and it would be a nice -- Yes, sorry.
		(to old woman)
	I'm sorry, ma'am, he's not in right now.
	It's a crazy time of year for us.

The receptionist gestures toward a Christmas tree in the
corner.  Its ornaments are holograms.

		OLD WOMAN
	This book -- It's essential that people
	read it because --
		(gravely, patting the
		 manuscript)
	-- It's the truth.  And only I know it.

		RECEPTIONIST
		(nodding sympathetically)
	Maybe after the holidays then.

INT. TILED HALLWAY - DAY

The old woman carries her manuscript haltingly down a subway
hall.  She stops to catch her breath, then continues and
passes several archway with letters printed above them.  When
she arrives at one topped by an LL, she slips a card in a
slot.  A plastic molded chair drops into the archway.  She
sits in the chair; it rises.

INT. TUBE -DAY

The woman is still in the chair as it slips gracefully into a
line of chairs shooting through a glass tube.  The other
chairs are peopled with commuters.  We stay with the woman as
she and the others travel over New York City in the tube.
There are hundreds of these commuter tubes crisscrossing the
skyline.  The woman glances at the manuscript in her lap.
It's called:

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

This serves as the movie's opening title.  The other credits
follow, as the old woman studies commuters in passing tubes.
Their faces are variously harsh and sad and lonely and blank.

INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

SUBTITLED: FIFTY YEARS EARLIER

Every doctor's office waiting room: chairs against the wall,
magazines on end tables, a sad-looking potted plant, generic
seascape paintings on the walls.  The receptionist, Mary, 25,
can be seen typing in the reception area.  Behind her are
shelves and shelves of medical files.  The door opens and
Clementine enters.  She's in her early thirties, zaftig in a
faux fur winter coat over an orange hooded sweatshirt.  She's
decidedly funky and has blue hair.  Mary looks up.

		MARY
	May I help you?

		CLEMENTINE
		(approaching reception area)
	Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr.
	Mierzwiak.  Clementine Kruczynski.

		MARY
	Yes, please have a seat.  He'll be right
	with you.

Clementine sits.  She looks tired, maybe hungover.  She picks
up a magazine at random and thumbs without interest.

INT. INNER OFFICE AREA - CONTINUOUS

Mary pads down the hallway.  She knocks on a closed door.

		MIERZWIAK (O.S.)
	Yes?

Mary opens the door, peeks in.  Howard Mierzwiak, 40's,
professional, dry, sits behind his desk studying some papers.

		MARY
	Howard, your one o'clock.

		MIERZWIAK
		(not looking up)
	Thanks, Mary.  You can bring her in.

She smiles and nods.  It's clear she's in love.  It's equally
clear that Mierzwiak doesn't have a clue.  Mary turns to
leave.

		MIERZWIAK (CONT'D)
		(looking up)
	Mary...

		MARY
		(turning back)
	Yes?

		MIERZWIAK
	Order me a pastrami for after?

		MARY
	Cole slaw, ice tea?

		MIERZWIAK
		(nodding)
	Thanks.

		MARY
	Welcome, Howard.

She smiles and heads down the hall.  Stan, 30's, tall,
spindly, and earnest in a lab coat pops out of a doorway.

		STAN
	Boo.

		MARY
	Hi.

She glances back nervously at Mierzwiak's open door.

		STAN
	Barely seen you all morning, kiddo.

He leans in to kiss her.  She cranes her neck to keep him
off.

		MARY
		(reprimanding whisper)
	Stan... c'mon...

		STAN
	Sorry.  I just --

		MARY
		(somewhat guiltilly)
	It's just...y'know... I mean...

		STAN
	I know.  Anyway --

		MARY
	Anyway, I've got to do my tap
	dance here.

She indicates the door to the reception area.  Stan nods.

		STAN
	See you later, alligator.

		MARY
	'kay.

		STAN
	Hey, if you're ordering lunch for
	Mierzwiak, would you --

		MARY
	I better do this, Stan.

Stan nods again and Mary opens the door to the waiting room.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	Ms. Kruczynski?

		CLEMENTINE (O.S.)
	Hi.

After a moment, Clementine appears in the doorway.  Mary
leads her down the hall, not looking back.

		MARY
		(professionally courteous)
	How are you today?

		CLEMENTINE
	Okay, I guess.

		MARY
		(at Mierzwiak's office)
	Here we are.

Mierzwiak steps out from behind his desk.

		MIERZWIAK
	Ms. Kruczynski, please come in.

Clementine enters the office.  Mary smiles at Mierzwiak and
closes the door, leaving them alone.

INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Mierzwiak directs Clementine to a chair next to a coffee
table and a conspicuously placed box of tissues.  Mierzwiak
sits across from her.  He smiles.

		MIERZWIAK
	How are you today?

		CLEMENTINE
	Okay, I guess.

		MIERZWIAK
		(nodding sympathetically)
	Well, why don't you tell me what's going
	on?  Do you mind if I turn this on?

He indicates a tape recorder.

		CLEMENTINE
	I don't care.

He turns it on, smiles at her, gestures for her to begin.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Well, I've been having a bad time of it
	with um, my boyfriend, I guess.

		MIERZWIAK
	You guess he's your boyfriend?  Or you
	guess you're having a bad time with hm?

		CLEMENTINE
	What?  No.  I don't like the term
	boyfriend.  It's so gay.

Mierzwiak nods.  He's attentive, pleasant, and neutral
throughout.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Maybe gay isn't the right word.  But,
	anyway, it's been rough with him...
	whatever the fuck he is.  Heheh.  My
	significant other... heh heh.  And I
	guess on a certain level, I want to break
	it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like
	this constant questioning and re
	questioning.  Do I end it?  Should I give
	it more time?  I'm not happy, but what do
	I expect?  Relationships require work.
	You know the drill.  The thing that I
	keep coming back to is, I'm not getting
	any younger, I want to have a baby... at
	some point... maybe... right?  So then I
	think I should settle -- which is not
	necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's
	a good guy.  It's not really settling.
	Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of
	movies, y'know?  That I have some
	completely unrealistic notion of what a
	relationship can be.  But then I think,
	no, this is what I really want, so I
	should allow myself the freedom to go out
	and fucking find it.  You know?  Agreed?
	But then I think he is a good guy and...
	It's complicated.  Y'know?

		MIERZWIAK
	I think I know. I think we can help.  Why
	don't you start by telling me about your
	relationship.  Everything you can think
	of.  Everything about him.  Everything
	about you.  And we'll take it from there.

She nods, thinks.

		CLEMENTINE
	Um, well, he's a fucking tidy one --

EXT. COMMUTER TRAIN STATION

SUBTITLE: TWO WEEKS LATER

The platform is crowded with business commuters.  Joel is
among them.  He is in his 30's, gaunt, and holding a
briefcase.  The platform across the tracks from him is empty.
Suddenly he turns and makes his way through the crowd.  He
climbs the stairs, crosses the overpass to the empty
platform.  Soon an almost empty train pulls up to that
platform.  Joel gets on and watches the business commuters
through the dirty window as his train pulls out of the
station.

EXT. MONTAUK TRAIN STATION - LATER

Joel talks on a phone.  The wind howls around him.  He tries
to shield the mouthpiece as he talks.

		JOEL
	Hi, Cindy.  Joel.  Listen, I'm not
	feeling well this morning.  No.  Food
	poisoning, I think.  Sorry it took me so
	long to call in, but I've been vomiting.

EXT. BEACH - DAY

Joel wanders the windy, empty beach, with his briefcase.  He
passes an old man with a metal detector.  They nod at each
other.

Later: Joel looks out at the ocean.

Later: Joel sits on a rock and pulls out a notebook.  He
opens it and writes with a gloved hand.

		JOEL
	January 13th, 2006.  Today I skipped work
	and took the train out to Montauk.
		(thinks)
	It's cold.
		(thinks some more)
	The sky is gray.
		(thinks some more)
	I don't know what else to say.  Nothing
	happens.  Nothing changes.  I saw Naomi
	last night.  We had sex.  It was weird to
	fall into our old familiar sex life so
	easily.  Like no time has passed.  After
	two years apart suddenly we're talking
	about getting together again.  I guess
	that's good.

He has no other thoughts.  He glances up, spots a female
figure in the distance, walking in his direction.  She stands
out against the gray in a fluorescent orange hooded
sweatshirt.  It's Clementine.  He watches her for a bit, then
as she nears, he goes back to his writing, or at least
pretends to.  Once she passed, he watches her walk away.  She
stops and stares out at the ocean.  Joel writes.

		JOEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
	If I'm constitutionally incapable of
	making eye-contact with a woman I don't
	know.  I guess I'd better get back to
	Naomi.

Later: Joel walks up near the beach houses closed for the
season.  He peeks cautiously in a dark window.

Later: Joel digs into the sand with a stick.

INT. DINER - DAY

It's a local tourist place, but off-season empty.  Joel sits
in a booth and eats a grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of
tomato soup.  An elderly couple drink coffee at the counter.
Clementine enters, looks around, takes off her hood.  Joel
glances at her bright blue hair.  She picks an empty booth
and sits.  Joel studies her discreetly.  The waitress
approaches her with a coffee pot.

		WAITRESS
	Coffee?

		CLEMENTINE
	God, yes.  You've saved my life!

The waitress pours the coffee.

		WAITRESS
	You know what you want yet?

		CLEMENTINE
		(laughing)
	Ain't that the question of the century.

The waitress is not amused.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	You got grilled cheese and tomato soup?

		WAITRESS
	Yeah.  We're having a run on it.

The waitress heads to the grill.  Clementine fishes in her
bag, brings the coffee cup under the table for a moment,
pours something in, then brings the cup back up.

		CLEMENTINE
		(calling)
	And some cream, please.

Clementine looks around the place.  Her eyes meet Joel's
before he is able to look away.  She smiles vaguely.  He
looks embarrassed, then down at his journal.  Clementine
pulls a book from her purse and starts to read.  Joel glances
up, tries to see the cover.  It's blue.  He can't read the
title.

EXT. BEACH - DAY

Joel stares out at the ocean.  Far down the beach Clementine
stares at it, too.  Joel glances sideways at her then back at
the ocean.

EXT. MONTAUK TRAIN STATION PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON

Joel sits on the bench waiting for a train.  Clementine
enters the platform, sees Joel, the only other person there.
She waves, sort of goofily enthusiastic, playing as if
they're old friends.  He waves back, embarrassed.  She takes
a seat on a bench far down the platform.  Joel stares at his
hands, pulls out his journal and tries to write in order to
conceal his awkwardness.

INT. TRAIN - A BIT LATER

Joel sits at the far end of the empty car and watches the
slowly passing desolate terrain.  After a moment the door
between cars opens and Clementine enters.  Joel looks up.
Clementine is not looking at him; she busies herself deciding
where to sit.  She settles on a seat at the opposite end of
the car.  Joel looks out the window.  He feels her watching
him.  The train is picking up speed.  Finally:

		CLEMENTINE
		(calling over the rumble)
	Hi!

Joel looks over.

		JOEL
	I'm sorry.

		CLEMENTINE
	Why?

		JOEL
	Why what?

		CLEMENTINE
	Why are you sorry?  I just said hi.

		JOEL
	No, I didn't know if you were talking to
	me, so...

She looks around the empty car.

		CLEMENTINE
	Really?

		JOEL
		(embarrassed)
	Well, I didn't want to assume.

		CLEMENTINE
	Aw, c'mon, live dangerously.  Take the
	leap and assume someone is talking to you
	in an otherwise empty car.

		JOEL
	Anyway.  Sorry.  Hi.

Clementine makes her way down the aisle towards Joel.

		CLEMENTINE
	It's okay if I sit closer?  So I don't
	have to scream.  Not that I don't need to
	scream sometimes, believe me.
		(pause)
	But I don't want to bug you if you're
	trying to write or something.

		JOEL
	No, I mean, I don't know.  I can't really
	think of much to say probably.

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh.  So...

She hesitates in the middle of the car, looks back where she
came from.

		JOEL
	I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down
	here.  I didn't mean to --

		CLEMENTINE
	No, I don't want to bug you if you're
	trying to --

		JOEL
	It's okay, really.

		CLEMENTINE
	Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe.
	I have a long trip ahead of me.
		(sits across aisle from Joel)
	How far are you going?  On the train, I
	mean, of course.

		JOEL
	Rockville Center.

		CLEMENTINE
	Get out!  Me too!  What are the odds?

		JOEL
	The weirder part is I think actually I
	recognize you.  I thought that earlier in
	the diner.  That's why I was looking at
	you.  You work at Borders, right?

		CLEMENTINE
	Ucch, really?  You're kidding.  God.
	Bizarre small world, huh?  Yeah, that's
	me: book slave there for, like, five
	years now.

		JOEL
	Really?  Because --

		CLEMENTINE
	Jesus, is it five years?  I gotta quit
	right now.

		JOEL
	-- because I go there all the time.  I
	don't think I ever saw you before.

		CLEMENTINE
	Well, I'm there.  I hide in the back as
	much as is humanly possible.  You have a
	cell phone?  I need to quit right this
	minute.  I'll call in dead.

		JOEL
	I don't have one.

		CLEMENTINE
	I'll go on the dole.  Like my daddy
	before me.

		JOEL
	I noticed your hair.  I guess it made an
	impression on me, that's why I was pretty
	sure I recognized you.

		CLEMENTINE
	Ah, the hair.
		(pulls a strand in front of her
		 eyes, studies it)
	Blue, right?  It's called Blue Ruin.  The
	color.  Snappy name, huh?

		JOEL
	I like it.

		CLEMENTINE
	Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were
	wondering.

		JOEL
	Yeah.  Tom Waits says it in --

		CLEMENTINE
	Exactly!  Tom Waits.  Which song?

		JOEL
	I can't remember.

		CLEMENTINE
	Anyway, this company makes a whole line
	of colors with equally snappy names.  Red
	Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution.
	That'd be a job, coming up with those
	names.  How do you get a job like that?
	That's what I'll do.  Fuck the dole.

		JOEL
	I don't really know how --

		CLEMENTINE
	Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.

		JOEL
	You think that could possibly be a full
	time job?  How many hair colors could
	there be?

		CLEMENTINE
		(pissy)
	Someone's got that job.
		(excited)
	Agent Orange!  I came up with that one.
	Anyway, there are endless color
	possibilities and I'd be great at it.

		JOEL
	I'm sure you would.

		CLEMENTINE
	My writing career!  Your hair written by
	Clementine Kruczynski.
		(thought)
	The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.

		JOEL
	You sure?  That doesn't sound --

		CLEMENTINE
	I think.  Anyway, I've tried all their
	colors.  More than once.  I'm getting too
	old for this.  But it keeps me from
	having to develop an actual personality.
	I apply my personality in a paste.  You?

		JOEL
	Oh, I doubt that's the case.

		CLEMENTINE
	Well, you don't know me, so... you don't
	know, do you?

		JOEL
	Sorry.  I was just trying to be nice.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah, I got it.

There's a silence.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	My name's Clementine, by the way.

		JOEL
	I'm Joel.

		CLEMENTINE
	No jokes about my name?  Oh, you wouldn't
	do that; you're trying to be nice.

		JOEL
	I don't know any jokes about your name.

		CLEMENTINE
	Huckleberry Hound?

		JOEL
	I don't know what that means.

		CLEMENTINE
	Huckleberry Hound!  What, are you nuts?

		JOEL
	I'm nut nuts.

		CLEMENTINE
		(singing)
	Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my
	darlin' Clementine?  No?

		JOEL
	Sorry.  It's a pretty name, though.  It
	means "merciful", right?

		CLEMENTINE
		(impressed)
	Yeah.  Although it hardly fits.  I'm a
	vindictive little bitch, truth be told.

		JOEL
	See, I wouldn't think that about you.

		CLEMENTINE
		(pissy)
	Why wouldn't you think that about me?

		JOEL
	Oh.  I don't know.  I was just... I don't
	know.  I was... You seemed nice, so --

		CLEMENTINE
	Now I'm nice?  Don't you know any other
	adjectives?  There's careless and snotty
	and overbearing and argumentative...
	mumpish.

		JOEL
	Well, anyway... Sorry.

They sit in silence for a while.

		CLEMENTINE
	I just don't think "nice" is a
	particularly interesting thing to be.

The conductor enters the car.

		CONDUCTOR
	Tickets.

Joel hands the conductor his ticket.  The conductor punches
it and hands it back.

		CLEMENTINE
	What is nice, anyway?  I mean, besides an
	adjective?  I guess it can be an adverb,
	sort of.

The conductor turns to Clementine.  She fishes in her bag.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	It doesn't reveal anything.  Nice is
	pandering.  Cowardly.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	And life is more interesting than that.
	Or should be.  Jesus God, I hope it is...
	someday.
		(to conductor)
	I know it's here.

The conductor and Joel watch as she gets more agitated.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	I don't need nice.  I don't need myself
	to be it and I don't need anyone else to
	be it at me.

		JOEL
	Okay.

		CLEMENTINE
	Shit.  Shit.  I know it's here.  Hold on.

She dumps the contents of the bag onto the seat and sifts
frantically through.  Joel sees the book she was reading in
the diner.  It's The Play by Stephen Dixon.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Damn it.  DAMN IT!
		(there it is)
	Oh.  Here.

She hands the conductor the tickets, smiles sweetly.  He
punches it, hands it back to her, and walks away.

		CONDUCTOR
	Next stop Southampton.

The conductor heads into the next car.  Clementine shoves
stuff back into her purse.  Her hands are a little shaky.
She pulls a airline-sized bottle of alcohol from her pocket,
opens it, and downs it.  Joel is watching all of this but
pretending not to.  She looks out the window for a while.
The train pulls into the station.  The doors open.  Nobody
gets on.  The doors close.  The train pulls out.

		CLEMENTINE
	Joel?  It's Joel, right?

		JOEL
	Yes?

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm sorry I... yelled at you.  Was it
	yelling?  I can't really tell.  Whatever,
	I'm a little out of sorts today.

		JOEL
	That's okay.

		CLEMENTINE
		(stares out window)
	My embarrassing admission is I really
	like that you're nice.  Right now,
	anyway.  I can't tell from one moment to
	the next what I'm going to like.  But
	right now I'm glad you said, "that's
	okay" to me.  That was nice of you.

		JOEL
	It's no problem.  Anyway, I have some
	stuff I need to --

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh, okay.  Well, sure, I'll just...
		(stands, throws bag over
		 shoulder)
	Take care, then.

		JOEL
		(pulling journal from
		 briefcase)
	Probably see you at the book store.

		CLEMENTINE
		(heading toward other end of
		 car)
	Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.

Clementine sits and stares out the window.

INT. TRAIN - LATER

There are a few more people in the car now.  Clementine has
inched a few seats closer to Joel.  She watches him.  His
head is immersed in his journal.

INT. TRAIN - LATER

It's dark out.  The train is pretty crowded.  Joel stares out
the window.  Clementine sits closer still to Joel, eyes him.

EXT. TRAIN STATION - EVENING

The doors open and Joel emerges along with others.  He heads
to the parking lot, arrives at the car.  There's a big dented
scrape along the driver's side.  He gets in.

INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Joel drives.  He passes Clementine walking.  She looks cold.
He considers, slows, rolls down his window.

		JOEL
	Hi.  I could give you a ride if you need.

		CLEMENTINE
	No, that's okay.  Thanks, though.

		JOEL
	You're sure?  It's cold.

		CLEMENTINE
	I don't want to take you out of your way.

		JOEL
	It's okay.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah?

He pulls over.  She climbs in.  They drive.

		JOEL
	Where do you live?

		CLEMENTINE
	You're not a stalker or anything, right?

		JOEL
	Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were,
	but no.

		CLEMENTINE
	You can't be too careful.  I've been
	stalked.  I've been told I'm highly
	stalkable.  I don't need that.

		JOEL
	I'm not a stalker.

		CLEMENTINE
		(beat)
	You know Wilmont?

		JOEL
	Yeah.

		CLEMENTINE
	Wilmont.  Near the high school.

Joel turns.  They drive in silence.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of
	nutso.  I'm not really.

		JOEL
	It's okay.  I didn't think you were.

There's a silence.

		CLEMENTINE
	So you like bookstores, huh?

		JOEL
	I like to read.

		CLEMENTINE
	Me too.  It is Rain Dogs, by the way.

		JOEL
	Yeah?  I can't remember that album very
	well.  I remember liking it.  But --

		CLEMENTINE
	The song's 9th and Hennepin.  I spent
	most of the train ride trying to
	remember.  "Till you're full of rag water
	and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill
	out/Over the side to anyone who'll
	listen."  Remember?

		JOEL
	Sort of, um...

		CLEMENTINE
	Remember?  "And you take on the dreams of
	the ones who have slept there/And I'm
	lost in the window/I hide on the
	stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in
	your hat..."
		(starts to cry)
	Oh, shit.  I'm so stupid.  Sorry.

		JOEL
	What?

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm just a bit of a wreck.  "I sleep in
	your hat" makes me cry.
		(pointing to a house)
	Me.

Joel pulls over.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Thanks very much.  That was very nice of
	you.

		JOEL
	Well, I wouldn't want to be --

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh, geez, I'm full of shit.  I already
	told you that.
		(pause)
	Anyway.  See Ya.

Clementine opens the car door.

		JOEL
	Take care.

		CLEMENTINE
		(turning back)
	Hey, do you want to have a drink?  I have
	lots of drinks.  And I could --

		JOEL
	Um --

		CLEMENTINE
	Never mind.  Sorry, that was stupid.  I'm
	embarrassed.  Good night, Joel.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Joel stands in the living room, somewhat nervously.  He tries
to calm himself by focusing on the surroundings.  He looks at
the books on her shelves.  Clementine is in the kitchen.  We
see her as she passes by the doorway several times, preparing
drinks and chatting.

		CLEMENTINE
	Thanks.  I like it, too.  Been here about
	four years.  It's really cheap.  My
	downstairs neighbor is old so she's
	quiet, which is great.  And the
	landlord's sweet, which is bizarre, but
	great, and I have a little porch in the
	back, which is great, because I can read
	there, and listen to my crickets and...

Clementine is in the living room now with two gin and tonics.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Two blue ruins...

Joel is looking at a framed black and white photograph of
crows flying.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	You like that?

		JOEL
	Very much.

		CLEMENTINE
	This... someone gave that to me, just
	like, recently.  I like it, too.  I like
	crows.  I think I used to be a crow.

She caws and hands Joel a drink.

		JOEL
	Thanks.  That was good, that crow sound.

		CLEMENTINE
	Do you believe in that stuff?
	Reincarnation?

		JOEL
	I don't know.

		CLEMENTINE
	Me neither.  Oh, there's an inscription
	on the back.
		(takes it off the wall, reads:)
	The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust
	of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my
	heart/A change of mood/And saved some
	part/Of a day I rued.

		JOEL
	Frost?

		CLEMENTINE
		(impressed)
	Yeah.  I'm not, like, a Robert Frost
	lover by any stretch.  His stuff seems
	strictly grade school to me.  But this
	made me cry for some reason.  Maybe
	because it is grade school.  Y'know?

		JOEL
	It's pretty.

		CLEMENTINE
	I miss grade school.  I don't know why
	I'm calling it grade school all of a
	sudden.  When I went we called it
	elementary school.  But I like grade
	school better.  Sounds like something
	someone from the forties would call it.
	I'd like to be from then.  Everyone wore
	hats.  Anyway, cheers!

		JOEL
	Cheers.

They click glasses.  Clementine giggles and takes a big gulp
of her drink.  Joel sips.  She plops down on the couch and
pulls her boots off.

		CLEMENTINE
	God, that feels so fucking good.  Take
	yours off.

		JOEL
	I'm fine.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah?  Well, have a seat, anyway.

Joel sits in a chair across the room.  Clementine finishes
her drink.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Ready for another?

		JOEL
	No, I'm okay for now.

She heads toward the kitchen with her glass.

		CLEMENTINE
	Well, I'm ready.  Put some music on.

Joel crosses to the CD's and studies them.

		JOEL
	What do you want to hear?

		CLEMENTINE (O.S.)
	You pick it.

		JOEL
	You just say.  I'm not really --

		CLEMENTINE (O.S.)
	I don't know!  I can't see them from
	here, Joel!  Just pick something good.

Joel studies the unfamiliar CD's.  He picks up Bang On a Can
performing Brian Eno's Music for Airports to look at.
Clementine reenters with her drink.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Oh, excellent choice.

She grabs it and sticks it in the CD player.  The music is
dreamy and haunting and slow.  Clementine falls back onto the
couch, closes her eyes and sips her drink.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Mmmmmmm.  Way to go, Joel.  You pick
	good.

Joel sits down in his chair and drinks.  There's a silence,
which seems fine to Clementine but makes Joel anxious.

		JOEL
	Well, I should probably get going.

		CLEMENTINE
	No, stay.  Just for a little while.
		(opens her eyes, brightly)
	Refill?

		JOEL
	No.  I --

		CLEMENTINE
	I know a man who needs a refill.

She grabs Joel's drink from his hand, takes it into the
kitchen.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D) (O.S.) (CONT'D)
	God bless alcohol, is what I say.  Where
	would I be without it.  Oh, Jesus, Mary,
	and Joseph, maybe I don't want to think
	about that.

She giggles.  Joel looks around the room again.  There are
several potatoes dressed as women in beautiful handmade
costumes: a nurse potato, a stripper potato, a schoolteacher
potato, a housewife potato.  Clementine returns with Joel's
drink and a refill for herself.

		JOEL
	Thanks.

		CLEMENTINE
	Drink up, young man.  It'll make the
	whole seduction part less repugnant.

Joel looks a little alarmed.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	I'm just kidding.  C'mon.

She sits back on the couch, closes her eyes.  Joel watches
her, looks at her breasts.  She opens her eyes, smiles
drunkenly at him.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.

		JOEL
	Yeah?

		CLEMENTINE
	Well, I go to a psychic and she's always
	telling me I'm psychic.  She should know.
	Do you believe in that stuff?

		JOEL
	I don't know.

		CLEMENTINE
	Me neither.  But sometimes I have
	premonitions, so, I don't know.  Maybe
	that's just coincidence.  Right?  Y'know,
	you think something and then it happens,
	or you think a word and then someone says
	it?  Y'know?

		JOEL
	Yeah, I don't know.  It's hard to know.

		CLEMENTINE
	Exactly.  Exactly!  That's exactly my
	feeling about it.  It's hard to know.
	Like, okay, but how many times do I think
	something and it doesn't happen?  That's
	what you're saying, right?  You forget
	about those times.  Right?

		JOEL
	Yeah, I guess.

		CLEMENTINE
		(dreamy beat)
	But I think I am.  I like to think I am.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	It's helpful to think there's some order
	to things.  You're kind of closed
	mouthed, aren't you?

		JOEL
	Sorry.  My life isn't that interesting.
	I go to work.  I go home.  I don't know
	what to say.

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh.
		(considers this)
	Does that make you sad?  Or anxious?  I'm
	always anxious thinking I'm not living my
	life to the fullest, y'know?  Taking
	advantage of every possibility?  Just
	making sure that I'm not wasting one
	second of the little time I have.

		JOEL
	I think about that.

She looks at him really hard for a long moment.  Joel tries
to hold her gaze, but can't.  He looks down at his drink.
Clementine starts to cry again.

		CLEMENTINE
	You're really nice.  I'm sorry I yelled
	at you before about it.  God, I'm an
	idiot.

		JOEL
	I do have a tendency to use that word too
	much.

		CLEMENTINE
	I like you.  That's the thing about my
	psychic thing.  I think that's my
	greatest psychic power, that I get a
	sense about people.  My problem is I
	never trust it.  But I get it.  And with
	you I get that you're a really good guy.

		JOEL
	Thanks.

		CLEMENTINE
	And, anyway, you sell yourself short.  I
	can tell.  There's a lot of stuff going
	on in your brain.  I can tell.  My
	goal... can I tell you my goal?

		JOEL
	Yeah.

		CLEMENTINE
		(ala Paul Simon)
	What's the goal, Joel?
		(laughs)
	My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow
	through me?  Do you know what I mean?
	It's like, there's all these emotions and
	ideas and they come quick and they change
	and they leave and they come back in a
	different form and I think we're all
	taught we should be consistent.  Y'know?
	You love someone -- that's it.  Forever.
	You choose to do something with your life
	-- that's it, that's what you do.  It's a
	sign of maturity to stick with that and
	see things through.  And my feeling is
	that's how you die, because you stop
	listening to what is true, and what is
	true is constantly changing.  You know?

		JOEL
	Yeah.  I think so.  It's hard to --

		CLEMENTINE
	Like I wanted to talk to you.  I didn't
	need any more reason to do it.  Who knows
	what bigger cosmic reason might exist?

		JOEL
	Yeah.

		CLEMENTINE
	You're very nice.  God, I have to stop
	saying that.  You're nervous around me,
	huh?

		JOEL
	No.

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm nervous.  You don't need to be
	nervous around me, though.  I like you.
	Do you think I'm repulsively fat?

		JOEL
	No, not at all.

		CLEMENTINE
	I don't either.  I used to.  But I'm
	through with that.  Y'know, if I don't
	love my body, then I'm just lost.  You
	know?

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	With all the wrinkles and scars and the
	general falling apart that's coming
	'round the bend.
		(beat)
	So, I've been seeing this guy...

Joel looks slightly crestfallen.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
		(off his reaction)
	Well, for the last week, anyway!  He's
	kind of a kid.  Kind of a goofball, but
	he's really stuck on me, which is
	flattering.  Who wouldn't like that?  And
	he's, like, a dope, but he says these
	smart and moving things sometimes, out of
	nowhere, that just break my heart.  He's
	the one who gave me that crow photograph.

		JOEL
	Oh, yeah.

		CLEMENTINE
	That made me cry.  But, anyway, we went
	up to Boston, because I had this urge to
	lie on my back on the Charles River.  It
	gets frozen this time of year.

		JOEL
	That's scary sounding.

		CLEMENTINE
	Exactly!  I used to do it in college and
	I had this urge to go do it again, so I
	got Patrick and we drove all night to get
	there and he was sweet and said nice
	things to me, but I was really
	disappointment to be there with him.
	Y'know?  And that's where psychic stuff
	comes in.  Like, it just isn't right with
	him.  Y'know?

		JOEL
	I think so.

		CLEMENTINE
	I don't believe in that soulmate crap
	anymore, but... he says so many great
	things.  We like the same writers.  This
	writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to.
	And he's cute.  It's fucked up.  Joel,
	you should come up to the Charles with me
	sometime.

		JOEL
	Okay.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah?  Oh, great!

She sits closer to him.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic --
	night picnics are different -- and --

		JOEL
		(shy)
	Sounds good.  But right now I should go.

		CLEMENTINE
		(pause)
	You should stay.

		JOEL
	I have to get up early in the morning
	tomorrow, so...

		CLEMENTINE
		(beat)
	Okay.

Joel puts on his overcoat.  Clementine heads to the phone
table, pulls out a notepad.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	I would like you to call me.  Would you
	do that?  I would like that.

		JOEL
	Yes.

She scribbles her phone number, hands it to him.  He puts it
in his pocket.  He stands there uncomfortably for a moment,
then forces himself to speak.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	I don't think your personality comes out
	of a tube.  I think the hair is just... a
	pretty topping.

She tears up, swallows, and kisses him on the cheek.  He's
surprised and pleased and nervous.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
		(shyly formal)
	So, I enjoyed meeting you.

		CLEMENTINE
	You'll call me, right?

		JOEL
	Yeah.

		CLEMENTINE
	When?

		JOEL
	Tomorrow?

		CLEMENTINE
	Tonight.  Just to test out the phone
	lines and all.

		JOEL
	Okay.

We stay with Clementine as she watches Joel tromping through
the snow and getting in his car.

INT. JOEL'S CAR - NIGHT

Joel speeds through the suburban Rockville Center
neighborhood.  There is no snow on the ground.  He seems
different, somehow foggy and disoriented.

SUBTITLE:  THREE DAYS EARLIER

He arrives at his apartment building and parks.

EXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Joel gets out of his car, spots a van parked across the
street.  There are two dark figures inside.

		VOICE-OVER
	Them.

He hurries inside the building.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel enters, dumps his overcoat on a chair, turns off the
lights, crosses to look furtively out the window.  It's
snowing in large flakes which seem to fall only in the beam
of a streetlight.

		JOEL
	It was snowing.

		VOICE-OVER
	There are two of them.  Couldn't make
	them out.  The orange glow of a
	cigarette.

Joel squints to see inside the van.  Two dark figures talk.
One sucks on a cigarette and s dim orange light momentarily
illuminates the interior.  The figure in the driver seat
rolls down his window and gives a cheery wave to Joel.

		JOEL
	The driver waved.  So casual, friendly.

		VOICE-OVER
	I'm like a joke to them.

Joel pulls away from the window, his face blanched.

		VOICE-OVER
	I guess they figure they can act like
	they want.  They don't have to worry
	about me remembering.

He paces, mulling things over.  As he does, the scene starts
to change, almost as if it is drying out.

		JOEL
	I might be making a mistake.

		VOICE-OVER
	Maybe I'm making a mistake.  Maybe I just
	need to learn to live with this.  First
	of all, I'll get over it.  Secondly, it
	happened.  Those who do not remember
	history are condemned to repeat it.  Who
	said that?  Churchill?  I'm not sure.
	But I don't care.  She did it to me.  I
	have to rid myself of this.  Fuck her.

		JOEL
	Fuck you, Clementine.

The colors bleach, the surroundings become slightly vague.
Even Joel's persona and voice-over seem to alter, his
emotional intensity becoming diffused.  Joel does not seem
aware of this.  He stops pacing, takes a small vial from his
pocket, dumps the lone pill onto his palm.  He looks at it.
It's pink.  There's some illegible initials stamped on it.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Pink.
		(beat)
	There was a number on it.  I remember.
	AL 1718?
		(beat)
	I have to follow through with this.  I
	have no choice.

		VOICE-OVER
	The pill was pink, I remember.  It had
	some letters and numbers on it.  What
	were they?  AL 1718?  AL something.  Four
	digits.  I don't like taking pills when I
	don't know what they are.  I have no
	choice.

He swallows it, peeks out the window again, takes off his
clothes, slips into a pair of pajamas fresh from the store
packaging.  He sits on the edge of the bed, dials the phone.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	We're sorry, the number you have
	dialed...
		(beat)
	Screw you, Clementine, for doing this ...

		RECORDED VOICE
	We're sorry, the number you have dialed
	is no longer in service.  If you think
	you have reached this recording in error
	-

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Bye.

Joel hangs up and lies on his back on the bed.  By now the
scene is lifeless, almost a husk.  He hears the apartment
building door open.  He hears footsteps.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	It's them.

		VOICE-OVER
	It's too late.

His eyelids are getting heavy.  He closes his eyes.

BLACK.

He hears a key in his apartment door.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Fuck.

INT. BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

Joel sits in the bookstore coffee shop.  It's a jarring
transition, visually and emotionally.  Joel is in the midst
of some traumatic state of mind.
He fingers the vial with the pink pill in it as he watches
Clementine stack books on shelves.  Her hair is bright orange
now.

		JOEL
	I should maybe talk to you.

		VOICE-OVER
	Clementine.  I should just maybe talk to
	her.

Joel rises and heads toward Clementine.

		JOEL
	I love you and if you knew that... if I
	told you what happened...  I'll explain
	everything, what we meant to each other.
	I'll tell you everything about our time
	together.  You'll know everything again
	and...

		VOICE-OVER
	Maybe if I just explain what happened, I
	wouldn't have to go through this and I
	could tell you everything and it would be
	like you knew and we could rebuild and we
	could be happy again and...

Right before Joel gets there, Patrick, a skinny young man
approaches Clementine.  Joel stops, watches.  The young man
seems out of breath.  He glances over at Joel, then taps
Clementine on the shoulder.  She turns, annoyed, sees who it
is and her face lights up.

		JOEL
	Clementine.

		VOICE-OVER
	That's your look for me.

Clementine giggles, stands and pokes Patrick playfully in the
ribs.

		PATRICK
	I just thought I'd say hi.  I was in the
	neighborhood.

		CLEMENTINE
	You were not.

		PATRICK
	I was not.

Joel is mesmerized by their familiarity.  As he stands there,
the scene starts to dry out.
Clementine and Patrick continue their flirtation but it's
turning lifeless, as if they are just reciting lines.  The
bookstore start to lose its color and immediacy.

		CLEMENTINE
	Come over after I'm done here?

		PATRICK
	I can't.  I want to, but I have to study.

		CLEMENTINE
	You rat.

		PATRICK
	I really want to, but tonight's
	important.  Test tomorrow.

		JOEL
	How could she have done this to me?  How
	could anyone do this to anyone?

		CLEMENTINE
		(to Patrick)
	You didn't say anything about my hair.

		PATRICK
	It's so cool.  You're by far the most
	sensational person in the room.

		CLEMENTINE
	In the room?

		PATRICK
	In the world.

Joel seems dazed, in some sort of dream confusion, as he
realizes the world around him is looking increasingly odd.

		JOEL
	What's happening here?
		(looks at watch; it's 9:30)
	Oh, God!  I have to go home.  They'll be
	there soon.

Joel turns to leave.

INT. JOEL'S CAR - NIGHT

Joel drives fast, recklessly.  The intensity is back.  He's
weeping as he drives.

		JOEL
	Gotta get home.  How could she do this to
	me?
	How could she not care about what we
	meant to each other.  What a fuck!  What
	a fucking monster she is!

		VOICE-OVER
	Oh, God.  I miss her.  I can't believe
	she's with that guy now!  I'm never going
	to see her again.  I love her so much.
	What a fucking monster she is!

The scene is faded as he parks in front of his apartment
building, and gets out of the car.  Joel spots the parked
van.  We've seen this before, but it's dried out now.

		JOEL
	Them.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY

Joel trudges along carrying two big trash bags full of stuff.
He's been crying.  He looks behind him and finds himself
looking out the window of his apartment at the dark van on
the snowy street.  He turns back to the New York Street and
spots the address he was looking for: 610 11th Avenue.

INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

Joel sits in the small room with his bags.  A woman across
from him cradles a box full of belongings in her lap.  Her
eyes are red from crying.  Mary, the receptionist, pokes her
head through her window into the waiting room.

		MARY
	Hello again, Mr. Barish.  Good, you've
	got your stuff.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Joel walks with his bags behind Mary.

		MARY
		(not looking back)
	How are you today?
		(at lab)
	Here we are.

INT. LABORATORY - DAY

Joel enters.  Mierzwiak stands there with Stan in his lab
coat.

		MIERZWIAK
	Ah, Mr. Barish.  This is Stan.  He'll be
	in charge of your procedure tonight.

Stan nods professionally.

		STAN
	Mr. Barish.

		JOEL
	How exactly is this going to work
	tonight?

As Mierzwiak talks, the room colors start to fade,
Mierzwiak's tone of voice is also affected; it becomes dry
and monotonous.

		MIERZWIAK
	We'll start with your most recent
	memories and go backwards -- There is an
	emotional core to each of our memories --
	As we eradicate this core, it starts its
	degradation process --  By the time you
	wake up in the morning, all memories
	we've targeted will have withered and
	disappeared.  Like a dream upon waking.

		JOEL
	Is there any sort of risk of brain
	damage?

		MIERZWIAK
	Well, technically, the procedure itself
	is brain damage, but on a par with a
	night of heavy drinking.  Nothing you'll
	miss.

Joel looks quizzically at the eroding environment.  Suddenly
he gets it.

		JOEL
	It's happening now!  I'm already in my
	brain.

Mierzwiak looks at the fading room.

		MIERZWIAK
	Yes, I suppose you are.
		(back in his faded memory
		 persona)
	So, let's get started -- If we want the
	procedure underway tonight, we have some
	work to do.

Joel is sitting in a chair.  Electrodes connect him to some
electronic machinery monitored by Stan.  Mierzwiak watches
from the corner.

		STAN
	We use the articles you brought to create
	a map of Clementine in your brain.
	Tonight while you sleep we'll be able to
	trace the map and erase.

		JOEL
	But you're tracing and erasing now.  It's
	already started.  I'm home in my bed.

Stan pulls a snow globe from one of Joel's bags, shows it to
Joel.  The equipment registers Joel's reaction.

		STAN
	Very good.

Stan pulls out a potato dressed as a Vegas showgirl.  Joel
studies it.  The machines register his response.

		MIERZWIAK
	We'll dispose of these mementos when
	we're done here.  That way you won't be
	confused later by their unexplainable
	presence in your home.

Stan pulls out a coffee mug with a photo of Clementine
printed on it.  Joel looks at the cup.  The machines record
his reaction.

		STAN
	Good.  We're getting healthy read-outs.

The room, Stan, and Mierzwiak are now vague and wispy.

		STAN'S VOICE
	Patrick, do me a favor --

Joel is watching Stan.  Stan is not speaking, yet his voice
continues.

		STAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	-- and check the voltage levels, I'm not
	wiping as clean as I would like here.

Joel looks up.  Stan's voice seems to be coming from above.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel lies on his back in fresh pajamas.  His eyes are closed
and electrodes connect his head to several machines.  The
machines are operated by Stan, now in grubby street clothes
and in need of a shave, and by Patrick, dressed similarly.
The monitor on one of the machines traces a myriad of light
blips running like streams through an image of Joel's brain.
Stan presses buttons and operates a joystick, aiming for the
lines.  Patrick (who we saw earlier with Clementine at the
bookstore) studies a meter on one of the machines.

		PATRICK
	The voltage looks fine.

		STAN
	Then check the connections.

Patrick fiddles with some jacks.

		PATRICK
	Does that help?

		STAN
	Yeah, that looks better.  Thanks.

INT. LAB ROOM - DAY

The memory is becoming vague, characters' affects flat.  Stan
pulls out a pile of loose-leaf pages.  Mierzwiak smiles.

		MIERZWIAK
	Ah, your journal.  This will be
	invaluable.

		STAN
		(reading)
	December 15th, 2004.  I met someone
	tonight.  Oh, Christ:  I don't know what
	to do.  Her name is Clementine and she's
	amazing.  So alive and spontaneous and
	passionate and sensitive.  Things with
	Naomi and I have been stagnant for so
	long.

The scene is just a shell of itself as Stan rattles on.

		STAN'S VOICE
	I think we got this one.  Let's push on.

Joel looks up at the ceiling.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - DAY

Joel, snapped into a new memory, cries as he fills two large
plastic garbage bags with mementos of his relationship with
Clementine.  There are funny little gifts, wind-up toys, some
potatoes dressed as women, some clothing Clementine has left
there, some CD's.  He pulls a big clump of pages out of his
loose-leaf journal and dumps them in the bag.

He gets some clean loose-leaf paper and writes:

December 15, 2004   Nothing much happened today.  I stayed
home.  Naomi worked on her dissertation.

The scene is fading as he continues to write.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Joel looks for an office number.  He finds it.  The plaque on
the door reads Lacuna Ltd.  Joel enters.

INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

Joel enters the Lacuna waiting room.  Mary sits in the
reception area.

		MARY
	May I help you?

		JOEL
	My name is Joel Barish.  I have an
	appointment.

		MARY
	Please have a seat.  Dr. Mierzwiak will
	be right with you.

INT. OFFICE HALL - DAY

Mary leads Joel down the hall.

		MARY
		(without turning)
	How are you today?

		JOEL
	Not great.

		MARY
		(at Mierzwiak's office)
	Here we are.

Joel glimpses Mary smiling coquettishly at Mierzwiak.

INT. MIERZWIAK'S OFFICE - DAY

Joel and Mierzwiak are in the sitting area.  Joel looks at
the tape recorder.

		MIERZWIAK
	I'm sorry you saw one of our notification
	cards.  You never should have.

		JOEL
	Well... I did.

		MIERZWIAK
	We can help you through this.  Why don't
	you start now by telling me everything
	you can remember about your relationship
	with Clementine.

		JOEL
		(thinks, then:)
	It was a mess.  I don't know how it got
	this way...

		PATRICK'S VOICE
	It's kind of a dump, don't you think?

Joel looks up, trying to locate the voice.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Patrick is checking out the apartment.  Stan monitors the
equipment.

		STAN
		(uninterested)
	It's an apartment.

		PATRICK
	Not a dump, then, but kind of plain.
	Uninspired.  And there's a stale smell.
	Sort of stuffy.  I don't know.  Stuffy.

		STAN
	Patrick, let's just get through this.  We
	have a long night ahead of us.

		PATRICK
	Yeah.

Patrick returns to the bedside, focuses on the machines for a
moment.  He glances at the unconscious Joel.

		PATRICK (CONT'D)
	So who do you think is better-looking, me
	or this guy?

Stan glances sideways at Patrick.

INT. MIERZWIAK'S OFFICE - DAY

Mierzwiak sits with Joel in the sitting area.

		MIERZWIAK
	So we'll need you to go home and bring in
	everything you ever received from
	Clementine and anything that might remind
	you of her...

The scene is faded and disappearing fast.  It's gone.

INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - DAY

Joel gets off the elevator and approaches the receptionist.

		JOEL
	So then she just stops calling.

		VOICE-OVER
	I wasn't going to call her.  Not after
	the way she was.

		JOEL
	Any messages, Carmen?

Carmen the receptionist shakes her head.

Next day: Joel approaches the receptionist.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Any messages for me, Carmen.

		CARMEN
	Nothing, Joel.

		VOICE-OVER
	It's bullshit.  She's punishing me for
	being honest with her.

Joel is at his office desk on the phone.

		PHONE MACHINE VOICE
	You have no messages.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel enters, checks his phone machine: zero messages.

INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - DAY

Joel gets off the elevator, approaches Carmen, who is in
conversation with someone else.

		JOEL
	Sorry, Carmen.  Any messages?

Carmen shakes her head "no", goes back to her conversation.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel checks his machine: zero messages.

		VOICE-OVER
	That's it.  I'm just gonna--

Without a moment's hesitation, he dials the phone.

		VOICE-OVER (CONT'D)
	I'm gonna tell her I'm through playing
	games and --

		RECORDED VOICE
	The number you have dialed has been
	disconnected.

Joel's eyes bug.

INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Joel sits across Rob and Carrie, mid-40's.

		JOEL
	Why would she do that?

		VAGUE RECORDED VOICE
	-- If you think you have reached this
	recording in error, please check your
	number and dial again.

		CARRIE
	I don't know, honey.  It's horrible.

		JOEL
	She's punishing me for being honest.  I
	should just go to her house.

		ROB
	I don't think you should go there, Joel.

		JOEL
	Yeah, I don't want to seem desperate.

		CARRIE
	Maybe you need to look at this as a sign
	to move on.  Just make a clean break.

		JOEL
	I don't know.  I'm so... I can't believe
	she'd be so goddamn immature!

		ROB
	Joel, look, the thing is --

		CARRIE
		(agitated, interrupting)
	Joel, honey... We have to feed the dog.
	Would you just wait here?  Just a second.

Joel nods, confused, as Rob and Carrie leave the room and
close the door behind them.  Joel hears a hushed argument
ensue in the hall.  He notices the dog asleep on the floor.
He grabs a magazine off the coffee table, flips through it
distractedly as he paces, puts it down, picks up another.  A
subscription card falls to the floor.  He picks it up and is
about to shove it back in the magazine when he sees it is not
a subscription card at all.  It reads:

 Clementine Kruczynski has had Joel Barish erased from her
  memory.  Please never mention their relationship to her
		 again.  Thank you.

		     Lacuna Ltd.
		     610 11th Avenue, NY, NY

Joel stares at the card, incredulous.

Later: Rob and Carrie are now back in the room.

		CARRIE (CONT'D)
	You weren't supposed to see that.

		JOEL
	They can't erase memories.  It's a joke.
	It's a nasty Clementine hoax.

		CARRIE
	Sweetie, we called the company.

Joel just stands there.

Close-up of a vague dictionary page.

		VOICE-OVER
	Lacuna:  Noun.  A blank, a missing
	portion, especially in a manuscript.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel is on the phone pacing.

		CARRIE'S VOICE
	You can't tell her, Joel.  They explained
	that.  Like waking a sleepwalker.  It
	might have a devastating effect.

INT. JOEL'S CAR - NIGHT

Joel drives past vague local landmark.

		CARRIE'S VOICE
	Think about it: to be told you lived an
	existence of which you have no
	recollection.

		JOEL'S VOICE
	But what am I supposed to do?

		CARRIE'S VOICE
	Move on, sweetie.

		JOEL'S VOICE
	How can I?  How can I move on when I know
	I'm the only one to carry this love we
	had?  How do I do that?

INT. CAR - NIGHT

Joel in his parked car next to a fence surrounding a drive-in
movie closed for the season.  He weeps.  The windows fog up
until the outside is completely obscured.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY

Joel looks for an address.

INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

Joel gets off on the sixth floor.  He searches for a room
number.  As he turns the corner, he sees that the hallway is
faded, vague and mostly erased.  He keeps walking, comes to
the door marked Lacuna and opens it.  Inside he can see
vague, erased version of Mary the receptionist.

		MARY
		(dead monotone)
	Hi, May I help you?

These degraded, faded memories allow Joel to detach himself
and hear what's going on in his bedroom.

		STAN'S VOICE
	So, Mary's coming over tonight.

Joel looks up.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Stan works the joystick.  Patrick sits on the bed with Joel.

		PATRICK
	Yeah?

		STAN
	Just wanted to let you know.

		PATRICK
	I like Mary.  I like when she comes to
	visit.  I just don't think she likes me.

		STAN
	She likes you okay.

		PATRICK
	I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend
	over, too.  I have a girlfriend now.

		STAN
	You can if you want.

		PATRICK
	Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?

		STAN
		(re: memory on monitor)
	This one's history.  Moving on...

		PATRICK
	The thing is ... my situation is a little
	weird.  My girlfriend situation.

		STAN
	Patrick, we need to focus.

Stan aims the joystick.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel distractedly reads a book, checks the clock, goes back
to the book.  The door opens.  He looks up.  Clementine is
staggering in, drunk.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yo ho ho!

		JOEL
	It's three.

		VOICE-OVER
	Shit.  The last time I saw you.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing.  I
	kinda sorta wrecked your car...

		JOEL
	I can't believe you wrecked my car.

		JOEL
	You're driving drunk.  It's pathetic.

		CLEMENTINE
	...a little.  I was a little tipsy.
	Don't call me pathetic.

		JOEL
	Well it is pathetic.  And fucking
	irresponsible.  You could've killed
	somebody.

The scene is starting to degrade.  The acting becomes anemic.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	I don't know, maybe you did kill
	somebody.

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody.  It's
	just a fucking dent.  You're like some
	old lady or something.

		VOICE-OVER
	Right!  She called me an old lady here,
	too!  And I remember, I said...

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	And what are you like?  A wino?

		CLEMENTINE
	A wino?  Jesus, Are you from the fifties?
	A wino!
		(laughs)
	Face it, Joel.  You're freaked out
	because I was out late without you, and
	in your little wormy brain, you're trying
	to figure out, did she fuck someone
	tonight?

		JOEL
	No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked
	someone tonight.  Isn't that how you get
	people to like you?

This shuts Clementine up.  She is stung and she starts
gathering up her belongings, which are strewn about the
apartment.  Joel is immediately sorry he said this.  He
follows her around.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	I'm sorry.  Okay.  I didn't mean that.  I
	just... I was just... pissed, I guess.

Clementine is out the door.  Joel follows.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Joel looks at his dented car, looks at Clementine clomping
off in the distance.

INT. JOEL'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Joel drives to catch up with Clementine.  He rolls down his
window to talk to her.

		JOEL
	Let me drive you home.

		CLEMENTINE
		(without turning)
	Fuck you, Joel.  Faggot.

		JOEL
	Look at it out here.  It's falling apart.
	I'm erasing you.  And I'm happy.

She keeps clomping.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	You did it to me.  I can't believe you
	did this to me.  By morning you'll be
	gone.  Ha!

He stops the car, gets out.

EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

It's a street you might see in a dream, more an impression of
a quiet street than an actual one, with what little detail
there is obscured in darkness.  Joel wanders it.  In the
distance Clementine walks off, but as in an animated loop,
she doesn't get any farther away.  It's lonely.

		PATRICK'S VOICE
	See, remember that girl?  The one we did
	last week?  The one with the potatoes?

Joel looks up, startled.

		STAN'S VOICE
	Yeah, that's this guy's girlfriend.  Was.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Stan watches the screen.  Patrick paces, fidgets, looks at
the unconscious Joel.

		PATRICK
	I gotta tell you something.  I kind of
	fell in love with her last night.

		STAN
	She was unconscious, Patrick.

		PATRICK
	She was beautiful.  So sweet and funky
	and voluptuous.  I kind of stole a pair
	of her panties, is what.

		STAN
	Jesus, Patrick!

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

On the vague street Joel listens to Patrick and Stan.

		PATRICK'S VOICE
	I know.  It's not like... I mean, they
	were clean and all.

		STAN'S VOICE
	Look, just don't tell me this stuff.  I
	don't want to know this shit.

		PATRICK'S VOICE
	Yeah, okay.

		STAN'S VOICE
	We have work to do.

There's a click and Joel finds himself in --

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel and Clementine sit and eat dinner in front of the TV.
It's hard to make out what they're watching.
They sit on opposite ends of the couch.  They look bored.
The scene quickly degenerates.  The room fades.

		PATRICK'S VOICE
	Okay, but there's more.

Joel listens.

		PATRICK'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	After we did her, I went to where she
	worked and I asked her out.

Joel looks over at the faded Clementine across the couch.
She stares straight ahead at the TV.

		STAN'S VOICE
	Patrick... do you know how unethical...

		JOEL
	That must be the guy I saw you with.

		VOICE-OVER
	In the bookstore that night.  The skinny
	guy.

There's a click and Joel finds himself in --

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel watches TV.  Clementine walks by in her underwear, looks
at the TV.  She slips into a skirt.

		CLEMENTINE
	How can you watch this crap?

		JOEL
	Where are you going?

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.

The scene starts to fade.  Clementine puts on her shoes and
heads out the door.

EXT. ZOO - DAY

Joel and Clementine walk around unhappily.  They barely look
at the animals.  Clementine watches parents with babies.

		JOEL
	Oh shit.  I remember this.
		(to Clementine)
	Want to go?

		CLEMENTINE
		(pissy)
	I want to have a baby.

		JOEL
	Let's talk about it later.

		CLEMENTINE
	No.  I want to have a baby.  I have to
	have a baby.

		JOEL
	I don't think we're ready.

		CLEMENTINE
	You're not ready.

		JOEL
	Clementine, do you really think you could
	take care of a kid?

She turns violently toward him, glaring.

		CLEMENTINE
	What?!

		JOEL
		(mumbly)
	I don't want to talk about this here.

		CLEMENTINE
	Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!

Joel looks around.  People are watching.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	You can't fucking say something like that
	and say you don't want to talk about it!

		JOEL
	Clem, I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have --

		CLEMENTINE
		(screaming now)
	I'd make a fucking good mother!  I love
	children!  I'm creative and smart and I'd
	make a fucking good mother!

The scene starts to fade.  Clementine's rant continues but
becomes attenuated and vague.

		JOEL
	Oh, thank God.  It's going.

		CLEMENTINE
	It's you!  It's you who can't commit to
	anything!  You have no idea how lucky you
	are I'm interested in you!  I don't even
	know why I am!  I should just end it
	right here, Joel.  Leave you in the zoo.
	Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang
	out with!

She's crying now, but it's almost animatronic, no real
emotion in it.  The scene is a husk.

		JOEL
	It's going, Clementine.  All the crap and
	hurt and disappointment.  It's all being
	wiped away.

She looks up at him.

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm glad.

Their eyes lock.  She is fading before his eyes.

		JOEL
	Me, too.

INT. BAR - NIGHT

It's noisy and crowded.  Joel and Clementine sit at a small
table.  She is drunk and staring off, blankly.

		JOEL
	So, um --

		CLEMENTINE
		(swiveling head toward him)
	Would you get me another, Joely?

Joel sighs, stands, and heads to the crowded bar.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Thanky!  Thanky!

Joel is at the bar, trying to get the bartender's attention.

Joel is paying the bartender.  He turns with the drink to
head back to the table.  He sees Clementine flirting with a
man in Joel's seat.

Joel is at the table.  Clementine looks from her
conversation.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Joel, this is Mark.  He likes my boobs.
	He came over special to tell me that.
	Isn't that nice.  He doesn't think I'm
	fat.

The scene starts to fade.  Mark rises.

		MARK
	I didn't know she was with someone, man.

		CLEMENTINE
	S'okay, Mark.  Joel doesn't like my
	boobs.
		(stage whisper)
	I don't think he likes girls.

The bar gets quiet and vague.

		JOEL
	You're drunk.

		CLEMENTINE
	You're a whiz kid.  So perceptive, so --

Clementine keeps talking but there are no more intelligible
words, just a whisper -- like a breeze.

A doorbell buzzes.  Joel looks up.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Patrick opens the door.  Mary stands there in a winter coat,
carrying a backpack.

		MARY
		(coolly)
	Oh, hey, Patrick.

		PATRICK
	Hi, Mary.  How's it going?

She walks past him.

		STAN
	Hey, you.

Stan and Mary kiss.  She looks down at Joel as she takes off
her coat.

		MARY
	It's freezing out.

		STAN
	You found us okay?

		MARY
	Yeah.
		(re: Joel)
	Poor guy.
		(looking around)
	Have anything to drink?

		STAN
	We haven't checked.

		MARY
	Well, allow me to do the honors.  It's
	fucking freezing and I need something.

She heads into the kitchen.  Stan turns back to monitor the
slivers of light.

		PATRICK
	Mary hates me.  I've never been popular
	with the ladies.

		STAN
	Maybe if you stopped stealing their
	panties.

		PATRICK
		(guilty beat)
	Okay, There's more, Stan --

Stan looks over at Patrick.  Mary returns with a bottle of
scotch and two glasses.

		MARY
	Hey, hey.

She pours the whiskey.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did
	you?

		PATRICK
	Nah, I don't know.

Mary hands a glass to Stan.  She holds hers up in a toast.

		MARY
	Blessed are the forgetful, for they get
	the better even of their blunders.

Mary and Stan click glasses.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	Nietzsche.  Beyond Good and Evil.  Found
	it my Bartletts.

		STAN
	That's a good one.

		MARY
	Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard!  It
	seems really appropriate.

		STAN
		(a little sulky)
	It's a good one all right.

		PATRICK
	What's your bartlett's?

		STAN
	It's a quote book.

		MARY
	I love quotes.  So did Winston Churchill.
	He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's
	about Bartlett's.  Isn't that trippy?

		PATRICK
		(trying to engage)
	Yeah.  Cool.

		MARY
	"The quotations when engraved upon the
	memory give you good thoughts."

		PATRICK
	Very cool.  Trippy.

		MARY
	I like to read what smart people say.  So
	many beautiful, important things.

		STAN
	Yup.

		MARY
	Don't you think Howard's like that?
	Smart?  Important?

		STAN
		(beat)
	Yup.

		PATRICK
	Definitely!

		MARY
	I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.

Stan focuses on the monitor.  Mary pours herself another
drink.

		PATRICK
	Definitely.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

It's dark.  Joel and Clementine are in bed.  The memory is
already in the midst of being erased.  Clementine is talking
in a monotonous, robotic manner.

		CLEMENTINE
	You don't tell me things, Joel.  I'm an
	open book.  I tell you everything.  Every
	damn embarrassing thing.  You don't trust
	me.

		JOEL
	No, it isn't that.

		CLEMENTINE
	I want to know you.

		JOEL
	I just don't have anything very
	interesting about my life.

		CLEMENTINE
	Joel, you're a liar.

The scene is faded completely now and Joel just lies there
for a moment, registering Clementine's statement.

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Joel and Clementine eat dinner in silence.  Joel looks around
at other couples in the restaurant.  Some seem happy and
engaged.  Others seem bored with each other.  He turns back
to his food.

		JOEL
	How's the chicken?

		VOICE-OVER
	Is that like us?  Are we just bored with
	each other?

		CLEMENTINE
	Good.

He watches her as she downs her wine and pours herself
another glass.  She holds the wine bottle up to Joel.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	More?

		JOEL
	No.  Thanks.

There's a silence.

		CLEMENTINE
	How's the fish?

The scene is fading.

		JOEL
	It's good.

They continue to eat in silence as the scene dissolves.

		PATRICK'S VOICE
	Hi, Clementine! -- Why, what's wrong? --
	Oh, I'm sorry. -- Well, I'm not sure, I
	kind of have to study for my test --

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Patrick is on the phone next to Joel's bed.  Stan watches the
lights on the computer screen.

		PATRICK
	Hold on.  Let me ask my friend.
		(covering mouthpiece)
	Stan, can I leave for a little while?  My
	girlfriend is very --

		STAN
	Patrick, we're in the middle of --

		PATRICK
	She's right in the neighborhood.  She's
	upset.

Mary is in the kitchen.  She pokes her head out.  She's got
some pie on a plate.

		MARY
	Let him go, Stan.  I can help.

		STAN
		(sighing, to Patrick)
	Go.

		PATRICK
		(quietly)
	Mary hates me.
		(into phone)
	I'll be right over, Tangerine.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Candles are lit.  Joel and Clementine are under a blanket on
the living room rug listening to music.

		CLEMENTINE
	Joely...

		JOEL
	Yeah, Tangerine?

		CLEMENTINE
	Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?

		JOEL
	No.

		CLEMENTINE
	It's my favorite book.  Since I was a
	kid.  It's about these toys.  There's
	this part where the skin Horse tells the
	rabbit what it means to be real.
		(crying)
	I can't believe I'm crying already.  He
	says, "It takes a long time.  That's why
	it doesn't often happen to people who
	break easily or have sharp edges, or who
	have to be carefully kept.  Generally by
	the time you are Real, most of your hair
	has been loved off, and your eyes drop
	out and you get loose in the joints and
	very shabby.  But these things don't
	matter at all, because once you are Real
	you can't be ugly, except to people who
	don't understand."

She's weeping.  Joel is stroking her hair.  They kiss and
begin to make love under the blanket.  It's sweet and gentle
and then it starts to fade.

		JOEL
		(screaming)
	No!  Jesus, No!

He looks down and Clementine's tear-streaked face is fading.
She continues as if she's still being made love to, even
though Joel is completely beside himself.  He jumps up naked
and yells at the ceiling.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Please!  Please!  I've changed my mind!
		(looks down at fading
		 Clementine, then at ceiling)
	I don't want this.  Wake me up!  Stop the
	procedure!  Plea --

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel is unconscious on the bed, completely still.  Mary and
Stan watch the monitor and smoke a joint.  After a silence:

		MARY
	It's amazing, isn't it?  Such a gift
	Howard gave the world.

		STAN
		(a sigh)
	Yeah.

		MARY
	To let people begin again.  It's
	beautiful.  You look at a baby and it's
	so fresh, so clean, so free.  And
	adults... they're like this messy tangle
	of anger and phobias and sadness...
	hopelessness.  And Howard just makes it
	go away.

		STAN
	You love him, don't you?

Mary seems surprised, taken aback, caught.  She is silent for
a long moment.

		MARY
	No.
		(beat)
	Besides, Howard's married, Stan.  He's a
	very serious and ethical man.  I'm not
	going to tempt him to betray all he
	believes in.

Stan takes another drag on the joint, passes it to Mary.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Patrick, bundled up and carrying a full backpack, trudges
through the snow.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Clementine watches out the window as Patrick nears.  She's
crying.  He makes his way up her front stairs.  She swings
open the door and hugs him.

		PATRICK
	Oh, baby, what's going on?

		CLEMENTINE
	I don't know.  I'm lost.  I'm scared.  I
	feel like I'm disappearing.  I'm getting
	old and nothing makes any sense to me.

		PATRICK
	Oh, Tangerine.

		CLEMENTINE
	Nothing makes any sense.  Nothing makes
	any sense.

She pushes herself out of the embrace and looks at Patrick.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Come up to Boston with me?

		PATRICK
	Sure.  We'll go next weekend and --

		CLEMENTINE
	Now.  Now!  I have to go now.  I have to
	see the frozen Charles!  Now!  Tonight!

		PATRICK
	Um, okay.  I'll call my study partner.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yay!  It'll be great!  I'll get my shit.

She runs into the bedroom.  Patrick is at the phone and
realizes he doesn't know Joel's number.  After a moment's
thought, he *69's.  The phone rings.

		JOEL'S VOICE
	Hi, it's Joel.  Please leave a message
	after the beep.

Beep.

		PATRICK
		(whisper)
	Stan, it's Patrick.  Pick up.

		STAN'S VOICE
	Hey, where are you?

		PATRICK
	I got into a situation with the old lady.
	Can you handle things tonight alone?  I'm
	really sorry, man.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Stan is on the phone.  He's really stoned and watches Mary,
stoned herself, dancing in a sexy trance to something soft
and low on the stereo.

		STAN
	I can handle it.  He's pretty much on
	auto-pilot anyway.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

		PATRICK
	Thanks, Stan.  I owe you.

Patrick hangs up, rifles quickly through his backpack.  He
pulls out a silver bracelet, puts it in his pocket, then
pulls out a journal, flips through it, keeping an eye on the
bedroom door.  The handwriting is a woman's.  He finds what
he's looking for.  He reads:

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	I took Joel to walk on Charles River with
	me last night.  It was so beautiful and
	charming.  Joel was nervous about
	stepping onto the ice, but he wanted to
	please me so much -- he's so sweet --
	that he came out after me.    We lay down
	right in the center and watched the
	stars.  He took my hand and said "I
	could...

EXT. CHARLES RIVER - NIGHT

Joel and Clementine lie together holding hands on the frozen
river.  They look up at the stars.

		JOEL
	...die right now, Clem.  I'm just...
	happy.  I've never felt that before.  I'm
	just exactly where I want to be.

Clementine looks over at him.  Her eyes are filled with love
and tears.  Then they get vague.  The scene is being erased.
Joel is panicked.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Clem, no!  This can't keep happening.
	Please!  Oh, fuck!  Please!

Crazily, Joel runs off, passing through a series of decayed
scenes: He and Clementine arguing in a car, having sex on the
beach, laughing and holding hands at a movie, eating grilled
cheese and tomato soup together in bed, Joel watching her
sleep, them drinking at a bar.  He arrives at a decayed
version of his first meeting with Mierzwiak.

		MIERZWIAK
	We can help you through this.  Why don't
	you start now by telling me everything
	you can remember about --

		JOEL
	You have to stop this!

		MIERZWIAK
	What?  What do you mean?

		JOEL
	I'm trapped in my head and everything I
	love is being erased!  Stop it now!

		MIERZWIAK
	Yes, but... I'm just something you're
	imagining.  What can I do?  I'm in your
	head, too.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Patrick reads the journal.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	... and we made love right on the ice.
	It was absolutely freezing on my ass!  It
	was wonderful.

Clementine enters, dressed for the cold.  Patrick puts the
notebook away.

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm so excited.  Yay!

		PATRICK
	I'm excited, too.  Oh, and I wanted to
	give you this.  It's a little... thing.

Patrick pulls the bracelet from his pocket, hands it to her.

		PATRICK (CONT'D)
	I didn't have a chance to wrap it.

		CLEMENTINE
	It's gorgeous.
		(slipping it on)
	Just my taste.  I've never  gone out with
	a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I
	liked.
		(kisses him)
	Thanks.  So let's get going.  Long drive.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Stan and Mary have sex on the floor next to Joel's bed.

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Joel and Clementine are hiking, Clementine in front.

		CLEMENTINE
	Such a beautiful view.

		JOEL
		(looking at her)
	Yes indeed.
		(snapping out of memory)
	Fuck!  They're erasing you, Clem!

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh?

		JOEL
	I hired them to.  We're in my brain.  But
	I want it to stop, before I wake up and
	don't know you anymore.

		CLEMENTINE
	Wow.  Um, well... can't you just force
	yourself awake?

		JOEL
	I don't know.

He concentrates.  Nothing happens.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Aaargh!  It's horrible!  I'm trapped!

He starts to have a fit, banging against trees, stomping his
feet, screaming.  But even while he's doing this the memory
and Clementine are fading around him.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - DAY

It's raining out.  Joel is reading, slouched in a chair.  He
looks over at Clementine, stretched out on her belly in her
underwear.  She's reading, too.

		VOICE-OVER
	She's so sexy.

		JOEL
	I loved you on this day.  I love this
	memory.  The rain.  Us just hanging.

Clementine looks over at him, smiles.  Her brow furrows in
thought.

		CLEMENTINE
	What if you hide me?

		JOEL
	What do you mean?

		CLEMENTINE
		(formulating)
	Well... if they're looking for me in
	memories I'm in, what if you take me to a
	memory I'm not in?
		(proud)
	And we can hide there till morning.

Joel ponders this.  The scene and Clementine are beginning to
dissolve.  Joel grabs Clementine's hand.  She giggles with
glee.  He pulls her out of the scene as it degrades.

		JOEL
	Where?  Where?  Where?

He drags her through the landscape of already decayed
memories and turns off into:

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

The kitchen is dated and vague.  Joel and Clementine are in
an oversized playpen; they're adults but small.  Joel wears
footsie pajamas with some vague little animals on them.  He
holds a a red furry huckleberry hound doll.  Clementine is
still in her panties and bra.  An oversized woman in high
heels, seen from a low angle, hurries back and forth
preparing dinner.

		CLEMENTINE
	Jesus.  What's this?

Joel looks around at the kitchen, at his doll, at the woman.

		JOEL
	I must be about two.
		(oddly)
	I want my mommy.  She's busy.  She's not
	looking at me.
		(back to himself, re: doll)
	Look, my Huckleberry Hound doll!  I told
	you about this!
		(beat)
	I want my mommy!

He starts to cry.  Clementine tries to comfort him.  She hugs
him.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
		(crying still)
	I want my mommy.
		(adult, to Clementine)
	I don't want to lose you, Clem.

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm right here.

		JOEL
	I'm scared.  I want my mommy.  I don't
	want to lose you.  I don't want to
	lose...

		CLEMENTINE
	Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading.
	The memory.  I think we're hidden.

Joel sucks in some snot.  His mother scurries back and forth
clanging pots.  The room is not decaying.  Joel smiles.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Stan and Mary lie on the floor, their stoned minds wandering
after sex.  Stan suddenly perks up.  He looks at the monitor.

		STAN
	It's stopped.

		MARY
	What?

		STAN
	Listen, it's not erasing.

He makes his way, naked, to the computer screen.

		STAN (CONT'D)
	It's not erasing.  He's off the screen.

		MARY
	Where?

		STAN
	I don't know.  He's not on the map.

Stan tries to break through his marijuana haze.  He fiddles
nervously with the equipment.

		STAN (CONT'D)
	I don't know what to do!  I don't know
	what to do!  Crap.  Crap...

		MARY
	Well, what should we do?

		STAN
	I don't know!  I just said that!

		MARY
	Sor-ry
		(beat)
	We have to do something.  He can't wake
	up half done.

		STAN
	Shit!

He jerks the joystick spastically.  Mary, also naked, gets up
and looks over his shoulder at the screen.

		MARY
		(definitely)
	We should call Howard.

Stan turns and looks at her.  He's stoned and trying to
understand her motivation.

		STAN
	No way.  I can handle this.

		MARY
	This guy's only half cooked.  There's no
	time to fuck around, Stan.

Stan tries to think.  He paces.  Mary watches him.  Finally:

		STAN
		(without making eye contact)
	Okay.

He dials the phone, waits.

		STAN (CONT'D)
	Hello, Howard?

INT. MIERZWIAK'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

The room is dark.  A groggy Mierzwiak is in bed on the phone.
His wife lies beside him, eyes open, listening.

		MIERZWIAK
	Stan?  What's going on?

		STAN'S VOICE
	The guy we're doing?  He's disappeared
	from the map.  I can't find him anywhere.

		MIERZWIAK
	Okay, what happened right before he
	disappeared?

		STAN'S VOICE
	I was away from the monitor for a second.
	I had it on automatic.  I had to go pee.

		MIERZWIAK
	Well, where was Patrick?

		STAN'S VOICE
	He went home sick.

		MIERZWIAK
	Jesus.  All right, what's the address.

		STAN'S VOICE
	1062 Sherman Drive.  Apartment 1E,
	Rockville Center.

Mierzwiak writes it down on a bedside not pad.  He hangs up.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Stan hangs up the phone, looks at Mary.

		MARY
	He's coming?

		STAN
	You better go.

		MARY
	Hell no.

She starts getting dressed.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	Shit, I'm so stoned.  I don't want him to
	see me stoned.  Stop being stoned, Mary!

She hurries into the bathroom with her bag.

		MARY (CONT'D) (O.S.) (CONT'D)
	God, I look like shit!  God!

Mary slams the bathroom door.  Stan puts his head in his
hands.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Joel and Clementine are in the playpen.  Joel's oversized
mother reaches down as she hurries by and pats Joel on the
head.

		MOTHER
	How's my baby boy?

She's gone.

		JOEL
	I really want her to pick me up.  It's
	weird how strong that desire is.

Clementine holds his hand.  He looks over at her.

		CLEMENTINE
	You know, we're okay.  They're not
	finding us.  You'll remember me in the
	morning.  And you'll come to me and tell
	me about us and we'll start over.

		JOEL
	I loved you so much this day.  On my bed
	in your panties.  I remember I thought,
	how impossibly lucky am I to have you on
	my bed in your panties.

She kisses him.

		CLEMENTINE
	You remember what happened next?

		JOEL
	I came over to the bed and you smelled so
	good, like you just woke up, slightly
	sweaty.  And I climbed on the bed with
	you and you said something like --

		CLEMENTINE
	-- another rainy day.  Whatever shall we
	do?

He laughs.  She unbuttons his pajamas.  They begin to make
love.  Joel's mother hurries around the kitchen.  Joel stops,
looks at Clementine.

		JOEL
	There's this guy!

		CLEMENTINE
	What?

		JOEL
	There's this guy.  I heard him talking in
	my apartment.  He's one of the eraser
	guys.  And he fell for you when they were
	erasing you, so he introduced himself the
	next day as if he were a stranger and now
	you're dating him.

		CLEMENTINE
	Really?  Is he cute?

		JOEL
	He stole a pair of your panties while you
	were being erased!

		CLEMENTINE
	Gross! You must remember to tell me this
	in the morning.  I'm, like, so freaked
	out now.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S CAR - NIGHT

It's a rust bucket.  Clementine drives through the snow.
She's crying and holding Patrick's hand.

		CLEMENTINE
	What's wrong with me?

		PATRICK
	Nothing is wrong with you.  You're the
	most wonderful person I've ever met.

She glances gratefully over at him then starts to cry even
harder.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Stan works on trying to get the signal back.  His hair is
combed and he's dressed neatly, looking professional but
still stoned.  Mary is pacing nervously to and from the
window, looking out into the night.  She's dressed also, and
she's wearing more make-up now.  Her hair is pulled up into
some sort of style.  Suddenly she freezes at the window.

		MARY
	There he is.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Do
	I look okay?

She doesn't say anything.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	I'm still stoned.  Are you?  Crap.

She looks in the mirror.

		MARY (CONT'D)
		(to Joel)
	Your Visine didn't do shit, fella.

The doorbell buzzes.  Mary lunges for the door, then calms
herself before opening it.  Mierzwiak, holding an equipment
bag, looks surprised.

		MIERZWIAK
	Mary.  What are you doing here?

		STAN
	She came to help, Howard.

		MARY
	I wanted to learn as much about the
	procedure as possible, Howard.  I think
	it's important for my job...to help
	comfort the clientele.  You know.

Mierzwiak looks from Mary to Stan, nods, and enters.  Mary
closes the door.  Mierzwiak crosses to the equipment.

		MIERZWIAK
	Let's get to the bottom of this.  Shall
	we?

He sits down in front of the computer and does some fiddling.

		MIERZWIAK (CONT'D)
	Odd.

He fiddles some more.  Mary looks on, fascinated.

		STAN
	I tried that already.

		MIERZWIAK
	Did you try going through C-Gate?

		STAN
	Yeah.  Of course.

Mierzwiak ponders.  He unzips his equipment bag, pulls out
another laptop computer and plugs it in to the system.

		MIERZWIAK
	I'm going to do a Spectrum search
	throughout his memory, see if anything
	comes up.

Mierzwiak presses some more buttons.  The program starts up.
A much more complex and detailed human brain appears on this
screen.  It rotates.  Eventually Mierzwiak sees a small
distant light in the brain.  He zeroes in on it.

		MIERZWIAK (CONT'D)
	Okay, here it is.  I don't know why it's
	off the map like that, but --

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Joel is being bathed in the oversized sink by his oversized
mother.  Clementine sits in the water with him, laughing.
The mother doesn't seem to see her.

		MOTHER
	Little baby getting awwwl cleean.  Awl
	clean.

		JOEL
		(to Clementine)
	I love getting bathed in the sink.  It's
	such a feeling of security.

		CLEMENTINE
		(giggling)
	I've never seen you happier.

The elements of the scene flash explosively away:  Joel's
mother, his Huckleberry Hound doll, the details of the
kitchen, Clementine.   Joel is thrown into:

INT. CAR - NIGHT

He sits with Clementine in the parked car, outside a drive-in
movie theater.  The movie on the giant screen is partially
obscured by a fence.  Joel and Clementine drink wine.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Mierzwiak looks up from the computer screen.

		MIERZWIAK
	Okay, we're back in.

		MARY
	That was beautiful to watch, Howard.
	Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.

		MIERZWIAK
	Well, thank you, Mary.

		STAN
		(sighing)
	You get some sleep, Howard.  I'll take it
	from here.

		MIERZWIAK
	Yeah, probably a good idea.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

Clementine and Joel laugh as they try to give voice to what
the characters on the screen are saying.

		CLEMENTINE
	But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.

		JOEL
	Don't call me Antoine.  My name is Wally.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.

She starts to fade.  The scene starts to fade.  Joel
remembers their previous plan.

		JOEL
	They found us before.  The plan didn't
	work.  I don't know what to do now.

		CLEMENTINE
		(mouthing to woman on screen)
	Hide me somewhere deeper?  Somewhere
	buried?

Joel grabs her.  They run off just as the scene decays into a
husk behind them.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Stan is back at the controls.  Mierzwiak's at the door with
Mary.

		STAN
	Howard, they've disappeared again.

		MIERZWIAK
	Oh dear.

		MARY
	I'm so sorry, Howard, you must be tired.

He nods, distractedly.  She smiles to herself as he heads
back to the equipment.

EXT. SCHOOLYARD - AFTERNOON

Joel, now the size of a junior high school kid and dressed
accordingly, is peering around the corner of the school
building toward the bike rack.  Clementine is with him,
dressed as she was in the parked car.

		CLEMENTINE
	Look at you, cutey!  What are we doing?

		JOEL
	This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the
	shit out of me.

		VOICE-OVER
	I'm terrified.  I thought if I hung
	around the art room long enough, he'd go
	home and I could get my bike.

They head toward the bike rack.  Joel's is the only bike
remaining.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Poor Joel.

They're at the bike rack and a bunch of kids, including
giant, fat Joe Early come around the corner.

		JOE EARLY
	Hi, Jill.

		JOEL
	He calls me Jill.  Everyone calls me Jill
	after this.

The other kids laughs.

		JOEL
	Just shut up, Joe.  I'm going home.

		JOE EARLY
	I don't think so.  We're fighting.

		JOEL
	I don't want to fight you.

The kids start chanting, "fight, fight, fight..."  Joe Early
throws a wild punch that hits Joel in the side.  joel falls
and stays down, covering himself.

		JOE EARLY
	C'mon, Jill.  Get up, faggot.  C'mon.

Joel doesn't say anything.  He peeks humiliated at
Clementine.  She's watching him.  She's got a tear in her
eye.  She kneels down beside him, puts her arm around him.

		JOEL
	I'm too scared to even throw a punch.
	When I tell people this story I leave
	that part out.

The scene flashes violently to white and is gone.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Mierzwiak is at the machine.

		MIERZWIAK
	We got him back.  Stan, I think I'm just
	going to have to get through this
	manually.  We're running late.

EXT. BEACH - DAY

It's cold.  Joel and Clementine walk, all bundled up.  She
points at a house up the beach.

		CLEMENTINE
	Our house!  Our house!

She runs ahead, laughing.  The scene is decaying.  Joel
chases after her.

		JOEL
	Clem, c'mon, we've got to hide you.
	Remember?

He grabs her arm and yanks and they are in:

INT. BOY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

It's dark.  Joel, junior high school size, is in bed
masturbating.  Clementine is in there, too, in her winter
coat, still laughing from before.  She realizes what's going
on.

		CLEMENTINE
		(mock offended)
	Joel!

		JOEL
		(continuing to masturbate)
	I don't like it either, but I'm just
	trying to find horrible secret place to --

Joel's mother pops her head in the door.

		MOTHER
	Joel, I was just --
		(sees what's going on)
	Oh.  Um... I'll ask you in the morning,
	honey.  Have a good night.

The mother backs out, closes the door.  Joel cringes.
Clementine laughs, still in the mode of the memory she was
swiped from.  Flash!  It's all gone.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Joel and Clementine are laughing as she blows out the candle
on a slice of cheesecake in front of her.  Joel hands her a
small wrapped box.

		JOEL
	Happy Birthday.

		CLEMENTINE
		(unwrapping the gift)
	Thanks, Joely.  A present!  Oh boy!

She pulls out the bracelet.  It's the same bracelet Patrick
gave her.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Oh, Joel.  It's beautiful!
		(slip it on)
	I mean, you're the first guy who ever
	bought me a piece of jewelry I could
	honestly say that about.

He notices she's starting to fade.

		JOEL
	I scoured the city for it.

		CLEMENTINE
	I love it!

She leans across the table to kiss him.  He grabs her and
runs through the decaying scene and into the vague night.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

Joel is one of a group of five year olds.  He holds a hammer
and is poised to hit a dead bird in a red wagon.  The other
boys are goading him.

		BOYS
	C'mon, Joel, you have to.  Do it already.

Joel doesn't want to.  Clementine watches.

		JOEL
	I can't.  I have to go home.  I'll do it
	later.

		VOICE-OVER
	I didn't want to do this.  But I had to
	or they would've called me a girl.

Joel miserably smashes the bird repeatedly with the hammer.
Red jelly guts cover the hammer and the wagon bottom.  The
kids hoot.

		VOICE-OVER
	I can't believe I did that.  I'm so
	ashamed.

A live bird watches from a tree.  Clementine, still dressed
for her birthday dinner (wearing her new bracelet), pulls
Joel away from the other boys.  The two of them walk down
Joel's suburban street.

		CLEMENTINE
	It's okay.  You were a little kid.
		(beat)
	This is a great birthday present.
	Getting to see you as a boy.

She kisses him and they walk holding hands.

		JOEL
		(pointing)
	That's where I live.  Lived.

Joel looks down at her hand.  It's fading.  The bracelet is
gone.  Clementine is gone.  His childhood house is gone.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Mierzwiak works the equipment.  He has located a small area
of light in the brain imaging and eradicates them.

		MIERZWIAK
	I'm getting the hang of it.  I still
	understand it.  But I'm finding him
	quickly enough.  I'm hopeful there won't
	be too much peripheral eradication.

Mary sits on the bed.

		MARY
		(a little giggly)
	I like watching you work.

Stan sighs, grabs his coat.

		STAN
	I'll go out for a smoke.  If no one
	minds.

		MIERZWIAK
		(not looking up)
	That's fine, Stan.

Mary doesn't say anything.  Stan huffs and is out the door.
Mierzwiak continues to find and erase points of light.  Mary
gets up her courage to speak.

		MARY
	Do you like quotes, Howard?

		MIERZWIAK
	How do you mean?

		MARY
	Oh, um, like famous quotes.  I find
	reading them inspirational to me.  And in
	my reading I've come across some I
	thought you might like, too.

		MIERZWIAK
	Oh.  Well, I'd love to hear some.

Mary is thrilled, beside herself.  She tries to calm down.

		MARY
	Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed
	are the forgetful, for they get the
	better even of their blunders."

		MIERZWIAK
	Is that Nietzsche?

		MARY
	Yeah, yeah it is, Howard.  And here I was
	thinking I could tell you something you
	didn't know.

		MIERZWIAK
	It's a good quote, Mary.  I'm glad we
	both know it.

He smiles at her.  She's flustered, flattered.

		MARY
		(sputtering)
	There's another one I like, I read.  It's
	by Pope Alexander.

		MIERZWIAK
	Alexander Pope?

		MARY
	Yes, shit.  Oops, sorry!
		(puts hand over mouth)
	Sorry.  It's just I told myself I wasn't
	going to say Pope Alexander and sound
	like a dope and then I go ahead and do
	it.  Like I psyched myself out.

		MIERZWIAK
	It's no big deal.

		MARY
	You are such a sweetheart.

There's an embarrassed moment as that line hangs in the air.
Then Mary plunges ahead to bury it.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	Anyway, the quote goes "How happy is the
	blameless Vestal's lot!  The world
	forgetting, by the world forgot: Eternal
	sunshine of the spotless mind!  Each
	prayer accepted, and each wish resign'd".

She smiles, proud and embarrassed.

		MIERZWIAK
	That's lovely.

		MARY
	Really?  I thought it was appropriate
	maybe.  That's all.
		(beat, then quickly)
	I really admire the work that you do.  I
	know it's not proper to be so familiar
	but I guess since we're outside the
	workplace I feel a certain liberty to --

		MIERZWIAK
	It's fine, Mary.  I'm happy to hear it.

		MARY
	Okay.  Good.  Great.  Thanks.
		(blurting)
	I like you, Howard... an awful lot.  Is
	that terrible?

Mierzwiak seems momentarily taken aback, then returns to his
unflappable self.

		MIERZWIAK
	You're a wonderful girl, Mary.

She leans over and kisses him, then pulls away quickly.

		MARY
	I've loved you for a very long time.  I'm
	sorry!  I shouldn't have said that.

		MIERZWIAK
	I've got a wife, Mary.  Kids.  You know
	that.

		MARY
		(suddenly weepy)
	I wish I was your wife.  I wish I had
	your kids.

Mierzwiak comforts her with a hug.  It turns into kiss.  He
pulls away.

		MIERZWIAK
	We can't do this.

		MARY
	No you're right.  Once again.  You're a
	decent man, Howard.

He smiles sadly at her.  She smiles courageously at him.

		MIERZWIAK
	I want you to know it's not because I'm
	not interested.  If that means anything.

They look at each other a long while, then Howard goes back
to locating and eradicating blips of lights.

EXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Stan sits in the van and smokes a cigarette.  He has an
unobstructed view into Joel's bedroom window.  He watches
Mierzwiak and Mary.  They're talking as Howard works.  It
appears to be a very serious discussion.  A car pulls up
outside.  Stan turns to see.  A middle-aged woman gets out,
checks the address on Joel's building, approaches the only
lit window, watches Mierzwiak and Mary inside.  Mierzwiak's
resolve has apparently weakened and he and Mary kiss again.
This time it leads to groping, partial undressing, and
falling onto the bed alongside the unconscious Joel.  The
woman in the window is transfixed.  As Mierzwiak fumbles to
unzip his pants, he catches sight of the woman in the window.
He practically shrieks and jumps up.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

Joel and Clementine walking, hand-in-hand, look up
simultaneously.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Mary looks confusedly at Howard.

		MARY
	What?

She follows his eyes and sees the woman in the window, who
turns and walks off in a huff.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	Oh my God!

Mierzwiak is already in his coat.  He's out the door.

EXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

The woman is at her car.  Stan watches from the van.
Mierzwiak is hurrying to the woman.

		MIERZWIAK
	Hollis!  Hollis!

		HOLLIS (THE MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN)
	I knew it, Howard.  I don't even know why
	I bothered to copy the damn address.

		MIERZWIAK
	It didn't start out to be this.  I came
	here to work.  It's a one-time mistake.

Mary is right behind Mierzwiak now.  Hollis is in her car.

		MARY
		(heroically)
	Mrs. Mierzwiak, it's true.  And it's not
	Mr. Mierzwiak's fault.  I'm a stupid
	little girl with a stupid little crush.
	I basically forced him into it.  I swear.

Hollis turns, looks at Mary and then at Mierzwiak.

		HOLLIS
	Don't be a monster, Howard.  Tell the
	girl.

Stan is out of the van now, listening.  Mary shivers in the
cold, hugs herself.  There's a long silence.  Then:

		MARY
	Tell me what?

Hollis and Mierzwiak have locked eyes.  Mary looks back and
forth between them.  Hollis starts her car.

		HOLLIS
	Poor kid.  You can have him.  You did.

She drives off.  Mary watches Howard with increased
foreboding.

		MARY
	What, Howard?

		MIERZWIAK
	We... have a history.  I'm sorry.  You
	wanted the procedure.  You wanted it
	done... to get past.  I have to finish in
	there.  It's almost morning.  We'll talk
	later.

He shuffles inside.  Mary stands there, unable to digest
this, struggling in vain to remember.  Stan watches.

		STAN
	Let me take you home.

Mary shakes her head "no."  She walks off, dazed.

EXT. CHARLES RIVER - NIGHT

Clementine and Patrick lie on their backs on the frozen river
and look up at the night sky.

		PATRICK
	I could die right now, Clem.  I'm just
	happy.  I've never felt that before.  I'm
	just exactly where I want to be.

Clementine looks over at him.  Their eyes meet.  She sobs.

		CLEMENTINE
	I want to go home.

She hurries toward the shore, slips on the ice, gets up, and
continues, now running.

INT. COMMUTER TRAIN - NIGHT

Mary, in shock, sits in the empty fluorescent car.  She tries
to look out the window but can only see her own reflection.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

It's deathly silent as Mierzwiak and Stan work on completing
the job.  Mierzwiak locates a light hidden very deep in the
map of Joel's brain.  He targets it.

EXT. ROWBOAT - DAY

Joel, the size of a ten year old, sits fishing with his
oversized father.  Clementine is naked and in the boat, too.
She's reading The Play by Stephen Dixon.

		CLEMENTINE
	I love this book, Joel.  Thank you so
	much for telling me about it.

Joel is his father.  The father is drunk and sullen.  He
faces away from Joel, looks out at the lake.

		FATHER
	Don't be like me, son.  Don't waste your
	life.  You'll come to a point someday
	where it'll be too late.  You'll be sewn
	into your fate...

		JOEL
	It was horrifying, seeing my father like
	that.
	There was no hope for me if his life was
	such a failure.  And he saw failure in
	me, too, written in my future.

Clementine watches the frightened, confused Joel.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Joel, you're not sewn in.  He's wrong.

		FATHER
	...and there'll be nowhere to go except
	where you're headed, like a train on a
	track.  Inevitable, unalterable.

The scene poops out of existence with a flash of light.

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Joel finds himself eating Chinese food and sitting across
from Clementine.  He is ragged and jarred.

		JOEL
	I'm done, Clem.  I'm just going to ride
	it out.  Hiding is clearly not working.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah.

		JOEL
	I want to enjoy my little time left with
	you.

		CLEMENTINE
	This is our first "date" date.

		JOEL
	Do you remember what we talked about?

		CLEMENTINE
	Naomi, I guess.

		JOEL
	Yeah.

		CLEMENTINE
	What was I wearing?

		JOEL
	God, I should know.  Your hair was red.
	I remember it matched the wallpaper.

		CLEMENTINE
	Egad, were you horrified?

		JOEL
	No!  I think you were wearing that black
	dress, y'know, with the buttons.

She is wearing the black dress.

		CLEMENTINE
	No, you were with me when I bought that.
	At that place on East 6th.  It was later.

INT. DRESS SHOP - SHOP

The scene has already been erased.  It's just a decayed husk.
A vague Joel watches a vague Clementine model a black dress.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Clementine wears a generic black dress now.

		JOEL
	Right.  Something black though.

		CLEMENTINE
	I'll buy that.  Black's always good.

		JOEL
	We did talk about Naomi.

		CLEMENTINE
	I said: Are you sure?  You seem unsure.

		JOEL
	I'm sure, I said.

		CLEMENTINE
	But you weren't.  I could tell.

		JOEL
	I was so nervous.  I remember I couldn't
	think of anything to say.  There were
	long silences.

There is a long silence.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	I thought I was foolish.  I thought I'd
	mistaken infatuation for love.  You said:

		CLEMENTINE
	So what.  Infatuation is good, too.

		JOEL
	And I didn't have an argument.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

Joel and Clementine pull up to Clementine's house.

		JOEL
	I dropped you off after.  You said --

		CLEMENTINE
		(Mae West)
	Come up and see me... now.

		JOEL
	It's very late.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yes, exactly.  Exactly my point.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel and Clementine are in the midst of awkward shy sex.

		JOEL
	This was our first time.

The scene starts to fade.  Joel watches Clementine disappear.

INT. LACUNA RECEPTION AREA - NIGHT

Mary enters the dark room, frazzled.  She flips on the
fluorescent lights and searches the file folders, finds one
with her name on it.  Her jaw drops.  With a shaky hand, she
puts the tape into the player on her desk and presses "play."

		MIERZWIAK VOICE
	Okay, so just tell me what you remember.
	And we'll take it from there.

		MARY'S VOICE
		(shaky)
	Um, I liked you immediately.  At the job
	interview.  You seemed so... important
	and mature.  And I loved that you were
	helping all these people.  You didn't
	come on to me at all.  I liked that.  I
	was tongue-tied around you at first.  I
	wanted you to think I was smart.  You
	were so nice.  I loved the way you
	smelled.  I couldn't wait to come to
	work.  I had these fantasies of us being
	married and having kids and just...
		(starts to cry)
	...and so... then... when...
	that one day, when I thought you looked
	at me back... like... Oh, Howie, I can't
	do this?  How can I do this?

		MIERZWIAK VOICE
	It's what's best, Mary.  You know that.

Mary slumps to the floor.  We move into her eyes.

		MARY'S VOICE
	Yeah, I know.  Oh, God.  Okay, well, I
	was so excited...

A SERIES OF MURKY IMAGES.  NO DETAIL.

A flirtatious look from Mierzwiak.

		MARY'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	...Remember you bought me that little
	wind-up frog?

A vague shot of a wind-up frog.

		MARY'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	And you said...

A vague shot of Mierzwiak mouthing to Mary's voice.

		MARY'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	"This is for your desk.  Just a little
	token"

Back to Mary sitting on the floor, listening to the tape.

		MARY'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	I knew then... I knew something was going
	to happen... something wonderful.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel sits in the quiet living room.  The scene is fading.

		JOEL
	Naomi.

		VOICE-OVER
	On the couch.  Dark.  Quiet.  I wondered
	if I had made a terrible mistake.  I
	almost reached for the phone about a
	thousand times.  I thought I could take
	it back, erase it, explain I had
	momentarily lost my mind. Then I told
	myself we weren't happy.  That was the
	truth.  That what we were was safe.
	It was unfair to you and to me to stay in
	a relationship for that reason.  I
	thought about Clementine and the spark
	when I was with her, but then I thought
	what you and I had was real and adult and
	therefore significant even if it wasn't
	much fun.   But I wanted fun.  I saw
	other people having fun and I wanted it.
	Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one
	is really having fun; I'm being suckered
	by advertising and movie bullshit... then
	I thought maybe not, maybe not.  And then
	I thought, as I always do at this point
	in my argument, about dying.

INT. ROOM - DAY

An elderly man sits.

		VOICE-OVER
	I projected myself to the end of my life
	in some vague rendition of my old man
	self.  I imagined looking back with a
	tremendous hole of regret in my heart.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel sits.

		VOICE-OVER
	I didn't pick up the phone to call you,
	Naomi.  I didn't pick up the phone.

The scene dissolves.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - DAY

Namoi is red-eyed from crying.  She is packing things in
boxes.  Joel paces, steals glances at her, doesn't know what
to say.  She holds up a book.  The scene starts to fade.

		NAOMI
	Yours?

		JOEL
	You take it.  I don't know.

She tosses it in a box.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Naomi, I really value our relationship.
	I hope it's possible for us to stay in
	touch.

		NAOMI
	Don't do this to me now, Joel.  Really.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - DAY

Joel watches out the window as Naomi stuffs a final box in
the trunk of a car.  There's another woman down there with
her.  They get into the car and drive off.

INT. BORDER'S BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

Joel talks to Clementine.  The scene is fogging over.

		JOEL
	I told her today I need to end it.

		CLEMENTINE
	Is that what you want?

		JOEL
	I did it.  I guess that means something.

Clementine shrugs.  The scene fades.

EXT. PARK - DAY

Joel walks with Naomi.

		NAOMI
	So what's going on, Joel?

		JOEL
	I don't know, I've just been thinking,
	maybe we're not happy with each other.

		NAOMI
	What?

		JOEL
	Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort
	of, unhappy with each other and --

		NAOMI
	Don't say "we" when you mean "you."

		JOEL
	I think maybe, we're both so used to
	operating at this level that -- How can
	one person be unhappy?  If one person is
	unhappy, both have to be... by
	definition.

		NAOMI
	Bullshit.  Who is it?  You met someone.

		JOEL
	No.  I just need some space, maybe.

		NAOMI
	The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you
	think you have with this chick, once the
	thrill wears off, you're just going to be
	Joel with the same fucking problems.

		JOEL
	It's not somebody else.

		VOICE-OVER
	I hate myself.

Naomi walks off.  Joel watches her.  The scene fades.

INT. BORDER'S BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

Joel enters, looks around.  There's no sign of Clementine.
Joel approaches a male employee.

		JOEL
	Is there a Clementine who works here?

		MALE EMPLOYEE #1
		(calling to another male
		 employee)
	Mark, is Clem on tonight?

		MALE EMPLOYEE #2
	On my dick, bro.
		(turns, sese Joel, embarrassed)
	Oh, hey.  Yeah, I think she's upstairs in
	Philosophy.

Joel climbs stairs, searches the aisle, spots Clementine.

		JOEL
	Hi.

She turns.

		CLEMENTINE
	I didn't think you'd show your face
	around me again.  I figured you were
	humiliated.  You did run away, after all.

		JOEL
	Sorry to track you down like this.  I'm
	not a stalker.  But I needed to see you.

		CLEMENTINE
		(seemingly uninterested)
	Yeah?

		JOEL
	I'd like to... take you out or something.

		CLEMENTINE
	Well, you're married.

		JOEL
	Not yet.  Not married.

		CLEMENTINE
	Look, man, I'm telling you right off the
	bat, I'm high maintenance.  So I'm not
	going to tiptoe around your marriage or
	whatever it is you got going there.  If
	you want to be with me, you're with me.

		JOEL
	Okay.

		CLEMENTINE
	So make your domestic decisions and maybe
	we'll talk again.

She goes back to stacking.  Joel stands there helplessly.

		JOEL
	I just think that you have some kind
	of... quality that seems really important
	to me.

The scene is disintegrating.  Clementine's speech is
delivered without passion.

		CLEMENTINE
	Joel, I'm not a concept.  I want you to
	just keep that in your head.  Too many
	guys think I'm a concept or I complete
	them or I'm going to make them alive, but
	I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking
	for my own peace of mind.  Don't assign
	me yours.

		JOEL
	I remember that speech really well.

		CLEMENTINE
		(smiling)
	I had you pegged, didn't I?

		JOEL
	You had the whole human race pegged.

		CLEMENTINE
	Probably.

		JOEL
	I still thought you were going to save
	me.  Even after that.

		CLEMENTINE
	I know.

		JOEL
	It would be different, if we could just
	give it another go around.

		CLEMENTINE
	Remember me.  Try your best.  Maybe we
	can.

The scene is gone.

INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S CAR - NIGHT

Joel sits forlornly in the back seat.  Rob drives and Carrie
sits in the front passenger seat.  The car stops in front of
Joel's apartment building.

		JOEL
	Thanks, guys.

		CARRIE
	I hope you feel better, sweetie.

		JOEL
	Yeah.

		CARRIE
	Say hi to Naomi.

The car door closes.

INT. BUILDING STAIRWAY - NIGHT

Joel climbs the stairs.

		VOICE-OVER
	I hope she's not up.  I need to think.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The lights are off.  Joel sits on a chair near the window,
writing in his journal.  The streetlight illuminates the
paper.  Naomi sleeps in the bed.

		VOICE-OVER
	I met someone tonight at a party on the
	beach.  Her name is Clementine.  There is
	something alive about her.

Naomi turns over in bed, sees Joel.

		NAOMI
		(full of sleep)
	Hi.

		JOEL
	Hi.

		NAOMI
	How was it?

		JOEL
	You didn't miss much.  Rob Carrie say
	hello.

		NAOMI
	Hi, Rob and Carrie.

		JOEL
	Go back to sleep.

The room is starting to decompose.

		NAOMI
	Yeah.  Come to bed.  I'm cold.

		JOEL
	In a minute.

Naomi turns over.  Joel goes back to his writing.

		VOICE-OVER
		(more and more emotionless)
	I don't know what to do about this.  I've
	been feeling so alienated and numb
	lately.  Forever.  The thought of not
	acknowledging my feelings again seems
	self-destructive.
	How can I continue on this path toward a
	living death, a life filled with
	obligation and guilt and responsibility
	but joyless, hopeless?  I need to speak
	with Clementine.

The scene has turned to a husk.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

Joel is at his closet, putting on a sweater.  Naomi is at the
dining room table, papers spread out before her, writing.
Joel turns and watches her for a moment.

		JOEL
	So you don't mind?

		NAOMI
	I've got to finish this chapter anyway.

The scene is fading.

		JOEL
	Okay.  I wish you could come.

		VOICE-OVER
	This is it.  The night we met.  My God,
	it's over.

		NAOMI (CONT'D)
	Me, too.

He approaches Naomi, kisses her on the top of the head.  She
continues to write.

		NAOMI (CONT'D)
	Say hi to Rob and Carrie.  Have some fun!

		JOEL
	I hope you get your work done.

		NAOMI
		(sighing)
	Yeah.

INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S CAR - NIGHT

Rob drives.  Carrie fiddles with the radio dial in the front
passenger seat.  Joel sits in the back.

		CARRIE
	I'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it.  You
	okay?  You seem quiet.

		JOEL
	Just a little overworked, maybe.

		VOICE-OVER
	The trip to the party where I met
	Clementine.  My first memory of her is
	now my last memory of her.

Joel looks out the window.  Carrie turns around and says
something to Joel.  She is backlit, her hair a halo of frizz.

		JOEL
	I remember you turned around.  Your face
	was dark and your hair was backlit -- I
	could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me
	if things were okay between Naomi and me.

		CARRIE
	I did.  You said, things were fine.

		JOEL
	I remember.

		CARRIE
	This is the night you met Clementine,
	Joel.  I remember watching you walk down
	the beach with her and I thought, oh
	shit.

		JOEL
	Yeah, you told me that later.

		CARRIE
	I told you that later.

Joel looks out he window.  He sees the husk of a memory on
the darkened roadside.  It's Joel and Carrie in:

INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S KITCHEN - DAY

Faded.  Carrie and Joel sit at the table with coffee.

		CARRIE
	Who was the girl you walked off with?

		JOEL
	No one.

EXT. BEACH PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Rob, Carrie, and Joel emerge from the car, parked amidst a
small cluster of cars in an otherwise empty parking lot.

EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

Joel watches his shoes in the sand as he trudges along.

		CARRIE
	Is this the right way?

EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

Joel, Rob, and Carrie step out of the brush and see a bonfire
down the beach.  People and music can be heard.

EXT. BEACH - LATER

Joel sits on a log, a paper plate of chicken and corn on his
lap.  People warm themselves at the fire.  Joel watches
couples talking, kissing, Rob sharing a joint with a guy.

		JOEL
	You were down by the surf.  I could just
	make you out in the dark.

Joel looks down to the water.  There's Clementine, in her
orange hooded sweatshirt, looking out to sea.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Your back to me.  In that orange
	sweatshirt I would come to know so well
	and even hate eventually.  At the time I
	thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.

		VOICE-OVER
	I remember being drawn to you even then.
	I thought, I love this woman because
	she's alone down there looking out at the
	black ocean.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	But I went back to my food.  The next
	thing I remember, I felt someone sitting
	next to me and I saw the orange sleeve
	out of the corner of my eye.

A shot of the orange sleeve.  Joel looks up.

		CLEMENTINE
	Hi there.

		JOEL
	Hi.

		VOICE-OVER
	I was so nervous.  What were you doing
	there, I wondered.  Your hair was lime
	green.  Green revolution.

A shot of her green hair.

		JOEL
	You said...

		CLEMENTINE
	I saw you sitting over here.  By
	yourself.  I thought, thank God, someone
	normal, who doesn't know how interact at
	these things either.

		JOEL
	Yeah.  I don't ever know what to say.

		CLEMENTINE
	I can't tell you how happy I am to hear
	that.  I mean, I don't mean I'm happy
	you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm
	such a loser.  Every time I come to a
	party I tell myself I'm going to be
	different and it's always exactly the
	same and then I hate myself after for
	being such a clod.

		JOEL
	Even then I didn't believe you entirely.
	I thought how could you be talking to me
	if you couldn't talk to people?

		VOICE-OVER
	But I thought, I don't know, I thought it
	was cool that you were sensitive enough
	to know what I was feeling and that you
	were attracted to it.

		CLEMENTINE
	But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal
	ones, y'know?  I mean, what kind of
	people do well at this stuff?

		VOICE-OVER
	And I just liked you so much.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	You did?  You liked me?

		JOEL
	You know what I did.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah, I know.  I'm fishing.

		JOEL
	You said --

She picks a drumstick off of Joel's plate.

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm Clementine.  Can I borrow a piece of
	your chicken?

		JOEL
	And you picked it out of my plate before
	I could answer and it felt so intimate
	like we were already lovers.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	I remember --

		VOICE-OVER
	The grease on your chin in the bonfire
	light.

Shot of a smudge of chicken grease on Clementine's chin.

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh God, how horrid.

		JOEL
	I'm Joel.

		VOICE-OVER
	No, it was lovely.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Hi, Joel.  So no jokes about my name?

		JOEL
	You mean, like...
		(singing)
	Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my
	darlin', Clementine... ?  Huckleberry
	Hound?  That sort of thing?

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah, like that.

		JOEL
	Nope.  No jokes.  My favorite thing when
	I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound
	doll.  I think your name is magic.

She smiles.

		CLEMENTINE
		(eyes welling)
	This is it, Joel.  It's gonna be gone
	soon.

		JOEL
	I know.

		CLEMENTINE
	What do we do?

		JOEL
	Enjoy it.  Say good-bye.

She nods.

Joel and Clementine are walking near the surf.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	So you're still on the Zoloft?

		VOICE-OVER
	Next thing I remember we were walking
	down near the surf.

		CLEMENTINE
	No, I stopped.  I didn't want to feel
	like I was being artificially modulated.

		JOEL
	I know what you mean.  That's why I
	stopped.

		CLEMENTINE
	But my sleeping is really fucked up.

		JOEL
	I don't think I've slept in a year.

		CLEMENTINE
	You should try Xanax.  I mean, it's a
	chemical and all, but it works... and it
	works just having it around, knowing that
	it's there.  Like insurance.

		JOEL
	yeah?

		CLEMENTINE
	I'll give you a couple.  See what you
	think.

		JOEL
	Okay.

		CLEMENTINE
	Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?

		JOEL
	I love her.

		CLEMENTINE
	Really?  Me, too!  I don't meet people
	who even know who she is and I work in a
	book store.

		JOEL
	I think she's great.

		CLEMENTINE
	Me too.  There's this poem --

		JOEL
	Did this conversation come before or
	after we saw the house?

		CLEMENTINE
	I think, before.

		JOEL
	Seems too coincidental that way.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah, maybe.

Joel and Clementine wander near some beach houses closed for
the winter.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside
	gusts of wind,/And a house in which we
	don't live...

		JOEL
	Yeah, yeah.  It goes "Perhaps there is
	someone in this world to whom I could
	send all these lines"?

		CLEMENTINE
	Yes!  I love that poem.  It breaks my
	heart.  I'm so excited you know it.
		(pointing to houses)
	Look, houses in which we don't live.

Joel chuckles appreciatively.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	I wish we did.  You married?

		JOEL
	Um, no.

		CLEMENTINE
	Let's move into this neighborhood.

Clementine tries one of the doors on a darkened house.  Joel
is nervous.

		JOEL
	I do sort of live with somebody though.

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh.

She walks to the next house, tries the door.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Male or female?

		JOEL
	Female.

		CLEMENTINE
	At least I haven't been barking up the
	wrong tree.

She finds a window that's unlatched.  She lifts it.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Cool.

		JOEL
	What are you doing?

		CLEMENTINE
	It's freezing out here.

She scrambles in the window.  Joel looks around, panicked.

		JOEL
		(whisper)
	Clementine.

		VOICE-OVER
	I couldn't believe you did that.  I was
	paralyzed with fear.

The front door opens and Clementine stands there beckoning.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	C'mon, man.  The water's fine.  Nobody's
	coming here tonight, believe me.  This
	place is closed up.  Electricity's off.

		JOEL
	I hesitated for what seemed like forever.

		CLEMENTINE
	I could see you wanted to come in, Joel.

He walks cautiously toward the door.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	As soon as you walked in.  I knew I had
	you.  You knew I knew that, right?

INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Joel enters the darkened and Clementine closes the door
behind him.

		JOEL
	I knew.

		CLEMENTINE
	I knew by your nervousness that Naomi
	wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to
	criminally trespass.

		JOEL
	It's dark.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yeah.  What's your girlfriend's name?

		JOEL
	Naomi.

She's searching through drawers for something.  She pulls out
a flashlight, shines it in Joel's face.

		CLEMENTINE
	Ah-ha!  Now I can look for candles,
	matches, and the liquor cabinet.

		JOEL
	I think we should go.

		CLEMENTINE
	No, it's our house!  Just tonight --
		(looking at envelope on
		 counter)
	-- we're David and Ruth Laskin.  Which
	one do you want to be?  I prefer to be
	Ruth but I'm flexible.
		(opens cabinet)
	Alcohol!  You make drinks.  I'm going
	find the bedroom and slip into something
	more Ruth.  I'm ruthless at the moment.

She runs upstairs, giggling.  The room is drying out, turning
into a husk.

		JOEL
		(calling after her)
	I really should go.  I really need to
	catch my ride.

		VOICE-OVER
	I didn't want to go.  I was too nervous.
	I thought, maybe you were a nut.  But you
	were exciting.  You called from upstairs.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
		(flat)
	So go.

		JOEL
	I did.  I walked out the door.  I felt
	like I was a scared little kid.  I
	thought you knew that about me.  I ran
	back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my
	humiliation.  You said, "so go" with such
	disdain.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
		(poking her head downstairs)
	What if you stay this time?

		JOEL
	I walked out the door.  There's no more
	memory.

		CLEMENTINE
	Come back and make up a good-bye at
	least.  Let's pretend we had one.

Clementine comes downstairs, vague and robotic, making her
way through the decaying environment.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Bye, Joel.

		JOEL
	I love you.

She smiles.  They kiss.  It fades.

		CLEMENTINE
	I --

EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

Joel finds himself hurrying back to the bonfire.  This scene,
too, is disintegrating.  It dries up and Joel is just
standing there on a faded beach at night, the bonfire frozen
in the distance like a photograph.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

Joel sits in the back seat, Rob and Carrie are in the front.

		CARRIE
	Did you have fun?

Joel nods glumly.

Carrie continues to talk, but her voice goes under as Joel
studies the faded husks of memories, piled like refuse
outside the moving car window.  He sees dried-out version of
previous interactions with Clementine playing out in loops.
He looks back and sees the memory of his ride home from the
beach with Rob and Carrie.  It, too, is decaying.  Soon all
has crumbled into dust.  Everything goes black.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

Howard watches the monitor.  The last specks of light are
fading.  It grows dark.  He is tired, his eyes are hollow.
He turns to Stan, who is staring out the window at the dawn.

		HOWARD
	Okay.

Stan turns and wordlessly begins the clean-up.  He pulls the
electrodes off of Joel's scalp, coils cable, packs bags.
Howard dials the bedside phone.  He waits as it rings.

		HOLLIS'S VOICE
	Hi, you've reached the Mierzwiaks.  We
	can't come to --

Howard hangs up.

EXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - EARLY MORNING

Stan and Howard load the last of the equipment into the back
of the van.  He and Howard look at each other.

		STAN
	So, I've got to drop the van off.

		MIERZWIAK
	Thanks, Stan.  Thanks.

INT. PATRICK'S CAR - EARLY MORNING

Patrick and Mary are heading home from Boston.  Mary is
silent and depressed.  Patrick tries to break the silence.

		PATRICK
	You want to stop for coffee or something?

Mary shakes her head "no."  Long silence.

		PATRICK (CONT'D)
	Well, it was sure beautiful on that
	river.  Thanks for sharing it with me.

Mary doesn't say anything.  Silence.

		PATRICK (CONT'D)
	Well do it again soon.

EXT. PARKING STRUCTURE - EARLY MORNING

Stan pulls the van into space marked "Lacuna."  He gets out,
crosses to his car.  Mary is sitting on the hood.

		STAN
	Hey.

		MARY
		(beat)
	Do you swear you didn't know?

		STAN
	I swear.

		MARY
	And you never even suspected?  Never saw
	us behaving in any unusual way together?

		STAN
	Once, maybe.

She watches him closely, waiting for him to continue.

		STAN (CONT'D)
	It was here.  At his car.  I was coming
	back from a job and spotted you together.
	You seemed caught.  I waved.  You
	giggled.

		MARY
	How did I look?

		STAN
		(beat)
	Happy.  Happy with a secret.

Mary starts to cry.

		MARY
	And after that?

		STAN
	I never saw you together like that again.
	So I figured I was imagining things.

Mary says nothing.

		STAN (CONT'D)
	I really like you, Mary.  You know that.

		MARY
	Do you remember anything else?  What I
	was wearing?  Was I standing close to
	him?  Was I leaning against his car like
	I owned it?  How did he look at me when I
	giggled?  Tell me everything.

		STAN
		(thinking)
	You were in red.  That red sweater with
	the little flowers, I think.  You were
	leaning against his car.
		(thinking)
	He looked a little like a kid.  Kind of
	goofy and wide-eyed.  I'd never seen him
	look like that before.  Happy.  You
	looked beautiful.  You looked in love.

		MARY
		(heading toward the levator)
	Thanks, Stan.

She stops but doesn't turn to face him.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	You're nice.
		(beat)
	But I love him.  I knew I loved him.  Now
	I know.

He nods.  She waves, heads to the elevator.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Joel awakens.  The apartment is neat, like when he went to
sleep.  He gets out of bed and heads into the bathroom.

EXT. COMMUTER TRAIN STATION - MORNING

Joel waits on the crowded platform.  The platform across the
tracks is empty.  Joel's train arrives.  It's packed.  He
squeezes on with all the other commuters.

INT. OFFICE - DAY

Joel works in his cubicle over the light table.  He seems
distracted.  He dials his phone.  He's nervous.

		JOEL
	Hi... Naomi?  Yeah, hi!  How are you?  I
	know, I know.  It's been a long time.
	Not too much.  You?  Oh, that's great!
	Congratulations!  Maybe I could buy you
	dinner to celebrate?  Tonight?  I'm free.
	Okay, good!

INT. LACUNA RECEPTION AREA - DAY

Mary does paperwork at her desk.  She looks through her
reception window at the sad people waiting in the lobby with
their bags of stuff.

INT. MIERZWIAK'S OFICE - CONTINUOUS

Mierzwiak dials his phone and waits.  He hangs up.  Mary
enters with the papers.

		MARY
	I need this signed, Howard.

He takes it, unable to make eye contact.  He signs it, hands
it back.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	Thanks.
		(beat)
	So... do we talk about this... or what?

		MIERZWIAK
	I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary.
	I want to do the right thing here.

		MARY
	Do you love me?  Did you love me?
	Something.  I listened to my tape.  I
	can't believe I've been sitting right in
	front of it for a year.  It's like
	listening to someone else's story.  I
	mean, I hear myself talking about having
	sex with you and I can't even imagine you
	naked.  I can't even say "naked" to you!

		MIERZWIAK
	I have a family, Mary.

		MARY
	You made me have an abortion.

		MIERZWIAK
	It was a mutual decision.

		MARY
	You made me have you erased!  I loved
	you.  I love you!  How could you --

		MIERZWIAK
	I didn't make you.  You thought it best.
		(off her stare)
	But, look, I take full responsibility.

She looks at him for a long while.  Then, out of frustration,
she screams.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Joel sits across from Naomi.

		NAOMI
		(oddly cautious)
	So... you haven't been involved with
	anyone in all this time?

		JOEL
	It's been a pretty lonely couple of
	years.

		NAOMI
	I'm sorry.

		JOEL
	Well, it was my fault -- the break-up.
	I'm sorry.

		NAOMI
	Oh, sweetie.  It really does cut both
	ways.  We were taking each other for
	granted and --

		JOEL
	I miss you.

		NAOMI
	Miss you, too.
		(awkward pause)
	I have been seeing someone for a little
	while.

		JOEL
		(trying for enthusiasm)
	Oh!  Great.  That's great!

		NAOMI
	A religion instructor at Columbia.  A
	good guy.  He's a good guy.

		JOEL
	I'm sorry.  I really shouldn't have --

		NAOMI
	I'm glad you called.

INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Joel and Naomi are in bed having sex.  There are certain
sexual routines, habits, they have fallen back into almost
immediately.  She sticks her tongue in his ear in a way
that's trying to be sexual but just feels embarrassing to
him.  They finish and lie there.

		JOEL
	So you think the dissertation will get
	published?

		NAOMI
	I don;t know.  I'm not sure there's a big
	public demand for books on Calvinism and
	Misogyny.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Clementine lies in bed with Patrick.

EXT. COMMUTER TRAIN STATION - MORNING

The platform is crowded with business commuters.  Joel is
among them.
The platform across the tracks from them is empty.  Suddenly,
Joel turns and makes his way through the crowd.  He climbs
the stairs, crosses the overpass and makes his way to the
empty platform.  An almost empty train pulls into that
platform.  Joel gets on the train and watches the business
commuters through the dirty window as his train pulls out of
the station.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Mary gets out of bed.  She has been crying all night.  She's
a wreck.  She puts on some coffee then crosses into the
living room area.  Sitting there are piles of the files from
work.  She pulls the top one out, copies the name and address
onto an envelope stuffs the file and tape cassette in.  She
pulls another file out.  This one has Joel's name on it.  She
copies it onto an envelope.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel says goodbye to Clementine.

		CLEMENTINE
	So you'll call me, right?

		JOEL
	Yeah.

		CLEMENTINE
	When?

		JOEL
	Tomorrow?

		CLEMENTINE
	Tonight.  Just to test out the phone
	lines.

		JOEL
	Yeah.

Joel exits.  We stay on Clementine as she watches Joel head
to his car, tromping through the snow.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel enters, drops his overcoat on a chair, dials the phone.

		JOEL
	Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.

		NAOMI'S VOICE
	Hi.

		JOEL
	How's it going?

		NAOMI'S VOICE
	Good.  I called you at work today.  They
	said you were home sick.

		JOEL
	I know.  I had to take the day to think.

		NAOMI'S VOICE
	Yeah, I tried you at home.  Did you get
	my message?

		JOEL
	I just got in.

		NAOMI'S VOICE
	Long day thinking.

Joel flips on messages with volume down.

		JOEL
	Yeah, I suppose so.

		NAOMI ON MACHINE
		(cheerful)
	Hi.  They told me you were sick!  So...
	Where are you?!  I had a really nice time
	last night.  Just wanted to say hi, so...
	hi.  Call me.  I'm home.  Call me!

		NAOMI'S VOICE
	That's me.

		JOEL
	There you are.
		(pause)
	Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall
	back into this fast without considering
	the problems we had...

		NAOMI
	Okay, Joel.  I suppose you're right.

		JOEL
	I had a good time last night.  I really
	did.

		NAOMI
	So I'm going to get some sleep.  I'm glad
	you're okay.

		JOEL
	We'll speak soon.

		NAOMI
	'Night.

She hangs up and Joel stands there for a minute feeling
creepy, then he dials the number on a piece of paper.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	What took you so long?

		JOEL
	I just walked in.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	Hmmm.  Do you miss me?

		JOEL
	Oddly enough, I do.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	Ha Ha!  You said, I do.  I guess that
	means we're married.

		JOEL
	I guess so.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	Tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.

EXT. CHARLES RIVER - NIGHT

Clementine steps out onto it.  Joel follows nervously.

		CLEMENTINE
	Don't worry.  It's really solid this time
	of year.

		JOEL
	I don't know.

She takes his hand and he is suddenly imbued with confidence.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	This is so beautiful.

She squeezes his hand.

		CLEMENTINE
	Isn't it?

She runs and slides on the ice.  Joel is by himself now.

		JOEL
	I don't know.  What if it breaks?

		CLEMENTINE
	What if?

Clementine lies on her back and stares up at the stars.  Joel
is paralyzed.  He looks back at the shore.

		JOEL
	I think I should go back.

		CLEMENTINE
	Joel, come here.  Please.

He hesitates then gingerly makes his way over to her.  She
reaches for his hand and gently pulls him down.  He lies on
his back beside her, their bodies touching.  He wants to turn
to her, but out of shyness, doesn't.  She holds his hand.
They look up at the stars.  She smiles, doesn't say anything
and snuggles closer to him.

		JOEL
	Listen, did you want to make love?

		CLEMENTINE
	Make love?

		JOEL
	Have sex.  Y'know --

		CLEMENTINE
	Oh, um...

		JOEL
	Because I just am not drunk enough or
	stoned enough to make that happen right
	now.

		CLEMENTINE
	That's okay.  I --

		JOEL
	I'm sorry.  I just wanted to say that.
	This seems like the perfect romantic
	exotic place to do it and --

		CLEMENTINE
	Hey, Joel --

		JOEL
	-- and I'm just too nervous around you
	right now.

		CLEMENTINE
	I'm nervous, too.

		JOEL
	Yeah?  I wouldn't have thought that.

		CLEMENTINE
	Well, you obviously don't know me.

		JOEL
	I'm nervous because I have and enormous
	crush on you.

She smiles up at the sky.

		CLEMENTINE
	Show me which constellations you know.

MONTAGE

We see people going to their mailboxes, finding manila
envelopes.  One by one they open the envelopes and pull out
tapes.  We see stunned, confused, disbelieving reactions as
people listen to their tapes.

EXT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Joel drops Clementine off.  She kisses him.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Joel enters with his mail.  He opens a manila envelope, reads
the enclosed file, sticks the cassette tape in his stereo,
listens.  Joel dials the phone.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	Yeah?

		JOEL
	Did you send this?  Is it a joke?

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	I probably got the same thing as you.

		JOEL
	I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've
	met you.  Who would even know to do this?

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
		(matter of fact)
	Maybe it's true then.  It's my voice on
	the tape.

		JOEL
	That's what you have to say?  How could
	it be true?  I never even heard of any
	procedure like this.  It's a joke.

		CLEMENTINE
	Maybe.  Call someone who'd know.

MONTAGE

We see the people we saw opening envelopes, now on the phone.
We hear over and over:  "Is this true?", "Did this really
happen?", "Do I know you?", "Is it true?"

INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S KITCHEN - DAY

Carrie is on the phone.  She pauses nervously, then speaks:

		CARRIE
	Yes, Joel.  It is true.  We weren't
	supposed to say anything.  They say it's
	like waking a sleepwalker.

INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Joel hangs up.  He dials the phone.

		JOEL
	It's true.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	I know.  I spoke to my friend Magda.

Joel is immersed in the several page document.

		JOEL
	Look, I have to go.  I have to think.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	Joel, we've fucked.  We've made love.
	Like a million times.  And we were so
	sweet and shy and inept with each other
	last night.  Isn't that lovely?

Joel doesn't know what to say as this registers.  He just
stands there dumbly.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	Come over here, sweetheart.  Please.

INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - LATER

Joel and Clementine review their separate Lacuna packages
together.

		CLEMENTINE
	Says you were closed off, non
	communicative, never told me what you
	were feeling.

		JOEL
	Says you were a bully...

		CLEMENTINE
		(laughing)
	A bully?  Moi?

		JOEL
	That's what it says.  You drank too much,
	you picked on me for being passive and
	timid.

		CLEMENTINE
	Well, sounds like me.  Sorry, man.
		(reading)
	Says you were jealous and suspicious.

		JOEL
	Says you would sometimes disappear all
	night, then brag to me about your sexual
	conquests.

		CLEMENTINE
	Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or
	is that your way of putting it.

		JOEL
	I don't know.

		CLEMENTINE
	Doesn't sound like me.

		JOEL
	Says you were a slob, leaving trails of
	panties and dirty socks in your wake.

		CLEMENTINE
	Says you were constantly calling me a
	slob.
		(laughs)
	It's sexy that we were like a married
	couple, griping and overly-familiar and
	bored.  Don't you think?

		JOEL
		(considering)
	I sort of do.  But I only see it as a
	fantasy version of reality.  Cleaned up
	enough to be erotic.

		CLEMENTINE
	We should have sex.  It's old hat for us.

She smiles at nervous Joel.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	You know my body like the back of your
	hand.

She unbuttons her blouse.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Every curve, every freckle.

She takes off her shirt.  He stares at her.  He has clearly
never seen this body before.

		JOEL
	You're so beautiful.

She approaches him, kisses him, his arms wrap around her
waist for the first time.

INT. LACUNA LTD. WAITING ROOM - MORNING

Stan enters the waiting room, now crowded with people holding
their files, a stunned-looking lot.  There is a new woman in
the reception window.  The file cases behind her are bare.

		RECEPTIONIST
	May I help you?

		STAN
	I work here.  I used to work here.  Stan.
	Please just tell Howard I'm here to clean
	out my desk.

		RECEPTIONIST
		(into phone)
	Mr. Mierzwiak, Stan is here to -- Yes
	sir.
		(to Stan)
	He says he needs to see you.

INT. MIERZWIAK'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Stan enters.  Mierzwiak is pale and pacing.

		MIERZWIAK
	She should not have done this, Stan.  As
	mad as she was... as justifiably --

		STAN
	I don't know what you're talking about,
	Howard.

		MIERZWIAK
	Mary has stolen our files and is sending
	them back to people.

		STAN
	Jesus.

Mierzwiak turns up the volume on a small video monitor
looking in on the lab, where Patrick has clearly taken over
Stan's position.  He is in the process of interviewing a sad
young woman.

		YOUNG WOMAN
	... so I called everybody I know and
	asked them to tell me everything.  Now I
	know my entire history with him, but it's
	in the form of a story, I'm losing my
	mind.

		MIERZWIAK
	This is why people must never be told.
	It's like waking a --

		YOUNG WOMAN
	I don't know what to do.  Before I
	thought I was depressed for no reason.
	Now it's like I've been assigned a
	reason.

		PATRICK
	This never should've happened, ma'am.
	We'll take care of it.

		MIERZWIAK
	I know you don't like me much, Stan, but
	please talk to Mary.  She of all people
	should know this is a dangerous thing
	she's doing.

INT. OFFICE - DAY

Joel works over his light box.  His phone rings.

		JOEL
	Hi, it's Joel.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	Hey, lover.  Whatcha doing?

		JOEL
	I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I
	can till I can see you.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	God, I can't believe I ever hated you.

		JOEL
	You must have been crazy.

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	Guess what I'm wearing.

		JOEL
	I don't know.  Panties and --

		CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
	Your dried cum.

		JOEL
	Jesus.

		CLEMENTINE
	You're still excited by my irreverence.
	You haven't yet started to think of it as
	my "gratuitous need to shock."

		JOEL
	I can't stop thinking about you.

		CLEMENTINE
	Yay.  Meet me after work by the old mill.

		JOEL
	What old mill?  Is that somewhere we --

		CLEMENTINE
	I just wanted to say that.  Come by my
	house.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Mary opens the door.  Stan stands there with two cups of take
out coffee.

		MARY
	Oh.

		STAN
	Hi.

		MARY
	What do you want, Stan?

		STAN
	Can I... I brought some --

She steps aside for Stan to enter.  He does, looks around,
sees the tapes and the stuffed envelopes on the floor.

		STAN (CONT'D)
	What's this?

		MARY
	Nothing.

		STAN
	I know what it is.

		MARY
	Then why did you ask me?

		STAN
	I don't know.  I just -- there are a lot
	of really confused people showing up at
	the office.

		MARY
	They have a right to know.  Howard is a
	thief.  He steals the truth.
		(suddenly weeping)
	I can't remember my baby!  I can't
	remember my baby.  It existed and I can't
	even remember.  Do you understand that?

Stan doesn't know what to say.  He stands there dumbly.  Mary
slumps into a ball on a chair.

		STAN
	Mary, people come to him voluntarily.

		MARY
	I won't allow it.  Those who cannot
	remember the past are condemned to repeat
	it.  What do you think of that?  That's
	from my quote book.

		STAN
	The office is filled with people who want
	their memories re-erased.

		MARY
		(hysterically)
	Remember the Alamo!  Remember the Alamo!

		STAN
	Mary... please.  This is hurting people.

Long pause, then:

		MARY
		(small)
	I don't want to hurt people.
		(breaking down)
	But these things happened!  All these
	little sadnesses, the big ones.  What if
	no one remembers?  What does that do to
	the world?
		(beat, quietly)
	Someone has to remember, Stan.

They look at each other.

EXT. PARK - AFTERNOON

Vague elliptical images of a young girl on a swig.

		SAD WOMAN'S VOICE
	I was by myself in the park because my
	friend Davia was sick that day.  I was on
	a swing.  There was this smiling man
	walking a little bushy dog --

Vague shots of a man smiling, a scruffy dog on a leash.

		SAD WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	The man said something like, "He's
	friendly --"

Vague shot of the man, his voice overlapping with the
woman's.

		SAD WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
	"-- he won't bite."

		MAN
	He won't bite.  You can pet him if you
	want...

Shot of the girl petting the dog.

		MAN
	Do you want to give him a biscuit?

The girl nods.

		MAN (CONT'D)
	They're in my car.  Why don't you --

		DISTRAUGHT WOMAN'S VOICE
	Excuse me?  Hello?

INT. LACUNA RECEPTION AREA - DAY

Mary, with a headset on, looks up, startled.  She switches
off the tape.  She has been crying.  There's a pile of tapes
next to her.  The distraught woman is standing there.

		MARY
	May I help you?

		DISTRAUGHT WOMAN
	I'm here for Dr. Mierzwiak.  My name is
	Helene Kernfeld.

		MARY
	Yes, please have a seat.  The doctor will
	be with you momentarily.

The woman sits.  Mary presses an intercom button.

		MARY (CONT'D)
	Howard, your 10:30.

She switches the tape back on.

		SAD WOMAN'S VOICE
	He took me to his car and ...

Vague shot of the girl being raped.

INT. COMMUTER TUBE - DAY

The old woman is staring off blankly, her giant manuscript in
her lap, as she travels over the New York skyline.  We move
into her eyes.

INT. VAGUE SPACE

Vague reenactments of memories intermingle in this undefined
space:

The young girl being raped by the man in the car.

A soldier on a battlefield looking at his slaughtered
friends.

A couple fighting, from the woman's point of view.

		MAN
	I...I... I... find you physically
	repulsive!  I can't even look at you!

They look at each other in silence.

A little boy being called "faggot" by an endless succession
of boys.

The aftermath of a car accident from the driver's POV.

Mary having an abortion.

INT. COMMUTER TUBE - DAY

The old woman and her chair lift out of the line of
commuters.

INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

It's modern and well-appointed.  The old woman enters, sits
behind the reception desk, drops her manuscript into the
drawer.   She takes some pills with water.  An old man
enters.

		OLD MAN
	How are you today, Mary?

		OLD WOMAN (MARY)
	Let's see... Still dying, Howard.

		OLD MAN (HOWARD)
	You don't have to jump down my throat.  I
	was trying to be nice.

		OLD WOMAN (MARY)
	Well, don't try.  It's unbecoming on you.

Old Howard mutters something and disappears into the back.
Old Mary pulls out a file from behind, removes a small disc,
places it in a machine on her desk, slips on earphones and
listens, somewhat wearily but attentively.  We watch the
color drain from her face, but don't hear the recording.
Another old woman enters the office.  Old Mary looks up,
seems a bit startled, conceals it, turns off the tape.

		OLD WOMAN (MARY) (CONT'D)
	May I help you?

		SECOND OLD WOMAN
	I'd like to make an appointment.

		OLD WOMAN (MARY)
	I think the doctor is free this morning.
	He can probably take you right away for
	an initial consultation.

The second old woman smiles gratefully.

INT. OLD MAN'S OFFICE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Old Howard works at his desk.  Old Mary enters with the
second old woman.

		OLD WOMAN (MARY)
	Dr. Mierzwiak, this is Clementine
	Kruczynski.  She'd like to talk to you.

Old Howard and the old Mary eye each other.

		OLD MAN (HOWARD)
	Hello, Ms. Kruczynski.  Nice to meet you.
	Please have a seat.

He indicates a sitting area.  She sits.  He joins her.

		OLD MAN (HOWARD) (CONT'D)
	Would you mind if I tape our discussion?

She shakes her hear.  He punches a couple of buttons on his
computer console.  A tape recorder starts up and his computer
screen lights up so only he can see it.  On it we see a whole
file on Clementine Kruczynski: a list of fifteen dates of
previous erasures stretching back fifty years, all of them
involving Joel Barish.

		OLD MAN (HOWARD) (CONT'D)
	So, why don't you begin by telling me why
	you've come here.

		SECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE)
	Well, I met this man, Joel, three years
	ago at a senior dance...  We'd both been
	alone for so long and...

INT. TUBE - NIGHT

The old woman (Mary) travels in the commuter tube over
Manhattan.  It's late, the tube is mostly empty.  She has
earphones on.

		SECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE) (V.O.)
	I remember Joel and I were having
	breakfast --

INT. VAGUE SPACE

An old man and the second old woman eat breakfast.

		SECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE) (V.O.)
	-- I said something like we should go
	upstate and see the leaves change...

The old man looks up from his cereal and stares blankly.  The
woman smiles, but there is no response... just a dead stare.

		SECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE) (V.O.)
		(CONT'D)
	He just stared at me as if I didn't
	exist.  As if I had never existed...

INT. TUBE - CONTINUOUS

The second old woman's (Clementine) voice drones tinnily on
in the distance.  The old woman with the earphones is dead,
her eyes glassy and unseeing.

		SECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE) (V.O.)
	-- his eyes used to be so filled with
	love.  But it was gone.  How can I go
	back to being alone after seeing love?  I
	was alone for so long.  What had I done
	with my life?  I was alone so long.

INT. SECOND OLD WOMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The old Clementine is unconscious on her bed, hooked up to
modern versions of the erasing machines.  Two young
technicians monitor the equipment.  The woman's bedside phone
rings.  Her machine picks up.  After a moment:

		OLD MAN'S VOICE
	Hi, it's Joel.  What's going on, Clem?
	Why won't you call me back?  Please call
	me.  We need to speak.

The machine clicks off.  One of the technicians reaches over
and presses the "erase" button on the machine.

BLACK.

               EXT. NEPTUNE - MODEL INTERPLANETARY SPACE

               A vast field of stars. The gas giant Neptune slowly spins 
               into view. Brilliant and blue and cold against the void.

               EXT. NEPTUNE - MODEL A BLACK SILHOUETTE

               stands out against the planet, tiny against Neptune's scale.

               EXT. NEPTUNE - MODEL DRIFT CLOSER

               to discern the hard angles of a man-made craft. A ship. No 
               longer dwarfed by the planet, the scale of the vessel emerges: 
               a vast labyrinth of steel.

               Its shadow swallows all in darkness.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY

               Shafts of Neptune's blue light enter through windows, 
               illuminate debris suspended in the zero-gravity environment: 
               shards of metal and glass.

               MOVE from the Corridor into:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               A cockpit for three. Neptune's blue light fills the chamber, 
               reflects off immobile particles in the air. Thick quartz 
               windows look down at Neptune. The cockpit lights are dark 
               but for one blinking red light.

               An emergency beacon. Under-floor lights go on.

               The strobe of the red light reveals a man floating at the 
               helm, slowly spinning. He is dead, perfectly preserved in 
               the cold vacuum of space. His eyes are empty black pits and 
               his mouth hangs open in a scream: DR. WILLIAM WEIR.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STUDIO APARTMENT

               Weir opens his eyes, waking from dream. Sweat beads his 
               ascetic, etched face. Many years a scientist.

               He turns on the bedside lamp, revealing a couple's apartment. 
               Decorated by a woman, but Weir is alone, unless you count 
               photographs. His nightstand looks like a shrine to a beautiful 
               woman.

               Weir reaches to the stand. Picks up...

               RECENT, UNFRAMED PHOTO

               The woman appears thin and haggard and wears a small brave 
               smile.

               Weir lies back on the bed. Looks at the photo. Presses it to 
               his forehead and closes his eyes. Trying to be with her, 
               just one more time.

                                     WEIR
                              (whisper)
                         I miss you.

               INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - LATER

               Weir stands in front of the bathroom mirror, shaving with a 
               straight-razor. The mirror reveals the bathtub just behind 
               him. DRIP, DRIP, DRIP...

               Weir turns to stare at the bathtub. Water wells up at the 
               mouth of the tub's faucet, grows impossibly large, falls... 
               DRIP.

               Weir turns back to his shaving.

               INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - LATER

               Weir stands in the kitchenette, staring at the microwave as 
               it cooks his breakfast.

               INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - LATER

               Weir stands before his window, chewing his oatmeal 
               mechanically, forcing himself to swallow. He reaches out to 
               open the blinds...

               INT. STUDIO APARTMENT REVERSE ANGLE

               as the blinds pull aside, revealing Weir, upside-down.

               ROTATE AND PULL BACK...

               EXT. DAYLIGHT STATION - MODEL TO REVEAL DAYLIGHT STATION

               Weir's window is just one of many in a space station, a 
               delicate combination of cylindrical habitats and solar panels. 
               The structure hangs above the Earth in low orbit.

                         This is Weir.

                                     LYLE (V.O.)
                              (tinny)
                         Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like 
                         to see you as soon as possible.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DAYLIGHT - OFFICE

               A military office, United States Aerospace Command seal 
               blazoned on the door. Views of the Earth. Admiral HOLLIS 
               sits behind his desk, a gruff career officer and a good man.

               Weir enters, escorted by Hollis' adjutant, LYLE.

                                     WEIR
                         You wanted to see me, Admiral?

                                     HOLLIS
                         I apologize for the short notice, 
                         Bill, but we've had something come 
                         up that requires your immediate 
                         attention. Lyle?

               INT. HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAY OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM

               Lyle activates a holographic display of the solar system. A 
               box magnifies the eighth planet, Neptune, revealing a flashing 
               red dot in its orbit.

               INT. DAYLIGHT OFFICE

                                     LYLE
                         At oh-three-hundred this morning, 
                         TDRSS picked up an automated 
                         navigation beacon broadcasting at 
                         two minute intervals in Neptune orbit.

               Lyle hands Weir a stack of hardcopy data. Weir reads the 
               data with growing excitement.

                                     WEIR
                         Incredible... These are the same 
                         coordinates before the ship 
                         disappeared... this, this happened? 
                         This isn't some kind of hoax?

                                     HOLLIS
                         I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. 
                         Houston confirms the telemetry and 
                         I.D. codes.

                                     WEIR
                              (excited)
                         It's the Event Horizon. She's come 
                         back.

               Hollis answers drily.

                                     HOLLIS
                         That ship was lost in deep space, 
                         seven years ago. If the Titanic sailed 
                         into New York harbor, I'd find it 
                         more plausible.
                              (beat)
                         Houston wants Aerospace to send out 
                         a search and rescue team, investigate 
                         the source of the transmission. If 
                         it really is the Event Horizon, 
                         they'll attempt a salvage.
                              (beat)
                         We need you to prepare a detailed 
                         briefing on the ship's systems for 
                         the salvage crew...

                                     WEIR
                         A written briefing can't possibly 
                         anticipate the variables on a mission 
                         like this. I have to go with them.

               Lyle looks at Weir, stunned by the request.

                                     LYLE
                         Dr. Weir, you have no experience 
                         with salvage procedures.

                                     WEIR
                         I designed the ship's propulsion 
                         system. I am the only person capable 
                         of evaluating the performance of the 
                         gravity drive. You can't send a Search 
                         and Rescue team out there alone and 
                         expect them to succeed. That would 
                         be like... like sending an auto-
                         mechanic to work on the shuttle.

                                     LYLE
                         I can understand your desire to redeem 
                         your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it 
                         doesn't factor into this.

                                     WEIR
                         This is not about my reputation! 
                         This is not about me at all!
                              (beat, passionate)
                         The Event Horizon was created for 
                         one reason: to go faster than light. 
                         Imagine mankind exploring new solar 
                         systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven 
                         years ago, we didn't just lose the 
                         ship and the crew. We lost the dream.
                              (beat, quiet and 
                              relentless)
                         I have to go.

                                     HOLLIS
                         It's not that simple.
                              (off of Weir's 
                              expression)
                         Lyle, play the recording for Dr. 
                         Weir.

                         Navigation Control tried to hail the 
                         vessel. This was the only response.

               Lyle presses a button on Hollis' desk. An unholy GARBLE rips 
               from office speakers: STATIC and NOISE and INHUMAN VOICES. 
               Alone, each sound would raise the hair on your neck. Together, 
               they are unbearable.

               The sound mercifully cuts off to STATIC. Lyle stops the tape.

               Weir sits there, stunned.

                                     LYLE
                         Since the initial transmission, 
                         there's been no further contact. 
                         Just the beacon, every two minutes.

                                     WEIR
                         The crew? Could they still be alive?

                                     LYLE
                         The ship had life support systems 
                         for eighteen months. They're been 
                         gone seven years.

                                     WEIR
                         Someone sent that message. Admiral, 
                         you have to put me on that ship.

               Hollis stares at Weir, judging the man with his eyes.

                                     HOLLIS
                         It's against my better judgement, 
                         but I'll run this by the Man 
                         downstairs. You'll know my decision 
                         by the end of the day.

                                     WEIR
                         Thank you.

                                     HOLLIS
                         Don't thank me, Bill. I'm not doing 
                         you any favors.

               Weir leaves. The door closes behind him.

                                     LYLE
                         You're not seriously considering 
                         sending him?

                                     HOLLIS
                         You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. 
                         The man held Oppenheimer's chair at 
                         Princeton. If the Event Horizon had 
                         worked, he would have gone down in 
                         history as the greatest mind in 
                         physics since Einstein.

                                     LYLE
                         The official inquiry blamed Weir's 
                         design for the ship's loss.

                                     HOLLIS
                         That doesn't mean a damn thing. They 
                         were looking for a scapegoat and 
                         Weir fit the bill. But he's not 
                         responsible for what happened to the 
                         ship.

                                     LYLE
                         Does he know that?

                                     HOLLIS
                         What's on your mind?

                                     LYLE
                         He doesn't belong on this mission. 
                         Responsible or not, he blames himself. 
                         He's too close to it.

                         It's been two years since she died. 
                         He's over it.

                                     LYLE
                         Some things you don't get over.

               Beat.

                         I want our best people on this.

                         The Lewis and Clark just returned 
                         from patrol in the asteroid belt, 
                         she's docked in bay four.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DAYLIGHT STATION/EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK

               The Lewis and Clark pulls away from Daylight station, turns 
               towards the depths of space. It is a tough-looking spacecraft, 
               all engine.

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

               MOVE IN on thick quartz windows near the ship's nose: the 
               bridge...

               Split level. Above: avionics, navigation, flight control. 
               STARCK (female, Navigator, sharp mind, sharp tongue) checks 
               the navigation data on her screen as SMITH (male, Pilot, 
               wrapped too tight) punches in the course.

                                     SMITH
                         I can't believe this, I haven't gotten 
                         more than my hand in six weeks and 
                         now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, 
                         Mars has women...

                                     STARCK
                         Smith's right. Neptune? There's 
                         nothing out there. If something 
                         happens, we'll be on our own.

               The captain's chair drops from above, swivels to reveal MILLER 
               (male, Captain, intense).

                                     MILLER
                         I don't like it either, but you know 
                         the rules: we get the call, we go. 
                         Is the course locked in?

                                     SMITH
                         Locked and cocked.

                                     STARCK
                         We're past the outer marker, we can 
                         engage the ion drive whenever you're 
                         ready.

                                     MILLER
                         Justin?

               Below: the bridge's "war-room" -- ship's systems and mission 
               stations. JUSTIN (male, Engineer, young hot-shot).

                                     JUSTIN
                         Everything green on my boards, 
                         Skipper.

                                     MILLER
                         Start the countdown.

                                     STARCK
                         Ion drive will engage in... T-minus 
                         ten minutes.

                                     MILLER
                         Let's go.

               Miller slides down a ladder into the war-room. The others 
               follow into...

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK BAY

               Bulky EVA (extra-vehicular activity) suits line the walls. 
               MUSIC blares from a JAMBOX, built into a storage locker.

               An Emergency Tech stows safety lines: COOPER -- male, the 
               resident pain-in-the-ass. He SINGS along with the music.

                                     MILLER
                              (not breaking stride)
                         Kill it.

               Cooper reaches up, turns off the box.

                                     COOPER
                         Time to play Spam in the can.

                                     MILLER
                         Don't start with me, Cooper.

               Cooper falls in as the crew continues into...

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - QUARTERS

               Evidence of long term habitation. Personalized lockers. Fold-
               down bunks, chairs, tables; currently stowed for docking. A 
               modular galley.

               PETERS (female, Emergency Technician, the crew's denmother) 
               and DJ (male, Doctor, a cold perfectionist) load CO2 scrubbers 
               into a bin in the floor.

               Weir stands to the side like a fifth wheel.

                                     WEIR
                         Captain Miller, I just want to say...

                                     MILLER
                         The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If 
                         you'll follow the rest of the crew, 
                         they'll show you to the gravity tanks.

               Weir hesitates, then follows the crew into Medical. Miller 
               hangs back.

                                     MILLER
                         What's the hold up?

                                     PETERS
                         Just loading the last of the CO2 
                         scrubbers.
                              (to Miller, accusatory)
                         Good for four months.

                                     MILLER
                         I put in for a replacement for you 
                         but no one...

                                     PETERS
                         No, no, its alright. I talked to my 
                         ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas 
                         and I'll get him this summer.
                              (beat)
                         Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen 
                         him in two months.

                                     MILLER
                         I am sorry. But now we have to go to 
                         work.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - MEDICAL

               A high tech operating room. Modular equipment. Vertical tanks 
               line the walls, each large enough to hold a human being: 
               gravity couches.

               The crew stands before the gravity couches, almost nude, no 
               room for modesty.

               Starck catches Cooper looking at her ass as she strips to 
               her undergarments. Cooper grins. She flips him off, not 
               bothering to turn around.

                                     COOPER
                         Is that an offer?

                                     STARCK
                         It is not.

               Miller disrobes. Two service tags hang around his neck. He 
               does not remove them. Weir approaches him.

                                     WEIR
                         Captain Miller, I appreciate this 
                         opportunity...

                                     MILLER
                         Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on 
                         your mission because we want to. We 
                         were pulled off a well deserved leave, 
                         to be sent out to the middle of 
                         nowhere, and no one's even told us 
                         why.

                                     WEIR
                         I've been authorized to brief you 
                         and the crew once we reach Neptune 
                         space.

                                     MILLER
                         Until then, do what you're told and 
                         stay out of my way.

               Weir nods, moves to an empty couch bearing his name, written 
               on a piece of tape. Peters watches him.

                                     PETERS
                         First time in a grav couch?

                                     WEIR
                         Yes.

               She checks Weir's couch, helps him climb in. Weir keeps one 
               eye on Miller.

                                     PETERS
                              (Off of Weir's glance)
                         Don't worry about it. He's hard, but 
                         he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping 
                         out with him. He's one of the few 
                         Captains in the service with 
                         experience in the Outer Reach.

                                     WEIR
                         He's been past Mars?

                                     PETERS
                         He served on the Goliath.

                                     WEIR
                         Wasn't that ship destroyed?

                                     PETERS
                              (nods)
                         They attempted to rescue a supply 
                         shuttle bound for Titan. The shuttle's 
                         oh-two tanks ruptured during the 
                         rescue, flooded both ships with pure 
                         oxygen. There was a spark and both 
                         ships were incinerated. The Skipper 
                         and three others just made it to a 
                         lifeboat. Captain Miller was able...

                         He doesn't like to talk about it.

               DJ swathes one of Weir's arms with alcohol.

                                     DJ
                         You didn't eat anything in the past 
                         twelve hours?

               Weir shakes his head.

                                     DJ
                         When the Ion drive fires, we'll be 
                         taking about 30 gees. Without a tank, 
                         the force would liquefy your skeleton.

               DJ injects Weir. The scientist winces.

                                     WEIR
                         I've seen the effect on mice.

               DJ hands him the breathing mask.

                                     DJ
                         Put this on.

               Weir does. DJ checks the fit.

                                     PETERS
                         You'll be fine. You'll wake up and 
                         we'll be there. Watch your fingers.

               DJ closes the tank. It begins to fill with green gel. Weir's 
               eyes grow large with fear and then the anaesthesia hits. His 
               eyes close. His body draws into a fetal position.

                                     DJ

               dead. A distant SOUND echoes though the ship, the unholy 
               garble of human and inhuman voices -- it is the Event Horizon, 
               calling to him -- the sound refines into a WOMAN'S VOICE, no 
               more than a WHISPER:

               A sound: DRIP... DRIP... DRIP...

               Weir slowly walks to the Bridge.

               A naked WOMAN sits at the helm, her back to us. Completely 
               still. Her skin is very pale. Water pools around her chair. 
               Weir stands behind her.

                                     WEIR

               She does not answer. She does not move. Weir reaches out to 
               touch her shoulder, then pulls his hand back, afraid.

                                     WEIR
                         Claire? I'm sorry. Claire?

               He reaches out again. He touches her hair. She doesn't move. 
               Weir catches her reflection in the computer monitors. 
               Something wrong with her face... He starts to spin her around.

               Weir awakes with a jolt, in his grav couch. His mask has 
               slipped. His tank has filled with blood. He is drowning.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Reality. Weir's eyes open. He presses against the glass of 
               the tank, trying to force it open, panicked. The others are 
               already stepping from open tanks.

               Weir's tank opens with a HISS. He tumbles to the floor, 
               gasping, fluid streaming from his mouth.

               Peters rushes to him.

                         It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.

               Weir catches his breath. He looks up. The crew surrounds 
               him, concerned.

                                     WEIR
                         I'm alright now. I'm alright...

               DJ helps him to his feet.

                         Move slowly. You've been in stasis

                         experience a little disorientation.

               Weir nods.

                                     COOPER
                         Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like 
                         that. Coffee?

                         No, thank you.

               Cooper, still butt-naked and proud of it, grabs a metal 
               cylinder from the wall and pours a mug for himself.

                                     COOPER
                         Hey, Starck. You wanna dry my back?

               Starck gives him a cool once over.

                         considered code-black by the NSA.

               The crew look at each other: they haven't heard that in a

                         EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.

               In the quiet that follows:

                                     WEIR
                         What was made public about the Event 
                         Horizon, that she was a deep space 
                         research vessel, that its reactor 
                         went critical, that the ship blew 
                         up... None of that is true.
                              (beat)
                         The Event Horizon was the culmination 
                         of a secret government project to 
                         create a spacecraft capable of faster-
                         than-light flight.

               The crew stares at Weir: he has just dropped another bomb on 
               them.

                         You can't do that.

                         The law of relativity prohibits faster-
                         than-light travel...

                                     WEIR
                         Relativity, yes. We can't break the 
                         law of relativity, but we can go 
                         around it. The ship doesn't really 
                         move faster than the speed of light; 
                         it creates a dimensional gateway 
                         that allows the ship to 
                         instantaneously "jump" from one point 
                         in the universe to another, light 
                         years away.

                                     STARCK
                         How?

                                     WEIR
                         Well, in layman's terms, you use a 
                         rotating magnetic field to focus a 
                         narrow beam of gravitons; these in 
                         turn fold space-time consistent with 
                         Weyl tensor dynamics until the space-
                         time curvature becomes infinitely 
                         large and you have a singularity...

                                     COOPER
                         Laymen's terms.

               Weir thinks of another way to explain it. He rips a pin-up 
               from Smith's locker.

                                     SMITH
                         Hey...

                                     WEIR
                         Say this paper represents space-time, 
                         and you want to get from "point A" 
                         here...
                              (marks it on the photo 
                              with a pen)
                         ...to "point B," here.
                              (marks point B)
                         Now: what's the shortest distance 
                         between two points?

               The crew stares at him. Starck decides to play.

                                     STARCK
                         A straight line.

                                     WEIR
                         Wrong. The shortest distance between 
                         two points...

               Weir folds the paper, lining up point A over point B... then 
               THRUSTING his pen through both, skewering the pin-up.

                                     WEIR
                         ...is zero. That's what the 
                         singularity does: it folds space, so 
                         that point A and point B coexist in 
                         the same space and time. After the 
                         ship passes through this gateway, 
                         space returns to normal.
                              (hands the ruined pin-
                              up back to Smith)
                         It's called a gravity drive.

                                     JUSTIN
                         How do you know all this?

                                     WEIR
                         I built it.

               Even Cooper is impressed.

                                     COOPER
                         I can see why they sent you along.

                                     JUSTIN
                         So if the ship didn't blow up, what 
                         happened?

                                     WEIR
                         It was the ship's maiden voyage, to 
                         test the drive. The Event Horizon 
                         moved to safe distance using ion 
                         thrusters. They received the go-ahead 
                         to activate the gravity drive.
                              (beat)
                         And the ship vanished from all our 
                         scopes. No radar contact, no enhanced 
                         optical, no radio contact of any 
                         kind. They disappeared without a 
                         trace.
                              (beat)
                         Until now.

                                     MILLER
                         Where has it been for the last seven 
                         years?

                                     WEIR
                         That's what we're here to find out.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. INTERPLANETARY SPACE - MODEL

               The Lewis and Clark flashes silently past, heading deeper 
               and deeper into space.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

               The crew assembled.

                                     WEIR
                         We haven't been able to confirm any 
                         live contact, but TDRSS did receive 
                         a single transmission from the Event 
                         Horizon.

               Weir punches a button on a console. The transmission BLARES 
               from the bridge's speakers, STATIC and NOISE and, underneath 
               all, INHUMAN VOICES.

               The crew listen, look at one another. The recording ends 
               abruptly.

                                     SMITH
                         What the hell is that?

                                     PETERS
                         It doesn't sound like anything human.

                                     WEIR
                         Houston has passed the recording 
                         through several filters and isolated 
                         what appears to be a human voice.

               He activates a different file. The resulting WAIL is more 
               human but no less terrifying, a cry of despair. The last 
               message from a drowning man...

                                     SMITH
                         Jesus...

                                     MILLER
                         What is that?

                                     DJ
                         It sounds like Latin.

                                     COOPER
                         Latin? Who the fuck speaks Latin?

                                     STARCK
                         No one. It's a dead language.

                                     DJ
                         Mostly dead.

                                     MILLER
                         What does it say?

                                     WEIR
                         NSA encryption specialists have 
                         deciphered some of the message...

               Weir plays the HELLISH INCANTATION for a third time.

                                     WEIR
                         There: "...liberatis me..." They 
                         haven't been able to translate the 
                         rest, it's too distorted.

                                     DJ
                         "Liberatis me." "Save me."

                                     COOPER
                         From what?

                                     MILLER
                              (to Weir)
                         You're convinced the crew could still 
                         be alive? After seven years?

                                     WEIR
                         The Event Horizon only had life 
                         support for eighteen months. It seems 
                         impossible, but in light of the 
                         transmission... I have to think that 
                         someone has managed to endure until 
                         now.

                                     COOPER
                         Skipper, do we get hazard pay for 
                         this?

                                     MILLER
                         You heard the tape, Smith. We're 
                         looking for survivors.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The Lewis and Clark closes in on the blue planet.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

               The flight crew assembled. Data flashes across the main 
               monitors on the bridge.

               RCS thrusters pivot and fire as the ship enters Neptune orbit,

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

               The ship begins to rock as it encounters atmosphere, a growing 
               vibration.

               GRAPHICS flash across the main window's HUD. Neptune's dark 
               shadow fills the screen.

                         We have a lock on the Event Horizon's 
                         navigation beacon. It's in the upper 
                         ionosphere, we're in for some chop.

                         We're all on edge, Smith. We're a 
                         long way out...

                                     SMITH
                         That's not it. That ship was built 
                         to go faster than light... That's 
                         just wrong, it goes against everything

                                     SMITH
                         Something like that, yeah.

               Miller grins grimly.

                         I guess we're about to find out. 
                         Keep us slow and steady.

                                     SMITH
                         Yes, sir.

                         Dr. Weir...!

               Weir sticks his head into the bridge.

                                     MILLER
                         I think you want to see this.

               Weir climbs up the ladder to the flight deck.

                                     WEIR
                         Where is she?

                         Dead ahead, 5000 meters.

               Suddenly, the ship SHUDDERS VIOLENTLY.

               Weir braces himself in the doorway, staring out the forward 
               window into the roiling azure clouds.

               Smith grimaces, his knuckles white at the controls.

                                     SMITH
                         We've got some weather.

                                     MILLER
                         I noticed. Starck, anybody home?

                                     STARCK
                         If they are, they're screening their 
                         calls.

                                     SMITH
                         Range 3000 meters and closing.

                                     WEIR
                         I can't see anything...

               Only turbid clouds of methane ice whirl past the Lewis and 
               Clark's windows.

                                     SMITH
                         1500 meters. We're getting too 
                         close...

                                     MILLER
                         Where is it?

                                     STARCK
                              (checking her console)
                         The scope is lit, it's right in front 
                         of us...

                                     SMITH
                         1000 meters...

               A red warning light begins to flash in time with a shrill 
               BEEP.

                                     SMITH
                         Proximity warning! 900, 800 meters, 
                         700... we're right on top of it, 
                         we're gonna hit!

                                     MILLER
                         Starck...

                                     STARCK
                         It should be right there...

               She looks up, trails off...

                                     STARCK
                         My God.

               EXT. EVENT HORIZON - AGAINST NEPTUNE - MODEL STARCK'S POV

               ...the clouds break, revealing...

               THE EVENT HORIZON, right in front of them. A black 
               labyrinthine blasphemy against Neptune's arctic blue. Cloud 
               banks encircle the ship as if it were the eye of a hurricane.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARKE - BRIDGE

               EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - DWARFED BY EVENT HORIZON - MODEL

               The Event Horizon looms enormous as the Lewis and Clark hangs 
               off the port stern, dwarfed by the giant ship.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

               The turbulence subsides. The bridge crew stares at the massive 
               craft. The only sound, the PROXIMITY WARNING. Finally:

                                     SMITH
                         Jesus, that is one big ugly fat 
                         fucker...

                                     WEIR
                         She's not ugly.

               Miller reaches over Smith's shoulder, turns off the proximity 
               warning. Smith snaps back to business.

                                     SMITH
                         Range 500 meters and holding. 
                         Turbulence is dropping off...

                         Picking up magnetic interference.

                         Put it through TACS. Smith, you up 
                         for a flyby?

                                     SMITH
                              (he is not)
                         Love to.

               EXT. NEPTUNE - LEWIS AND CLARK - EVENT HORIZON - MODEL

               The Lewis and Clark maneuvers in close to the Event Horizon, 
               dwarfed by the dark ship.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

               Smith keeps a tight hand on the controls. The crew stare out 
               the viewport at the abandoned craft.

                                     STARCK
                         Look at the size of that thing.

               Weir explains the view out the cockpit window.

                                     WEIR
                         Foredecks. Crew quarters, bridge, 
                         medical and science labs, hydroponics, 
                         what have you. That central section 
                         connects the forward decks to the 
                         Engineering containment area. Can we 
                         move in closer?

                                     SMITH
                         Shit, Doc, any closer and we're gonna 
                         need a rubber...

                                     MILLER
                         Do it.

               Smith grimaces. His hands move carefully over the controls.

               EXT. NEPTUNE - LEWIS AND CLARK - EVENT HORIZON - MODEL

               The Lewis and Clark moves even closer. Vanishing into the 
               shadow of the Event Horizon.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

               The crew stares at the ship rushing past the viewport. A 
               huge spherical structure looms eerily ahead.

                                     WEIR
                         That's the engineering containment. 
                         And there's the main airlock. We can 
                         dock there.

                                     MILLER
                         Smith, use the arm and lock us onto 
                         that antennae cluster.

                                     WEIR
                         Be careful. It's not a load bearing 
                         structure...

               EXT. EVENT HORIZON - LEWIS AND CLARK - MODEL

               The Lewis and Clark carefully maneuvers in close to the Event 
               Horizon's airlock.

               A mechanical boom-arm extends from the smaller ship to latch 
               onto the Event Horizon. Its clawed hand grabs the antennae 
               cluster. The cluster buckles under the stress.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

                                     SMITH
                              (to Weir)
                         It is now.
                              (to Miller)
                         We're locked in.

                                     MILLER
                         Starck, give me a read.

               A scan of the Event Horizon appears across Starck's screen.

                                     STARCK
                         The reactor's still hot. We've got 
                         several small radiation sources, 
                         leaks probably. Nothing serious.

                                     WEIR
                         Do they have pressure?

                                     STARCK
                         Affirmative. The hull's intact... 
                         but there's no gravity and the thermal 
                         units are off line. I'm showing deep 
                         cold. The crew couldn't survive unless 
                         they were in stasis.

                                     MILLER
                         Find 'em, Starck.

               Starck frowns at her display.

                                     STARCK
                         Something's wrong with the bio-scan.

                                     MILLER
                         Radiation interference?

                                     STARCK
                         There's not enough radiation to throw 
                         off the scan. I'm picking up trace 
                         life forms, but I can't get a lock 
                         on the location.

                                     WEIR
                         Could it be the crew? If they were 
                         in suspended animation, wouldn't 
                         that effect the scan?

                                     STARCK
                         If they were in stasis, I'd get a 
                         location, but these readings, they're 
                         all over the ship. It doesn't make 
                         any sense.

                                     MILLER
                         Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by 
                         deck, room by room. Starck, deploy 
                         the umbilicus. I believe you're up 
                         for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your 
                         bonnet on.

                                     JUSTIN
                         Yes, sir!

               Weir starts to follow Justin from the bridge.

                                     MILLER
                         Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.

                                     WEIR
                         Captain, I didn't come out here to 
                         sit on your bridge, I need to be on 
                         that ship...

                                     MILLER
                         Once the ship is secured, we'll bring 
                         you on board --

                                     WEIR
                              (interrupting)
                         That is not acceptable --

                                     MILLER
                              (overlapping)
                         -- once we've secured the ship, that's 
                         the way it is!
                              (beat)
                         I need you to guide us from the comm 
                         station. This is where I need you. 
                         Help us to do our job.

               Weir exhales.

                                     WEIR
                         Very well.

               The docking collar umbilicus extends to the Event Horizon's 
               airlock.

               Miller, Peters, Justin and Cooper in EVA; Cooper and Justin, 
               without headgear.

                         ...come on, Skipper, I already put 
                         my shoes on...

                                     MILLER

                         You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's 
                         Justin's turn. Stay on station. If 
                         anything happens...

                         I'll be all over it.

               Miller nods to Peters.

                                     PETERS
                              (muffled)
                         Opening inner airlock door.

               The inner airlock door opens: CH-THUNK. Miller, Peters and 
               Justin enter the airlock. Justin attaches his safety line. 
               Miller and Peters do not.

                                     COOPER
                         You still need the rope? I thought 
                         you were one a those spacemen with 
                         ice in ya veins.

                                     JUSTIN
                         I'd rather be on the rope and not 
                         need it than need it and not have 
                         it. Now step aside, old man.

               Cooper puts Justin's helmet on. It seals tight.

                                     COOPER
                              (serious now)
                         You just keep your nose clean, Baby 
                         Bear. Clear the door.

               Cooper backs out, allowing the inner airlock door to shut, 
               ECHOING through the ship.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - UMBILICUS

               Miller, Peters and Justin float down the brightly lit 
               umbilicus into the Event Horizon, all in EVA suits. Justin's 
               safety line trails out behind him.

               The OUTER AIRLOCK DOOR of the Event Horizon waits for them.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

               Weir has taken over Justin's station. He watches the POV 
               monitors like a kid watching Christmas. Smith and Starck 
               keep tabs over his shoulder.

               Peters attaches a thumper -- a device using sound waves to 
               measure pressure -- to the inner airlock door.

                                     PETERS
                         We've got pressure.

                                     MILLER
                         Clear and open on my mark. Three... 
                         two... one... mark.

               Peters inserts a zero-G drill into the panel beside the door. 
               The door slowly opens...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - WITH AIRLOCKS

               The immense corridor stretches away into darkness in both 
               directions. Distantly spaced windows manifest as remote pools 
               of blue light amidst endless black, adding to the vast sense 
               of scale.

               The light from their dual spotlights on the team's helmets 
               reflects off tiny ice crystals of frozen atmosphere. They 
               are ants in a tomb built for giants.

                                     PETERS
                         Jesus its huge.

                                     MILLER
                         Ice crystals everywhere. This place 
                         is a deep freeze.

                                     WEIR (O.S.)
                              (radio)
                         You're in the central corridor. It 
                         connects the personnel areas to 
                         Engineering.

                                     MILLER
                         Peters and I will search the forward 
                         decks. Justin, take Engineering. No 
                         hot-dogging, not on this one, alright?

                                     JUSTIN
                         Not a chance, sir.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

               The group separates. Justin kicks off from the wall, shoots 
               down the corridor at immense speed.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - WITH AIRLOCKS

               Miller and Peters move in the opposite direction. They use 
               magnetic plates on their boots and gloves to cling to the 
               walls as they slowly make their way down the dark shaft. 
               Their journey seems endless. The darkness almost seems a 
               living thing as it surrounds them.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

               Miller spots something at a coupling, where two sections of 
               the corridor join...

                                     MILLER
                         Dr. Weir, what's this?

               Miller indicates a box nestled against the coupling. The 
               universal symbol for explosives is on the cover.

                                     PETERS
                              (ahead at the next 
                              coupling)
                         Here's another one. They're all over 
                         the place.

                                     WEIR (O.S.)
                              (radio)
                         They're explosive charges.

                                     MILLER
                         I can see that, what're they for?

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

                                     WEIR
                         In an emergency, the charges detonate 
                         in series, destroying the central 
                         section and separating the personnel 
                         areas from the rest of the ship. 
                         That way, if the gravity drive 
                         malfunctions, the crew could use the 
                         foredecks as a lifeboat.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

               Peters and Miller keep moving.

                                     PETERS
                         That means they didn't abandon ship.

                                     MILLER
                         So where are they? Starck, any luck 
                         with the bio-scan?

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

                                     STARCK
                         I'm running diagnostics now, 
                         Skipper... Nothing's wrong with the 
                         sensor pack, I'm still getting trace 
                         life readings, all over the ship.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

               Miller and Peters unconsciously look around. Sweat beads 
               their faces.

                                     PETERS
                         There's no one in the corridor but 
                         us.

                                     STARCK (O.S.)
                              (radio)
                         Not according to the computer.

                                     MILLER
                         Peters is right, no one's here.

                                     PETERS
                         I don't know, this place is really 
                         dark, I can't see a thing...

               She starts to wave her searchlight around wildly.

                                     MILLER
                              (calming her down)
                         Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. 
                         Let's finish the sweep.

                                     WEIR (O.S.)
                              (radio)
                         Captain Miller, the foredecks are 
                         just ahead.

                                     PETERS
                         I can see the hatch.

                                     MILLER
                         Starck, you still showing those 
                         readings?

                                     STARCK (O.S.)
                              (radio)
                         That's an affirmative.

                                     MILLER
                              (to Peters)
                         Keep your eyes open.

               She nods as he reaches for the hatch...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY

               The hatch opens, allowing Peters and Miller entrance into 
               the forward decks. These areas were intended for human 
               habitation, and seem similar in design to the Lewis and Clark, 
               only larger.

               Gravity couches line both walls, eighteen in all. Empty.

                                     PETERS
                         We found the gravity couches.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

               Weir peers eagerly at the monitors.

                         Any survivors?

                         They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving 
                         forward.

               Miller and Peters split up, each taking a separate exit from 
               the chamber.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

               Weir looks at Justin's POV screen: a grainy image of the 
               First Containment Seal.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR (BY FIRST SEAL)

               Justin stands before a thick pressure door. Justin checks 
               the door with his thumper, his boots are now on.

                         You've reached the First Containment 
                         Seal. The engineering decks are on 
                         the other side.

                                     JUSTIN
                         We still have pressure. The radiation 
                         count's steady at 7 millirads an 
                         hour.

               Justin touches a panel beside the door. It opens. He enters...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - FIRST CONTAINMENT

               ...a long corridor shaped like a tube. It rotates like a 
               turbine, causing vertigo. Justin's BREATH echoes in his helmet 
               as he moves forward...

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK BAY

               Cooper stares at Justin's safety line in the airlock.

               THE SAFETY LINE

               counts off silently, passing 150 meters...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR TO BRIDGE

               The corridor ends at a pressure door.

                                     PETERS
                         Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?

                                     WEIR (O.S.)

                         You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. 
                         You still haven't seen any crew?

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

               Miller, moving through a deserted lab. Empty operating tables. 
               Stainless steel surgical instruments float in zero-G. A glove 
               floats up behind him, brushes his shoulder. He wheels... the 
               glove is empty. It spins away.

                                     MILLER
                         If we saw any crew, Doctor, you'd 
                         know about it.

                         looks like this place has never been

               He finds a computer console.

               Peters opens the door.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE ANTECHAMBER

               Peters enters. Looks around: a small antechamber for crew 
               briefings, with chairs and a display table. Red crystals 
               float in a crimson mist around her.

                                     PETERS
                         I found something.

               Weir peers at the monitors, trying to make out the red haze.

                         Yes, we can see some kind of mist. 
                         What is that?

                         There's no one here.

                         The blood came from somewhere,

                         There's no one here, Skipper.

               Peters takes a sample container from her belt. Carefully 
               tries to capture a suspended crystal...

                                     PETERS
                         Come on...

               CLOSE UP OF THE BLOOD CRYSTAL

               and the Container; Peters' brow furrowed with concentration.

               WIDER AS A FLASH OF BLUE LIGHTNING ILLUMINATES THE ROOM, 
               REVEALING...

               ...THE WALL BEHIND PETERS, CASED IN A FROZEN EXPLOSION OF 
               BLOOD AND TISSUE. Someone died here in a violent and terrible 
               way.

               Peters starts to look up but the flash dies away. She never 
               saw the horror behind her.

               Peters turns her attention back to her tiny crystal. She 
               traps the it, returns the container to her belt.

               She moves from the antechamber into...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Her helmet lights sweep the room. Every surface a control 
               panel.

                                     PETERS
                         Okay. I'm on the bridge.

               Peters examines the other consoles -- most are dark but for 
               a few dim lights.

                                     PETERS

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Peters reaches towards a small video deck. Touches the eject 
               button. Nothing happens.

                                     PETERS
                         It's stuck.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - FIRST CONTAINMENT

               Justin's light bounces off an even larger pressure door, 
               built like a bank vault. The Second Seal.

                                     JUSTIN
                         I've reached another containment 
                         door. This thing's huge...

                              (radio)
                         That's the Second Containment Seal. 
                         Beyond that, engineering.

                                     JUSTIN
                         I'm going in.

               Justin opens the seal. It releases SLOWLY, inching open. 
               Justin squeezes through.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Peters takes a small probe from her belt, inserts it into 
               the video deck.

               A small laser disc emerges partway from the deck. Peters 
               pulls on it. It doesn't move.

                                     PETERS
                         It's really jammed in there.

               A shadow crosses the window behind her. Someone -- something -- 
               is in there with her...

               Peters pulls harder. Nothing. Another effort. The disc pulls 
               free. Peters spins in the zero-gravity, spinning into...

               ...A BODY floating at the helm, the face illuminated by 
               Peters' helmet lights. His swollen tongue clogs his gaping, 
               screaming mouth. His cracked and crystallized skin is crossed 
               by a network of bloated veins. He has no eyes. Just like 
               Weir's dream.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

               Peters' monitor shows the CORPSE'S face, its mouth open in 
               mute agony. Weir GASPS.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Peters pushes free of the body.

                         Decompression wouldn't do that.

               Weir just stares at the ruined face, rapt. Starck notices.

                                     STARCK
                         You okay?

               Weir nods, not taking his eyes from the screen.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               An alcove, opening into a vast chamber. Once pristine, all 
               the surfaces have been coated in a dark gray slick. Globules 
               of fluid hang motionless, sticking to Justin's suit, leeching 
               away his light and swallowing him in darkness.

                         I'm in the Second Containment area. 
                         It's pitch black in here. There must 
                         have been a coolant leak. Man, this 
                         shit is everywhere. I can't see a 
                         damn thing.

               A lighted console blocks Justin's view of the chamber beyond. 
               He drifts over to it, wipes the console clear of coolant, 
               revealing dim lights: the station has power.

               JUSTIN'S POV - THE CORE

               A massive sphere, 10 meters in diameter, dominates the center 
               of the second containment. Intricate machinery surrounds the 
               sphere but the globe itself is featureless, smooth; a 
               enigmatic monolith. Black ice encrusts it, giving it the 
               seeming of a living thing.

                         Boarding party, sound off... Peters, 
                         do you read me... . Peters...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Peters' light, too, remains dark, but Neptune's blue light 
               fills the Bridge. The frozen corpse floats before her. No 
               longer a man.

               A young boy, maybe five years old. His legs are withered, 
               useless things. The skin remains a crystallized surface, but 
               the eyes look straight at her, alive.

                                     PETERS
                         Denny...

               Peters reaches out to touch the body. It falls away from 
               her. No longer her son, but the body of the astronaut. It 
               hits the door and shatters.

                         ...Peters, do you read me...

               A MAN'S VOICE, in agony, CRACKLES over Miller's radio:

                                     VOICE

                         Justin...!

               Miller trails off as RED LIGHT flickers across his visor. He 
               turns...

               MILLER

               A BURNING MAN stands in Medical/Science, a human body wreathed 
               in flame. The eyes are like sunspots. As the Burning Man 
               moves, bones and black flesh poke through the fire. He raises 
               one hand to point at Miller in accusation...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

               Miller's BREATH stops in his throat. His mouth works but 
               nothing comes out. He BLINKS...

               ...and the VISION is gone. Miller is alone, BREATHING hard.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - FIRST CONTAINMENT

               Cooper enters at full speed, shooting through in a controlled 
               fall...

               ...into the Second Containment. He catches himself at the 
               console. Cooper sees Justin's safety line, cut off abruptly 
               by the darkness of the Core.

                                     COOPER
                         Oh my God...

               The darkness of the Core ripples...

               Justin suddenly emerges from the darkness, a white figure 
               riding a wave of impenetrable blackness.

               Cooper catches him, holds him tight as the wave carries them 
               towards the wall. Cooper sees a control rod -- a long metal 
               spike -- coming at them. He twists his body so that they 
               miss -- barely -- before slamming into the wall.

                                     COOPER
                         Justin, do you read me? Justin... .

               Cooper pulls Justin close. Justin's head lolls to one side. 
               Unconscious.

                                     COOPER
                         Baby Bear, don't do this. Don't do

               The second wave hits. Sparks fly as consoles EXPLODE. Deep 
               in the ship metal SCREAMS, followed by the SHRIEK of escaping 
               atmosphere. An emergency klaxon RINGS out: PRESSURE WARNING.

               Starck checks Justin's station:

               The Bridge pressure door begins to close...and then stop.

               Starck pushes Weir ahead of her, Smith follows hard as they 
               run the length of the ship for the airlock bay.

                                     STARCK
                         I thought of that, with the filters 
                         from the Clark, we've got enough 
                         breathable air for twenty hours. 
                         After that, we'd better be on our 
                         way home.

                                     MILLER
                         What about the life readings you 
                         picked up?

                                     STARCK
                         The Event Horizon sensors show the 
                         same thing: "Bio-readings of 
                         indeterminate origin." Right before 
                         that wave hit the Clark, there was 
                         some kind of surge, right off the 
                         scale, but now it's back to its 
                         previous levels.

                                     MILLER
                         What's causing the readings?

                                     STARCK
                         I don't know, but whatever it is, 
                         it's not the crew.

                                     MILLER
                         So where is the rest of the crew? 
                         We've been over every inch of this 
                         ship and all we've found is blood. 
                         Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?

               Weir just stares at the bloodstained wall.

                                     MILLER
                         What happened here?

               Miller follows Weir's gaze to the wall: a Rorschach test in 
               blood...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE WINDOW

               PULL BACK from the bridge windows TO REVEAL...

               EXT. EVENT HORIZON - LEWIS AND CLARK - MODEL

               ...the Event Horizon in all its horrific glory, hanging skew 
               in the center of the hurricane like a mote in God's eye.

               The Lewis and Clark clings to the giant craft, as 
               insignificant as a tick. An even smaller figure clings to 
               the hull of the Lewis and Clark...

               EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - HULL SECTION

               It's Smith, EVA in full protective gear. His magnetic boots 
               hold him to the Lewis and Clark's hull. He kneels over a 
               hole in the hull, where the metal has buckled and torn. Vapor 
               still leaks from the hole into space.

                                     SMITH
                         Captain Miller, you copy?

                                     MILLER (O.S.)
                              (radio)
                         I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?

                                     SMITH
                         I've found a six inch fracture in 
                         the outer hull. We should be able to 
                         repair it and re-pressurize, it's 
                         gonna take some time.

                                     MILLER (O.S.)
                              (radio)
                         We don't have time, Smith. In twenty 
                         hours we run out of air.

                                     SMITH
                         Understood.

               Smith uses a foam applicator to fill the hole. The gel freezes 
               in place. Smith reaches to his belt, pulls out a ZERO-G 
               NAILGUN. Presses it to the patch and begins to rivet it into 
               place.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

               Justin lies unmoving on a table. His eyes are open, staring 
               at a smear of blood on the ceiling.

               A needle slides into the skin below his eye. He doesn't 
               respond.

               DJ removes the needle. It glistens with blood. He looks up 
               at Miller and Peters.

                                     MILLER
                         How is he?

                                     DJ
                         His vitals are stable, but he's 
                         unresponsive to stimuli. He might 
                         wake up in fifteen minutes. He might 
                         not wake up at all.

                                     PETERS
                         What happened to him?

               DJ shakes his head. Miller eyes the bloodstain above them.

                                     MILLER
                         DJ, take samples from these stains, 
                         compare them to medical records, I 
                         want to know whose blood this is.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Gravity has scattered debris and freeze-dried blood about 
               the room. The crew (Justin and Smith excepted) tries to relax 
               on the chairs of dead men. Their faces are wan and haggard.

               Weir relaxes at the table. Unlike the others, he seems almost 
               at ease. DJ remains forever stoic; Starck, animated and 
               nervous. Cooper bounces the handball on the floor, a reflex 
               action.

               Miller stares at a video monitor, watching Smith repair the 
               Lewis and Clark. He turns from the window.

                                     MILLER
                         Okay, people, there's been a change 
                         in the mission. In less than eighteen 
                         hours, we will run out of breathable 
                         air. Our primary objective is now 
                         survival. That means we focus on 
                         repairing the Lewis and Clark and 
                         salvaging whatever will buy us more 
                         time.
                              (pause)
                         Our secondary objective is finding 
                         out what happened to this ship and 
                         its crew. Two months from now, I 
                         fully intend to be standing in front 
                         of the good Admiral giving my report, 
                         and I'd like to have more than my 
                         dick in my hands.

               Grim smiles all around.

                                     MILLER
                         Peters, I want you to go through the 
                         ship's log, see if we can't find 
                         some answers.

                                     PETERS
                         I can use the station in Medical, 
                         keep an eye on Justin...

                                     MILLER
                         Fine. Starck, I want you to repeat 
                         the bio-scan...

                                     STARCK
                         What's the point? I'll just get the 
                         same thing...

                                     MILLER
                         Not acceptable. I want to know what's 
                         causing those readings. If the crew 
                         is dead, I want the bodies, I want 
                         the crew found.

                                     STARCK
                         I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, 
                         amylase proteins.

                                     MILLER
                         Do it. Dr. Weir...

                                     WEIR
                         Yes.

                                     MILLER
                         One of my men is down. I want to 
                         know what happened to him.

                                     COOPER
                         I told you. He was inside the Core...

               Weir starts shaking his head.

                                     COOPER
                         It was like... nothing was there... 
                         and then Justin appeared and the 
                         Core... became metal...

                                     WEIR
                              (cutting him off)
                         No, he didn't.

                                     COOPER
                         You weren't there. I saw it.

                                     WEIR
                         Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you 
                         really see, because what you're 
                         describing is not physically 
                         possible...

               Cooper throws the ball at him, hard. Weir ducks. It bounces 
               wildly around the room. Miller catches it.

                                     MILLER
                         Cooper! Enough!

               Cooper sits down.

                                     MILLER
                              (turning on Weir)
                         Dr. Weir, Justin may die. Whatever 
                         happened to him could happen to all 
                         of us.

               Beat.

                                     WEIR
                         I don't know what happened to Justin.

                                     COOPER
                         I'm telling you, I saw it...

                                     WEIR
                         What you saw could have been an 
                         optical effect caused by gravitational 
                         distortion.

                                     COOPER
                              (turning on Weir)
                         I know what I saw and it wasn't a 
                         fucking "optical effect!"

                                     MILLER
                         Hold on, what's this "gravitational 
                         distortion?"

                                     WEIR
                         It's possible that a burst of gravity 
                         waves escaped from the Core, 
                         distorting space-time. They could be 
                         what hit the Lewis and Clark.

                                     MILLER
                         What could cause them?
                              (Weir doesn't answer)
                         What's in the Core?

                                     WEIR
                         It's complicated...

                                     MILLER
                         How much time do you need? We have 
                         seventeen hours and forty-two minutes. 
                         Now: what is in the Core?

               Beat. Here comes another bomb...

                                     WEIR
                         A black hole.

               The crew stares at him, stunned.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               Miller, Starck and Weir stand before the Core. Dark ominous 
               structures loom around them, glistening with coolant. The 
               PULSE of the ship is loud here, a deep THRUM that steals 
               their breath. Weir's voice is a reverent WHISPER:

                                     WEIR
                         That's how the gravity drive works, 
                         you see: it focuses the black hole's 
                         immense gravitational power to create 
                         the gateway. That's how the Event 
                         Horizon travels faster than light.

                                     STARCK
                         I can't believe we built this.

                                     MILLER
                         It's insane.

                                     WEIR
                         "Insane?" The finest astronauts fought 
                         to be posted to this ship. It would 
                         take the Lewis and Clark a thousand 
                         years to reach our closest star. The 
                         Event Horizon could be there in a 
                         day...

                                     MILLER
                         If it worked.

                                     WEIR
                         If it worked, yes.

               They stare at the Core, the surrounding machinery moving in 
               a slow giant's dance. A trick of the eye, or does the Core

                         I want this room sealed. The Second 
                         Containment is off limits.

                                     WEIR
                         There's no danger. The black hole is 
                         contained behind three magnetic 
                         fields, it's under control.

                                     MILLER
                         Your black hole damn near ripped my 
                         ship apart. It may have killed one 
                         of my men.

               until its darkness fills the screen...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

               Peters sits before the computer workstation, running the 
               ship's log, forwarding through hours of boring footage. Rubs 
               her eyes.

               The lights flicker.

               Peters hears something RUSTLING behind her. She turns...

                                     PETERS
                         Justin...?

               Justin lies unmoving on the nearest examination table. 
               Comatose. Peters reaches out and picks up a scalpel.

               Peters hears the sound again, FINGERNAILS ON PLASTIC. She 
               moves past Justin...

               ...past several empty tables, covered with clear plastic...

               ...to the last table. She stares in shock.

               THERE'S SOMETHING UNDERNEATH THE PLASTIC COVER

               She slowly reaches out. Lifts the cover.

               Her son DENNY looks at her and GIGGLES. She GASPS. The scalpel 
               drops to the floor at her feet.

               Denny reaches up to her, to be picked up...

                                     DENNY
                         Mommy...

               ...but the plastic that still covers his withered legs squirms 
               like a bag full of snakes...

               Peters drops the plastic and backs away.

                                     DJ (O.S.)
                         Peters?

               She turns. DJ stands in the doorway, holding blood samples.

               Peters turns back, but her son is gone.

               DJ reads her expression.

                                     DJ
                         What's wrong?

                                     PETERS
                         Nothing. It's nothing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Smith enters. He closes the Outer Airlock door. Atmosphere

                         You been out there a long time. Trying 
                         to break my record?

                                     SMITH
                         I'd rather spend the next twelve 
                         hours Outside than another five 
                         minutes in this can. This ship is 
                         bad. It watches you.

                                     COOPER
                         What?

                         You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: 
                         trying to go faster'n light, that's 
                         like the Tower of Babel.

                                     COOPER
                         Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical 
                         on me.

                                     SMITH
                         You know what happened to the Tower 
                         of Babel, don't you? It fell down.

               Starck programs the sensor workstation. She glances over at 
               Weir: sitting at a computer terminal, his face rapt as data 
               flashes by. His lips move, muttering to himself.

                                     STARCK
                         Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.

                                     WEIR
                         Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved 
                         the Event Horizon more than I loved 
                         her. I told her that wasn't true, I 
                         just knew the Event Horizon better, 
                         that's all.

                                     STARCK
                         Claire is your wife?

                                     WEIR
                         Yes.

                                     STARCK
                         It must be hard, being so far away 
                         from her.

                                     WEIR
                         Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years 
                         now.

                                     STARCK
                         I'm sorry.

               Weir keeps his attention focused on the screen.

                                     WEIR
                         These things happen.

                              on the screen)
                         Wait a minute, that's not right...

               He fingers fly across the keyboard, double-checking the data.

               Miller leans over Weir's shoulder.

                                     MILLER
                         You have something, Dr. Weir?

                         The date.

                                     MILLER
                         What about it?

                                     WEIR
                         The Event Horizon's computer think's 
                         it's 2034.

                                     WEIR
                         Exactly. The ship's internal clock 
                         is off by seven years.

                                     STARCK
                         Maybe a power interruption crashed 
                         the system...

                                     WEIR
                         No, there's no evidence of a surge 
                         or spike of any kind. It's as if 
                         time just... stopped for seven years.

                                     MILLER
                         Explanation?

                         Intense gravitational fields effect 
                         the passage of time, it's possible...

                         what really happened...
                              (he shakes his head)
                         The Event Horizon has passed beyond 
                         our plane of reality, and like 
                         Lazarus, returned from the dead.

               when Miller stops him. He checks a Geiger counter. It is 
               silent.

                                     MILLER
                         No radiation. What's causing the 
                         drain?

               Weir crosses to a console. Frowns.

                                     WEIR
                              (shakes his head)
                         The magnetic fields are holding. 
                         Maybe a short in the fail-safe 
                         circuit. I'll check it out.

               Miller assists Weir in removing bolts from an access panel. 
               The panel falls away, revealing a cramped duct leading into 
               the ship's circuitry.

               Weir climbs into the duct. Miller hands him a flashlight and 
               a toolkit.

                                     MILLER
                         We don't get the power back, our 
                         air's gonna go bad.

                                     WEIR
                         Check the Core for radiation. Carbon 
                         dioxide may be the least of our 
                         worries.

               Weir begins to crawl into the depths of the ship.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - WEIR'S DUCT

               Weir's breath ECHOES in the cramped shaft. He counts off 
               circuit panels as he goes:

                                     WEIR
                         E-three... E-five... E-seven... where 
                         are you...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               Miller slogs through the coolant to the Core. Stares at it. 
               It remains metallic, mundane.

               He pulls out a Geiger counter and crosses to the reactor 
               shell. Examines a gleaming weld. The Geiger counter CLICKS 
               slowly: no leak.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               A yellow light starts flashing on the engineering board. 
               Starck's eyes widen: the engineering sections flash 
               yellow...and green...

                                     STARCK
                         What the hell...

               STARCK'S POV

               as the bio-scan goes wild.

                                     STARCK
                              (into intercom)
                         Skipper, the bio-scan just went off 
                         the scale...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

               Justin shakes on the bed in an epileptic fit. DJ rushes to 
               him.

                                     DJ
                         Justin! Can you hear me? Justin!

               Justin's eyes remain unfocused, unseeing as he tries to speak.

               DJ leans in close, trying to hear him speak...

               Justin arches in agony and the words come in a strangled, 
               tortured voice:

                                     JUSTIN
                         THE DARK IS COMING...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - WEIR'S DUCT

               Weir stops before module E-12. Hears a faint HISSING and 
               POPPING.

                                     WEIR
                         There you are.

               He uses a screwdriver to open up the module. Reveals a series 
               of circuit boards. One SPARKS. Weir plucks the damaged chips 
               and starts running a by-pass.

               His flashlight flickers. He bangs it against the duct wall. 
               It grows dimmer. Goes out.

                                     WEIR
                         Um. Captain Miller? I, uh, I seem to 
                         have a problem with my light.

               A single DRIP of water in the darkness...

                                     WEIR
                              (beat, hushed)
                         Captain Miller?

               Another DRIP, then a woman's VOICE like a distant echo:

                                     VOICE
                         Billy.

               Weir starts at the sound. He recognizes the voice.

               She speaks again, no longer far away, but a close WHISPER in 
               his ear:

                                     CLAIRE (O.S.)
                         Billy. Help me. I'm so cold.

               Weir's eyes open wide in hope and fear.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               Even the emergency lights go out. Total darkness.

                                     MILLER
                         We just lost all power in here. Dr. 
                         Weir...?

               Miller's voice trails off as he looks towards the Core. A 
               red glow reflects across his eyes. He takes a few steps away 
               from the reactor. He stares...

               ...at the BURNING MAN, standing before the Core. The deep 
               ROAR of its conflagration fills the containment.

               It slowly turns and raises its arm and points at Miller in 
               accusation.

                                     BURNING MAN
                         Don't leave me...

               Miller stares as the Burning Man turns and vanishes into a 
               bulkhead, leaving the wall blackened and burned with his 
               passing.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - WEIR'S DUCT

               Total darkness. Weir's breath ECHOES in the cramped metal 
               space.

                                     WEIR
                              (a whisper)
                         Claire...?

               Weir bangs his flashlight. Again. Again...

                                     CLAIRE (O.S.)
                         Help me. I'm so cold.

               The flashlight flickers...

               Claire's face is inches from Weir's.

                                     CLAIRE
                         So cold.

               His flashlight flickers again, snaps on...

               She is gone. Weir lets his head fall to the floor of the 
               deck, breathing in ragged SOBS.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE ANTECHAMBER

               The crew, except for Cooper. DJ whets a scalpel against the 
               leg of his jumpsuit, an unconscious gesture. FLICK. FLICK. 
               FLICK.

                                     DJ
                         Carbon dioxide poisoning produces 
                         hallucinations, impaired judgement...

                                     MILLER
                         Goddammit, DJ, it was not a 
                         hallucination! I saw a man, he was 
                         on fire. And then he disappeared.

                                     STARCK
                         Maybe one of the original crew?

                                     MILLER
                         No. It was someone else.

                                     STARCK
                         Who?

                                     MILLER
                              (ignoring the question)
                         Dr. Weir, you were right there, you 
                         must have heard something, seen 
                         something...

                                     WEIR
                         No. I saw nothing.

                                     PETERS
                         I did.

               All heads turn to her.

                                     PETERS
                         About an hour ago. In medical. I saw 
                         my son. He was lying on one of the 
                         examination tables and his legs 
                         were...
                              (she trails off)

                                     WEIR
                         Isn't it possible that you were 
                         traumatized by finding the body on 
                         the bridge?

                                     PETERS
                         I've seen bodies before. This is 
                         different.

               She falls silent, unwilling to say more.

                                     MILLER
                         Peters is right. Its like something 
                         reaching into your mind. Seeing your 
                         thoughts and making them real. Smith, 
                         did you or Cooper experience anything 
                         unusual?

               Smith, leaning against the doorway:

                                     SMITH
                         I didn't see anything and I don't 
                         have to see anything. This ship is 
                         fucked.

                                     WEIR
                         Thank you for that scientific 
                         analysis, Mister Smith.

                                     SMITH
                              (exploding)
                         Hey! You don't need to be a scientist 
                         figure it out...

                                     MILLER
                         Smith...

               Weir's face is stone.

                                     SMITH
                         ...you break all the laws of physics, 
                         you think there won't be a price? 
                         You already killed the first crew...

                                     MILLER
                         That's enough!

               DJ lays one hand on Smith's shoulder to calm him...

               Smith reacts violently, turning on DJ, shoving him back. DJ 
               uses Smith's momentum to spin the pilot into the wall. He 
               presses his scalpel just below Smith's ear...

                                     MILLER
                         DJ!!

               DJ freezes. The scalpel falls from his hands. He releases 
               Smith.

                                     DJ
                         I'm sorry, I... I don't know why I 
                         did that.

                                     WEIR
                              (wry)
                         Carbon dioxide.

               Smith goes for Weir.

                                     SMITH
                         He's fucking lying, you know 
                         something...!

               Miller heads him off, grabs him.

                                     MILLER
                         That's it, that's enough for one 
                         day, Smith! I need you back on the 
                         Clark, I need you calm, I need you 
                         using your head, you make a mistake 
                         out there, none of are getting home, 
                         you understand?

               Smith calms.

                                     SMITH
                         Sir.

                                     MILLER
                         Get outside, go back to work. I'll 
                         join you shortly.

               Smith leaves.

                                     MILLER
                         We're a long way from home and we're 
                         in a bad place. Let's not make it 
                         worse. If anyone has any constructive 
                         suggestions, now is the time.

                                     WEIR
                         I think I can stabilize the fields 
                         around the singularity, that should 
                         prevent another power drain.

                                     MILLER
                         Do it.

                                     DJ
                         To conserve our oxygen, we should 
                         severely restrict our activity. Anyone 
                         who can should get some sleep.

                                     MILLER
                         I don't need sleep, DJ. I need 
                         answers.

               Miller exits. Starck follows.

                         origin," don't you have anything 
                         useful to tell me?

                                     STARCK
                         I've got a theory.

               Miller stops.

                                     MILLER
                         Go ahead.

                                     STARCK
                         There was a another surge in the bio-
                         readings right before you... you saw 
                         what you saw. We picked up a similar 
                         readings right before the Clarke was 
                         damaged. What if there were a 
                         connection between the two? The 
                         gravity waves, the hallucination, 
                         all part of an defensive reaction, 
                         like an immune system...

               Miller starts walking again.

                                     MILLER
                         I don't need to hear this.

               She rushes to follow.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 2

               Miller and Starck enter the Airlock Bay:

                                     STARCK
                         You've got to listen...

                                     MILLER
                         To what? What are you saying? This 
                         ship is alive?

                                     STARCK
                         I didn't say that, I said the bio-
                         readings correspond to what happened 
                         to you, the ship is reacting to us...

                                     MILLER
                         We're hanging on by our fingernails 
                         and you're giving me bullshit 
                         stories...

               She grabs him by the arm.

                                     STARCK
                         It's not bullshit, it's the only 
                         conclusion the data supports...

                                     MILLER
                         Starck, do you know how crazy that 
                         sounds? It's impossible.

                                     STARCK
                         I know that.

               Beat. Miller allows himself to relax.

                                     MILLER
                         If you knew it was impossible, then 
                         why'd you waste my time?

                                     STARCK
                         I thought you wanted an answer. And 
                         that's the only one I have.

               Miller pulls an EVA suit from the wall, starts putting it 
               on.

                                     MILLER
                         What I want is to survive the next 
                         ten hours.

                                     STARCK
                              (checks her watch)
                         Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.

                                     MILLER
                         I'm going outside to work on the 
                         Clark. And Starck... don't tell anyone 
                         what you just told me. We've got 
                         enough to worry about.

               She nods. He locks his helmet into place.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Establish.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GENERIC CORRIDOR

               The ship seems to breathe. The lights flicker...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - WITH AIRLOCKS

               ANOTHER ANGLE. The ship seems to breathe. The lights 
               flicker...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

               ANOTHER ANGLE. The ship seems to breathe. The lights 
               flicker...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

               Peters has fallen asleep in her chair.

               On the threshold of hearing, a distant POUNDING. Not a 
               heartbeat. Metal on metal. Something trying to get out. 
               Something trying to get in.

               Peters wakes with a start.

                                     PETERS
                         Justin...?

               She turns. Justin lies on the floor in a heap, completely 
               covered by his sheet. She crosses to him. Pulls back the 
               sheet...

               Revealing empty nitrogen tanks.

                                     PETERS
                         Justin!

               She looks up, eyes widening, as...

               The IV bottles fill with blood. Blood fills the X-ray 
               lightboxes, it surges up from gutters in the floor...

               And the pounding grows louder... LOUDER... almost to 
               Medical...

               The spell breaks and she RUNS...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GENERIC CORRIDOR

               Peters sprints, the SOUND BOOMING after her, almost on her 
               heels...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE ANTECHAMBER

               Peters darts into the Bridge Antechamber. She SLAMS the 
               pressure door shut behind her, CUTTING OFF the sound.

               She turns. Weir, DJ, Starck look up from their work, staring 
               at her.

                                     DJ
                         What's wrong?

                                     PETERS
                         You didn't hear it? You must have 
                         heard it!

                                     STARCK
                         Heard what?

               Beat. Peters starts to LAUGH, part hysteria, part relief.

                                     PETERS
                         Oh... nothing...

               DJ crosses to Peters, concerned.

                                     DJ
                         Sit down...

               As he reaches out to touch her...

               BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. POUNDING ON THE DOOR ITSELF

               Peters SCREAMS. DJ clutches her to him, backs away from the 
               door.

               The POUNDING grows louder. LOUDER. The door vibrates with 
               each blow Starck puts her hands over her ears. Peters SCREAMS 
               at the door.

                                     PETERS
                         Stop it! Stop it!

               But the POUNDING intensifies, metal GROANING under incredible 
               pressure.

                                     DJ
                              (shouting to be heard)
                         What is it?

               Weir slowly walks to the door.

                                     STARCK
                         What are you doing?

                                     WEIR
                         It wants me. I have to go.

               He reaches for the door.

                                     STARCK
                         No...!

               Starck grabs him. He tries to shake her off, but she traps 
               his arm in a wrist-lock. He turns on her, his face furious...

               ...and the POUNDING stops. They remain frozen for a moment. 
               Afraid to breathe.

               Weir shakes the trance.

                                     STARCK
                         In our current environment, Dr. Weir, 
                         self-control is an asset.

                                     WEIR
                         I'm alright. Please.

               In the distance, the POUNDING begins again. Moving away from 
               them.

               The ship systems station BEEPS. A warning light flashes on 
               the console.

                                     STARCK
                         What is it?

                                     WEIR
                         The forward airlock.

                                     STARCK
                              (into radio)
                         Miller, Smith, Cooper, any of you in 
                         the airlock?

                                     MILLER (O.S.)
                              (radio)
                         That's a negative, Starck.

                                     PETERS
                              (realization)
                         Justin.

               Peters, Starck and DJ rush from the Bridge, leaving Weir 
               behind.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR NO. 2 - WITH 
               AIRLOCKS

               Peters leads Starck and DJ down the corridor towards the 
               Forward Airlock bay. They round a corner in time to see a 
               figure moving in the Airlock.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 3

               They race into the bay even as Justin steps into the Airlock. 
               He is naked.

                                     PETERS
                         Justin, no!

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 3

               Justin turns and stares through them with cold eyes. He 
               reaches out to the airlock control.

               The pressure door shuts with a HISS.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - HULL SECTION

               Miller, Smith and Cooper cling to the Lewis and Clark's hull. 
               They carefully remove an access panel, revealing scorched 
               wiring.

                                     COOPER
                         We'll have to re-route through the 
                         port conduit to the APU.

                                     SMITH
                         What about the accumulator...?

               Starck's VOICE breaks in:

                                     STARCK (O.S.)
                              (radio)
                         Miller, come in...

                                     MILLER
                         What's going on in there, Starck?

                                     STARCK (O.S.)
                              (radio)
                         Justin's in the airlock.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 3

               Starck at the intercom. The others huddle by the door.

                                     MILLER (O.S.)
                              (intercom)
                         What?

                                     STARCK
                         He's awake, he's in the airlock, 
                         he's not wearing a suit.

               EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - HULL SECTION

                                     MILLER
                              (to Cooper)
                         Stay here! Don't stop working!

                                     COOPER
                         But Justin...

                                     MILLER
                         I'll get him.

               Miller swings his body around, heads across the umbilicus to 
               the Event Horizon. He moves in great leaps, using the magnetic 
               plates in his gloves and boots to keep from drifting off 
               into Neptune's thin atmosphere.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 3

               Starck works the airlock control panel without success.

                                     STARCK
                         He's engaged the override.

                                     PETERS
                         Can you shut it down?

               She opens the Airlock access panel.

                                     STARCK
                         I'll try. DJ, you better get your 
                         bag of tricks.

               DJ nods, runs off. Peters bangs on the Airlock door.

                                     PETERS
                         Justin! Open the door!

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 3

               Peters' voice barely penetrates the pressure door:

                                     PETERS
                              (muffled)
                         Open the door!

               Justin turns off the artificial gravity. He begins to float 
               gently.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Miller moves like a frantic spider across the surface of the 
               Event Horizon.

                                     MILLER
                         I'm on my way, Starck.

                         override, we can't open the inner 
                         door.

               Miller curses under his breath, moves even faster...

                                                                   BACK TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 3

               Peters, against the window:

                                     PETERS
                              (muffled)
                         The door, Justin! Open the door!

               He fixes his gaze upon the outer airlock door. And beyond 
               it, space. He speaks in a flat monotone:

                                     JUSTIN
                         Did you hear it?

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 3

               They are stunned to hear his voice. Peters answers:

                                     PETERS
                         Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.

                                     STARCK
                         Keep him talking.

                                     PETERS
                         Do you know what it was?

                              (muffled)
                         It gets inside you. It shows you

                         words...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Weir sits alone, listening to the VOICES on the intercom.

                                     PETERS (O.S.)
                              (intercom)
                         What, Justin, what shows you?

                              (intercom)
                         It won't stop, it goes on and on and 
                         on...

                              (intercom)
                         The dark inside me.

               A LOW MOAN escapes Weir's lips. He cradles his head in his 
               hands.

               EXT. EVENT HORIZON - (MILLER'S CROSSING)

               Miller races across the surface of the Event Horizon, the 
               only sounds, his LABOURED BREATHING, and Justin's tortured 
               VOICE, patched through on his radio:

                                     JUSTIN (O.S.)
                              (radio)
                         ...It's inside and it eats and eats 
                         until there's nothing left.

                         "The dark inside..."? I don't 
                         understand.

                         The other crew, they're there, they're 
                         waiting for me. They're waiting for 
                         you. I won't go back there... I 
                         won't...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 3

               Peters presses her face against the Airlock window, trying 
               to calm him:

                                     PETERS
                         Justin, look at me. Look at me. Open 
                         this door.

               DJ runs up with his medkit.

                                     STARCK
                         I don't think she can talk him down. 
                         We need a sedative.

                                     DJ
                         If he opens the outer door he'll 
                         turn inside-out.

               Starck's hands fly as she re-wires the circuits. Sweat beads 
               her face.

                                     STARCK
                         Almost got it.

                         Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...

               Justin looks at her with dead eyes. He reaches out to gently 
               touch the glass between them.

                                     JUSTIN
                         If you could see the things I've 
                         seen, you wouldn't try to stop me. 
                         You'd come with me.

               Justin's hand moves to the OUTER AIRLOCK DOOR control. 
               Hesitates... then floats to the OUTER AIRLOCK control. Hits 
               it.

                                     PETERS
                              (muffled)
                         NOOO!

               A yellow warning light flashes. A warning klaxon WHOOPS, 
               deafening.

               Justin jerks his hands to his ears, closes his eyes...

                         Hey, Mama-Bear... what are doing...?

               And then he realizes where he is...and what is about to 
               happen.

                                     JUSTIN

                         once the outer door has been

               Miller moves through the Event Horizon superstructure, 
               recklessly leaping from one beam to another, trying to build 
               up speed.

                                     MILLER
                         Patch me through to him.

               EXT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 3

               Miller moves faster and faster, his BREATH echoing in his 
               helmet. He can see the exterior airlock just beyond a deep 
               chasm in the ship's superstructure. If he misses this jump, 
               Justin will not be the only man to die today.

               He doesn't hesitate but leaps, soaring across the chasm 
               towards the airlock.

                         Justin. I won't let you die.

               Miller's words give Justin hope. He regains some control.

                         Okay... okay...

               Justin breathes hard and follows Miller's hurried

               Miller lands on the superstructure opposite the exterior 
               airlock.

                         blow it all out...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON -- AIRLOCK NO. 3

               Justin goes into a fetal crouch and covers his eyes.

                                     JUSTIN
                         Oh god --

               He wheezes out all his air...

               EXT. EVENT HORIZON -- AIRLOCK NO. 3

               Miller squats on the girder, ready to push off. He focuses 
               on the 5 meters of space between him and the airlock...

               The outer doors OPEN...

               The rush of escaping atmosphere carries Justin's body out...

               Miller pushes off... catches Justin's body... sending them 
               both back towards the open Airlock...

               Ice forms on Justin's body. His veins bulge. Blood fountains 
               from his noise and mouth, forming a red icicle over his face.

               Miller pulls him into the Airlock. Five seconds have passed 
               since the airlock door opened.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON -- AIRLOCK NO. 3

               Miller closes the Airlock behind them. Air HISSES into the 
               chamber. Justin's body hits the deck as "normal" gravity 
               exerts itself.

               Miller opens the Inner Door. Peters and DJ rush in.

                                     PETERS
                         Oh God... Justin...

               DJ puts a tube in the Justin's mouth immediately, feeding 
               him oxygen.

                                     PETERS
                         I've got a pulse, he's alive...

                                     DJ
                         Pressure?

                         He's crashing...

               Blood bubbles from Justin's mouth and eyes. He GASPS, then 
               SCREAMS, spraying blood from his mouth.

                                     DJ
                         He can breathe. That's good. Let's 
                         get him to Medical, go, go!

               Starck helps DJ and Peters carry Justin from the Airlock. 
               Miller sits there, exhausted. Reaches up and pulls his helmet 
               off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         One thing at a time, let's keep him 
                         breathing. Start the drip, 15cc's 
                         fibrinogen, Christ, he's bleeding 
                         out...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON -- GRAVITY COUCH BAY

               One of the tanks has been activated. Swaddled in bandages, 
               Justin floats within, suspended in green gel. The others -- 
               DJ, Starck, Peters, Miller, Weir -- look exhausted.

                                     DJ
                         He'll live... if we ever make it 
                         back.

                                     MILLER
                         We'll make it.

                                     STARCK
                         CO2 levels will reach toxic levels 
                         in four hours.

               Peters stands, looking at Justin's ravaged form floating in 
               the tank.

                                     MILLER
                              (gently)
                         Peters. We need to know what happened 
                         to the crew. Before it happens to 
                         us.

                                     PETERS
                              (weakly)
                         I'll get back to the log. But on the 
                         bridge, I won't go back, back in 
                         there...

                                     MILLER
                         Thanks.

               Peters exits.

                                     STARCK
                         Justin said something about, "The 
                         dark inside me..." What did he mean?

                                     WEIR
                         It means nothing.

                                     MILLER
                         Is that your "expert opinion?" The 
                         only answer we've had out of you is 
                         "I don't know."

                                     WEIR
                         Justin just tried to kill himself. 
                         The man is clearly insane.

                                     DJ
                         How would you explain your own 
                         behavior?

                                     WEIR
                         What?

                                     STARCK
                         On the bridge. You said "it" wanted 
                         you.

               Weir glances at Justin...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON -- GRAVITY COUCH BAY -- POV OF CLAIRE

               But it's not Justin in the tank. It's his wife CLAIRE, naked, 
               wet, dead. Weir stares at her.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON -- GRAVITY COUCH BAY

                                     WEIR
                         I said that?

                                     DJ
                         Yes. You did.

               Weir blinks. Justin floats in the grav couch. Weir turns 
               back to the others.

                                     WEIR
                         I don't remember saying that.
                              (covers with a joke)
                         Maybe I'm insane, too.

               Weir exits.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON -- GENERIC CORRIDOR

               Miller follows Weir out of the Gravity Couch Bay.

                                     MILLER
                         I want to know what caused that noise. 
                         I want to know why one of my crew 
                         tried to throw himself out of the 
                         airlock.

                                     WEIR
                         Thermal changes in the hull could 
                         have caused the metal to expand and 
                         contract very suddenly, causing 
                         reverberations --

                                     MILLER
                              (exploding)
                         That's bullshit and you know it! You 
                         built this fucking ship and all I've 
                         heard from you is bullshit!

                                     WEIR
                         What do you want me to say?

                                     MILLER
                         You said this ship creates a 
                         gateway...

                                     WEIR
                         Yes...

                                     MILLER
                         To what? Where did this ship go? 
                         Where did you send it?

                                     WEIR
                         I don't know...

                                     MILLER
                         Where has it been for the past seven 
                         years?

                                     WEIR
                         I don't know...

                                     MILLER
                         The "Other Place," what is that...?

                                     WEIR
                         I DON'T KNOW!
                              (beat, calm again)
                         I don't know. There's a lot of things 
                         going on here that I don't understand. 
                         Truth takes time.

                                     MILLER
                         That's exactly what we don't have, 
                         Doctor.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GENERIC CORRIDOR

               Miller moves through the maze of the ship, heading for the 
               Bridge.

               As he reaches a junction, he hears...

               ...A DISTANT CRY...

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Don't leave me...!

               Miller wheels like a cat, staring wildly down the branching 
               corridors.

               Nothing. He is alone. Miller leans against the wall, sinks 
               to the floor, rests his head in his hands.

               EXT. NEPTUNE - MODEL

               The grotesque ship continues it's orbit as the moon Triton 
               eclipses the sun. Darkness swallows all.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY

               DJ enters, checks Justin's display.

                                     MILLER (O.S.)
                         Any change?

               DJ turns, surprised. Miller sits, barely visible in the dark.

                                     DJ
                         No. No change.
                              (beat)
                         I've analyzed Justin's blood samples. 
                         There's no evidence of excessive 
                         levels of carbon dioxide. Or anything 
                         else out of ordinary.

               A grim LAUGH from Miller.

                                     MILLER
                         Of course not. Justin just climbed 
                         into the airlock because he felt 
                         like it. Just one of those things.
                              (beat)
                         I swore I'd never lose another man. 
                         I came close today. Real close.

                                     DJ
                         "Another man?" Who?

               Miller nods, pulls his service medal from beneath his 
               jumpsuit.

                                     MILLER
                         It was on the Goliath. There was 
                         this bosun, Corrick, a young guy, a 
                         lot like Justin. Edmund Corrick, 
                         from Decatur, Georgia. He got caught 
                         when the pressure doors sealed, one 
                         closed on his arm. Severed it at the 
                         wrist. The pain of that must have 
                         been... He passed out and...

               Miller trails off. DJ waits patiently. Finally:

                                     MILLER
                         I, I tried to go back for him, to 
                         save him, but I couldn't get to him 
                         in time. The fire... Have you ever 
                         seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like 
                         a liquid, it slides over everything. 
                         It was like a wave breaking over 
                         him, a wave of fire. And then he was 
                         gone.
                              (beat)
                         I never told anyone until now. But 
                         this ship knew, DJ. It knows about 
                         the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. 
                         It knows our secrets. It knows what 
                         we're afraid of.
                              (beat, wan smile)
                         And now you're going to tell me it's 
                         carbon dioxide.

                                     DJ
                         No.

               Miller sees something in DJ's expression.

                                     MILLER
                         What is it?

                                     DJ
                         I've been listening to the 
                         transmission. And I think Houston 
                         made a mistake in the translation.

                                     MILLER
                         Go on.

               DJ plays the recording again. Stops it abruptly.

                                     DJ
                         They thought it said, "Liberatis 
                         me," "Save me," but it's not "me." 
                         It's "tutemet:" "Save yourself."

                                     MILLER
                         It's not a distress call. It's a 
                         warning.

                                     DJ
                         It gets worse.

               Miller stares at him.

                                     DJ
                         It's very hard to make out, but listen 
                         to this final part.

               He plays the recording again.

                                     DJ
                         Do you hear it? Right there.

                                     MILLER
                         Hear what?

                                     DJ
                         It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," 
                         from; "infera," the ablative case of 
                         "inferi." "Hell."

                                     MILLER
                         "Save yourself. From Hell."
                              (beat)
                         What are you saying, are you saying 
                         that this ship is possessed?

                                     DJ
                         No. I don't believe in that sort of 
                         thing.
                              (beat)
                         But if Dr. Weir is right, this ship 
                         has passed beyond the boundaries of 
                         our universe, of reality. Who knows 
                         where this ship has been... What 
                         it's seen...
                              (beat)
                         And what it's brought back with it.

               DJ looks at Miller. He does not have an answer. The intercom

                              (intercom)
                         Captain Miller, we're ready to 
                         repressurize the Clark.

                                     MILLER
                              (into intercom)
                         On my way.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

               Miller stands in his EVA suit in the darkened bridge. He 
               twists a manual valve.

                                     MILLER
                         Alright, Cooper.

               EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - HULL SECTION

               Cooper looks at Smith.

                                     COOPER
                         Cross your fingers.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

               A moment later, mist flows from the vents into the bridge, 
               filling it with atmosphere. Miller watches the pressure rise 
               on his suit gauge.

                                     SMITH (O.S.)
                              (radio)
                         It's holding... She's holding...!

                              (radio)
                         We're still venting trace gasses, 
                         gimme twenty minutes to plug the 
                         hole.

                         You got it, Coop.

               Miller removes his helmet. Breathes deep.

                                     MILLER
                         Back in business.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Peters sits in front of the screen. The log is still 
               distorted.

               Frustrated, she types in a series of instructions. Get to 
               her feet.

                                     PETERS
                         You got any coffee?

                                     STARCK
                         It's cold.

                                     PETERS
                         I don't care.

               Behind Peters, the process refines, accelerates... pieces 
               coming together like a jigsaw...

               Peters turns around. Sees the screen. The coffee slips from 
               her hand to the floor.

                                     PETERS
                              (tiny voice)
                         Starck...

               Starck turns, sees the screen.

                                     PETERS
                         Sweet Jesus. Miller... MILLER!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Miller, Starck, DJ watch the video. Peters turns away, 
               miserable. Unable to watch...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE THE VIDEO SCREEN

               still distorted by static and roll, but finally lucid: FOUR 
               ORIGINAL CREW of the Event Horizon. On the Bridge.

               ONE MAN dislocates his shoulder with a WET POPPING sound as 
               he shoves his arm down his own throat. Blood bubbles from 
               his nose. With a SHUCKING sound, he pulls his stomach out 
               his mouth...

               Behind him, a MAN and WOMAN fuck, covered with blood. She 
               bites through his neck. His head lolls to the other side. 
               She buries her face in the torn flesh as he thrusts into her 
               again and again...

               Presiding over them, KILPACK. His eyes are bloody holes. His 
               hands reach out in offering. In the palms of his hands, his 
               eyes.

               Kilpack opens his mouth and speaks with an INHUMAN VOICE.

                                     KILPACK
                         Liberatis tutemet ex infera...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Miller switches off the video. No one says anything.

                                     MILLER
                         We're leaving.

                                     WEIR
                         You can't, your orders are specific...

                                     MILLER
                         "...to rescue the crew and salvage 
                         the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. 
                         Weir. This ship killed them. And now 
                         it's killing us.

                                     WEIR
                         You're insane. You've lost your mind.

                                     MILLER
                         Maybe you're right. But it's still 
                         my command, and I have leeway to 
                         abort when I feel there is an 
                         unacceptable threat to my crew. And 
                         I think there is.

                         back onto the Clark.

                                     MILLER
                         It's done.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK

               Peters enters, carrying heavy CO2 scrubbers. Smith stops 
               her.

                                     SMITH
                         What's going on, sweethearts?

                         CO2 scrubbers for the Clark. Miller 
                         pulled the plug on the mission.

               Smith smiles.

                                     SMITH

               Weir follows Miller down the Corridor.

                                     WEIR
                         What about my ship?

                                     MILLER
                         We will take the Lewis and Clark to 
                         a safe distance and then launch tac 
                         missiles at the Event Horizon until 
                         I am satisfied that she has been 
                         destroyed.
                              (beat)
                         Fuck this ship.

                         You... You can't do that!

                                     MILLER
                         Watch me.

               Miller turns to walk away. Weir grabs Miller, wheeling him 
               around, almost frenzied.

                                     WEIR
                         You can't kill her, I won't let you! 
                         I lost her once, I will not lose her 
                         again...!

               Miller shoves Weir back into the wall. The two stare at each 
               other. Adversaries...

               The lights cut to emergency lighting.

               Miller finds the intercom:

                         Starck, what the hell is going on?

               Starck peers at the Engineering board:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - WITH AIRLOCKS

               Miller and Weir are barely visible in the darkness.

                                     MILLER
                         Goddammit! Starck, get those files 
                         and vacate. I want off this ship.

               He releases the intercom.

               Weir's voice is a WHISPER as he backs into the shadows.

                                     WEIR
                         You can't leave. She won't let you.

                                     MILLER
                         Just get your gear back onto the 
                         Lewis and Clark, doctor, or you'll 
                         find yourself looking for a ride 
                         home.

               Weir is swallowed by the darkness.

                                     WEIR (O.S.)
                         I am home.

               REGULAR LIGHTING snaps on...

               Miller looks around. Dr. Weir has vanished.

                                     MILLER
                         Weir? WEIR!

               He slams the intercom:

                                     MILLER
                         All hands. Dr. Weir is missing. I 
                         want him found and restrained.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Starck gathers all the files and disks. Shuts down the 
               consoles, one by one.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               Smith and Peters finish removing CO2 scrubbers from panels 
               in the walls.

                                     SMITH
                         Let's go, let's go, this place freaks

               Peters follows Smith down the First Containment towards the 
               Main Access Corridor, carrying the last case of scrubbers. 
               She begins to lag behind.

               A GIGGLE echoes down the First Containment.

                                     PETERS
                              (whisper)

               She turns back to the Second Containment...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT POV PETERS

               A SMALL FIGURE dashes through the darkness in the Second

               Peters turns, but Smith is already out of sight. She 
               hesitates. Moves back towards Second Containment.

               Again, Peters hears the GIGGLE of a child. The SCRAPE of 
               metal on metal. She slowly moves forward...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               ...into the darkness of the Second Containment. Peters sees 
               an open access panel. She looks inside.

               PETERS' POV - ACCESS DUCT

               A narrow tube, vanishing into darkness. A YOUNG CHILD'S VOICE 
               echoes from far away:

               ducks her head and enters the access duct.

               could be with her, there in the dark.

               A child's WHISPER, too faint for words. Peters turns...

               Behind her, FOREGROUND, a YOUNG CHILD dashes across the 
               corridor.

               Peters turns back. Too late to see. Again, the child's WHISPER 
               draws her onward.

                                     PETERS
                         Denny? Denny, come to Mommy...

               FAINT LAUGHTER is her only answer. She follows the sound, 
               now climbing into a vertical shaft that takes her higher and 
               higher...

                                     PETERS
                         Hold on, Denny, Mommy's coming...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - DENNY'S DUCT - CATWALK

               Peters pulls herself up from the vertical shaft onto a catwalk 
               that snakes between huge oily machinery, just in time to 
               see...

               A SMALL CHILD running, disappearing into the gloom ahead.

                                     PETERS
                         Denny?

               She runs forward into a junction. The lights flicker red.

                                     PETERS
                         Denny...?

                                     DENNY
                         Mommy...

               Her son can barely be seen in the flickering darkness ahead.

                                     PETERS
                         You can walk... Denny, you can walk... 
                         oh, my baby...

                                     DENNY
                         Wanna show you, Mommy, wanna show 
                         you something...

               He reaches his arms out to her...

               Peters steps forward, reaching for her son...

               ...falling into an open access hatch, hidden in the dark...

               INT. DENNY'S DUCT - (VERTICAL TUBE)

               ...a twenty meter drop...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               Peters hits hard, lies before the Core, an offering of flesh 
               and blood. Her legs twist beneath her, shattered; blood pools 
               around her head. Her chest heaves: still alive.

                                     PETERS
                              (bloody gasp)
                         Denny...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - DENNY'S DUCT - TUBE SECTION

               Denny peers down from the top of the shaft and GIGGLES. CLAPS 
               his hands in childlike glee.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - FIRST CONTAINMENT

               Weir wanders into First Containment, brooding.

                                     WEIR
                              (to himself)
                         I won't. I won't leave. This is my 
                         ship.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               Weir enters the Second Containment. Freezes as he sees...

               Peters body lying twisted and broken before the Core.

                                     WEIR
                         Oh no. Peters...?

               He rushes to Peters. Reaches out to touch her but pulls his 
               hand back. Her eyes are black, eight-ball hemorrhage darkening 
               the irises. She is dead.

                                     WEIR
                         Why did you do that? You didn't have 
                         to do that...

                                     CLAIRE (O.S.)
                         Billy.

               Weir looks up from Peters' corpse.

               CLAIRE stands before the Core. She is naked. Her skin is 
               pale and beautiful and cold and wet. Her hair hangs in her 
               face, covering her milk-white eyes...

               INT. STUDIO APARTMENT

               Claire stands naked before the bathroom mirror. Behind her, 
               the tub steams...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT - (SEX AND SUICIDE 
               INTERCUT)

               Weir stares at Claire in shock. She walks to him. Slowly.

               She stops in front of him. Her arms hang at her sides. He 
               must reach for her.

               He does, putting his hands on her hips. He slides from his 
               chair to the floor to his knees. He presses his face to her 
               pale belly and cries. SOBS wrack his body...

               INT. STUDIO APARTMENT

               ...and in the bathroom, she clutches Weir's straight-razor...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               She reaches down. Slowly, her arms cradle his head. She slides 
               down on him. Straddles him.

               INT. STUDIO APARTMENT

               ...Claire slips into the steaming water...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               He raises his head to her breasts. His eyes, closed. She 
               remains unnaturally still, only her hips rocking back and 
               forth.

               Weir's mouth opens, GASPS as he enters her...

               INT. STUDIO APARTMENT

               ...and the razor bites her skin...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               She caresses his face. Lifts his face to hers. Her mouth is 
               slack. Her hair hangs in front of her eyes.

               INT. STUDIO APARTMENT

               ...Claire floats dead in the red water, eyes open, hair 
               billowing around her head like a halo...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               Weir gazes up at her, transfixed. He takes her hand and raises 
               it to his face. She caresses his cheek. And reaches for his 
               eyes...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - FIRST CONTAINMENT

               A MUFFLED SCREAM rips through the Second Containment Seal. 
               It begins as a human sound and ends as something else, an 
               alien CRY of rage.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - WITH AIRLOCKS

               The CRY echoes down the Main Corridor.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

               DJ packs up blood samples. He raises his head at the sound 
               of the CRY.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Starck GASPS as the CRY resounds through the bridge.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

               Miller turns in the direction of the CRY. He begins to move 
               down the Corridor, towards the source.

               EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - HULL SECTION

               Cooper examines the weld on the baffle plate. It's solid.

                                     COOPER
                         Solid as a rock.
                              (into his radio)
                         Hey, Smith...

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK

                                     COOPER (O.S.)
                              (intercom)
                         Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm 
                         coming in.

                                     SMITH
                         Roger that.

               Smith carries another load of supplies. Movement out of the 
               corner of his eye...

               He turns in time to see Weir disappear around a corner inside 
               the Event Horizon.

                                     SMITH
                         Dr. Weir! Hey, get your ass back on 
                         board! Dr. Weir!

               No response.

               Smith keys the radio.

                                     SMITH
                         Skipper, come in...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

               Miller jogs down the Main Corridor. An INTERCOM gets his 
               attention:

                                     SMITH (O.S.)
                              (intercom)
                         Skipper...

                                     MILLER
                              (into intercom)
                         What is it, Smith?

                                     SMITH (O.S.)
                              (intercom)
                         I just saw Weir, I think he was 
                         messing around on the Clark.

               Something SPARKS and SIZZLES in the dim light, catching 
               Miller's eye. He looks up...

               One of the EXPLOSIVE CHARGES has been removed from the its 
               mounting in the Corridor.

                                     MILLER
                         Smith, get out of there...

                                     SMITH (O.S.)
                              (intercom)
                         Come again, Skipper?

                                     MILLER
                         One of the explosives is missing 
                         from the corridor. I think Weir may 
                         have put it on the Clark.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK

               Smith's eyes open wide.

                                     MILLER (O.S.)
                              (intercom)
                         Get off the Clark now and wait for 
                         me at the airlock.

                                     SMITH
                         No, no, we just got her back 
                         together...

                                     MILLER (O.S.)
                              (intercom)
                         Get out of there now!

               But Smith has already left the airlock...

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - QUARTERS

               ...entering the Quarters, tearing through storage lockers.

                                     SMITH
                         Where is it, where is it...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - WITH AIRLOCKS

                                     MILLER
                         Smith? Smith! Fuck!

               Miller races down the corridor towards the airlock, towards 
               his ship...

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - QUARTERS

               A BEEPING sound catches Smith's attention. He follows the 
               sound to a storage compartment. Rifles through it.

                                     SMITH
                         I gotcha... I gotcha...

               The BEEPS are coming closer and closer together.

               Smith grabs a duffel.

                                     SMITH
                         I gotcha.

               Opens it. He sees the EXPLOSIVE CHARGE from the Event Horizon 
               even as the BEEPS become a steady TONE. He closes his eyes 
               and SIGHS...

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - EXPLOSION

               WHITE LIGHT. A MASSIVE EXPLOSION...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 1 - (TATTERED 
               UMBILICUS)

               Miller enters the docking bay even as a HUGE BLAST knocks 
               him back.

                                     MILLER
                         NOOO!

               Safety doors close, sealing off the airlock and preventing 
               loss of pressure.

               EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - MODEL

               The SILENT EXPLOSION tears the Lewis and Clark into two 
               pieces, spiralling away from each other and from the Event 
               Horizon. Metal shards, like confetti, fill the space between 
               them.

               EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - EXPLODED HULL SECTION

               Cooper clings to the forward section, watching the Event 
               Horizon recede as he tumbles into space. His FRENZIED 
               BREATHING is the only sound.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 1 - (TATTERED 
               UMBILICUS)

               Miller gets to his feet. Stares out the window upon the 
               wreckage of his ship, spiralling away. He hits the intercom 
               with his forearm.

                                     MILLER
                         DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper 
                         are dead.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

                                     DJ
                         What happened?

                                     MILLER (O.S.)
                              (intercom)
                         Weir. He used one of the explosives 
                         from the Corridor.

               The door opens behind DJ. The lights go out. DJ turns...

               Face to face with Weir...

               Blood crusts Weir's cheekbones, his mouth. He has no eyes. 
               Only clotted, empty sockets.

               DJ opens his mouth to SCREAM. Weir grabs DJ by the throat, 
               cutting him off.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 1 - (TATTERED 
               UMBILICUS)

                                     MILLER
                         DJ, you read me?

               DJ does not answer. The CRASH of glass and steel resonates 
               over the intercom.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

               Too dark to see... glimpses of violent motion in the stainless 
               steel cabinets... the sounds of STRUGGLE continue...

               ...then something WET... and the struggle stops.

                                     MILLER (O.S.)
                              (intercom)
                         DJ? DJ, come in...

               Finally, Weir emerges from the gloom. He searches among the 
               surgical instruments until his blood caked hands find a 
               needle... and thread...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 1 - (TATTERED 
               UMBILICUS)

               Miller, at the intercom. He tries another channel.

                                     MILLER
                         Peters...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               Peters body lies before the Core. The intercom CRACKLES.

                                     MILLER (O.S.)

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 1 - (TATTERED UMBILICUS)

                                     MILLER
                              (growing panic)
                         Starck, do you read me? Starck...?

               But it is Weir who answers. His voice sounds thick, choked 
               with dirt.

                                     WEIR (O.S.)
                              (intercom)
                         I told you... She won't let you 
                         leave...

                                     MILLER
                         Son of a bitch!

               Miller yanks open a storage locker full of zero-G tool. Lifts 
               a nailgun. Chambers a round.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - EXPLODED HULL SECTION

               Cooper watches the Event Horizon fall farther and farther 
               away.

               He checks his oxygen gauge. One tank full, one tank at half.

               Cooper twists his backpack around, giving him access to the 
               oxygen tanks. He seals off his primary hose and disconnects 
               the full tank. His gauge immediately goes to "Yellow - 
               Reserve."

               Cooper points the full tank away from the Event Horizon and 
               OPENS IT...

               The blast of pressurized air pushes him towards the ship, 
               leaving the wreckage of the Lewis and Clark behind.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GENERIC CORRIDOR

               Miller races through the corridors to Medical...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

               ...and finds DJ, suspended above the table, neatly dissected. 
               His organs have been laid out carefully before him on the 
               steel table.

                                     MILLER
                         Oh my God.

               DJ raises his head.

                                     DJ
                              (whisper)

                                     MILLER
                         Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do 
                         I...

                                     DJ
                         Please... kill...

                                     MILLER
                         Oh God...

               Miller raises the nailgun with trembling hands. FIRES.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR TO BRIDGE

               Miller approaches the door to the Bridge. It is open...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Miller stands in the doorway. A figure sits at the helm. 
               Miller aims the nailgun.

                                     MILLER
                         Weir.

               The figure doesn't move. Miller slowly circles around the 
               helm...

               It's Starck. Bound with wire in a sadomasochistic pose, 
               unconscious.

                                     MILLER
                         Hold on... Get you outta these...

               Miller kneels in front of her, puts down the nailgun, loosens 
               the cords. She BREATHES in ragged gasps, opens his eyes...

               Then stops. She stares over Miller's shoulder like a deer 
               caught in the headlights.

               Miller looks behind him...

               WEIR STANDS THERE, STARING WITH EYES SEWN SHUT.

               Miller reaches for the gun...

               Weir hits him, sending Miller across the bridge into a 
               bulkhead. Weir picks up the nailgun, examines it.

               Miller slowly gets to his feet.

                                     MILLER
                         Your eyes...

                                     WEIR
                         I don't need them anymore. Where 
                         we're going, we won't need eyes to 
                         see.

                                     MILLER
                         What are you talking about?

                                     WEIR
                         Do you know what a singularity is, 
                         Miller? Does your mind truly fathom 
                         what a black hole is?
                              (beat)
                         It is NOTHING. Absolute and eternal 
                         NOTHING. And if God is Everything, 
                         then I have seen the Devil.
                              (a dead man's grin)
                         It's a liberating experience.

               With his free hand, Weir reaches for the navigation console. 
               Flips a series of switches with gore caked fingers.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE (ENLARGED CONSOLE)

               The display lights up.

                                     COMPUTER
                         Gravity drive primed. Do you wish to 
                         engage?

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

                                     MILLER
                         What are you doing?

               Weir grins as he flips the final switch.

                                     COMPUTER
                         Gravity drive engaged. Activation in 
                         T-minus ten minutes.

               Miller lunges for the nailgun. Weir raises the nailgun to 
               point at Miller's face. Miller slowly backs away.

                                     MILLER
                         If you miss me, you'll blow out the 
                         hull. You'll die too.

                                     WEIR
                         What makes you think I'll miss?

               Miller sees something out of the corner of his eye...

               EXT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Cooper. Outside, braced in the viewport bracket.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Weir spins and FIRES at Cooper. The nail lodges in the thick 
               quartz glass. A web of cracks spreads out from the bullet, 
               the glass SHRIEKING under the pressure.

               Weir takes a step towards the window, raises the gun to fire 
               again.

               EXT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Miller dives for the door. Before Weir can fire,

               EXT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE WINDOW (HANGING SECTION)

               the window EXPLODES outward.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               The ship HOWLS as air rushes out, ripping Weir off his feet. 
               Weir catches himself in the broken window, trying to pull 
               himself back in...

               A monitor tears free, SMASHES into him. HE IS SUCKED OUT.

               Miller pulls himself through the door as it begins to shut. 
               He is safe...

                                     STARCK (O.S.)
                         Don't leave me!

               Miller turns. Starck clings to a console, barely able to 
               resist the winds that try to suck her into the void.

                                     STARCK
                              (gasping for air)
                         Please... help, help me...

               Miller hesitates, looking from Starck back into the safety 
               of the ship. The door continues to shut. In seconds, he will 
               be safe. And she will be dead.

               Miller YELLS and rips a compressor from its mount, wedges it 
               in the door to keep it open. He keeps one hand on the door, 
               reaches the other hand to Starck.

                                     MILLER
                         Give me your hand! Your hand!

               She does. Frost forms on their bodies as the air cools. Their 
               veins begin to bulge, blood pulses from their noses. He YELLS 
               with exertion...

               ...drags her to the door... through the door...

               ...as the compressor tears free, sucked into space...

               ...and the door SNAPS shut, missing them by a fraction.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR TO BRIDGE

               Starck and Miller collapse against the door. A moment passes 
               between them. Just happy to be breathing...

               ...and then the AIRLOCK KLAXON goes off.

                                     MILLER
                         The forward airlock.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GENERIC CORRIDOR

               Starck and Miller race towards the Forward Airlock Bay.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - FORWARD AIRLOCK BAY NO. 4

               They enter, see a humanoid shape moving in the strobing light 
               of the airlock.

                                     STARCK
                         Weir can't be alive.

                                     MILLER
                         Whatever was on that bridge wasn't 
                         Weir.

               Miller looks around for a weapon. Pulls a zero-G bolt cutter 
               from the wall. Wields it like a bat.

                                     MILLER
                         Stay behind me.

               The inner airlock door releases with a HISS. Swings open...

               Cooper tumbles through, clawing at his helmet.

                                     STARCK
                         Cooper!

               Starck rushes to him, takes his helmet off.

               He SUCKS air in, COUGHS it out.

                                     COOPER
                         Let me breathe, let me breathe...

                                     STARCK
                         You're okay now, it's over...

                                     MILLER
                              (sees something)
                         It's not over. It's just starting.

               Starck follows Miller's gaze to a workstations's flashing 
               display: GRAVITY DRIVE ENGAGED. ACTIVATION 00:06:43:01...

                                     MILLER
                         Weir activated the drive. He's sending 
                         us to the Other Place.

                                     STARCK
                         We've got to shut it down, we've got 
                         to...

                                     COOPER
                         How? The Bridge is gone.

                                     STARCK
                         There must be a way! What about 
                         Engineering?

                                     COOPER
                         Can you shut it down?

                                     STARCK
                         I don't know the process, Dr. Weir 
                         was the expert...

                                     COOPER
                         I don't want to go where the last 
                         crew went. I'd rather be dead.

                                     MILLER
                         BLOW THE FUCKER UP.

                                     STARCK
                         Blow it up?

                                     MILLER
                         We blow the Corridor. Use the 
                         foredecks as a lifeboat, separate it 
                         from the rest of the ship. We stay 
                         put...

                                     COOPER
                         ...and the gravity drive goes where 
                         no man has gone before.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY

                                     MILLER
                         You prep the gravity couches. I'm 
                         going to manually arm those 
                         explosives.

                                     COOPER
                         Will it work?

                                     MILLER
                         It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.

               Cooper nods, heads for the gravity couch bay. Starck follows 
               Miller to the steel pressure door.

                                     STARCK
                         I'll do it --

                                     MILLER
                         No. I'll be right back.

               Miller opens the door.

                                     MILLER
                         Close it behind me. Just in case.

               Beat. Starck stares at Miller as if memorizing his face.

                                     STARCK
                         Don't be long.

               Miller smiles wanly. The door slides shut with a dull THUNK.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

               Miller runs down the corridor. Stops at a bulkhead coupling. 
               Kneels down to remove the cover from an explosive charge, 
               switch it to MANUAL detonation.

               Miller runs to the next coupling. Repeats the process...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY

               Starck and Cooper check the gravity couches. One by one, 
               they slide open...

                                     COOPER
                         I'm gonna activate the emergency 
                         beacon.

                                     STARCK
                         Hurry.

               Cooper exits down a ladder. Starck turns to the console, 
               activates three gravity couches. Behind her, two begin to 
               fill with blue gel...

               ...and one begins to fill with blood... the hint of dark 
               shapes moving within...

               Starck doesn't see it, concentrates on the console.

               THUMP. THUMP. Starck turns. Sees the bloody tank. Sees 
               something moving inside it.

               She slowly crosses to the tank. Peers at it...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY (TANK)

               THUMP. A FACE PRESSES AGAINST THE GLASS, STARING BACK AT 
               HER. WEIR. Bone and muscle are exposed where the skin hasn't 
               finished forming.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY

               Starck SCREAMS and backs away.

                                     STARCK
                         Cooper...!

               The glass BURSTS in an EXPLOSION OF BLOOD...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR BELOW GRAVITY COUCH BAY

               A corridor beneath the Gravity Couch Bay. Cooper searches 
               through circuit panels until he finds the EMERGENCY BEACON 
               breaker. He runs a by-pass, activating it manually. The lights 
               begins to STROBE...

               DRIP. DRIP. A bloodstain spreads over his shoulder. He follows 
               the drip to the ceiling...

                                     COOPER
                         Starck?

               No response. He slowly moves to peer up the ladder...

               ...as Starck CRASHES down, bloody but alive.

                                     COOPER
                         What...?

                                     STARCK
                         Run!

               She shoves him away...

               Weir appears at the top of the ladder, crawling down headfirst 
               like a spider...

               Starck gets to her feet, staggers away...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - BY FIRST 
               CONTAINTMENT

               Miller kneels, removing the cover from the last explosive. 
               Flips a switch.

               A small cover pops open. Miller reaches in, removes a RADIO 
               DETONATOR.

               He arms the explosives. Watches the red lights on the 
               explosives wink on in the darkness.

               He reaches for an intercom.

                                     MILLER

                         you, who was in the tank?

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

               A figure seems to coalesce from the shadows behind Miller.

                                     STARCK (O.S.)
                              (intercom)

                         out there now, if he finds you...

               The figure moves forward into the light... Arcane runes etch 
               Weir's face; his eyes, now restored, blaze with unholy zeal.

               Miller glances over his shoulder. His jaw drops in surprise 
               as he sees...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

               Weir grinning at him... then SMASHES the intercom with his 
               fist, cutting off Starck's VOICE.

                         Weir is dead.

                                     MILLER
                         Then who the fuck are you?

                                     WEIR
                         Your fear. Do you remember the

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

               FLAMES SPREAD OVER WEIR'S BODY, TRANSFORMING HIM INTO THE 
               BURNING MAN.

                                     BURNING MAN
                         Do you remember me?

                                     MILLER
                         That's not true...

                         I begged you. I begged you to save 
                         me and you did nothing. You stood 
                         there and watched me burn...

                         SHUT UP! SHUT UP!

               The Burning Man YELLS and raises his arm in accusation...

               ...and FIRE RACES OUT FROM BEHIND HIM, flowing over the walls, 
               the ceiling, the floor, racing for Miller like a rising 
               tide...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - BY FIRST 
               CONTAINMENT

               Miller runs. Dead ahead, the First Containment...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - FIRST CONTAINMENT

               Miller runs fast. The fire is faster, flooding in behind 
               him.

               Miller dashes for the Second Seal as IT BEGINS TO CLOSE. The 
               fire gains on him, surrounding him.

               Miller dives through the Second Seal...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               ...barely makes it...

               ...SLAMS into the engineering console. Miller looks back at 
               the Second Seal. It's still open by a fraction when the fire 
               hits it...

               ...SENDING A LANCE OF FLAME stabbing out towards Miller. He 
               rolls aside as the fire hits the console. The console 
               EXPLODES.

               The Second Seal shuts tight, cutting the fire off. The paint 
               on the Second Seal begins to bubble and scorch... and then 
               cools as the fire subsides.

               Miller gets to his feet. Almost allows himself to relax. 
               Then he sees his shadow before him, dancing in the growing 
               red light. He turns...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               The Second Containment is a holocaust. Fire swarms over the 
               walls. Burning jelly drips from Control Spikes. The Core 
               itself is a blazing orb; the gyroscope that holds it glows 
               red-hot.

               Miller stares at the blazing Core.

                                     BURNING MAN (O.S.)
                         Don't leave me!

               Miller turns. The Burning Man stands RIGHT BESIDE HIM.

               He SMASHES Miller with a backhand that ignites Miller's 
               clothes and sends him flying. The detonator falls from 
               Miller's grasp, lost beneath two feet of coolant. Miller 
               comes up CHOKING and SPLUTTERING.

               The Burning Man stalks towards Miller. The coolant STEAMS 
               and SIZZLES at his feet.

               Miller stares at the Burning Man as he approaches. Slowly 
               rises to his feet.

                                     MILLER
                         You're not Edmund Corrick.

               The Burning Man's flames wane, revealing Weir's misshapen 
               form.

               Miller throws a wicked right. Weir catches Miller's fist. 
               SQUEEZES until blood wells up between his fingers. Then slings 
               Miller against a cooling tank with BONE CRACKING force. Miller 
               collapses into the slime, barely able to raise his head to 
               breathe.

               Weir slowly approaches.

                                     MILLER
                         What are you?

                                     WEIR
                         You know.

                                     MILLER
                         You want me to believe you're the 
                         Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!

                                     WEIR
                         I'm not the Devil.

                                     MILLER
                         Then what, what are you? Tell me...

                                     WEIR
                         Better if I just show you.

               Weir's hands reach down and he grabs Miller by the skull. 
               Miller GASPS as he sees...

               SERIES OF SHOTS

               His hand closes on the scrubber and he swings it across Weir's 
               head. Weir reels back, stunned.

               Miller gets to his feet.

                                     MILLER
                         You can't have them!

               He hits Weir again. HARD. Blood gushes from Weir's skull, 
               filling the runes on his face.

               Weir staggers. Miller attacks. Again and again and again...

               This time Weir is ready. He catches the scrubber and tears 
               it from Miller's grasp. SMASHES Miller to the floor with a 
               single blow. Miller GROANS.

                                     WEIR
                         I'm not the Devil. I'm much, much

                         will see the End. I am the dark behind 
                         the stars. I am the dark inside you 
                         all.

               Miller gets to all fours, trying to get up.

                                     MILLER
                         ...not the Devil...

               Weir kicks Miller savagely. Miller slides through the coolant, 
               comes to rest beneath a walkway. He attempts to rise, 
               collapses back into the sludge.

               Weir slowly stalks towards him.

                                     WEIR
                         There is no Devil. There is no God. 
                         There is only... NOTHING.

                                     MILLER
                         You're lying...!

                         will your crew. You're all coming

                         Starck... Cooper...

               Weir's grotesque face is inches from his. He reaches down 
               and pulls Miller from the dripping ooze...

                                     WEIR
                         They are mine. And so are you...

               ...as Miller clears the surface, he holds something in his 
               fist.

               Miller stares dead-on into Weir's hellish face...

               ...and raises his right hand. HE'S HOLDING THE DETONATOR.

                                     MILLER
                              (a grim smile of 
                              triumph)
                         You can't have them. Go to hell.

                         NOOO!

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

               ...followed frames later by a sequence of DETONATIONS that 
               rip the Main Access Corridor apart and propel the foredecks 
               away from the containment section.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR (ROLLOVER SET)

               The EXPLOSION knocks Starck and Cooper down. They hold on 
               tightly as...

               EXT. NEPTUNE - MODEL

               Waves of distortion ripple over the Event Horizon's 
               containment section...

               A dark sphere of energy spreads out from the containment as 
               the gateway opens... A BLACK HOLE...

               The black hole begins to shrink, imploding. As it collapses, 
               it sucks Neptune's blue clouds with it, creating a TITANIC 
               WHIRLPOOL with the black hole at its center...

               The SHRIEKING winds carry the foredecks back towards the 
               whirlpool, towards the black hole...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR (ROLLOVER SET)

               Cooper and Starck slide across the floor as the deck tips at 
               a terrific angle...

               EXT. NEPTUNE - MODEL

               The foredecks teeter on the edge of oblivion...

               The black hole collapses utterly, vanishing to a point. An 
               enormous SHOCKWAVE rips out from the point of implosion.

               The foredecks ride the wave away from the implosion and out 
               of Neptune's atmosphere to safety...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR WINDOW

               The VIBRATIONS subside. Cooper and Starck stagger to their 
               feet. Look out the window...

               EXT. NEPTUNE - MODEL COOPER/STARCK POV

               Neptune recedes, the ugly hole of the implosion already being 
               erased by Neptune's violent winds...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR WINDOW

               Starck's voice is tiny.

                                     STARCK
                         Miller...

                                                                   FADE TO:

               SPACE - MODEL

               Black planets silhouetted by a dying red giant. The 
               Engineering Containment of the Event Horizon drifts in the 
               eddies of gas that swirl and spiral into the bloated star.

               MOVE towards the ship until its shadow consumes all...

               DELETE SCENE

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY

               Starck awakens but the SCREAMS continue as the Event Horizon 
               calls out to her... she SCREAMS... hands on her body... the 
               CRIES stop...

               Starck looks around uncomprehending at the faces around her.

               IT'S A RESCUE TEAM

               Cooper pushes them aside. She clings to him, CRYING...

                                     COOPER
                         It's over, hush now, it's over...

               FADE TO BLACK.

          INT. COUNTRY CHURCH - NIGHT

          The man facing us is bearded, sweating, intense,'joyous.
          Jacket and tie, jeans, fortyish. His name is Wittold Levi.
          eXistenZ.
          Levi turns to a chalkboard on a tripod and writes the word.

                         LEVI
          Written like this. One word.
          Small e. Capital X, capital Z.
          He turns back to face an as-yet-unseen audience.

                         LEVI
          eXistenZ. It's new, it's from
          Antenna Research, and it's here,
          right now.
          We now see Levi's audience, about seventy-five people, some
          standing, some sitting on plastic folding chairs. They are
          of very mixed age and type, but they all cheer and applaud
          enthusiastically.
          We are in the central playing area of a small, deconsecrated
          country church, and Levi performs on a broad, low, carpeted
          plywood dais. At the far end of the dais, a man and a woman
          - assistants to Levi - are carefully laying out about two
          dozen plastic modules that look somewhat like high-tech ski
          boots.

                         LEVI
          My name is Wittold Levi, my
          friends call me Witt - and I'm
          the project manager for eXistenZ.
          I recognize some familiar faces -
          that's all right, that's all
          right. We won't throw you out. We
          encourage consumer loyalty, and
          we want you to help us with our
          product testing. We're a team,
          Antenna and you.
          A delighted stir from the crowd.

                         LEVI
          Those of you who have come to our
          invited seminars before will know
          that I normally lead the group
          through our new games, but

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         LEVI (CONT'D)
          tonight, it won't be me. No, for
          the test launch of eXistenZ by
          Antenna, we have brought you a
          seminar leader who is rather
          special.
          An unbelieving, excited stir. Could it really be?

                         LEVI
          Yes, it is. The world's greatest
          game designer is here, in person,
          to lead you, the first test
          enclave, through her newest
          creation, eXistenZ by Antenna...
          The small crowd is now tremendously excited, wide-eyed,
          murmuring, one or two have actually gotten on their knees.

                         LEVI
          I give you, the Game-Pod Goddess
          herself - Allegra Geller!
          Levi moves to the edge of the crowd, works his way into it
          until he has reached a small, unobtrusive figure who up to
          now has hardly been noticed. She stands next to a security
          guard who is dressed in a suit and tie but carries an
          electronic wand of some sort. His name-tag identifies him as
          Ted Pikul (rhymes with "Michael", not with "pickle"), and we
          will see more of him later.
          As Levi takes her hand and gently leads her out of the
          crowd, her fans applaud softly, touch her hem. They part
          like water as she passes amongst them, clutching her own
          personal game-pod case with both hands. She mounts the dais
          like a blind person led by her seeing-eye dog.
          Allegra Geller, early thirties, conservatively dressed, is
          bright, acutely aware, but wary and controlled. When she
          speaks, she is deliciously, sexily shy, serious, melodic.

                         GELLER
          The world of games is in a kind
          of a trance. People are
          programmed to accept so little,
          but the possibilities are so
          great.

                         (PAUSE)
          You probably thought that
          tonight, we were going to test a
          new game that I designed.
          Excited murmurings from the crowd.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GELLER
          But there is no new game to test,
          at least, not in the usual sense.
          Confused, slightly disappointed mutterings.

                         GELLER
          No, no, it's going to be much
          better than you expected, because
          eXistenZ is not just a game. It's
          an entirely new game system.
          Antenna Research and I developed
          it together - the eXistenZ System
          by Antenna - and it involves a
          whole lot of new toys, which you
          are going to be the first to try
          out.
          The crowd's spirit rises again. Levi steps forward, smiling,
          playing off the renewed energy.

                         LEVI
          MetaFlesh.
          Levi turns to the chalkboard and writes the word.

                         LEVI
          Written like this. One word.
          Capital M, capital F. MetaFlesh
          is what our new toys are made of
          - the MetaFlesh Game-Pod, only
          from Antenna Research. It
          connects with any industry
          standard bioport, which I know
          you all have or you wouldn't be
          here...
          (chuckles from the crowd)
          .using, however, a very non-
          standard connecting device which
          we call...
          Levi turns again to the chalkboard.

                         LEVI
          .we call an UmbyCord. Spelled
          like this.
          Levi writes the word out and then turns back to his by-now-
          salivating audience.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         LEVI
          I guess you can tell I started
          off as a schoolteacher.

                         4 (APPRECIATIVE CHUCKLES)
          But I never had anything quite so
          fun or so revolutionary to teach
          as what Allegra and I are going
          to teach you all tonight.
          With a theatrical flourish, Levi whirls around to face his
          two assistants, who have finished laying out their devices
          on the back table and are now standing crisply at attention
          at either end of it.

                         LEVI
          Are the MetaFlesh Game-Pods by
          Antenna Research ready?

                         ASSISTANTS

                         (TOGETHER)
          Yes, Mr; Levi.

                         LEVI
          And how many of these precious
          prototypes did we manage to bring
          with us?

                         FEMALE ASSISTANT
          Twenty-one, Mr. Levi.
          Levi's face clouds slightly. The audience does not hear the
          following exchange.

                         LEVI

                         (SOTTO VOCE)
          Twenty-one? I thought we had an
          even two dozen.

                         MALE ASSISTANT
          The first three we opened were...
          unhealthy.

                         LEVI
          Really? Any chance that some of
          the others...?

                         FEMALE ASSISTANT
          We think we're clean.

                         LEVI

                         J

                         (RESTRAINED FURY)
          God-damn better be.
          Levi turns back to his audience, radiant once more.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         LEVI
          We have twenty-one prototype
          MetaFlesh Game-Pods, and that
          means that for our first wave
          test enclave we need twenty-one
          volunteers who will port in these
          slave units with the Game-Pod
          Goddess herself...
          Levi doesn't need to finish his pitch. Every hand is waving
          in the air, and every pair of lips is saying, "Me, me, oh
          God, please, let it be me!"
          Geller can only stand by modestly and beam at the intensity
          of the small crowd's enthusiasm.

          INT. COUNTRY CHURCH. MINUTES LATER - NIGHT

          A SHORT MONTAGE as the twenty-one volunteers mount the dais
          and are fitted with their game gear:
          The assistants undo the heavy-duty snap locks and split open
          the ski-boot-like plastic modules on the back table. Inside,
          resting in a lining of dense foam, are what look almost like
          living kidneys: the MetaFlesh Game-Pods.
          Coiled in each boot toe is the Y-shaped, multi-player
          UmbyCord that comes with each pod, a split twelve-foot
          connector cord that resembles an umbilical cord, twisted,
          translucent, blue and red veiny vessels running just below
          the surface.
          The volunteers watch in hushed reverence, as though about to
          receive communion.
          The game-pods are gingerly lifted out of their cases.
          The UmbyCords are uncoiled and plugged into ports in the
          back of the game-pods.
          The shirts, blouses, and jackets of the volunteers are
          lifted at the back to reveal their owners' bioports, which
          are small, soft-plastic, flesh-coloured permanent spinal
          jacks positioned just above the belt line.
          Twenty-two folding chairs are placed in a circle on the
          dais. As each volunteer has his UmbyCord plugged into his
          bioport, he takes one of the seats and places his quivering,
          rippling game-pod, now connected directly to his nervous
          system, on his lap.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          The last chair is taken by Allegra Geller, who is fussed
          i over and settled by Levi as she unpacks her own master game-
          pod with exaggerated delicacy and is then ported in to the
          players on either side of her.
          We END the short MONTAGE with the security guard, Pikul,
          standing with arms folded near the church's side door,
          watching the proceedings with fascination.
          A loud knocking at the door forces Pikul to turn away from
          the action on the dais. He walks over to the door and opens
          it. A hyper, exasperated fan almost tumbles into the church.
          Pikul immediately raises his electronic wand and bars his
          way.

                         PIKUL
          Hold it. Not so fast.
          In response, the fan thrusts a card at him.
          Pikul takes the card, a complex invitation card which
          includes a holographic photo of the fan under which floats
          his name, Joel Dichter. Dichter anxiously looks past Pikul
          into the depths of the church, nervously adjusting the vinyl
          case slung over his shoulder.

                         DICHTER
          Oh, god. I hope I'm not too late.
          Did I miss the port-in?

                         PIKUL
          It's just the first wave. You can
          be part of the second wave.
          (rereads the invitation)
          OK, Joel Dichter. Put your arms
          up. I have to scan you. Metal and
          heavy synthetics can't come in.

                         DICHTER

                         (INCREDULOUS)
          A weapons check?

                         PIKUL
          More for recording devices. Lotta
          money invested in these games.
          Industrial espionage happens.
          What's in this case?

                         DICHTER
          I brought my game-pod. It's got
          original Marway tissue
          architecture. It's kind of
          obsolete but I was hoping,...

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         DICHTER (CONT'D)
          even though I couldn't afford the
          Antenna Fifteen upgrade, I
          figured out a method of virtual
          porting that I thought might...
          Pikul uses his wand to scan the vinyl case, then opens the
          zipper and feels around. In the case is a more solid,
          rubbery version of the new MetaFlesh pods.

                         PIKUL
          You won't need it tonight.
          Everything's provided for.
          Dichter suddenly spots Geller on the dais. He almost faints.

                         DICHTER
          Migod! Is that who I think it is?

          .PIKUL
          (with paternal pride)
          Yeah, that's her. She's
          something, isn't she?

                         DICHTER
          But why would a star like her
          come to a product seminar in a
          little one-horse town like this?

                         PIKUL
          This is where the real people
          live, Joel. Her real fans, like
          you.

                         DICHTER
          Yeah, well, you said it. Just
          like me.
          Dichter has scanned OK. Pikul waves him into the church to
          join the spectators who will form the second wave and re-
          locks the door.
          On the dais, in the center of the circle of linked game
          players, Levi nods at Geller.

                         LEVI
          Everything's in order. Are you
          ready, Allegra?

                         T

                         GELLER

                         (PUMPED)
          Sure. This is my favourite part.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          There is giddy laughter in the room. Geller looks at every
          player-in the circle as Levi steps down off the platform and
          retires to the far edge of the small, watching throng.

                         GELLER
          I'm ready to download eXistenZ by
          Antenna Research into you all
          now. I'm warning you, it's going
          to be a wild ride, but don't
          panic no matter what happens.
          I'll see you all back here in no
          time at all.
          Now the giddy laughter goes a touch nervous, uncertain, but
          it's too late. Geller depresses a nipple-like protuberance
          on the game-pod on her lap, and all the players close their
          eyes and go rigid, like members of a seance who have
          suddenly been contacted by the spirit world. The pods in
          their laps begin a rhythmic, peristaltic rippling.
          At the edge of the crowd, Pikul sidles up to Levi.

                         PIKUL

                         (TO LEVI)
          She seems to be very shy. It
          never occurred to me that a big
          star would be shy.

                         LEVI
          She spends most of her time alone
          in a room designing her games. I
          think she'd like it best if she
          never had to show them to
          anybody.

                         PIKUL
          Really? She doesn't enjoy all the
          adulation?

                         LEVI
          She hates having to port in with
          her fans. It's too intimate.

                         PIKUL
          Then why does she do it?

                         LEVI

                         (LAUGHS)
          We make her do it.

                         I D

                         PIKUL
          By "we" you mean, the game
          company, Antenna Research?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         A

                         LEVI '
          That's what I mean.

                         PIKUL
          Why?

                         I

                         LEVI

                         (SUDDENLY SUSPICIOUS)
          Are you with us or did an
          independent security company send
          you?

                         PIKUL
          Me? Oh, I'm with your own
          management training program.
          (shows him a card)
          I want to end up in marketing and
          public relations.
          (holds up security wand)
          The only thing I know about
          security is how to switch this
          thing on.

                         LEVI

                         (SATISFIED)
          Well, for example, we've spent a
          fortune developing eXistenZ, but
          we all know it's a risky project.
          She might have to make changes.
          It's the only way we can convince
          her that there might be a
          problem.

                         PIKUL

                         (PUZZLED)
          A problem with her new game?

                         LEVI
          eXistenZ is a lot more than a
          game.

                         PIKUL
          Yeah, right, it's a game system.
          I heard that.

                         LEVI
          And we're worried that it's too
          intellectual, too complex, too
          weird, too artsy. That argument ;
          never bothers her until she faces
          her fans. She hates to be
          rejected in the flesh, so we make
          her come out sometimes to take
          the heat.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL

                         (ADMIRINGLY)
          4 I've heard that she's very
          sensitive.
          A strange, choral humming begins to fill the church. Pikul
          and Levi turn their attention to the dais, where the fans
          rock and sway with the pulsing of the pods in their laps.

                         PIKUL
          What are they doing?

                         LEVI

                         (LAUGHS)
          It's the new Antenna Research
          theme song. We thought this would
          be a good way to launch it.
          Everybody who plays eXistenZ is
          going to be very familiar with
          that tune.
          Haltingly, but gamely, Pikul tries to hum along.

                         PIKUL
          Catchy.
          Levi helps him out, and soon the whole room is humming along
          happily, warmed by the Antenna Research corporate theme
          song.
          The whole room, that is, except for Joel Dichter, who, at
          the edge of the dais, is more concerned with fumbling around
          in the vinyl pod-case hanging from his shoulder.
          In the case, we watch as Dichter tears open his obsolete
          game-pod to reveal a bizarre weapon, a pistol made of bone
          and gristle, almost like the half-decayed body of a small
          mammal - whose snout is the barrel, whose rigid hind leg is
          the trigger.
          Dichter takes his weapon out of its case, shakes off a few
          gelatinous strips of game-pod flesh, and steps up onto the
          dais.
          Pikul is the first to notice this. He glances at Levi, who's
          still blissed out and humming, then launches himself
          awkwardly through the crowd.
          Now in the middle of the circle, Dichter makes his way
          towards the blissfully unsuspecting Geller, raising his
          weapon as he goes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         DICHTER
          Death to eXistenZ! Death to
          Antenna Research! Death to the
          demoness Allegra Geller!

                         P

                         PIKUL

                         (TO DICHTER)
          No! Don't do it!
          Dichter turns to see Pikul stumbling through the small
          crowd, scrambling onto the dais. Distracted, Dichter
          hurriedly raises his weapon again and fires it at Geller.
          The first shot hits her in the shoulder and spins her off
          her chair, which collapses over her and takes the second
          bullet on its seat rim.
          The circle of players on the dais moans as one, swoons and
          jostles: they are all feeling the neural surge of Geller's
          traumatized nervous system. Peeking out from under her
          folding chair, Geller's eyes are wide with fear and
          confusion. She clutches her shoulder without being aware of
          it. Blood seeps in between her fingers
          Now Levi and his two assistants scramble onto the platform
          to get at Dichter, who fires wildly, hitting two of the
          players nearest Geller. The circle of players immediately
          goes spastic, screaming and twitching and dropping to the
          ground and writhing. Many of them are clutching their
          shoulders in the same spot as Geller, sympathy pain
          transmitting through their UmbyCords.
          Pikul manages to tackle Dichter, then starts whacking at him
          with the security wand. Dichter twists around and raises his
          weapon at Pikul, who immediately backs off in terror. But
          before Dichter can pull the trigger, the two assistants
          produce small, normal pistols from hidden holsters and empty
          their clips into the prostrate Dichter. Dichter manages to
          squeeze off one last shot at the approaching Jevi, hitting
          him squarely in the chest. Levi goes down and is lost
          amongst the jostling feet.
          The watching fans pile onto the dais and begin to help the
          players unplug from the game-pods which are obviously
          causing them distress. Three of the players attack the dying
          Dichter, dragging their game-pods after them, kicking at
          whatever part of him they can find in the confused mass of
          bodies.
          in the turmoil, Pikul is knocked to the ground. Amid the
          stamping, sliding feet, he finds himself lying across the
          stricken-Levi. Levi clutches Pikul desperately.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         LEVI
          Get her out of here! Save her!
          There might be more of them! Go
          on!

                         PIKUL
          Me? Me take her?

                         LEVI
          (urgent, pleading)
          We have enemies in our own house.
          Trust no one. Trust no one...
          The wide-eyed Pikul scrambles to his feet and promptly trips
          over the all-but-dead Dichter. He falls painfully to his
          knees, struggles up again, and finds the bizarre bone gun in
          his hand. Pikul stares at it, fascinated, horrified.
          He turns back to Levi, but Levi's eyes are rolling back as
          he loses consciousness. The two assistants are making their
          way towards them through the shoving, shuffling throng, guns
          cocked, faces set hard. Panicked, Pikul jams the bone gun
          into his suit pocket and jumps off the platform, wildly
          looking around for Geller.
          She and her chair have slipped off the dais in a heap only a
          few feet away, and she is in several kinds of agony. Pikul
          unports her, which immediately brings her some relief and a
          lot of clarity. Pikul wards off a couple of fans with one
          arm, screams at them.

                         PIKUL

                         (SCREAMS)
          She's coming with me! I'm
          responsible for her! She's
          supposed to come with me!
          To his surprise, Geller laughs a dazed, hearty laugh.

                         GELLER

                         (LAUGHS)
          Am I? With you?

                         PIKUL
          (quietly, firmly)
          Yeah, you're coming with me.
          Pikul pulls her to her feet, but she immediately dives back
          to the floor to find her game-pod and UmbyCord.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GELLER
          (suddenly near hysteria)
          I can't lose this! I can't lose
          this!
          She finds the game-pod still under the folding chair, a bit
          flattened on one side but in one piece. She grabs the game-
          pod and its UmbyCord and stuffs them into her MetaFlesh pod
          case which has been knocked to the edge of the dais. As she
          clutches it to her, Pikul takes her hand and hauls her
          through the crowd, which is now spilling off the overcrowded
          dais and clutching at Geller fitfully, like Velcro. They
          head for the door, fighting everybody off as though they
          might be lethal.
          As they leave through the side door, Pikul sees five or six
          fans, shrieking like monkeys, still stomping and kicking the
          body of Dichter viciously, hysterically, while Levi's two
          assistants carry him to the safety of the church's apse.

          EXT. COUNTRY CHURCH - NIGHT

          Pikul and Geller spew out of the doorway and find themselves
          standing alone in the weedy parking lot of the church. The
          church itself stands isolated on a country road just outside
          a town which is not much more than two gas stations and a
          crossroad.
          Pikul and Geller look around wildly. The vehicles in the
          parking lot are country, pickup trucks, rusted vans, 4x4s.
          Across the road, aloof, maybe too high-class for the parking
          lot, sits a Land Rover Defender 110, the one with the roof
          cage and the seven seats and the winch hanging off the
          front. Geller gestures towards the Defender.

                         GELLER
          Let's take my limo.

                         PIKUL

                         (WILD)
          No, no!

                         GELLER
          Why no?

                         PIKUL
          I don't trust the driver!

                         GELLER
          You drive, idiot!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          They cross the road and jump in the Defender. Frances, the
          driver, sixtyish, a retired lady farmer who moonlights, is
          apprehensive.

                         FRANCES
          What's the commotion, Miss
          Geller? Say, are you all right?
          What's goin' on in there?

                         GELLER
          We need this vehicle, and we need
          it without you. But with the
          keys.

                         FRANCES
          I can't do that. I can't abandon
          my vehicle.
          Geller pulls the weird gun out of an astonished Pikul's
          pocket. She points it at Frances.

                         GELLER
          Get out, Frances. You can say you
          were hijacked.

                         FRANCES

                         (CHUCKLES)
          It'll take more than a dead
          squirrel to get me out of this
          seat.
          Geller fires two shots. One rips a hole in Frances's
          headrest.

                         FRANCES
          (getting out of her seat)
          You have to push the shift lever
          down to get it into reverse.

                         GELLER
          Thanks, Frances.
          They drive off down the country road, leaving Frances in the
          dust.

          INT. DEFENDER LIMO - NIGHT

          Pikul drives. He can see why the limo is an off-road
          vehicle: the road is terrible, dirt and gravel, stutter
          potholes and sharp ridges, the occasional fallen tree.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL
          (manic, scared)
          I normally like the countryside,
          don't you? Normally, the country
          is relaxing and calm.

                         GELLER
          Only if you don't really know
          what's going on.

                         PIKUL
          What do you mean?

                         GELLER
          There is great stress and anger
          and violence in the countryside.
          Thousands of life forms all
          screaming ME ME ME and trying to
          kill and dominate and devour the
          other life forms. It's terrifying
          and exhausting.

                         PIKUL

                         (LAMELY)
          Well, I like the countryside.

                         GELLER
          That's good, `cause you might end
          up spending a lot of time here.

                         PIKUL
          I might?

                         GELLER
          Sure. If you go back home to the
          city, they'll probably be waiting
          for you.

                         PIKUL
          They?

                         GELLER
          Yeah. My assassins. They'd want
          to have a little talk with you
          about where I am.

                         PIKUL
          I was hoping that was just one
          crazy guy.

                         GELLER
          Did you hear the way he screamed
          at me? He wasn't alone.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL
          Everybody likes a conspiracy.
          It's more satisfying than just
          one crazy guy doing one crazy
          thing.
          Geller goes silent.

                         PIKUL
          Well, what are we going to do out
          here? Do you know your way
          around? You know any country
          people?

                         GELLER
          Not country people. Games people.
          The countryside's full of games
          development people, project co-
          ordinators, little factories -
          you name it.

                         PIKUL
          That's weird. I never knew that.

                         GELLER
          The city's full of bad
          microwaves, bad thermals, bad
          electro-optics. You can't shield
          from it anymore. You can't get
          true readings. The whole industry
          moved out of the city years ago.

                         PIKUL
          So you know your way around. We
          can hide out.

                         GELLER
          Maybe. But it seems I have some
          enemies I didn't know I had.
          "Death to Allegra Geller." How'd
          you like to hear somebody with a
          gun screaming, "Death to Ted
          Pikul"?

                         PIKUL
          Wow.
          (reflective pause; then)
          Hey, how'd you know my name?

                         GELLER
          (indicating his name tag)
          You're labelled.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL
          Oh. Yeah.

                         (PAUSE)
          How did you know how to fire that,
          gun? I've never seen anything
          like it.

                         GELLER
          It has a trigger. I pulled it.

                         PIKUL
          Can I see it?

                         GELLER
          Later. I think I'm gonna use it
          in my next game. If there ever is
          a next game.
          Pikul glances at her. He hits a pothole and she bounces
          around in her seat, exposing her far shoulder to him. Her
          shirt is soaked with blood.

                         PIKUL
          Migod, you're bleeding. I forgot
          you got hit.
          There is an urgent buzzing from somewhere in Pikul's breast
          pocket.

                         GELLER
          What's that?

                         PIKUL
          It's my pink-fone. I'm not sure I
          should answer it.

                         GELLER
          Answer it.
          Pikul pulls the pink-fone - it's soft surgical plastic,
          palm-sized - out of his pocket. When he squeezes it open, a
          diffuse pink light swells up from deep inside it.

                         PIKUL

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Ted Pikul.

                         (PAUSE)
          What happened? Some fan went
          crazy and started shooting up the
          place. I don't know why. He was
          just nuts. Allegra Geller? She's
          with me. We're OK. Yeah. Yeah.

                         (PAUSE)
          You're kidding me. You're kidding
          me! God. 1 can't believe it. I
          can't do that. No, how can I do
          that? Well, I'm not really sure
          where we are because...
          Geller grabs the pink-tone from him. She fumbles around with
          it, trying to find the power button. She accidentally
          summons up a read-out, which she pauses to look at. What she
          sees makes her glance up at Pikul.

                         PIKUL
          What? Can I have my pink-tone
          back?
          Geller finds the power button and pushes it. The pink inner
          light flutters out. She unceremoniously throws the pink-tone
          out the window. It lands in a rain ditch full of frogs.

                         PIKUL

                         (IN SHOCK)
          What did you do that for? That
          was our lifeline to civilization.

                         GELLER
          That was a rangefinder. As long
          as you have that, they know where
          you are.

                         PIKUL
          They? You mean head office?

                         GELLER
          I mean anybody.

                         (PAUSE)
          I heard what Levi said to you. He
          said, "We have enemies in our own
          house." He said it as he was
          dying.

                         PIKUL

                         (FLUSTERED)
          I don't think he died. I mean, do
          you? I think he maybe fainted...
          Maybe he went unconscious...

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL
          That was Alex Kindred, head of
          publicity and marketing, at
          Antenna HQ...

                         (WISTFUL)
          .on that very expensive pink-
          fone you threw away.

                         (DEEP SIGH)
          He said that some bizarre
          fanatical group called the Anti-
          eXistenZialists has put a price
          of 5 million dollars on your
          head, payable to anybody who
          kills you. It's been released to
          all the media now. Everybody
          knows about it.

                         GELLER

                         (IN DISBELIEF)
          Anti-existentialists?

                         PIKUL
          No. Anti-eXistenZialists. Capital
          X, capital Z. They somehow found
          out about eXistenZ and they want
          to kill you for creating it. They
          say that the eXistenZ game system
          will "finally destroy reality",
          or something totally nuts like
          that.

                         GELLER

                         (STRANGELY SATISFIED)
          Yeah.

                         PIKUL
          It makes sense to you? You're not
          suprised?

                         GELLER
          I hear things. It's hard to
          surprise me.

                         (PAUSE)
          And what else?

                         PIKUL
          Kindred said that I'm your
          bodyguard and the company is
          holding me totally responsible
          for your safety.

          Pikul, why don't you have a gun
          with you?

                         PIKUL
          What?

                         GELLER
          You're not armed. They told me
          you were my security but you have
          no weaponry.

                         PIKUL
          Who told you that? I'm just a
          marketing trainee. My clinic
          master thought I'd learn
          something about marketing if I
          moonlighted as a security guard
          on one of your test previews.

                         GELLER
          Fuck. I'm marked for death and
          they send me on the road with a
          PR nerd.

                         PIKUL
          (realization setting in)
          Jesus! Marked for death!

                         GELLER
          Don't sweat it, Pikul. I'll
          handle it. We just have to
          disappear for a while. And right
          now, we have to stop.

                         PIKUL
          We do? Why?

                         GELLER

                         (DEADPAN)
          So we can have an intimate moment
          together.

          EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

          The intimate moment involves Pikul digging the bullet out of
          I Geller's shoulder with a Swiss Army knife while kneeling in
          front of the idling Defender's headlights. Pikul'is being
          squeamish and not getting the job done.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GELLER

                         (IRRITATED)
          C'mon. If you're gonna do it, do
          it.

                         PIKUL

          OK, OK.
          He grits his teeth and digs in with a bit more gusto.
          Something yellow and white, like a kernel of corn, flips out
          of her wound and onto the road's shredding asphalt. Pikul
          feels around for it, finds it, holds it up to the light.

                         PIKUL
          I got it. Wow. Did somebody bite
          you?

                         GELLER
          What do you mean?

                         PIKUL
          What I just dug out of you. It's
          a tooth. A human tooth.
          Pikul holds the tooth out to her, but she just glances at
          it, then rummages around in her MetaFlesh game-pod bag.

                         GELLER
          Lemme see that weirdo pistol.
          Geller pulls the strange weapon out of the bag. After a
          moment of study, she expertly pops the magazine out of the
          grip. The gristly magazine is packed with teeth.

                         GELLER
          Yep. The bullets are human teeth.
          Look - this one's got a cavity.

                         PIKUL
          That thing was designed to get
          past any kind of metal or
          synthetics detector. It's all
          flesh and bone.

                         GELLER
          I suppose the smaller caliber
          pistols would have to fire baby
          teeth. The tooth fairy could go
          I into the arms business.

          tonight just to kill you.

                         (WITH IRONY)
          Amazing, isn't it?

          EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT

          We follow the Defender as it parks outside the Salmon Falls
          Motel. Pikul jumps out carrying two paper bags of Perky
           Pat's takeout. He knees the truck door shut and walks over
          to motel door 5.

          INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          Inside the very basic motel room, Pikul sits hypnotized,
          reverentially watching Geller as he obsessively packs the
          greasy remains of their Perky Pat burgers into the smallest
          possible paper bundle.
          Geller is sitting in the middle of her twin bed, her pod
          before her on a hotel towel which is draped over her lap,
          UmbyCord jacked into her bioport, a second towel slipping
          off her shoulders leaving her almost naked, her shoulder
          wound livid in the 25-watt light of the night table lamp.
          Her hands twitch delicately over the surface of the pod like
          insect antennae, so delicately that we are not sure that she
          is actually touching the pod. Her eyes are half-closed, and
          she is obviously in some kind of trance-like, ecstatic
          state.
          Finally, she comes out of it and unplugs her UmbyCord,
          discretely rearranging her towels in the process. She sighs
          and speaks, not exactly to Pikul.

                         GELLER
          The whole gamesworld is in a kind
          of trance.

                         PIKUL
          Yes. I remember you said that at
          the church.

          theirs.

                         PIKUL
          Where were you just now? What
          were you doing?

                         GELLER
          (a worried frown)
          I was wandering through eXistenZ
          - the new system, I mean.
          (a shy, sexy smile)
          I like it in there. Of course,
          without another player you're
          only a tourist. It's frustrating.

                         PIKUL
          Why won't you let me contact
          Antenna? They've got to be going
          crazy, wondering what's happened
          to you. I mean, it's not like
          we've done something wrong. We
          just ran because we didn't know
          how many of them there were,
          right? I think we owe it to
          Antenna to let them know you're
          all right, to get them to send
          somebody to help you who knows
          what he's doing... And besides, I
          can't... I can't just keep doing
          this, whatever it is, you know,
          forever, not having any idea when
          it's going to be...
          Geller gets up and goes over to Pikul. She pulls up his
          shirt.

                         PIKUL
          Hey, what are you doing?

                         GELLER
          Where's your bioport? Don't tell
          me you were never fitted. I can't
          believe it.
          Pikul shrugs his shirt back down, starts tucking it in.

                         PIKUL
          No, I was never fitted with a
          bioport. What do you care?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GELLER
          You're hoping to get into the biz
          and you've never played one of my
          games. You've never played any
          game. That means you have no idea

                         %
          what a genius I am.

                         PIKUL

                         (LAMELY)
          My clinic master told me I don't
          need to play a game to know how
          to sell it.

                         GELLER
          Bullshit. Posturing. You don't
          play my games, you don't work for
          Antenna Research, I'll make sure
          of that.

                         PIKUL
          Look, I've been dying to play
          your games. But I have this -
          phobia about having my body
          penetrated - surgically. You know
          what I mean.

                         GELLER
          I'm not so sure I do.

                         PIKUL
          Getting a bioport fitted... I
          dunno. I can't do it. It's too
          freaky. Makes my skin crawl.

                         GELLER
          God, c'mon. They just pop your
          spine with a little hydro-gun.
          Shoot the port-plug into it. They
          do it at malls, like getting your
          ears pierced.

                         PIKUL
          Yeah, sure. With only an
          infinitesimal chance of permanent
          spinal paralysis. I've read all
          about it.

                         GELLER
          It's your chosen profession,
          geek.
          She pauses, then moves very close to him. She breathes her
          words slowly, intimately, into his ear.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GELLER

                         (HOTLY)
          There's an intimacy involved in
          playing eXistenZ that is beyond
          description. It has to be
          experienced. And frankly, the
          two-player version is the most
          exquisitely intense. Wouldn't you
          like to play with me?

                         PIKUL
          (his resolve is crumbling)
          Well, yeah, of course, but... Let
          me, uh, let me call Antenna...

                         GELLER
          (a gentle threat)
          They wouldn't want to talk to you
          if they knew you had never had a
          bioport installed. It's company
          policy, you know. They want you
          to be passionate about your work.

                         (VERY SEDUCTIVE)
          Besides, once you're ported,
          there's no end to the games you
          can play.

                         PIKUL

                         (HE'S SWEATING)
          You can't seriously want to play
          games now. Not here. Not while
          we're being hunted down by crazy
          people. _
          Geller sighs, then switches into her explaining-the-facts-
          of-life-to-a-child mode.

                         GELLER
          (cradling her pod)
          My baby here took a huge hit in
          the church, Pikul. You see how
          she's quivering?
          Pikul takes a look. The pod is, in fact, quivering like a
          terrified hamster.

                         PIKUL
          It... she, yes, she's quivering.

                         R

                         GELLER

                         (EMOTIONAL)
          When those UmbyCords got ripped
          out of her in the church, ripped

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          GELLER (CONT' D)
          out just as the game architecture
          was being downloaded from her to
          all those slave pods... that's a
          very vulnerable time for her. She
          could be crying out for help
          right here, right now.

                         (CHOKING UP)
          The only way I can tell if
          everything's OK - the game's not
          been contaminated, the pod, my
          baby, is not about to be crippled
          for life because of my negligence
          - the only way is to play
          eXistenZ with somebody friendly.
          Are you friendly, or are you not?

                         PIKUL

                         (PAUSE)
          Sure, all right.
          (he might have found a way

                         OUT)
          Let's do it... let's do it now.
          Let me see.
          (checks his watch)
          To get an illegal, unregistered
          bioport installed at about
          midnight - we just drive up to
          your local country gas station,
          right?

          EXT. COUNTRY GAS STATION - NIGHT

          The Defender is parked by the pumps. A gangly pump attendant
          - his name, embroidered on his overalls, seems to be Gas -
          fills the truck as Pikul and Geller hover nervously.

                         GAS
          Anything else I can do for you?

                         GELLER
          Well, Gas, you could check your
          bioport-plugs.

                         GAS
          The what? The sparkplugs?

                         GELLER
          You heard me. My friend here has
          a bioport problem.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GAS

                         (COOL)
          A bioport, now, that's a sort of
          a hole in your spine, isn't it?
          Lotta assholes `round here, but
          that's generally it. I don't know
          why you'd be talking to me about
          that, lady.
          Geller smiles a knowing smile.

                         GELLER
          Sure you do.
          Gas looks at her closely for the first time. His eyes widen
          in disbelief. He pulls a greasy wallet out of his overalls
          and flips out the card holders. Amongst various family
          photos, hot rod photos, fishing photos, is a photo of
          Allegra Geller clipped from a glossy magazine. Under the
          photo is the legend "Genius In A Game-Pod".
          Gas takes her hand in his and kisses it.

                         GAS
          Allegra Geller. You changed my
          life.

          INT. GAS-STATION GARAGE - NIGHT

          Pikul sits on a mouldy, greasy, plump, wingback chair in the
          corner of the gas-station garage, watching Gas balance
          shakily on one leg as he puts on a fresh set of overalls.

                         PIKUL
          What was your life like before?

                         GAS
          Before?

                         PIKUL
          Before it was changed by Allegra
          Geller.

                         GAS
          I operated a gas station.

                         PIKUL
          But you still operate a gas
          station, don't you?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GAS
          Only on the most pathetic level
          of reality. Geller's work
          liberated me.

                         PIKUL
          Liberated?

                         GAS
          Did you ever play her game
          ArtGod? One word, capital A,
          capital G?

                         PIKUL
          I don't have a bioport, remember?

                         GAS
          "Thou, the player of the game,
          art God." Very spiritual. Funny,
          too. God, the artist. The
          mechanic.
          (chuckles to himself)
          Funny.
          Gas zips up his fresh overalls.

                         PIKUL

                         (UNEASY)
          Those are sterile, are they?

                         GAS
          Not to worry. They way they set
          things up, you could fire in a
          bioport in a slaughterhouse and
          not generate an infection.

                         PIKUL
          Then why the clean overalls?

                         GAS
          It's a mental thing. Helps me
          focus. The one thing you don't
          want to do is miss with the stud-
          finder.

                         PIKUL
          Oh, God.

                         GAS

                         (BIG SMILE)
          God, the mechanic.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         Z'R
          Gas slides open a drawer of his red metal mechanic's rolling
          toolbox and pulls out a greasy device that looks like a
          carbon-fibre voltage meter.

                         GAS
          We call this thing a stud-finder.'
          It locates the spot on your spine
          where the x intersects with the
          y. We don't want to be even a
          micron out of whack. That's when
          you get troubles. It's a little
          radar/sonar/laser thingee. Marks
          you with a special range-finding
          dye.

                         PIKUL
          Never say dye.

                         GAS
          Lift up your shirt and turn
          around.

          EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

          In the heat of the summer night, game-pod case still slung
          over her shoulder, Geller wanders around the periphery of
          the gas station, touching things - trees, the ground, grass
          - at random, her expression suggesting that everything she
          sees is amazing and delightful and slightly disturbing, like
          someone who has wandered into a sculpture garden where
          everything is perfect in every detail except that everything
          is made out of bronze.

          INT. GAS-STATION GARAGE - NIGHT

          Gas pulls the trigger on the stud-finder, then removes it
          from Pikul's back. We see a small purple flower-mark, like
          the kind that marks sides of beef, on the skin over Pikul's
          spine just above the belt line. Pikul stands up from his
          kneeling position on the wingback chair. He stretches,
          twists. Everything seems to be all right.

                         GAS
          See, that didn't hurt, did it?

                         PIKUL
          I didn't expect that to hurt. I
          expect the next part to hurt.
          Gas pulls the bioport insertion gun out of another drawer,
          this time a locked wooden one bolted under his metal-topped
          work bench. It is a scary thing, like a hydraulic jack
          designed by Giger, only smaller.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL
          Yeah, that's what I expect will
          hurt.

                         GAS
          I've never crippled anyone yet.

                         PIKUL
          How many have you done?

                         GAS
          Three. Well, you'll be the third.

          EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

          We are close on a bizarre insect which sits unsteadily on
          the chrome of a gas pump handle. Geller's hand comes into
          frame and gently eases the creature into its palm. Geller
          floats her hand closer to her face and studies the creature
          with an expression of rapture on her face.
          The insect is large, praying mantis-sized, and it has two
          heads, neither of which seems to know how to deal with the
          other one. Each time it attempts to move, it falls over in
          an awkward heap because its legs are all different sizes and
          shapes. It beats its large, papery wings wildly in order to
          pull itself upright and then begins the whole clumsy process
          all over again. Eventually, its wing action lifts it off
          Geller's hand - more by accident than will, it seems - and
          the creature disappears in the darkness surrounding the gas
          pumps.

          INT. GAS-STATION GARAGE - NIGHT

          Geller enters the garage and sees Pikul with his back to the
          wall of the service bay and a large wrench in his hand,
          poised and threatening. Gas stands twenty feet away, his
          insertion gun at the ready. A Mexican standoff.

                         GELLER
          What's going on, Gas?

                         GAS
          Hell, he's acting like I'm
          attackin' him. People usually pay
          me.to do this, you know.

                         11

                         PIKUL
          Yeah. All two of them.
          As you can see, I've decided not
          to have a bioport installed.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         31
          Geller walks over to Pikul and puts her face quite close to
          his. He watches her lips move from the corner of his eye.
          They. are full and moist and convincing.

                         GELLER
          This is it, you see. This is the
          cage I was talking about, the
          cage of your own making which
          keeps you trapped and pacing
          about in the smallest possible
          space forever. Break out of your
          cage, Pikul. Break out now.

          INT. GAS-STATION GARAGE. MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

          Wearing mechanic's work gloves, Gas fires in the bioport
          plug. Its impact knocks the breath out of Pikul, like being
          kicked in the spine; he can't even scream. When Gas pulls
          the insertion device away from Pikul's back, we see the
          glossy plastic head of the bioport plug. It's surrounded by
          a small, angry-looking volcano of rashy, irritated flesh.

                         GELLER
          That swelling doesn't last for
          long. Tomorrow, you won't even
          notice it.

                         PIKUL
          I love it. Great.
          Pikul tries to get up from the wingback chair and promptly
          collapses into the arms of Geller and Gas.

                         PIKUL

                         (PANIC-STRICKEN)
          What's going on? I can't walk!

                         GAS
          The procedure comes with its own
          epidural, just like when you have
          a baby. Kinda like instant
          paralysis from the waist down?
          That's why it didn't hurt you.
          It'll wear off in about twenty
          minutes.
          As they ease Pikul into a sitting position in the chair, Gas
          almost drops the insertion gun which he has been holding in
          one hand. He leans it against the wingback chair, and Pikul
          notices blood and flecks of skin on Gas's work gloves.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL
          You're looking more like a
          butcher than a mechanic.

                         GAS
          Things do get kinda confused
          these days, don't they? I'm gonna
          go wash up. You two make
          yourselves at home.
          Gas strides off towards the washroom with an air of great
          satisfaction. Geller eases her game-pod out of its case and
          starts to attach its two-player, Y-shaped UmbyCord to it.

                         PIKUL
          What are you doing?

                         GELLER
          We don't have to wait for the
          swelling to go down.

                         PIKUL
          You're going to port into me?
          While I'm paralysed?

                         GELLER
          You wanted to play my game,
          didn't you?

                         PIKUL
          Yeah, I did, and I do, but...
          Here? Now?

                         GELLER
          It's an instant-on world, isn't
          it?
          She lifts up his shirt to reveal the new bioport. It already
          looks a bit less angry than it did before. Geller caresses
          it, prods it, plays with it. Then she takes out a little
          bottle of WD-40 and sprays it around and into the port.

                         PIKUL
          What's that for? It feels cold.

                         GELLER
          New ports are sometimes a bit
          tight. Wouldn't want to hurt you.

                         PIKUL
          How come bioports don't get
          infected? I mean, they open right
          into your body...

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GELLER
          Listen to what you're saying,
          Pikul. Don't be ludicrous.

                         PIKUL

                         (VERY NERVOUS)
          Don't you think you could call me
          Ted?

                         GELLER
          Maybe afterwards.
          Geller gently works her UmbyJack into Pikul's bioport. She
          locks her eyes onto his, then squeezes her game-pod's ON
          teat. Instantly, her pod convulses and begins to flash and
          spark and crackle. White electronic smoke seeps from its
          crevices and a kind of bioelectronic fat sputters from its
          pores.
          Geller leaps up from the arm of the chair and rips her
          UmbyJack out of Pikul's spine. He can't feel it, but the
          furious force of her move twists him in his chair.

                         GELLER

                         (FURIOUS)
          Shit, Pikul! I can't believe
          this! I trusted you and you blew
          my pod! You must have neural-
          surged!

                         PIKUL
          What do you mean?

                         GELLER

                         (IN DESPAIR)
          I jacked you into my pod and you
          obviously panicked. Now it's
          totally fucked! This is a
          disaster!

                         PIKUL
          I.. I was nervous, but I didn't
          panic.

                         GELLER

                         (FIGHTING HYSTERIA)
          I was forced to trust you and you
          panicked and you neural-surged,
          and you blew my pod.

                         PIKUL
          You can get a new pod...

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GELLER
          (her heart is breaking)
          Pikul, in this pod is the only,
          the original version of eXistenZ,
          an entire game system that cost
          thirty-eight million to develop,
          not including pre-release
          marketing costs. And I'm locked
          outside of my own game! I can't
          get it out, or me in!

                         PIKUL
          Are you serious? This is the only
          version that exists?

                         GELLER
          Security is everything these
          days. It's the only one and its
          stuck inside and it's your fault.
          Geller uses her sleeve to clean the drool off the pod with
          tragic gentleness, as though it were an injured child.

                         GELLER
          (fighting back tears)
          I've devoted my five most
          passionate years to this strange
          little creature. And I've never
          regretted it, Pikul, because I
          knew that it was the only thing
          that could give my life any
          meaning...

                         PIKUL
          But why is it my fault? I'm
          telling you, I didn't, I did not
          neural-surge. I didn't. I didn't
          feel any surging.
          Gas strolls into the garage, still wearing his work gloves,
          which now hold an agricultural-looking shotgun. It is
          levelled at Geller.

                         GAS
          It isn't your fault. It's my
          fault.
          Pikul looks at Gas in disbelief. His feet begin to writhe in
          circles, but he still can't get out of the chair; Geller
          backs away from Gas, clutching her pod protectively.

                         GELLER

                         (QUIETLY)
          Oh, no, Gas, not you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         3=

                         GAS
          I wouldn't try to use that
          bioport again, `cept maybe for a
          toaster or something.

                         GELLER
          What's going on?

                         GAS
          You're worth a lot of money. If
          you're dead.

                         PIKUL
          What are you talking about?

                         GAS
          You know what I'm talking about.
          It's all over the countryside.
          Five million for her dead body.
          No questions asked.

                         PIKUL
          But, but... she changed your
          life.

                         GAS
          Yup. And now I'm gonna change
          hers.

                         PIKUL

                         (STALLING)
          But wait... Why did you install a
          bad port into me?

                         GAS
          Seems there's a big bonus for
          killing Allegra Geller's latest
          game, or whatever it is. I think
          I just did that, didn't I?
          Geller decides to try another tack. She stops backing away
          and begins to slowly approach Gas.

                         GELLER
          But can you kill a person? Can
          you do that, Gas? Can you kill
          me? Hide my body. Contact the
          crazies. Trust them to pay up.
          Hand over my now-decaying,
          fucking grotesque corpse. Really
          expect them to hand over 5 mil
          cash? Don't you ever go to the
          fuckin' movies?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GAS
          I like your script. I want to be
          in it.
          Gas cocks his shotgun. He's really going to do it. Except
          that Pikul shoots him right in the mastoid bone, just behind
          the ear, with the bioport insertion gun. The back of Gas's
          skull shatters and he goes down hard. Pikul drops the gun
          and launches himself out of his chair. He falls to his knees
          beside Gas's body.

                         PIKUL
          Oh, God, I think he's dead. I
          thought I could just distract
          him.

                         GELLER
          You did distract him.
          (to Gas's body)
          Plug your toaster into that hole,
          corpse!

          INT. DEFENDER - NIGHT

          Geller drives. Pikul hangs on in the passenger seat.

                         PIKUL
          He wanted to kill you.

                         GELLER
          Yep.

                         PIKUL
          That's two people in one day who
          wanted to actually kill you.

                         GELLER
          I've never been more popular.

                         PIKUL
          Allegra, we need help.

                         GELLER
          You're right. I've got to get
          this pod fixed.

          EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          The Defender winds its way up a heavily wooded mountain
          road.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          EXT. CALEDON SKI CLUB - DAY

          The Defender turns off a dirt road and rumbles through an
          open gate. The stone gateposts bear a coy rustic sign which
          reads, CALEDON SKI CLUB - PRIVATE ROAD.

          INT. DEFENDER - DAY


                         PIKUL
          We're going skiing?

                         GELLER
          Nothing in the countryside is
          what it seems. It's all
          appearance versus reality, and
          the reality here is something
          unique.

          EXT. CALEDON SKI CLUBHOUSE - DAY

          The Defender pulls up beside the chalet-style ski clubhouse.
          As they get out of the truck, the same bizarre insect that
          Geller was playing with the night before lands on the
          truck's side mirror, narrowly missing Pikul as it flops
          around in the air.

                         PIKUL
          Look at that huge bug. It's got
          two heads.

                         GELLER '
          They breed them here. They're not
          supposed to get away.
          They get out and walk towards the clubhouse.

                         PIKUL
          What if somebody comes up here
          and really wants to ski?

                         GELLER
          Nobody actually physically skis
          any more, Pikul. You know that.

                         PIKUL
          I've watched some ski shows.
          Downhill racing, Austrian Alps.

                         GELLER

                         (CONTEMPTUOUSLY)
          Yeah, right.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          INT. CALEDON SKI CLUBHOUSE - DAY

          Pikul and Geller enter the clubhouse. There is nobody
          around. It looks like a real ski clubhouse, complete with
          racks of ski pants and ski boots. But when Pikul examines
          the goods, he can see that they're old and cracked and
          falling apart. They've been there for years. `
          A man comes out of a back room, early sixties, authoritarian
          air, eastern-European. He is Kiri Vinokur, and he lights up
          when he sees Geller.

                         VINOKUR
          My darling Allegra. I am so
          pleased to see you here.
          They embrace.

                         GELLER
          Kiri Vinokur, this is my
          bodyguard, Ted Pikul.

                         VINOKUR
          Hello, yes, I heard the
          ridiculous story about this fatwa
          against you. The company is
          desperately trying to find you.
          Is it really serious? Are you in
          danger?

                         PIKUL
          If I'm her bodyguard, then she's
          in grave danger.

                         GELLER
          There have been a couple of
          attempts on my life already.

                         VINOKUR

                         (SHOCKED)
          No! That's unbearable. The
          company must stop this. They owe
          you every kind of protection.

                         GELLER
          I don't know if they can do
          anything about it. It seems to be
          open season on me.

          VINOKUR ,
          Well, you will be safe here, I
          can assure you of that. I will
          contact Antenna right away and
          have them send some people to
          come and collect you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GELLER
          Kiri, no, don't. You mustn't let
          anybody know we're here unless
          you have to. I can't be sure that
          Antenna is completely safe for
          me.

                         VINOKUR
          I understand. Yes. The company
          draws many eccentric people into
          its fold. You can hide in one of
          the guest chalets. As long as you
          like. I will make sure you get
          fresh towels...
          Geller pats her game-pod case.

                         GELLER
          .and make sure I don't lose
          everything I have in here.

          INT. WORKSHOP CHALET - DAY

          In the strange atmosphere of the workshop chalet, Vinokur is
          taking Geller's pod apart. It is more like surgery on an
          alien life form than computer electronics. The room feels
          like a weird combination of a hi-tech operating room and a
          woodworking class.
          A cherubic middle-aged man - Landry - who looks more like a
          farmhand than an electronics technician, assists Vinokur as
          he works.

                         VINOKUR
          What did you port into?

                         GELLER
          Pikul's bioport.

                         VINOKUR
          Really? That's what did all the
          damage?

                         PIKUL
          It was a flawed installation - my
          first. It... it neural-surged.
          Allegra says you can fix it.

                         VINOKUR
          It fried some very expensive
          nerve boards. See? Here. These
          are kaput. It's a complex thing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL
          Nerve boards?

                         VINOKUR
          We use the nervous systems of
          specially-bred insects to create
          the electronic circuits on our
          motherboards.

                         (SMILES)
          Only Antenna Research has it.

                         PIKUL
          Wow. And where do the batteries
          go?

                         VINOKUR
          Very funny.

                         GELLER
          He's not kidding. He's a total PR
          nerd.

                         (TO PIKUL)
          It ports into you, and you are
          the power source. Your body, your
          nervous system. Your energy. When
          you get tired, run down, it won't
          run properly.

                         VINOKUR
          Landry here will finish up the
          pod-work. Meanwhile...

                         (TO PIKUL)
          Let's get that nasty bioport out
          of you and get a nice, fresh one
          in there. We have guest chalets
          out back. You're both welcome to
          stay. Now where did I put my
          bioport-plug puller..? Here it
          is.
          Vinokur hauls out a device that looks like a pair of spring-
          loaded fire tongs.

                         VINOKUR

                         (TO PIKUL)
          Lie down on that couch and pull
          up your shirt.

          INT. GUEST CHALET - NIGHT

          In their chalet, a cozy and inn-like'space, Pikul and Geller
          examine his new bioport while sitting on one of the chalet's
          twin beds. The region around the port looks swollen, bruised
          and tender.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL
          It hurts. I think it's infected.

                         GELLER
          It's not infected. It's just
          excited. It wants action.
          She attempts to jack her pod into his port using the Y-
          shaped UmbyCord, but he twists away from her.

                         PIKUL
          But I really don't think that I
          want action. Me, I mean. The
          bearer of the excited bioport.
          What I want is... not now. Not
          here. I feel too... too exposed.
          Geller sighs, then switches into her explaining-the-facts-
          of-life-to-a-child mode. They are both aware that they are
          replaying an earlier moment.

                         GELLER
          (cradling her pod)
          My baby here has now taken three
          major hits, one in the church,
          one in the gas station, and one
          on the operating table. The only
          way I can tell if everything's OK
          - the game's not been
          contaminated, the pod's not
          fucked - is to play eXistenZ with
          somebody friendly. Are you
          friendly, or are you not?
          Pikul swallows nervously, then turns his back to Geller so
          that she can port in.

                         PIKUL
          You're telling me this thing will
          run off my body's energy?

                         GELLER

                         (PORTING IN)
          That's how they work. See? You're
          hummin' along already.
          Sure enough, he is. Geller deftly twists the second jack
          into her own bioport and takes a deep breath.

                         GELLER
          All right. eXistenZ. Only from
          Antenna. Here we go.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL

                         (APPREHENSIVE)
          You've got a bit of an unfair
          advantage, don't you? How can I
          possibly compete with the
          designer of the system?

                         GELLER
          You could beat the guy who
          invented poker, couldn't you?
          Geller flicks the game-pod nipple, and the chalet begins to
          melt away around them.

          INT. GAME STORE - NIGHT

          The chalet melts away and is replaced by a scruffy game
          store. A lot of kids and strange adults mill around amongst
          the dusty racks and pinball machines, examining packages of
          weird games and game devices, muttering secretively to each
          other, and it is amongst these dull rows of shelves that
          Pikul and Geller find themselves standing.
          A cashier works away behind an old-fashioned cash register
          that sits on a tall counter. The cashier, a gangly, sallow
          young man, glances at Pikul and Geller suspiciously from
          time to time.
          Pikul feels himself', his clothes, moves his arms, his
          tongue. He feels around behind him but there is no game-pod
          or UmbyCord in sight.

                         PIKUL
          That was beautiful. I feel...
          just like me. Is that kind of
          transition normal, a kind of
          smooth dissolve from place to
          place?

                         GELLER
          Depends on the style of the game.
          You can get jagged, brutal cuts,
          slow fades, shimmering little
          morphs...

                         PIKUL
          This is amazing. I had no idea.
          We... we're still ourselves, but
          we're in the game. Where are we?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GELLER
          It's basically a game store I
          used to hang out in as a kid.

                         PIKUL

                         4

                         (ENCHANTED)
          Are you serious?

                         GELLER
          We're ported into a game-pod
          together, remember? eXistenZ has
          complete access to both our
          central nervous systems. Its game
          architecture will be based on our
          memories, our anxieties, our
          preoccupations...

                         PIKUL

                         (DISENCHANTED)
          Are you serious?

                         GELLER
          You keep saying that.
          (examines a game-pak)
          Look at this. Games I've never
          heard of. Biological Father. Hit
          By A Car. Viral Ecstasy. Chinese
          Restaurant.
          (reads pak back)
          In Viral Ecstasy, you are a
          virus invading a specific human
          body. You create ingenious viral
          strategies to cope with the
          efforts of the body's immune
          system to destroy you..."

                         PIKUL
          Wait a minute. That reminds me.
          What precisely is the goal of the
          game we're playing now? I mean,
          the rules, the objective...
          Nobody's ever really said
          anything about what you have to
          do in eXistenZ.

                         GELLER
          The beauty of eXistenZ is that it
          changes every time you play it.
          It adapts to the individuals who
          are actually playing it. The
          result is that you have to play
          the game to find out why you're
          playing the game.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL
          But that's kind of cheating,
          isn't it? Not to say confusing.

                         GELLER
          Not at all. It's a much more
          organic approach to gaming than
          classic, arbitrary, rule-
          dominated games. It's the future,
          Pikul. You'll see how natural it
          feels.

                         PIKUL

                         (DISTRACTED)
          Look at this. Could this be the
          future too?
          (picks up a game-pod)
          Ever see anything like this
          before?
          They are looking at a game-pod in a gel-pak that is even
          weirder than a tissue-pod. It has a logo and a name -

          CORTICAL SYSTEMATICS.
          Suddenly, a hand reaches into the frame and takes the pak
          away, puts it neatly back on the rack.
          Pikul and Geller look up at a man in his early fifties,
          graying, thinning hair, beefy, generally harried and
          pugnacious air. The man is Dorsey Nader.

                         NADER
          These are delicate. You have to
          be careful.

                         PIKUL
          Yes. I can imagine.

                         NADER
          Cortical Systematics is the
          latest and the hottest. Not just
          a new game, but a new system.

                         GELLER
          Will it work with an industry
          standard bioport?

                         NADER
          (ignores her question)
          I haven't seen you two before,
          have I? This is my place.
          Haimische, isn't it? Funky?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          PIKUI,
          We're new in town.

                         NADER
          Welcome to Dorsey Nader's Game
          Emporium. I'm Dorsey Nader. Is
          there anything I can help you
          with?

                         GELLER
          We're just looking.

                         NADER

                         (FURTIVELY)
          I have what you're looking for.

                         PIKUL
          You do?

                         NADER
          Follow me.
          Nader turns his back on them and walks to the back of the
          store. He stops at a warped and dirty door, turns, beckons
          to them urgently, trying not to be noticed by the
          preoccupied patrons.
          As Pikul and Geller follow Nader through the door, they do
          not escape the notice of the sour-faced young cashier, who
          writes something down hurriedly on a pad with an air of
          vengeful self-importance.

          INT. STOCKROOM. GAME STORE - NIGHT

          Pikul and Geller find themselves in a stockroom jammed to
          overflowing with packaged and naked game-related
          merchandise. They are alone with Nader, and they are all
          sitting on wooden crates.
          Nader rummages on the shelves behind him for a moment, then
          turns back to them with a gel-pak in his hands. He studies
          them for a moment, hefting the gel-pak in his hand.

                         NADER

                         (PAUSE)
          Who sent you?

                         PIKUL

                         (INSTANT RESPONSE)
          It's none of your businesz who
          sent us. We're here, and that's
          all that matters.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Pikul is shocked at his own response. He turns to Geller in
          horror, worried that he's blown the game already.

                         PIKUL
          Oh God, what happened? I didn't
          mean to say that!

                         GELLER

                         (GIGGLING)
          It's your character who said it.
          It's a kind of schizophrenic
          feeling, isn't it? But you'll get
          used to it. There are things that
          have to be said to advance the
          plot and establish the
          characters, and those things get
          said whether you want to say them
          or not. Don't fight it. Just go
          with it.

                         PIKUL
          But should you be saying that in
          front of him? Nader?

                         GELLER
          Look at him.
          Pikul does. Nader doesn't seem to have heard him. In fact,
          he doesn't respond at all other than to hum the Antenna
          Research corporate-song and tap his fingers repetitively,
          caught in a small behavioural loop. Geller chuckles at
          Pikul's confusion.

                         PIKUL

                         (RE NADER)
          What's he doing?

                         GELLER
          He's gone into a game loop, he's
          locked up, and he won't come out
          of it until you give him a proper
          game line of dialogue.

                         PIKUL
          This is tricky.

                         GELLER
          Start by repeating your last
          line. Include his name so he
          knows you're talking.to him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         4-

                         PIKUL
          We're here, Dorsey Nader, and
          that's all that matters.
          Nader immediately comes out of his loop. He chuckles.

                         NADER
          You're right. That is all tha 
          matters.
          Pikul smiles, delighted. Now he takes a deep breath, closes
          his eyes, relaxes. The line comes.

                         PIKUL
          Well, Nader, you said you had
          what we want. We're waiting.

                         NADER
          You're going to need these micro-
          pods to download your new
          identities. I assume that you
          both have had those industry
          standard bioports you mentioned
          installed.

                         GELLER
          Yes, of course, that's right. We
          both have bioports.
          Here she pauses, looks at Pikul.

                         GELLER
          We do, don't we?

                         PIKUL
          I assumed we did. I mean, here.
          In the game. Of course, we might
          not.

                         GELLER
          We'd better check.
          While Nader goes into game lock-up, Geller lifts up her
          shirt. Pikul takes a look. Her bioport is there, although
          slightly rougher, puckered, more organic than in non-game
          life.

                         PIKUL
          Yeah, it's there. Looks a little
          different, but it's there.
          Geller grabs Pikul's shirt and lifts it. His is there too.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GELLER
          I see what you mean.

                         (TO NADER)
          Yes, we both have bioports.

                         NADER

                         (UNLOCKING)
          Good. Port in and this'll tell
          you all you need to know for now.
          Pikul and Geller examine the pak, which bears the Cortical
          Systematics name and logo. It seems to be a miniature
          version of their real-life game-pod.

                         NADER
          I'm going to leave while you
          finish up here. It wouldn't be
          good for us all to be seen
          together.
          Nader gets up to leave, pauses at the door.

                         NADER
          Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
          Nader chuckles a very theatrical chuckle, then leaves.

                         PIKUL
          I assume that Nader is our entry
          point into the game.

                         GELLER
          Yeah. Kinda disappointing.

                         PIKUL
          Nader?

                         GELLER
          Yeah. Not a very well-drawn
          character. And his dialogue was
          just so-so.

                         PIKUL
          Yeah.

                         (PAUSE)
          Do we blame ourselves for that?
          The bad dialogue? Or would it be
          bad no matter who was ported in?

                         GELLER
          The game engine is just getting
          used to us. It'll get more daring
          once it warms up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         49
          Geller fumbles the micro-pod out of its vacuum-pak shell.
          She reads the instructions on the back.

                         GELLER
          OK. The pods are so small they
          plug directly into the bioport.
          Geller delicately twists the end of the micro-pod into
          Pikul's bioport. The micro-pod changes colour, pulses,
          ripples, and then slowly flows and wriggles its way into
          Pikul's bioport until it has completely disappeared.

                         GELLER
          God!

                         PIKUL
          What happened?

                         GELLER
          The whole pod just disappeared
          into your back.

                         PIKUL

                         (PANICKY)
          It disappeared into my back?!
          It... it's in my spine? It's
          winding its way around my spinal
          cord?

                         GELLER
          Don't panic, it's just a game. Do
          you feel anything yet?

                         PIKUL
          (controlling his fear)
          No, I don't. Not a thing. I don't
          feel a thing. Uh, do you want me
          to do you?
          They change positions. Pikul ports in the micro-pod and it
          duly crawls its way into Geller's bioport. Tenderly, as
          though kissing a cut to make it better, Pikul kisses her
          back, low near her bioport. Geller whirls around with sudden
          anger.

                         GELLER
          What the hell was that?

                         PIKUL

                         (CONFUSED)
          That wasn't me. That was my game
          character. I wouldn't have done
          that. Not here, anyway.
          She pauses, then kisses him on the mouth, hard.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GELLER
          You're right. Our characters are
          obviously supposed to jump on
          each other. Probably to create
          emotional tension when danger
          happens. No use fighting it.

                         PIKUL

                         (FIGHTING IT)
          What about our new identities? Do
          you feel yours yet?

                         GELLER

                         (CARESSING)
          They'll take care of themselves.

                         PIKUL

                         (PAUSE)
          I'm very worried about my body.
          Geller stops, sits up.

                         GELLER
          Your what?

                         PIKUL
          I mean, where are our real
          bodies? Are they all right? Are
          they hungry? What if there's
          danger?

                         GELLER
          (kissing and caressing

                         AGAIN)
          They're just where we left them,
          sitting quietly, eyes closed.
          Just like meditating.

                         PIKUL
          (reluctantly kissing and

                         CARESSING BACK)
          I don't know. I feel really
          vulnerable. Disembodied.

                         GELLER
          Don't sweat it. All your senses
          are still operating. You'll pop
          right out of the game if there's
          a problem.
          They begin to make seriously hot love amrngst the game paks
          and cartons of replacement UmbyCords. And then the game
          store melts away around them.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          INT. TROUT FARM. ASSEMBLY LINE - DAY

          Pikul finds himself sitting at an immensely long bench in
          the process of assembling insect motherboards along with
          many other workers. Pikul can still feel the warmth of
          Geller's body, but she's nowhere to be seen. A gritty,
          narrow conveyor belt runs down the middle of the bench, upon
          which floats an endless stream of motherboard parts which
          the workers pick off as they need them. The belt begins and
          ends in the anonymous smoky innards of the building.
          The place, a high-ceilinged pre-fab, long and narrow with
          hundreds of blanked-out windows, houses a game-pod assembly
          line. Pikul looks down to find himself wearing a photo-ID
          card clipped to his shirt pocket that tells him he is
          somebody named LARRY ASHEN. He has to twist the card around
          because, of course, from his vantage point it is upside
          down.

                         NOURISH
          Tryin' to remember who you are?
          Pikul snaps his head up to see a long-haired, morose-looking
          worker sitting next to him, snickering. Mocking Pikul, he
          twists his own card around, comically bunching up his work
          shirt so he can read his own name, which is YEVGENY NOURISH.

                         NOURISH
          Hey, it works! I must be Yevgeny
          Nourish!
          Nourish leans over to squint at Pikul's name tag.

                         NOURISH
          And you... you are new to the
          Trout Farm.

                         PIKUL
          Yes. I... I'm... very new. Did
          you say trout farm?

                         NOURISH
          You know - raise baby trout from
          eggs and then stock the rivers
          with them.

                         (BROAD GESTURE)
          Entire place used to be a trout
          farm. Seems like most everything
          used to be something else,
          doesn't it?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Pikul looks around him. The place is humming, but Geller is
          still nowhere in sight. The workers are small-town locals o_Â°
          a wide range of ages.
          Pikul looks down at his own hands, which seem to,know what
          to do: place glue on the boards, glue them down to a resin
          frame using a template, insert needle-like electrodes into
          the bodies of certain epoxied insects. The insect boards,
          Pikul notes, are actually whole insects coated in epoxy and
          frozen together like a sick collage. At least, here in the
          game they are.
          Pikul is now automatically doing flashy moves with the odd
          materials in front of him with great dexterity. Nourish
          takes note of this.

                         NOURISH
          I (with admiration)
          You might be new but you seem to
          know what you're doing.

                         PIKUL

                         (GENUINELY PERPLEXED)
          It surprises me more than it
          surprises you.
          Nourish moves back to the insect motherboard that he has
          been working on, then leans over again exactly as he did the
          first time. It has the effect of an instant replay, but not
          in slow-motion.

                         NOURISH

                         (WITH ADMIRATION)
          You might be new but you seem to
          know what you're doing.
          Pikul realizes he hasn't given the right answer. He now just
          lets it come without thinking.

                         PIKUL
          I, ah... I've been trained by the
          very best.
          Nourish unlocks and looks around with a delicate
          furtiveness.

                         NOURISH

                         (FURTIVE)
          So have I. Where do you plan to
          have lunch?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL
          I'm new here. I have no plans for
          lunch.

                         NOURISH 11
          I suggest the Chinese restaurant
          in the forest. Everybody knows
          where it is. Just ask.

                         PIKUL
          Won't you be going there too?

                         NOURISH
          I have other plans for lunch. But
          I do suggest that you order the
          special. And don't take no for an
          answer.

                         PIKUL
          All right, I'll do that.
          Nourish turns back to his task and begins to work away as
          though Pikul didn't exist.
          Pikul takes this cue to go back to his own board and is soon
          preoccupied with testing the board's circuits by porting it
          into a test UmbyCord that uncoils from the center of the
          bench. His strange reverie, watching himself work on auto-
          pilot at this bizarre task, is soon interrupted by a worker
          pushing a canvas and metal cart with bicycle wheels. The
          worker parks the cart behind Pikul and taps him on the
          shoulder.

                         WORKER
          Larry?

                         PIKUL

                         (STARTLED)
          Yes?

                         WORKER
          They need this in the back room.
          They asked for you.
          The worker shuffles off, leaving the cart behind him. Pikul
          turns to Nourish.

                         PIKUL
          What's that mean?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         NOURISH

                         (GESTURES)
          It means that they want you in
          the back room. They need more
          insect boards for the pod
          assembly bays.

                         PIKUL
          Should I just get up and go
          there?

                         NOURISH
          Yeah. I'll take care of your
          incoming boards.
          Pikul gets up to go. Nourish grabs him by the arm and
          whispers intensely.

                         NOURISH
          Remember. The Chinese restaurant
          for lunch.

                         PIKUL
          I order the special.

          INT. TROUT FARM. POD ASSEMBLY BAYS - DAY

          Pikul enters the huge back wing of the Trout Farm and walks
          along a rampway, pushing his cart past the pod assembly-bay
          area. There, pods very much like the one he and Geller are
          ported into back home are being assembled - motherboards
          inserted, internal ports connected, fleshy housings like the
          corpses of small amphibians sewn up - by small teams of
          workers.
          The bays themselves are old horse stalls with straw still
          covering the dirt floors. But because the pods are primarily
          organic, the teams are more like groups of masked surgical
          workers in a series of impossibly small and filthy operating
          rooms than, let's say, auto-assembly teams in a progressive
          Saab plant.
          As Pikul wheels his cart past each stall, he digs into the
          cart's canvas bag and delivers insect boards wrapped in
          brown wax paper to the eagerly awaiting pod teams.
          In the last bay, one of the masked surgeons grabs him by the
          hand instead of taking the proferred motherboard pnd leads
          himm to an isolated corner. Her ID card says she is BARB
          BRECKEN, and her photo says she is Geller.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          GELLER,
          (slipping off her mask)
          I saw you make contact, Larry
          Ashen. What did the guy on the .l
          assembly line say to you?
          Pikul's expression shows that there is a return game line
          welling up in his mouth, tickling his tongue, perhaps.
          Perversely, he fights it, but it comes out anyway.

                         PIKUL
          He told me where to have lunch.

          EXT. CHINESE RESTAURANT IN THE WOODS - DAY

          A ragged stream of pod-assembly workers trickles along a
          densely wooded gravel path towards a very un-Chinese
          Victorian red-brick farmhouse. A small river flows not more
          than fifty feet from the restaurant, mimicking the movement
          of the line of workers.
          The workers all file past a sign on the lawn in front of the
          building which reads, MONA ZHANG'S BEIJING CUISINE.

          INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT IN THE WOODS - DAY

          Pikul and Geller are seated at a round Formica-covered table
          with a lazy Susan serving wheel in the centre of it, all
          very Mandarin in style. Other workers sit sullenly at their
          table, wordless, suspicious.
          A restaurant dog, a mongrel with a lot a heavy, collie-like
          fur, lies basking in a pane of sunlight. in a corner.
          The waiter, a young, athletic Chinese man, comes over
          bringing rice and tea.

                         WAITER
          We have nice sea bass today.
          Shall I bring it for everyone?
          Pikul and Geller exchange a look. Pikul shrugs OK.

                         PIKUL
          We want the special.
          The waiter looks stunned. The others at their table look
          distressed. The waiter seems to lock up, almost freeze-
          framed.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL
          Did you hear me, Chinese waiter?

                         (SLOWLY)
          We want the special.
          The waiter unfreezes, smiles grimly.

                         WAITER
          The special is for special
          occasions. I cannot give you the
          special.

                         PIKUL
          But this is a special occasion.
          It's...
          Pikul pauses, waiting for the proper game line to
          materialize in his mouth. Finally, it does. He gestures
          towards Geller.

                         PIKUL
          It's her birthday.
          The waiter locks up for a moment, then unfreezes.

                         WAITER
          A birthday is a special occasion.
          I will therefore bring the
          special for everybody.
          The waiter walks away. The others at the table get up and
          move away, drift over to other tables with occasional
          furtive backward glances at Pikul and Geller.

                         PIKUL
          I guess the special isn't very
          popular.

                         GELLER
          I guess.

                         PIKUL
          But you know, really, don't you?
          You don't have to guess. I mean,
          it's your game, your little
          universe.

                         GELLER
          I don't know. You have to
          understand that, to understand
          what we've really created with
          eXistenZ.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL
          You're telling me, for example,
          that you don't know what the
          special is?

                         GELLER
          Correct. I don't.

                         PIKUL
          Or why we ordered it.

                         GELLER
          We ordered it because another
          game character told you to.
          That's a clue we can't ignore.
          But that's just basic games
          playing.

                         PIKUL
          I want to put the game on pause.
          Geller just looks at him, puzzled. Pikul panics.

                         PIKUL

                         (PANICKING)
          The game can be paused, can't it?
          I mean, all games can be paused,
          right?

                         GELLER
          Sure, yeah, but why? What's
          wrong? Aren't you dying to see
          what's special about the special?

                         PIKUL
          I'm feeling a little disconnected
          from my real life. I'm kind of
          losing touch with the texture of
          it, you know what I mean? I mean,
          I actually think there's an
          element of psychosis involved
          here. I mean, I don't know where
          my body really is, or where
          reality is, what I've actually
          done, or not done.

                         GELLER
          That's a great sign. It means
          your nervous system is fully
          engaging with the game
          architecture. The game is a lot
          more fun when it starts to feel
          realer than real.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL

                         (PAUSE)
          Yeah.
          Pikul stands up and screams at the top of his lungs.

                         PIKUL

                         (SCREAMS)
          eXistenZ is paused!
          The Chinese restaurant melts away.

          INT. GUEST CHALET - DAY

          The guest chalet melts back up around them. Pikul looks
          around. They are still sitting on the bed, ported into
          Geller's pod together.

                         PIKUL
          Did I do that? I guess I did.

                         GELLER
          So how does it feel?

                         PIKUL
          What?

                         GELLER
          Your real life. The one you came
          back for.

                         PIKUL
          Just sitting here, it feels
          completely unreal. I'm sure you
          knew that would happen.

                         GELLER
          You're stuck now, aren't you? You
          want to go back to the Chinese
          restaurant because there's
          nothing happening here. We're
          safe. It's boring.

                         PIKUL
          Worse than that. I'm not sure
          here, where we are, is real at
          all. This feels like the game.
          And you... you're beginning to
          t1 feel a bit like a game character
           to me.

                         PIKUL (CONT'D)

                         (PAUSE)
          Did we really make love to each
          other?

                         4

                         GELLER

                         (SHARP)
          Definitely not.

                         PIKUL
          It feels like we did.

                         GELLER
          Our characters did. I'm sure it
          would be very different if we
          did.

                         PIKUL
          I... I'm actually just like that
          in real life. You got the real
          Ted Pikul there, in the stockroom
          of the game store.

                         GELLER
          Well, you didn't get the real
          Allegra Geller, I can tell you
          that. no

                         PIKUL
          I didn't?
          She kisses him gently.

                         GELLER
          No. In real life I tend to lose
          control. It can get messy.

                         (PAUSE)
          Let's go back.
          Pikul looks down at the pod. He flicks the PLAY nipple. The
          room melts down around them and is replaced by the Chinese
          restaurant.

          INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT IN THE WOODS - DAY

          Pikul and Geller are back at their table in the Chinese
          restaurant. The waiter is approaching their table. He
          proudly sets down a series of dishes on the lazy Susan.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         6C

                         WAITER
          Special order for the birthday
          girl. Hope you enjoy it very
          much.
          In the dishes are a variety of cooked reptiles, amphibians,
          fish and birds, all weirdly mutated and presented in a
          bizarrely beautiful fashion.

                         PIKUL
          I think I've lost my appetite.

                         WAITER
          A shame. Mutant creatures provide
          new and previously unimagined
          taste sensations.

                         (SIGNIFICANTLY)
          Shall I clear all this away?
          Geller sees that this is a crucial game moment.

                         GELLER
          No, it looks terrific. Thank you.
          We're happy.
          The waiter nods.

                         WAITER
          Very good. Enjoy.
          The waiter leaves. Geller watches him go, suspicious. When
          she turns back to Pikul, she is shocked to see that he has
          served out most of the creatures to himself and is avidly
          stripping the meat off their bones.

                         GELLER
          Pikul, what are you doing?

                         PIKUL
          I don't know. I find this
          disgusting but I can't help
          myself.

                         GELLER
          Oh, good!
          Pikul looks up from his big bowl, which is rapidly filling
          with creature parts. His fingers are'slimy and sticky, but
          he doesn't stop, his fingers working expertly on their own.

                         PIKUL
          Good? You think this is good?

                         ( AM-

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         O:

                         GELLER
          Yeah. It's a genuine game urge.
          It's something that your game
          character was born to do. Don't
          fight it.

                         PIKUL
          I am fighting it, but it isn't
          doing me any good.
          Pikul is now snapping together bits and pieces of bone,
          gristle and flesh, a grotesque Lego set. When he's finished,
          he's made a gun very much like the one that was used in the
          attempted assassination in the church.

                         PIKUL
          Omigod, this looks awfully
          familiar. You sure this is OK?

                         GELLER

                         (NOT SURE)
          It should be OK.
          Now Pikul reaches into his mouth, pulls out a bridge of
          three teeth - one of them gold-filled - and loads them into
          the gristly magazine.

                         GELLER
          Do you have that bridge in real
          life?

                         PIKUL
          Absolutely not. My teeth are
          perfect. Don't ask me how I knew
          this thing was in my mouth.

                         GELLER
          It probably wasn't until you
          ordered the special.
          He slaps the magazine into the handle, then pulls the slide
          back and releases it so that there is now a toothy round in
          the chamber.
          Then with a smile, Pikul points the weapon at Geller.

                         PIKUL

                         (CASUALLY)
          Death to the demoness Allegra
          Geller.

                         GELLER
          (suddenly very uncertain)
          That's not funny!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Pikul looks at Geller and sees that there is genuine terror
          in her eyes.

                         PIKUL
          Sorry, I couldn't resist. But you
          know... I do feel the urge to
          kill someone here.
          Geller grips the edge of her bowl of hot-and-sour soup - the
          handiest weapon she has.

                         GELLER

                         (TENSING)
          Who?

                         PIKUL
          I need to kill our waiter.

                         GELLER

                         (RELIEVED)
          Oh, well, that makes sense.

                         (CALLS OUT)
          Waiter! Waiter!

                         (TO PIKUL)
          When he comes over, do it. Don't
          hesitate.

                         PIKUL
          But everything in this game is so
          realistic. I don't think I really
          could...

                         GELLER
          You won't be able to stop. You
          might as well enjoy it.

                         PIKUL
          "Free will" is obviously not a
          big factor in this little world
          of ours.

                         GELLER
          It's like real life - there's
          just enough to make it
          interesting.
          - Pikul spots the waiter making his way across the room
          towards them, a big smile on his face.

                         PIKUL
          He's too nice. I won't do it.
          The waiter arrives at their table.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         53

                         WAITER
          What can I do to make your lunch
          more pleasant?
          Pikul lifts the gun and points it at the waiter.

                         4

                         PIKUL
          I found this in my soup and I'm
          very upset.
          Pikul fires. The tooth-bullet hits the waiter in the
          cheekbone. A chunk of the waiter's cheekbone comes off and
          his head jerks back like a fighter taking a stiff jab.
          The waiter's sweet face instantly transforms into a hideous,
          angry, snarling mask of hatred. He pulls a meat cleaver out
          of his jacket.
          Geller immediately throws her bowl of hot-and-sour soup into
          the waiter's face. The waiter screams, then wildly wipes the
          noodles and goop out of his eyes. He raises the cleaver over
          his head.
          The waiter swings and lunges across the table, managing only
          to hack the tip of the gun off. Pikul is shocked to see the
          gun begin to bleed. The waiter, sprawling across the table,
          screams as he tries to reach Geller with his cleaver. Pikul

          44.
          fires into the waiter's shrieking, open mouth - a tooth-
          bullet into teeth.
          A piece of the waiter's skull comes off like a piece of
          coconut, the gold-filled tooth now flattened and embedded in
          it. The gun is bleeding all over Pikul's hand now. He drops
          it in disgust.
          The restaurant dog comes out of nowhere, picks the gun up,
          and runs off with it under a table, where he crouches down
          and starts to gnaw on it, growling.
          Pikul stands up shakily, begins to become aware of the
          strange, tense stillness of the other patrons in the
          restaurant.

                         PIKUL
          (loudly, to room)
          St's all right, just a little
          misunderstanding over the check.
          Pay no attention and enjoy your
          meal.
          To his surprise, the patrons actually turn back to their
          meals, albeit with a certain sinister reluctance.
          Pikul looks around wildly.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL
          I feel a serious game urge to get
          out of here!
          Through the porthole in one of the pair of metal-clad
          kitchen doors, Geller spots someone wearing a che'f's hat,
          someone who is wildly beckoning to them.

                         GELLER
          Through the kitchen! That way!

          INT. KITCHEN. CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY

          Geller and Pikul enter the kitchen and take a look around.
          There are mutant amphibians and reptiles hung up everywhere,
          in bowls and on chopping blocks. The kitchen workers have
          all turned to look at the intruders.
          Suddenly, a cook steps forward from around the door. We can
          now see that it is Nourish in a chef's outfit.

                         NOURISH
          Did you like the meal I prepared
          for you?

                         PIKUL
          Yes. It was very... revealing.

                         NOURISH
          It certainly was for me. You both
          passed our little test with
          flying colours.

                         GELLER
          Why did the Chinese waiter have
          to die?

                         NOURISH
          A waiter hears many things spoken
          when people are relaxed and
          eating. A waiter has many
          opportunities for betrayal.

                         PIKUL
          He betrayed you?

                         NOURISH
          He betrayed us. Out this way,
          quickly!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          They go out a side door, and find themselves walking along
          the river that links the Chinese restaurant and the Trout
          Farm.

          EXT. THE RIVER - DAY

          The trio walk along the bank of the river that feeds the
          Trout Farm. Nourish points out a connected series of rock-
          lined, internally-lighted pools, some stagnant, like ponds,
          and some clear, with river water running through them.

                         NOURISH
          See there, the breeding pools.
          The pools are all alive with strange creatures, mutated
          fish, amphibians, and, along the small, muddy terraces that
          border the pools, reptiles. Like the dysfunctional insect at
          the gas station, these creatures do not work very well. They
          float and swim belly up, lie on their sides at the bottom of
          their pools, flop and flounder around, and in general,
          ostentatiously fail to function.

                         PIKUL
          Is that where you caught today's
          special?

                         NOURISH

                         (LAUGHS)
          The restaurant is controlled by
          us. We raise these mutant
          creatures as food and that is our
          cover, but of course, we are also
          raising them as components for
          undetectable and hypoallergenic
          weapons. Right under the noses of
          our enemies. And speaking of our
          enemies, it's important that you
          go back to work at Cortical
          Systematics. We need to maintain
          as many agents there as we can.
          I'll take care of the mess at the
          restaurant.

                         GELLER
          The Trout Farm is owned by
          Cortical Systematics?

                         NOURISH
          Yes.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         OC

                         NOURISH (CONT'D)

                         (BITTERLY)
          Their corporate slogan should be,
          "Enemies of Reality".
          A glazed look comes over Pikul. He begins to speak like a
          robotic orator.

                         PIKUL

                         (ROBOT-LIKE)
          Reality is a fragile thing. Most
          people think that reality must of
          course be the most solid thing,
          but it isn't. Reality is
          threatened now more than ever. It
          is being eroded and it is
          washing away in the deforming
          storm of non-reality, which
          masquerades as reality, and
          eventually replaces it. Deformed
          and crippled and limping and
          hideous, threatening to engulf us
          all.
          Geller looks at Pikul in admiring disbelief.

                         GELLER

                         (SOTTO VOCE)
          Where did that come from?

                         PIKUL
          The game made me do it.

                         GELLER
          I'm impressed.
          Nourish is also impressed. He smiles broadly, then takes
          Pikul in his arms and hugs him, then Geller.

                         NOURISH

                         (PASSIONATE)
          We love you two now, now that you
          have proven to be true and
          trustworthy Realists. We'll be in
          touch.
          Nourish turns around and walks back-towards the restaurant.

                         PIKUL
          "Enemies of Reality"? Or does it
          really mean, enemies of eXistenZ?
          Are the Realists the game-life
          version of the Anti-
          eXistenZialists, desperately
          want to kill you?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         S'

                         GELLER
          I wouldn't take it too seriously.

                         PIKUL 1
          Of course you wouldn't. But maybe
          you should.

                         (PAUSE)
          But why is the name Cortical
          Systematics familiar?

                         GELLER
          We saw it everywhere in Dorsey
          Nader's game store, remember?

                         PIKUL
          Yes. So that makes it the game-
          life version of our own company.
          Cortical Systematics is
          equivalent to Antenna Research in
          the real world.

                         GELLER
          That's probably fair to say.

                         PIKUL
          So, then, do we meekly go back to
          work and say nothing? It sounds
          as though Nourish and his
          Realists are preparing to
          sabotage the Trout Farm. Before
          you know it, they'll be planning
          to assassinate game designers.

                         GELLER
          We're just characters in here.
          Don't mix your real-life
          loyalties into it or you'll lose
          for sure.

                         PIKUL
          Then what do we do next?

          INT. GAME STORE - NIGHT

          We are close on a Cortical Systematics logo on a game-pak.
          As Pikul and Geller pretend to examine the merchandise, they
          scan the game store for Nader. The store is quite crowded -
          same style of customers, maybe even some of the same faces,
          different clothes. They don't see Nader.
          Geller goes up to the cashier, the same gangly, sallow,
          bespectacled young man who was there the first time.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         O;

                         GELLER
          I'm looking for Dorsey Nader. Is
          he here?

                         CASHIER
          Say that again?

                         GELLER
          Is Dorsey Nader here?
          The cashier glances around the store, then locks the
          register.

                         CASHIER
          Come with me. He's in the back.
          The cashier leads them through the store towards the
          stockroom door. As they move amongst the customers, both
          Pikul and Geller feel that they are being scutinized
          carefully by shoppers who turn their eyes away from them at
          the last moment, so that they can't be absolutely certain.
          And as for us - have we glimpsed some characters from the
          game that we have already seen? Possibly even Wittold Levi
          from the first scene in the church, and Frances the limo
          driver, and Gas? We aren't positive.

          INT. STOCKROOM. GAME STORE - NIGHT

          The cashier closes the door behind them, then gestures
          towards the back of the stockroom.

                         CASHIER
          You want him, there he is.
          Nader lies dead, the unnatural purple of his face eerily
          matched by the veiny purple streaks in the UmbyCord around
          his neck.

                         PIKUL
          Migod!

                         GELLER
          What happened?
          In response, the cashier starts rummaging around on one of
          the shelves. He soon finds what he was looking for, and
          turns around to face them. In his hand is a grotesque,
          slightly chewed gristle gun - the one Pikul assembled in the
          Chinese restaurant - in his hand.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         CASHIER
          You shouldn't have killed the
          Chinese waiter.

                         PIKUL
          Why not?

                         CASHIER
          He was your contact at the Trout
          Farm. A damn good man.
          (pause; he waggles the gun)
          His dog brought me this.
          The cashier toys with the gun's claw-like hammer.

                         PIKUL
          But we were contacted there by
          Yevgeny Nourish. He seemed to
          know exactly who we were.

                         CASHIER
          That's because Nader tipped him
          off that you were coming. Nader
          was a mole for Cortical
          Systematics.

                         GELLER
          You're with the Realist
          underground.

                         CASHIER
          Yes. I was placed here to keep an
          eye on Nader.
          The cashier puts the gun back on the shelf.

                         PIKUL
          If Nourish isn't our real
          contact, who is he?

                         CASHIER
          Nourish is a double agent for
          Cortical Systematics. He was
          working with Nader to subvert the
          Realist cause, and doing it
          rather well.

                         (SNORTS CONTEMPTUOUSLY)
          After all, he got you to
          assassinate your own contact. But
          now you're going to put a stop to
          him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL
          We are?

                         CASHIER
          I assume that you both have had
          spinal port inserts, bioports,
          installed.

                         PIKUL
          We do.

                         CASHIER

                         (PASSIONATE)
          Do you both realize that neither
          of you can be buried on hallowed
          ground because of these... these
          mutilations? Does your bioport
          manual tell you that?

                         GELLER
          Are you trying to talk us into
          having them removed?

                         CASHIER
          No, no. In fact, you would be
          useless to us without them. We
          Realists are forbidden to have
          them, and so we have to use
          people like you on occasion.

                         GELLER
          I don't understand. Are you
          wanting us to jack a game into
          our bioports?

                         CASHIER
          Game? No. Not a game. A weapon.
          (a creepy smile)
          You go back to the Trout Farm,
          and in a familiar place, you find
          a mouldy old wicker basket with a
          thread-bare canvas cover.

                         PIKUL
          How will we know what to do?

                         CASHIER
          (an even creepier' smile)
          Even a child would know what to
          do.
          Someone begins to knock loudly on a door very near by. The
          cashier is oblivious, but'both Pikul and Geller hear it. The
          stockroom begins to morph away as its objects are replaced
          one at a time by chalet objects.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          INT. GUEST CHALET - NIGHT

          Someone is knocking at the chalet door.

          VINOKUR (0. S. )
          Sorry to interrupt you kids, but
          I thought you'd better have
          something to eat. We knocked on
          your door a few times to invite
          you to dinner...
          Pikul and Geller sit on the bed, game-pod between them,
          UmbyCord joining them to each other and to the pod. They
          look at each other. Pikul shrugs.

                         GELLER
          Come on in.
          The door opens slowly to reveal Vinokur, who stands there
          uncertainly, holding a large tray.

                         VINOKUR
          ..and when we got no answer, I
          figured you were playing eXistenZ
          to try out your new pod, and your
          new bioport. Everything's all
          right, I take it?
          An awkward moment, as though Vinokur has caught the pair
          having illicit sex. Vinokur moves into the room towards the
          table.

                         VINOKUR
          Can I leave this here for you?
          Don't bother unporting. I just
          had to be sure our star designer
          was in a good place and that
          she'd recovered her multi-
          million-dollar game system from
          her defective pod.
          Vinokur puts down the tray, which holds several plates
          covered by smaller, inverted plates to keep the food warm.

                         GELLER
          Thanks so much, Kiri. This is
          very sweet of you.

                         VINOKUR

                         I

                         (AWKWARD PAUSE)
          So I take it she has.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GELLER
          Has what?

                         VINOXUR
          Recovered. eXistenZ.

                         GELLER
          Oh, yes, sure. That's why we're
          so spaced out.

                         (TO PIKUL)
          We were right into it, weren't
          we?

                         PIKUL
          Yeah, we were. And it's amazing.

                         VINOKUR
          Well, that's a relief. I'll leave
          you two alone. You can leave the
          tray outside your door when
          you're finished.

                         PIKUL
          What is that you've brought?

                         VINOKUR
          Believe it or not, it's Chinese
          food. There's a great Chinese
          restaurant on the other side of
          the escarpment road.
          Vinokur turns to go.

                         GELLER
          Kiri?

                         VINOKUR
          Yes?

                         GELLER
          Have you heard anything yet? I
          mean, about the eXistenZ test
          seminar and the shooting?

                         VINOKUR
          Oh, yes. It's come over all the
          media now. You've never been more
          famous. Your face is everywhere,
          which of course just.makes it
          worse. I...
          (a disturbed pause)

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GELLER
          What? Tell me.

                         VINOKUR
          They've announced the possibility
          that Antenna will delay the
          release of your new system
          indefinitely, until they can
          determine how widespread support
          for this fanatical group really
          is. I don't approve, myself. I
          don't think we should bend one
          degree to extremists.

                         GELLER
          Support for the fanatics? What
          does that mean?

                         VINOKUR
          Well, you know. They're all
          coming out of the woodwork now.

                         GELLER
          Who is?

                         VINOKUR
          (heavy, defeated sigh)
          A lot of people are taking the
          opportunity to jump on the anti-
          game bandwagon. They've now heard
          rumours about what the eXistenZ
          system is, and they say we've
          gone too far psychologically,
          medically, socially, you name it.
          And I'm afraid I wouldn't put it
          past our competitors to be
          involved in this, to try to whip
          up public opinion and kill our
          new system before it gets born.

                         (PAUSE)
          You're sure you don't want me to
          contact Antenna, even just to see
          what they have to say?

                         GELLER

                         (SHAKEN)
          Not yet, Kiri. Thanks.
          Vinokur smiles gently and leaves.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL
          (gesturing towards the

                         DOOR)
          Your friend Vinokur is getting
          shaky. I think he's going to turn,
          you in to Antenna.

                         GELLER
          Sounds like you might approve of
          that.

                         PIKUL
          It might be the safest thing. Are
          you hungry?

                         GELLER
          Are you kidding?

                         PIKUL
          Me neither. I'm terrified to look
          under the plates.

                         (PAUSE)
          This "support for the fanatics"
          thing doesn't sound too good.
          Maybe we should stop...

                         GELLER
          We can't stop. I've been noticing
          some new... glitches. I'm not
          sure what they mean. I'm not sure
          the game is OK.

                         PIKUL

                         (GENTLY)
          Listen, to be honest, I find your
          game very confusing. I'm not sure
          I want to go back in there,
          because I'm not convinced I'm
          going to keep coming out. Do you
          really like that feeling?

                         GELLER

                         (WITH PASSION)
          Yeah, I love it.

                         (DELICIOUSLY MUSING)
          When eXistenZ is released, it's
          gonna wipe the competition off
          the face of the earth.

                         PIKUL
          Will it?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GELLER
          It really will do that, yes.

                         (HEAVY PAUSE)
          Don't hurt me, Pikul. Don't make
          me go back in alone. Play with
          me.

                         PIKUL
          Allegra, I'm worried that your
          game will wipe me off the face of
          the earth. I'm thinking I was
          right never to have a bioport
          installed.

                         GELLER
          (sly, quick smile)
          But you have one now. And you're
          ported in.
          She mischievously flicks the pod nipple, and the chalet
          melts away around them.

          INT. TROUT FARM SECURITY - DAY

          Trout-farm workers shuffle along a murky pre-fab corridor
          towards a smoke-enshrouded security checkpoint. A puffy-
          faced woman with a clipboard is walking down the lineup
          checking faces and ID cards. With her we discover Pikul and
          Geller, once again wearing their ID cards which identify
          them as LARRY ASHEN and BARB BRECKEN.

                         PIKUL
          That was cruel. I don't want to
          be here.

                         GELLER
          It wasn't cruel, it was
          desperate. C'mon, Pikul. You've
          just got a bad case of first-time
          user anxiety.

                         PIKUL
          I don't like it here. I don't
          know what's going on. We're
          blundering around together in
          this unformed world, whose rules
          and objectives are largely
          unknown, seemingly
          indecipherable, or even Possibly
          non-existent, always on the verge
          of being killed by forces we
          don't understand.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GELLER
          That sounds like my game, all
          right.
          They are now close enough to the security cubicle'at the end
          of the corridor to see the workers ahead of them being
          frisked by hand, then scanned by a wand similar to the one
          that Pikul used at the church.

                         PIKUL
          That sounds like a game that's
          not going to be easy to market.

                         GELLER

                         (LAUGHS)
          But it's a game that everybody's
          already playing! Existence, it's
          wonderful!

          INT. TROUT FARM. ASSEMBLY LINE - DAY

          Pikul and Geller have passed through security and now enter
          the assembly-line arena. They see Nourish at his accustomed
          place on the line, hunched over a pile of insect
          motherboards and now seeming, somehow, menacing, predatory
          in profile. The pair skirt the assembly-line area, carefully
          scanning as they go, but there is no wicker basket to be
          seen.

          INT. TROUT FARM. ASSEMBLY BAYS - DAY

          Pikul and Geller walk down the aisle connecting the assembly
          bays. Other workers drift casually in and out, preparing for
          their day in a desultory fashion.

                         PIKUL
          The cashier said it would be in a
          familiar place. Is there such a
          thing here?

                         GELLER
          My assembly bay.
          They make their way to the last assembly bay and slip inside
          it. There is, for the moment, nobody else there, but several
          pods have been left on the work tables half-assembled.
          Pikul spots it first, in the far corner: a large, mouldy
          wicker basket in the opposite corner. Something lumpy in it
          is covered by a thread-bare canvas sheet.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PIKUL
          Is that it over there?
          They stroll over to the basket. Geller kneels down and
          carefully begins to unwrap it while Pikul stands guard.

                         GELLER
          I'd say it's exactly as
          advertised.
          The final wrap comes off. In the basket is a necrotic,
          purpled, very diseased-looking pod.

                         PIKUL
          God, it's ugly. Even for a game-
          pod.

                         GELLER

                         (PAUSE)
          I have a terrible urge to port
          into it. What about you?

                         PIKUL
          (he thinks she's joking)
          Oh, sure. Yes. Desperate to port
          into it.
          Geller steps over to a bunch of UmbyCords draped over a peg
          and strips one off. She sits down on a rotting wooden
          folding chair next to the death-pod's basket and ports in
          one end of the UmbyCord.

                         GELLER
          Here we go. Wanna give me a hand?

                         PIKUL

                         (HORRIFIED)
          You're not serious! I mean,
          that's a diseased pod! Once you
          port into that, you become,
          you... you...

                         GELLER
          (a quick smile)
          Exactly. Help me.
          Pikul kneels beside her as she pulls up her shirt to reveal
          her bioport. Geller hands him the free end of the UmbyCord
          and he ports it into her.

                         PIKUL
          How long does it take for the
          infection to take hold?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GELLER
          No time at all.

                         PIKUL
          And then you quietly port into
          all the other pods and spread the
          infection to them...

                         GELLER
          (pale, shaky)
          Oh, God!

                         PIKUL
          What's happening?

                         GELLER

                         F (SWOONING)
          Something's wrong!

                         PIKUL

                         (SUPPORTING HER)
          I'm gonna unport you now.
          Pikul tries to unport Geller, but her bioport has swollen
          and seized the jack. He gives the UmbyCord a tug.

                         GELLER
          (in sudden pain)
          0, God, don't! That really hurts!
          Pikul lets go. The death-pod, triggered off by Pikul's
          attempt to disconnect Geller, now begins to convulse in
          peristaltic waves in its wicker basket. Pikul looks around
          desperately and spots a clutch of tools hanging from nails
          on the wall.

                         PIKUL

                         (RISING)
          I'm going to cut you free!

                         GELLER
          No, don't, I'm afraid!
          But Pikul seizes a crude linoleum knife used for trimming
          oversized motherboards and, with three erratic slashes at
          the quivering UmbyCord, hacks her loose. Blood immediately
          pours out of both ends of the severed cord.

                         GELLER C
          (wide-eyed, quietly)
          Pikul. I'm bleeding to death.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          .9
          Panic-stricken, Pikul steps on Geller's end of the cord to
          stop the bleeding. It seems to work, but Geller moans
          horribly.

                         PIKUL

                         (TERRIFIED)
          I'm sorry! I don't know what else
          to do!

                         NOURISH
          I know what to do.
          Pikul twists awkwardly around to see Yevgeny Nourish
          standing just behind him. He is in the process of slipping a
          large propane torch off its wall hook.

                         NOURISH
          I know exactly what to do.
          Nourish unscrews the gas valve and ignites the torch.

                         NOURISH
          Death to Realism!
          Nourish turns the blazing torch on the pod in the basket.
          Where the cone of flame hits the pod, it begins to shrivel,
          crackle, sputter fat. The pod itself tries to ripple away
          from the searing flame as though it were alive. Nourish
          laughs and begins to play the cone over the entire surface
          of the pod.
          Geller sinks to the ground in exhaustion, holds on to
          Pikul's leg.
          The death-pod now swells and bubbles under the torch's
          flame, then explodes with a dull whump.

          INT. TROUT FARM. ASSEMBLY LINE - DAY

          A huge cloud, speckled black and gray, billows upwards and
          floats out over the intersecting walls of the stalls and
          into the main area of the Trout Farm's assembly line, where
          it begins to settle like granular. ash on the startled
          workers.

          INT. TROUT FARM. ASSEMBLY BAYS - NIGHT

          i Horrified, Nourish watches the thick cloud of infectious
          spores floating out of his reach.

                         NOURISH

                         (HORRIFIED)
          No, no!

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         S:
          Gathering up her last shreds of energy, Geller suddenly
          shoves a startled Pikul off her cord and picks up the
          linoleum knife from where Pikul dropped it.
          Trailing her bloody cord, she lunges at Nourishi driving the
          rusty, curved blade into his back with great force. Nourish
          turns to Geller, the torch circling towards her, wavering.
          He tries to touch her with the flame, staggers.

                         NOURISH

                         (DYING)
          Death... death to the demoness
          Barb Brecken... to the...

                         PIKUL
          Death to who?
          (he fingers his ID card)
          Oh, yeah... Barb...
          Nourish drops the torch, falls to the ground and snaps into
          the foetal position. A wall of flame roars up around him,
          fueled by the straw, wood, canvas, pod-oils. Pikul jumps
          over to Geller and picks up the trailing cord, twists it in
          his hands until it stops bleeding.
          All four walls of the assembly bay are on fire now. The
          doorway is a flapping sheet of flame. Mixing with the
          swelling rush of the flame are the sounds of the entire
          plant going on alert: yells, screams, sirens, running feet,
          doors being slammed open and closed.
          Pikul holds Geller tightly. She is limp, weak, drained in
          his arms.

                         PIKUL
          I think we just lost the game.
          But now, strange, anomalous objects begin to appear out a
          nowhere in the flames - a chair, a tv set, a bath tub, a
          table, objects emerging into the game from the quest chalet.
          After a moment's confusion, Pikul smiles.

                         PIKUL
          Or maybe not.
          And sure enough, the Trout Farm and its flames and its black
          cloud melt away.

          INT. GUEST CHALET - NIGHT

          As the guest chalet melts up around them, Pikul finds
          himself back on the bed, as he expected; but he is still
          embracing the swooning Geller, which he had not expected.

                         PIKUL
          Allegra, we're back home. What's
          the matter, what's wrong?
          As Geller swims back up into full consciousness, she begins
          to talk, mumbling at first, then with terrible clarity.

                         GELLER

                         (BARELY COHERENT)
          Pikul. It's here, it's happened.
          It's come back here with us. We
          brought it back with us from
          eXistenZ.

                         PIKUL
          Brought what back? I can't
          understand what you're saying.

                         GELLER

                         (WITH CLARITY)
          We brought the disease back with
          us. My pod is diseased.
          As though realizing the implications of what she's saying
          for the first time, Geller twists away from Pikul and begins
          to fumble with her UmbyJack.

                         GELLER
          Oh God, I'm really going to lose
          it, I'm going to lose my game!
          Unport me! C'mon, unport me!
          Pikul unports her, then begins to tug at his own jack. When
          he takes a close look at the pod, he can see that it looks -
          unhealthy.
          Geller jumps off the bed and yanks open her bag on the
          table. She pulls out a tiny hypodermic syringe, unwraps it,
          flicks the bubbles out of it, falls to her knees beside the
          bed.

                         GELLER

                         (TO POD)
          I'm coming, I'm coming!
          Geller jabs the pod with the needle. As sne pushes in the
          plunger, she starts to massage it with her free hand, rub
          it, prod it. She's so close to it we think she might give it
          mouth-to-mouth.

                         PIKUL
          But this can't be possible. How
          can a game event emerge into real
          life?

                         GELLER

                         (PANICKING)
          There's a very weird reality-
          bleed-through effect happening
          here. I'm not sure I get it.
          Pikul finally gets his UmbyCord unplugged.

                         PIKUL
          What's in that needle?

                         GELLER
          It's an anti-viral serum. It
          sometimes works if you get it in
          time.
          Unconsciously, Pikul scratches at his bioport. Geller fixes
          on him with strange intensity.

                         GELLER
          Lemme see your bioport.

                         PIKUL
          What?

                         GELLER
          Lemme see it!
          Pikul turns and shows it to her. She begins to examine it
          with microscopic, clinical attention.

                         GELLER
          I know what happened. It's
          Vinokur, that bastard.

                         PIKUL
          Vinokur?

                         GELLER
          He gave you a new bioport, didn't
          he?

                         PIKUL
          Oh, no.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GELLER
          He gave you an infected bioport
          so that my pod would die and so
          would my game-system.

                         PIKUL
          I'm infected? Wait a minute!

                         GELLER

                         (IN TEARS)
          The poor thing was trying to tell
          us that it was sick by
          introducing the theme of disease
          into our game.

                         PIKUL
          The theme of disease? I'm fucking
          reall infected! Is it going to
          crawl up my spine and rot my
          brain?

                         GELLER
          (suddenly all business)
          All right, don't panic. I've got
          something that will help you.
          Brusquely wiping away her tears, Geller goes over to her bag
          and takes out a cork-shaped plastic capsule. She snaps open
          the capsule to reveal a knurled, plug-like electronic
          device.

                         GELLER
          I'm going to seal up your bioport
          with this anti-viral resonator.
          Geller bends over Pikul and works the device into his
          bioport until it's flush with his skin.

                         GELLER
          (inserting the device)
          It uses the Umby pick-ups for
          power. Should cleanse all your
          porting channels of infection in
          a few hours. It'11 give you a
          little skin buzz when it's done.
          Of course, we can't play until
          then.

                         PIKUL
          (controlling his panic)
          Yeah, great. Now, listen. This
          could be critical. Were you
          really saying that Vinokur is an

          eXistenZialists? Because if he
          is, if he's with them, then we
          are really...

                         GELLER

                         (WAILING)
          Oh, God! Pikul, my pod's dying.
          Sure enough, the thing is quivering, rippling, convulsing,
          turning purple.

                         GELLER

                         (WAILING)
          I can't help it! I can't do
          anything for it!
          Geller falls to her knees beside the pod.
          As though triggered by this action, an explosion in the
          nearest chalet blows the windows and the door out of the
          guest chalet. Pikul and Geller are knocked to the floor by
          the impact of the blast.
          Waves of heat and debris billow into the room.
          A moment of eery silence, and then Pikul and Geller peek
          wide-eyed over the-edge of the bed. Flames now engulf the
          nearby chalet, all too clearly visible throught the
          shattered window frames.
          Sounds of pandemonium begin to well up from the hills below,
          and then a figure steps boldly in through the doorway. When
          the flamelight flickers over his face, Pikul and Geller are
          stunned to see that it is the cashier, and he is cradling a
          real-life submachine gun in his arms.
          The cashier screams at the bewildered and terrified pair.

                         CASHIER

                         (SCREAMS)
          The uprising has begun! The whole
          place is on fire! Let's go!
          You've got to get out of here.
          They'll be looking for you.

                         PIKUL

                         (TO GELLER)
          The cashier? He's a game
          character! How can he be here?

                         GELLER
          I don't know! I don't know!
          The cashier strides into the room and pulls her to her feet.
          She tries to pick up her pod, but the cashier tugs her away
          from it.

                         CASHIER
          Leave that rotting piece of meat
          here. It's done its job. Let it
          die.

                         GELLER
          But my game! My game's inside it.
          I don't want my game to die.
          The cashier unslings his submachine gun, cocks it, and blows
          the pod into streaks of slime, flesh, and slivers of insect-
          board. Geller is in shock. Pikul turns her to face him,
          speaks' forcefully right into her face, shuts everything else
          out.

                         PIKUL
          Allegra, listen to me. I think
          we're still inside the game. I
          think your real pod's out there
          somewhere, somewhere safe. I
          think it's OK to let go of this
          one, this pod. It's not the real
          one.
          A Molotov cocktail comes sailing into the room and shatters
          against the bed. The bed ignites with an explosive whump.

                         CASHIER
          Everybody out! now!
          The three of them scramble out into the fiery night.

          EXT. CALEDON SKI-CLUB COMPOUND - NIGHT

          The cashier leads Pikul and Geller out of the guest chalet
          and down the mountain path. The chalet next to theirs begins
          to implode as they scurry by it.
          As they flee, they realize that all the chalets are on fire.
          There are people trying to fight the fires, running
          r frantically everywhere with hand-held extinguishers. There
          is also scattered gunfire, but who's firing on whom is
          impossible to tell.

          EXT. HILLTOP - NIGHT

          The cashier now leads them up to the top of a hill.

                         CASHIER
          Up here. We can see everything
          from here.

                         PIKUL
          What is it that we're seeing?

                         CASHIER

                         (GLEEFUL)
          The victory of Realism. And you
          were part of it.

                         (DESOLATE)
          The death of eXistenZ. And we
          were part of it.
          The cashier turns on her with his gun. He snaps out his old
          clip and slams home a new one. He cocks the gun.

                         CASHIER
          There's just one more thing.

                         PIKUL

                         (HORRIFIED)

                         (FIERCE)
          How could you be? How could
          Allegra Geller, the world's
          premiere game designer, be on our
          side?
          (off their bewildered

                         LOOKS)
          Oh, Y93.' We know who you are. You
          can't hide inside a game forever.

                         PIKUL
          Something's slipped over the
          edge, here, Allegra. Something's
          all wrong.

                         CASHIER

                         (SMILES)
          There. You see what I mean. You
          see the problem.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         9'
          The cashier raises his gun to fire at Geller, but before he
          can pull the trigger, he jolts backwards and falls twitching
          to the ground.
          From the shadows of the trees, backlit by the fiery
          landscape below, steps Kiri Vinokur. In his hand he holds
          the gristle gun which Pikul assembled in the Chinese
          restaurant.

                         VINOKUR
          I tried to find you. Thank God I
          got here in time.
          (pause; waggles the gun)
          My dog brought me this.

                         GELLER

                         (BACKING AWAY)
          You didn't get here in time. My
          game is dead.

                         (FOCUSSING)
          You murdered my game.

                         VINOKUR

                         (LAUGHS)
          No, just your pod. I replicated
          the entire contents of your pod
          when I fixed your nerve boards.
          They're in safe-keeping. They're
          all in one piece.

                         GELLER

          Only from Antenna Research.

                         VINOKUR
          But why stay with them? Look at
          that mess down there. How could
          you trust Antenna again, when
          they've endangered you like this?
          Geller seems to have lost the thread. She wanders over to
          the cashier's body and disentangles his submachine gun from
          him.

                         GELLER
          (referring to cashier)
          You know, this guy was actually
          going to kill me.
          Vinokur looks to Pikul for support.

                         VINOKUR

                         (TO PIKUL)
          Can you talk to her? I mean, we
          can take you with us too.
          But before Pikul can respond, Geller, now sitting next to
          the cashier's body on the grass, opens fire at Vinokur with
          the submachine gun. Vinokur falls with a startled expression
          on his face.
          Pikul, absolutely horrified, runs at Geller and kicks the
          weapon out of her hand, picks it up himself.

                         PIKUL
          What the fuck are you doing?!
          You've killed him! Are you gonna
          kill me next?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         A-

                         GELLER

                         (LAUGHS GIDDILY)
          C'mon, Pikul. He's only a game
          character. And I didn't like the
          way he was messing with my mind.

                         PIKUL

                         (SUDDENLY CALM)
          Didn't you? You didn't like that
          and so you killed him?

                         GELLER
          He was only a game character.

                         PIKUL

                         (QUIETLY)
          But Allegra. What if we're not in
          the game anymore?

                         GELLER
          (confused, childlike)
          Huh? If... if we... we're not?

                         PIKUL

                         (STRANGELY HARD)
          If we're not, then you just
          killed someone real. A real
          person.

                         (PAUSE)
          You see what can happen. It's
          important for me that you see
          that.

                         GELLER
          Why?

                         PIKUL
          (standing over her)
          It wasn't an accident that you
          and I ended up on the run
          together.

                         GELLER
          Not an accident?
          Pikul hefts the submachine gun in his hands.

                         PIKUL
          No.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GELLER

                         (COLD)
          That's why you never had a
          bioport. You were one of them.

                         PIKUL
          I still am one of them.

                         GELLER
          But you have a bioport now.

                         (IRONIC)
          I thought that was forbidden to
          Anti-eXistenZialists.

                         PIKUL
          I made the bioport sacrifice to
          get close to you, to make love to
          my enemy.

                         GELLER
          Why would you do that?

                         PIKUL
          To understand what I have to
          kill.

          7.

                         GELLER

                         (QUIETLY)
          Then. understand this.
          Geller produces a tiny electronic remote controller from the
          pocket of her shirt.

                         GELLER
          Understand that I suspected who
          you were from the moment you made
          that fake phone call to yourself
          in the limo. Understand that I
          knew you were my real assassin
          when you pointed the gun at me in
          the Chinese restaurant.
          She flicks up a safety cover on the remote's tip, revealing
          a toggle switch. Pikul's hands tense around the submachine
          gun.

                         GELLER
          And understand that you're dead.
          Geller flips the toggle switch. The base of Pikul's spine
          blows out, his shirt billowing with blood as his bioport
          explodes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         9:
          A delighted Geller dances to her feet as Pikul staggers
          backwards.

                         GELLER

                         (GLEEFUL)
          Death to the demon Ted Pikul!
          His eyes frozen in a death stare, Pikul falls, rolls down
          the hill into the underbrush. Smoke creeping up from the
          fires below curls over him like a blanket.
          Arms raised in the air, Geller dances around on the top of
          the hill, looking down on the flames and the chaos.

                         GELLER
          (confident, laughing)
          Have I won the game? Have I won?
          Have I won?
          The hill, the trees, the flames melt down around her.

          INT. COUNTRY CHURCH - NIGHT

          We melt back up into the church, which we last saw in the
          first scene. But there are many differences between then and
          now,
          Geller is sitting in her chair on the dais as before, her
          eyes just beginning to flutter open. But Pikul is sitting
          next to her, also playing the game. And next to him is
          Nourish, whom we are even more surprised to see in this
          context.
          Aad in fact, the players who are sitting in the circle of
          chairs on the dais are all characters who have been in the
          movie up to this point: Nader, the cashier, Dichter, Gas,
          Vinkokur, even Frances, the limo driver.
          The players are all emerging from a game that has just ended
          - the movie we have been watching - and they begin to stir
          in their game gear, which is nothing like the organic pod-
          technology we have just seen.
          On the contrary, the garners are wearing head-gear with
          electrodes, more like normal clunky Virtual-Reality
          equipment, and are linked by mundane wires. In their laps
          they hold, not game-pods, but sleek plastic game modules,
          each about the size of a walkman, with holes into Which
          I their left thumbs are inserted - a simpler and cruder
          version of the bioports we have become used to.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Watching the proceedings from down on the church floor are
          two security guards, neither of whom is Pikul, of course. On
          a leash, one of the security guards holds the dog that, in
          the game, picked up the gristle gun in the Chinese
          restaurant.
          Also monitoring the action are a woman, Merle, who is the
          game's actual project manager - the real-life version of the
          game-character Levi - and her two assistants.
          There is a collective sigh as the game finally releases the
          players, and now they are free to remove their thumbs from
          the game modules and slide their head-gear off.
          The two assistants - the real-life ones are both matronly
          women - begin to help everyone unplug, neatly gathering up
          the equipment in padded bags as they go.
          A broadly smiling Merle mounts the dais and stands in the
          centre of the ring of players.

                         MERLE
          Are you all back?
          The man whom we knew in the game as Yevgeny Nourish
          immediately stands and takes charge. But it is a different
          Nourish, exuberant, sensitive and artistic.

                         NOURISH
          We're back, Merle. Although I
          have a feeling some of our crew
          might not realize it yet.
          Shaky laughter from some of the players.
          Throughout the following round of comments from the garners,
          whom we now realize have been, up to now, playing characters
          in a game, we hear nothing from Pikul and Geller. These two,
          who sit next to each other and are now holding hands, remain
          enigmatically silent.

                         WAITER
          Wow. Anybody here want a bowl of
          hot and sour soup?

                         (LAUGHTER)

                         VINOKUR
          I will, if you make sure there

                         R
          are some insect boards in the

                         F(
          rice.

                         (LAUGHTER)

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         FEMALE ASSISTANT
          How long were we gone?

                         MERLE
          About twenty minutes.

                         T

                         DICHTER
          It seemed like days. That's
          fantastic.

                         FEMALE ASSISTANT
          Yeah. If you stayed in the
          gameworld for most of your life,
          you could live to be five hundred
          years old!

                         (LAUGHTER)

                         CASHIER
          The twists and turns at the end
          made my head spin. Maybe there
          were too many, to fast to absorb.
          (to Pikul and Geller)
          Hey, but you two were fantastic.
          You guys are game divas! I think
          you both deserved to win.
          There is general agreement amongst the garners about this
          compliment to Pikul and Geller. The pair just smile sweetly
          and bob their heads modestly at the smattering of applause.

                         GAS
          (a little jealous)
          Well me, I was really bummed out
          at first. I got knocked out of
          the game so soon. It was fun to
          watch the rest, though. I liked
          that part where the ones who got
          knocked out of the game early got
          to be spooky customers in the
          game store.

                         LEVI
          But you were so wonderfully bad.
          So scary and crazy. I had a lot
          to do in that first scene in the
          church but I thought my character
          was kind of boring.

                         GAS
          Well, you know, I'm a gas-jockey
          in real life, so I was kind of
          disappointed that I was basically
          the same thing in the game. A
          little more fantasy, there,
          fellers.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         Y{

                         MERLE

                         (NODDING SAGELY)
          Interesting. Interesting. Hold
          that thought for the focus group.

                         FRANCES
          (indicating game module)
          Can I keep this? I've never felt
          anything like it! And I love this
          little thumb-hole. It's
          fantastic!
          (appreciative laughs and

                         APPLAUSE)

                         NOURISH

                         (LAUGHS)
          Nice try, but you're going to
          have to turn them in because
          they're beta versions, pre-
          production hand-made specials,
          and we need to study them after
          use for wear and tear and other
          things. But you'll get a
          certificate for helping us out
          here - I'm right about that,
          aren't I, Merle?

                         MERLE

                         (NODDING ENTHUSIASTICALLY)
          And that will entitle you to
          reserve one of the first batch of
          the TranscendenZ by PilgrImage
          game modules to hit the market,
          and at a seriously discounted
          price. You're gonna love it.
          Amidst applause and general excitement, Merle turns to the
          tripod-mounted chalkboard standing, as in the first scene,
          at the back of the dais. There we see the words that she has
          already written: TranscendenZ by PilgrImage.

                         MERLE
          Remember - it's written like
          this. Capital T, capital Z.
          TranscendenZ. It's new, it's from
          Pilgrimage - capital P. capital
          I, and it's coming soon.

          Allegra Geller now stands up, walks over to Nourish and
          gently takes his hand. He turns to see who's got him, then
          smiles broadly.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         95

                         GELLER

                         (SHYLY)
          I'd just like to say thank you to
          Mr. Nourish for giving me the
          chance to play the role of a star
          designer. I guess the game picked
          up on my ambitions to be like
          you.

                         NOURISH
          well, let me first say that I'm
          kinda glad I lost this game. I
          don't usually play such nasty
          characters.

                         (LAUGHTER)
          And, Allegra, you were so good in
          that role that I suspect it won't
          be long before PilgrImage is
          after you to sign a designing
          contract.
          (applause and laughter)
          And maybe you should take your
          friend Ted, here, Mr. Pikul, with
          you. He's obviously good in a
          crisis, and when you design
          games, there are plenty of them.
          Amid the renewed good-natured laughter, Geller blushes. She
          reaches out for Pikul's hand.

                         GELLER
          I guess you all could tell that
          Ted and I had a relationship
          prior to our coming here. We
          really do like to play together.

                         PIKUL
          (shy but determined)
          We do, but I'd like to assure
          everybody here that Allegra
          wouldn't really jump into bed
          with a security guard unless he
          was me.
          (laughs from the security

                         GUARDS)
          Merle holds out her hand in a gesture of appreciation
          towards Nourish.

                         MERLE
          Well, what do we say to our
          brilliant, award-winning game
          designer, Yevgeny Nourish? Does
          he have another winner on his
          hands or not?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PC
          Wild applause from all garners, including Geller and Pikul.

                         MERLE
          All right, now, I have to ask you
          some questions, before the game
          half-life wears off. First, let
          me thank you for taking part in
          this test seminar. PilgrImage
          wants to deliver nothing but the
          finest to the game enthusiast,
          and you have all been a proud
          part of that process tonight.
          When we've collected all the
          head-sets and game modules, we'll
          be handing out a questionnaire to
          each of you, and I'd like your
          answers to the questions to be as
          honest, as brutal, as clear as
          you can make them. Don't hold
          back. After that, we're going to
          form a focus group where we'll
          discuss details of each of your
          experiences playing TranscendenZ.
          You've all had different but
          interlocking lives in the game,
          and I think you'll be amazed when
          you hear each other's stories.

          INT. COUNTRY CHURCH. MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

          While the questionnaires are being handed out by the
          assistants, Nourish confers with Merle in a corner.

          Merle, I was very disturbed by
          the game we just played.

                         MERLE
          What do you mean?

                         NOURISH
          It had a very strong, very real
          anti-game theme. I mean, it began
          with the assassination of a game
          designer.

                         MERLE
          or Really? But that's very creative.

                         (PAUSE)
          But on second thought, I see what
          you mean. It makes me nervous.
          You think it must have come from
          one of our game players?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         NOURISH
          It sure didn't come from me. The
          tone of it in the game was very,
          very passionate, fanatical. And
          the atmosphere of paranoia and
          betrayal was overwhelming. The
          whole thing felt unstable,
          dangerous, volatile. But worse
          than that, there was a kind of
          industrial espionage subplot.
          Stealing game-systems, jumping
          ship from one game company to
          another. That kind of thing.
          They both reflexively begin to scan the gaming group, who
          are all innocently dealing with their question cards.

                         MERLE
          So which one of them did these
          elements come from?

                         NOURISH
          Let's probe it when we do the
          focus group. I think we might
          have been infiltrated here, and
          if we have, we've got a big
          security problem.
          Pikul and'Geller, questionnaires in hand, wander over to the
          wary Nourish and Merle. Pikul is now leading the dog that
          the security guard was holding for him earlier on, the model
          for the game dog in the Chinese restaurant.

                         PIKUL
          Hi. We were just wondering if we
          could ask Mr. Nourish a question,
          away from all the others.

                         NOURISH
          Sure. Shoot.

                         (CHUCKLES)
          Long as you don't ask me to fill
          in your questionnaire.

                         PIKUL

                         (NO CHUCKLES)
          We've played your game now, and
          so we can finally agree with the
          others that you are the world's
          greatest game artist.

                         (OMINOUSLY)
          We weren't sure before.

          Well, thank you so much.

          Yevgeny, don't you think you
          should suffer for all the harm
          you've done, and intend to do, to
          the human race?

                         NOURISH

                         (STUNNED)
          What?

                         PIKUL
          Yes. Don't you think the world's
          greatest game artist ought to be
          punished for the most effective
          deforming of reality?

                         MERLE

                         (NERVOUSLY)
          I don't think this is very...
          (looks towards security

                         GUARDS)
          Boys? Could you come over here -
          right now!
          But it's too late. Geller reaches down and pulls a flap of
          false fur and skin away from the dog to reveal two semi-
          automatic pistols strapped to the dog's flank. Pikul and
          Geller grab the guns, pull back the slides, and cooly
          execute Merle and Nourish, who bump grotesquely together as
          they slump to the ground.
          In the stunned silence that follows, only the clatter of the
          last few shells bouncing around on the hardwood floor can be
          heard. Pikul and Geller glance at each other,. pumped, then
          fill the silence.

                         GELLER

                         (SCREAMS)
          Death to the demon Yevgeny
          Nourish!

                         PIKUL =

                         (SCREAMS)
          Death to PilgrImage! Death to
          TranscendenZ!

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         33
          Now a hesitant shuffling of feet causes Pikul and Geller to
          whirl and catch the security guards coming at them with
          their pathetic scanning wands. The guards stop in their
          tracks, raise their hands, and start to back away as the
          place suddenly explodes in screams and pandemonium.
          As Pikul and Geller in their turn back towards the front
          exit, they glide past the young Chinese man who was the
          waiter in the game. The waiter stands flattened out in fear
          against a pillar with his questionnaire and his pencil in
          his hand.
          They ignore the waiter, but stop to wait for Pikul's dog to
          trot calmly past them, heading for the door.
          Now Pikul and Geller are just about to turn and follow the
          dog when the waiter unfreezes and takes a step away from the
          pillar towards them. They immediately swing their pistols
          over towards him. The waiter stops and raises his hands.

                         WAITER
          No, wait, you don't have to shoot
          me. I just wanted to ask you a
          question. _

                         (WARY)
          What?

                         WAITER

                         (INNOCENT)
          Hey, tell me the truth. Are we
          still in the game?
          Pikul and Geller look at each other, then into the camera.
          The church melts down around them into blackness.
