Star Wars: Episode 1:The Phantom Menace



TITLE CARD : A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....

A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title, followed by
a roll up, which crawls up into infinity.

EPISODE 1 THE PHANTOM MENACE

Turmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic. The taxation of trade routes to
outlaying star systems is in dispute.
Hoping to resolve the matter with a blockade of deadly battleships, the
greedy Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to the small planet of
Naboo.
While the congress of the Republic endlessly debates this alarming chain of
events, the Supreme Chancellor has secretly dispatched two Jedi Knights,
the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy, to settle the
conflict.....

PAN DOWN to reveal a small space cruiser heading TOWARD CAMERA at great
speed. PAN with the cruiser as it heads towardthe beautiful green planet of
Naboo, which is surrounded by hundreds of Trade Federation battleships.

INT. REPUBLIC CRUISER - COCKPIT


In the cockpit of the cruise, the CAPTAIN and PILOT maneuver closer to one
of the battleships.

QUI-GON : (off screen voice) Captain.

The Captain turns to an unseen figure sitting behind her.

CAPTAIN : Yes, sir?
QUI-GON : (V.O) Tell them we wish to board at once.
CAPTAIN : Yes, sir.

The CAPTAIN looks to her view screen, where NUTE GUNRAY, a Neimoidian trade
viceroy, waits for a reply.

CAPTAIN : (cont'd) With all due respect for the Trade Federation, the
Ambassodors for the Supreme Chancellor wish to board immediately.
NUTE : Yes, yes, of coarse...ahhh...as you know, our blockade is perfectly
legal, and we'd be happy to recieve the Ambassador...Happy to.

The screen goes black. Out the cockpit window, the sinister battleship
looms ever closer.

EXT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - DOCKING BAY - SPACE (FX)

The small space cruiser docks in the enormous main bay of the Federation
battleship.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - DOCKING BAY - SPACE

A PROTOCOL DROID, TC-14, waits at the door to the docking bay. Two WORKER
DROIDS, PK-4 and EG-9 watch.

PK-4 : They must be important if the Viceroy sent one of those useless
protocol gearheads to greet them.

The door opens, and the Republic cruiser can be seen in the docking bay.
Two darkly robed figures are greeted by TC-14.

TC-14 : I'm TC-14 at your service. This way, please.

They move off down the hallway.

EG-9 : A Republic cruiser! That's trouble...don't you think?
PR-4 : I'm not made to think.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM

A door slides open, and the two cloaked shapes are led PAST CAMERA into the
formal conference room by TC-14.

TC-14 : I hope you honoured sirs with the most comfortable here. My master
will be with you shortly.

The droid bows before OBI-WAN KENOBI and QUI- GON JINN. He backs out the
door and it closes. The JEDI lower their hoods and look out a large window
at the lush green planet of Naboo. QUI-GON sixty years old, has long white
hair in a ponytail. He is tall and striking, with blue eyes. OBI-WAN is
twenty five, with very short brown hair, pale skin, and blue eyes. Several
exotic, bird-like creatures SING in a cage near the door.

OBI-WAN : I have a bad feeling about this.
QUI-GON : I don't sense anything.
OBI-WAN : It's not about the mission, Master, it's
somethging...elsewhere...elusive.
QUI-GON : Don't center on your anxiety, Obi-Wan. Keep your concentration
here and now where it belongs.
OBI-WAN : Master Yoda says I should be mindful of the future...
QUI-GON : .....but not at the expense of the moment. Be mindful of the
living Force, my young Padawan.
OBI-WAN : Yes, Master...how do you think the trade viceroy will deal with
the chancellor's demands?
QUI-GON : These Federation types are cowards. The negotiations will be
short.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

NUTE GUNRAY and DAULTRAY DOFINE stand, stunned, before TC-14.

NUTE : (shaken) What?!? What did you say?
TC-14 : The Ambassadors are Jedi Knights, I believe.
DOFINE : I knew it! They were sent to force a settlement, eh. Blind me,
we're done for!

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY

A hologram of NUTE , surrounded by BATTLE DROIDS, appears in the conference
room hallway.

NUTE : They must be dead by now. Blast, what's left of them.

The hologram fades off, as a BATTLE DROID, OWO-1, cautiously opens the
door. A deadly green cloud billows from the room. BATTLE DROIDS cock their
weapons as a figure stumbles out of the smoke. It is TC-14 , carrying the
tray of drinks.

TC14 : Oh, excuse me, so sorry.

The PROTOCOL DROID passes the armed camp just as two flashing laser swords
fly out of the deadly fog, cutting down several BATTLE DROIDS before they
can fire.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

The bridge is a cocophony of alarms. NUTE and RUNE watch OWO-1 on the
viewscreen.

OWO-1 : Not sure exactly what...

OWO-1 is suddenly cut in half in mid-sentence. RUNE gives NUTE a worried
look.

NUTE : What in blazes is going on down there?
RUNE : Have you ever encountered a Jedi Knight before, sir?
NUTE : Well, not exactly, but I don't...(panicked) Seal off the bridge.
RUNE : That won't be enough, sir.

The doors to the bridge SLAM shut.

NUTE : I want destroyer droids up here at once!!!
RUNE : We will not survive this.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE

QUI-GON cuts several BATTLE DROIDS in half, creating a shower of sparks and
metal parts. OBI-WAN raises his hand, sending several BATTLE DROIDS
crashing into the wall.

QUI-GON makes his way to the bridge door and begins to cut through it.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

The CREW is very nervous as sparks start flying around the bridge door.
QUI-GON and OBI-WAN are on the view screen.

NUTE : Close the blast doors!!!

The huge, very thick blast door slams shut, followed by a second door, then
a third. There is a hissing sound as the huge doors seal shut. QUI-GON tabs
the door with his sword. The screen goes black as a red spot appears in the
center of the blast door.

RUNE : ...They're still coming through!

On the door, chunks of molten metal begin to drop away.

NUTE : Impossible!! This is impossible!!
RUNE : Where are those destroyer droids?!

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE

Ten ugly destroyer WHEEL DROIDS roll down the hallway at full speed. Just
before they get to the bridge area, they stop and transform into their
battle configuration. QUI-GON can't see them but senses their presence.

QUI-GON : Destroyer droids!
OBI-WAN : Offhand, I'd say this mission is past the negotiaion stage.

The WHEEL DROIDS, led by P-59, rush the entry area from three hallways,
blasting away with their laser guns. They stop firing and stand in a
semi-circle as the smoke clears. OBI-WAN and QUI-GON are nowhere to be
seen.

P-59 : Switch to bio...There they are!

The Jedi materialize at the far end of the hallway and dash through the
doorway that slams shut. The WHEEL DROIDS blast away at the two JEDI with
their laser swords.

OBI-WAN : They have shield generators!
QUI-GON : It's a standoff! Let's go!

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

NUTE and RUNE stand on the bridge, watching the view screen as the WHEEL
DROIDS' POV speeds to the doorway.

RUNE : We have them on the run, sir...they're no match for destroyer
droids.
TEY HOW : Sir, they've gone up the ventilation shaft.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - MAIN BAY

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN appear at a large vent in a giant hanger bay. They are
careful not to be seen. Thousands of BATTLE DROIDS are loading onto landing
craft.

QUI-GON : Battle droids.
OBI-WAN : It's an invisible army.
QUI-GON : It's an odd play for the Trade Federation. We've got to warn the
Naboo and contact Chancellor Valorum. Let's split up. Stow aboard separate
ships and meet down on the planet.
OBI-WAN : You were right about one thing, Master. The negotiations were
short.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

TEY HOW recieves a transmission.

TEY HOW : Sir, a transmission from the planet.
RUNE : It's Queen Amidala herself.
NUTE : At last we're getting results.

On the view screen, QUEEN AMIDALA appears in her throne room. Wearing her
elaborate headdress and robes, she sits, surrounded by the GOVERNING
COUNCIL and FOUR HANDMAIDENS, EIRTAE, YANE, RABE, and SACHE.

NUTE : (cont'd) Again you come before me, Your highness. The Federation is
pleased.
AMIDALA : You will not be pleased when you hear what I have to say,
Viceroy...Your trade boycott of our planet has ended.

NUTE smirks at RUNE.

NUTE : I was not aware of such a failure.
AMIDALA : I have word that the Senate is finally voting on this blockade of
yours.
NUTE : I take it you know the outcome. I wonder why they bother to vote.
AMIDALA : Enough of this pretense, Viceroy! I'm aware the Chancellor's
Ambassadors are with you now, and that you have beencommanded to reach a
settlement.
NUTE : I know nothing about any Ambassadors...you must be mistaken.

AMIDALA, surprised at his reaction, studies him carefully.

AMIDALA : Beware, Viceroy....the Federation is going too far this time.
NUTE : Your Highness, we would never do anything without the approval of
the Senate. You assume too much.
AMIDALA : We will see.

The QUEEN fades off, and the view screen goes black.

RUNE : She's right, the Senate will never....
NUTE : It's too late now.
RUNE : Do you think she suspects an attack?
NUTE : I don't know, but we must move quickly to disrupt all communications
down there.

INT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM

The QUEEN, EIRTAE, SACHE and her Governor, SIO BIBBLE, stand before a
hologram of SENATOR PALPATINE, a thin, kindly man.

PALPATINE : ...How could that be true? I have assurances from the
Chancellor...his Ambassaodrs did arrive. It must be
the...get...negotiate...

The hologram of PALPATIONE sputters and fades away.

AMIDALA : Senator Palpatine?!? (turns to Panaka) What's happening?

CAPTAIN PANAKA turns to his SARGEANT

CAPT. PANAKA : Check the transmission generators...
BIBBLE : A malfunction?
CAPT. PANAKA : It could be the Federation jamming us. Your Highness.
BIBBLE : A communications disruption can only mean one thing. Invasion.
AMIDALA : Don't jump to conclusions, Governor. The Federation would not
dare go that far.
CAPT. PANAKA : The Senate would revoke their trade franchise, and they'd be
finished.
AMIDALA : We must continue to rely on negotiation.
BIBBLE : Negotiation? We've lost all communications!...and where atre the
Chancellors Ambassadors? How can we negotiate? We must prepare to defend
ourselves.
CAPT. PANAKA : This is a dangerous situation, Your Highness. Our security
volunteers will be no match against a battle-hardened Federation army.
AMIDALA : I will not condone a course of action that will lead us to war.

EXT. SPACE LANDING CRAFT - TWILIGHT (FX)

Six landing craft fly in formation toward the surface of the planet Naboo.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP - SHALLOW LAKE - TWILIGHT

Three landing craft slowly descend through the cloud cover of the
perpetually gray twilight side of the planet. One by one, the Federation
warships land in the eerie swamp.
OBI-WAN's head emerges from the mud of a shallow lake. For in the
background, the activities of the invasion force can be seen in the mist.
OBI-WAN takes several deep breaths, then dissapears again under the muddy
swamp. Troop Transports (MTT's) emerge from the landing craft.

EXT. NABOO EDGE OF SWAMP / GRASS PLAINS - TWILIGHT (FX)

The droid invasion force moves out of the swamp and onto a grassy plain.
OOM-9, in his tank, looks out over the vast ARMY marching across the
rolling hills. A small hologram of RUNE and NUTE stands on the tank.

RUNE : ...and there is no trace of the Jedi. They may have gotton onto one
of your landing craft.
OOM-9 : If they are down here, sir, we'll find them. We are moving out of
the swamp and are marching on the cities. We are meeting no resistance.
NUTE : Excellent.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP - TWILIGHT

QUI-GON runs through the strange landscape, glancing back to see the
monstrous troop transports, emerging from the mist. Animals begin to run
past him in a panic.
An odd, frog-like Gungan, JAR JAR INKS, squats holding a clam he has
retrieved from the murky swamp. The shell pops open. JAR JAR's greta tongue
snaps out and grabs the clam, swallowing it in one gulp.
JAR JAR looks up and sees QUI-GON and the other creatures running like the
wind toward him. One of the huge MTT's bears down on the JEDI like a
charging locomotive. JAR JAR stands transfixed, still holding the clam
shell in one hand.

JAR JAR : Oh, noooooooooo!

JAR JAR drops the shell and grabs onto QUI-GON as he passes. The JEDI is
caught by surprise.

JAR JAR : (Cont'd) Hey, help me! Help me!!
QUI-GON : Let go!

The machine is about tp crush them as QUI-GON drags JAR JAR behind him.
Just as the transport is about to hit them, QUI-GON drops, and JAR JAR goes
splat into the mud with him. The transport races overhead.
QUI-GON and JAR JAR pull themselves out of the mud. They stand watching the
war machine dissapear into the mist. JAR JAR grabs QUI-GON and hugs him.

JAR JAR : Oyi, mooie-mooie! I luv yous!

The frog-like creature kisses the JEDI.

QUI-GON : Are you brainless? You almost got us killed!
JAR JAR : I spake.
QUI-GON : The ability to speak does not make you intelligent. Now get outta
here!

QUI-GON starts to move off, and JAR JAR follows.

JAR JAR : No...no! Mesa stay...Mesa yous humble servaunt.
QUI-GON : That wont be necessary.
JAR JAR : Oh boot tis! Tis demunded byda guds. Tis a live debett, tis. Mesa
culled Jaja Binkss.

In the distance, two STAPS burst out of the mist at high speed, chasing
OBI-WAN.

QUI-GON : I have no time for this now...
JAR JAR : Say what?

The two STAPS barrell down on OBI-WAN.

JAR JAR : (cont'd) Oh, nooooo! Weesa ganna....

QUI-GON throws JAR JAR into the mud.

QUI-GON : Stay down!

His head pops up.

JAR JAR : ...dieeee!

The two troops fire laser bolts at OBI-WAN. QUI-GON deflects the bolts
back, and the STAPS blow up. One-two. OBI-WAN is exhausted and tries to
catch his breath.

OBI-WAN : Sorry, Master, the water fried my weapon.

OBI-WAN pulls out his burnt laser sword handle. QUI-GON inspects it, as JAR
JAR pulls himself out of the mud.

QUI-GON : You forgot to turn your power off again, didn't you?

OBI-WAN nods sheeplishly.

QUI-GON : (cont'd) It won't take long to recharge, but this is a lesson I
hope you've learned, my young Padawan.
OBI-WAN : Yes, Master.
JAR JAR : Yousa sav-ed my again, hey?
OBI-WAN : What's this?
QUI-GON : A local. Let's go, before more of those droids show up.
JAR JAR : Mure? Mure did you spake??!?

OBI-WAN and QUI-GON start to run. JAR JAR tries to keep up.

JAR JAR : (cont'd) Ex-squeeze me, but da moto grande safe place would be
Otoh Gunga. Tis where I grew up...Tis safe city.

They all stop.

QUI-GON : A city! (JAR JAR nods his head) Can you take us there?
JAR JAR : Ahhh, will...on second taut...no, not willy.
QUI-GON : No??!
JAR JAR : Iss embarrissing, boot... My afrai my've bean banished. My
forgoten der Bosses would do terrible tings to my. Terrible tings if my
goen back dare.

A PULSATING SOUND is heard in the distance.

QUI-GON : You hear that?

JAR JAR shakes his head yes.

QUI-GON : (cont'd) That's the sound of a thousand terrible things heading
this way...
OBI-WAN : When they find us, they will crush us, grind us into little
pieces, then blast us into oblivion!
JAR JAR : Oh! Yousa point is well seen. Dis way! Hurry!

JAR JAR turns and runs into the swamp.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP LAKE - TWILIGHT

QUI-GON, OBI-WAN and JAR JAR run into a murky lake and stop as JAR JAR
tries to catch his breath. The TRANSPORTS ARE HEARD in the distance.

QUI-GON : Much farther?
JAR JAR : Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN pull out small capsule from their utility belts that
turn into breathing masks.

JAR JAR : (cont'd) My warning yous. Gungans no liken outlaunders. Don't
expict a wern welcome.
OBI-WAN : Don't worry, this has not been our day for warm welcomes.

JAR JAR jumps, does a double somersault with a twist, and dives into the
water.
Breath masks on, QUI-GON and OBI-WAN wade in after him.

EXT. NABOO LAKE - UNDERWATER

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN swim behind JAR JAR, who is very much at home in the
water. Down they swim into murky depths. In the distance the glow of Otoh
Gunga, an underwater city made up of large bubbles, becomes more distinct.
They approach the strange, art nouveau habitat. JAR JAR swims magically
through one of the bubble membranes, which seals behind him. OBI-WAN and
QUI-GON follow.

INT. OTOH GUNGA - CITY SQUARE

GUNGANS in the square scatter when they see the strange JEDI. Four GUARDS
armed with long electro-poles ride two-legged KAADUS into the square. The
GUARDS, led by CAPTAIN TARPALS, point their lethal poles at the dripping
trio.

JAR JAR : Heyo-dalee, Cap'n Tarpals, Mesa back!
CAPT. TARPALS : Noah gain, Jar Jar. Yousa goen tada Bosses. Yousa in big
dudu this time.

CAPT. TARPALS gives JAR JAR a slight zap with his power pole. JAR JAR jumps
and moves off, followed by the two JEDI.

JAR JAR : How wude.

INT. OTOH GUNGA - HIGH TOWER BOARD ROOM

The Bosses' Board Room has bubble walls, with small lighted fish swimming
around outside like moving stars. A long circular judge's bench filled with
GUNGAN OFFICIALS dominates the room. OBI-WAN and QUI-GON stand facing BOSS
NASS, who sits on a bench higher than the others.

BOSS NASS : Yousa cannot bees hair. Dis army of mackineeks up dare tis new
weesong!
QUI-GON : That droid army is about to attack the Naboo. We must warn them.
BOSS NASS : Wesa no like da Naboo! Un dey no like uss-ens. Da Naboo tink
day so smarty den us-ens. Day tink day brains so big.
OBI-WAN : After those droids take control of the surface, they will come
here and take control of you.
BOSS NASS : No, mesa no tink so. Mesa scant talkie witda Naboo, and no
nutten talkie it outlaunders. Dos mackineeks no comen here! Dey not know of
uss-en.
OBI-WAN : You and the Naboo form a symbiont circle. What happens to noe of
you will affect the other. You must understand this.
BOSS NASS : Wesa wish no nutten in yousa tings, outlaunder, and wesa no
care-n about da Naboo.
QUI-GON : (waves his hand) Then speed us on our way.
BOSS NASS : Wesa gonna speed yousaway.
QUI-GON : We need a transport.
BOSS NASS : Wesa give yousa una bongo. Da speedest way tooda Naboo tis goen
through da core. Now go.
QUI-GON : Thank you for your help. We go in peace.

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN turn to leave.

OBI-WAN : Master, whats a bongo?
QUI-GON : A transport, I hope.

The JEDI notice JAR JAR in chains to one side, waiting to hear his verdict.
QUI-GON stops. JAR JAR gives him a forlorn look.

JAR JAR : Daza setten yous up. Goen through da planet core is bad bombin!!
QUI-GON : Thank you, my friend.
JAR JAR : Ahhh...any hep hair would be hot.

JAR JAR's soulful look is counterpointed by a sheepish grin.

OBI-WAN : We are short of time, Master.
QUI-GON : We'll need a navigator to get us through the planet's core. This
Gungan my be of help.

QUI-GON walks bact to BOSS NASS.

QUI-GON : (cont'd) What is to become of Jar Jar Binks here?
BOSS NASS : Binkss brokeen the nocombackie law. Hisen to be pune-ished.
QUI-GON : He has been a great help to us. I hope the punishment will not be
too severe.
BOSS NASS : Pounded unto death.
JAR JAR : (grimacing) Oooooh...Ouch!

OBI-WAN looks concerned. QUI-GON is thinking.

QUI-GON : We need a navigator to get us through the planet's core. I have
saved Jar Jar Binks' life. He owes me what you call a "life.debt."
BOSS NASS : Binks. Yousa havena liveplay with thisen hisen?

JAR JAR nods and joins the JEDI. QUI-GON waves his hand.

QUI-GON : Your gods demand that his life belongs to me now.
BOSS NASS : Hisen live tis yos, outlauder. Begone wit him.
JAR JAR : Count mesa outta dis! Better dead here, den deader in da
core...Yee guds, whata mesa sayin?!

EXT. NABOO CITY - UNDERWATER - SUB (FX)

A strange little submarine propels itself away from the Otoh Gunga, leaving
the glow of the settlement in the distance.

INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER

OBI-WAN in the co-pilots seat, JAR JAR guides the craft.

JAR JAR : Dis is nusen.
OBI-WAN : Master, why do you keep dragging these pathetic life forms along
with us?...Here, take over.
JAR JAR : Hey, ho? Where wesa goen??
QUI-GON : You're the navigator.
JAR JAR : Yo dreamen mesa hopen...,br QUI-GON : Just relax, the Force will
guide us...
JAR JAR : Ooooh, maxibig..."da Force"...Wellen, dat smells stinkowiff.

JAR JAR veers the craft to the left and turns the lights on. The coral
vistas are grand, fantastic, and wonderous.

OBI-WAN : Why were you banished, Jar Jar?
JAR JAR : Tis a long tale, buta small part wawdabe
mesa...ooooh...aaaa.....clumsy.
OBI-WAN : They banished you because you're clumsy?

As the little sub glides into the planet core, a large dark shape begins to
follow.

JAR JAR : Mesa cause-ed mabee one or duey lettal bitty axadentes...yud-say
boom da gasser, un crash Der Bosses heyblibber...den banished.

Suddenly there is a loud CRASH, and the little craft lurches to one side.
QUI-GON looks around and sees a huge, lumimnous OPEE SEA KILLER has hooked
them with its long gooey tongue.

QUI-GON : Full speed ahead.

Instead of full ahead, JAR JAR jams the controls into reverse. The sub
flies into the mouth of the creature.

JAR JAR : Oooops.
OBI-WAN : Give me the controls.

OBI-WAN takes over the controls and the OPEE SEA KILLER instantly releases
the sub from its mouth.

JAR JAR : Wesa free!

As the sub zooms away they see a larger set of jaws, munching on the
hapless KILLER. The jaws belong to the incredible SANDO AQUA MONSTER. The
lights on the tiny sub begin to flicker as they cruise deeper into the
gloom.

QUI-GON : There's always a bigger fish.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

NUTE and RUNE stand before a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS.

NUTE : The invasion is on schedule, My Lord.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Good. I have the Senate bogged down in procedures. By the
time this incident comes up for a vote, they will have no choice but to
accept your control of the system.
NUTE : The Queen has great faith the Senate will side with her.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Queen Amidala is yound and naive. You will find controlling
her will not be difficult. You have done well, Viceroy.
NUTE : Thank you, My Lord.

DARTH SIDIOUS fades away.

RUNE : You didn't tell him about the missing Jedi?
NUTE : No need to report that to him, until we have something to report.

INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER

Sparks are flying, and water is leaking into the cabin. The sound of the
power drive drops.

OBI-WAN : .....we're losing power.

OBI-WAN is working with the sparking wires. JAR JAR panics.

QUI-GON : Stay calm. We're not in trouble yet.
JAR JAR : What yet? Monstairs out dare! Leak'n in here, all'n sink'n, and
nooooo power! You nutsen! WHEN YOUSA TINK WESA IN TROUBLE?!!!?
OBI-WAN : Power's back.

The lights flicker on, revealing an ugly COLO CLAW FISH right in front of
them.

JAR JAR : Monstairs back!

The large COLO CLAW FISH is surprised and rears back. The sub turns around
and speeds away.

JAR JAR : (cont'd) Wesa in trouble now??
QUI-GON : Relax.

QUI-GON puts his hand on JAR JAR's shoulder. JAR JAR relaxes into a coma.

OBI-WAN : You overdid it.

The COLO CLAW FISH leaps after the fleeing sub as it shoots out of the
tunnel and into the waiting jaws of the SANDO AQUA MONSTER.

OBI-WAN (cont'd) This is not good!

JAR JAR regains consciousness.
JAR JAR : Wesa dead yet?? Oie Boie!

JAR JAR's eyes bulge, and he faints again. The sub narrowly avoids the
deadly teeth of the AQUA MONSTER. The COLO CLAW FISH chasing them isn't so
lucky. It is munched in half by the larger predator. The little sub slips
away.

QUI-GON : Head for that outcropping.

EXT. THEED - MAIN ROAD INTO THEED - DAY (FX)

The long columns of the DROID ARMY move down the main road leading to
Theed, the Naboo capital.

EXT. THEED PLAZA - DAY (FX)

As the QUEEN watches helplessly from a window in the palace, a transport
carrying NUTE and RUNE lands in Theed Plaza. They exit the transport.

NUTE : Ah, victory!

INT. NABOO LAKE - UNDERWATER - SUB (FX)

The little sub continue to propel itself toward the surface, which is
brightly lit.

JAR JAR : Wesa dude it!

EXT. THEED - ESTUARY - DAY

Paradise. Billowing clouds frame a romantic body of water. There is a LOUD
RUSH OF BUBBLES, and a small sub bobs to the surface.
The current in the estuary begins to pull the sub backward into a fast
moving river. OBI-WAN switches off the two remaining bubble canopies.
QUI-GON stands up to look around. JAR JAR lets out a sigh of relief.

JAR JAR : Wesa safe now.
QUI-GON : Get this thing started.
JAR JAR : Dissen berry good. Hey?
OBI-WAN : What is it?

JAR JAR looks back to where they're drifting. He sees they are headed for a
huge waterfall.

JAR JAR : What!!?? Oie boie!

OBI-WAN tries to start the engine. The long props behind the sub slowly
begin to rotate. OBI-WAN struggles until finally, a few feet short of the
waterfall, the sub starts and is able to generate enough power to stop
drifting backward in the powerful current. The sub slowly moves forward. In
the background, QUI-GON takes a cable out of his belt. The engine coughs
and dies. They start drifting backward again. JAR JAR panics.

JAR JAR : (cont'd) Iyiiyi, wesa die'n here, hey!

QUI-GON shoots the thin cable, and it wraps itself around a railing on the
shore. The sub pulls the cable taut, and the little craft hangs
precariously over the edge of the waterfall.

QUI-GON : Come on...

OBI-WAN climbs out of the sub and pulls himself along the cable. QUI-GON
starts in after him.

QUI-GON : (cont'd) Come on, Jar Jar.
JAR JAR : No! Too scary!
OBI-WAN : Get up here!
JAR JAR : No a mighty no!

JAR JAR looks back and sees he is hanging over the waterfall.

JAR JAR : (cont'd) Oie boie...mesa comen. Mesa comen!

JAR JAR starts to climb out of the sub. OBI-WAN is on shore and helps to
pull QUI-GON out of the water.

OBI-WAN : That was close.
BATTLE DROID 3B3 : (O.S) Drop your weapons!

The TWO JEDI turn around to see a BATTLE DROID standing in front of them.
JAR JAR climbs up on shore between the JEDI.

BATTLE DROID 3B3 : I said drop your weapons

QUI-GON ignites his laser sword, and in a brief flash, the DROID is cut
down by the JEDI. A stray laser bolt hits the cable and the sub breaks
lose, crashing down the waterfall.
The JEDI move on. JAR JAR reluctantly follows and looks back at the mess.

JAR JAR : Whoa!!!

EXT. THEED - PALACE - DAY

The waterfalls of Theed sparkle in the noonday sun.

INT. THEED - PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY

QUEEN AMIDALA, SIO BIBBLE, and FIVE OF HER HANDMAIDENS (EIRTAE, YANE,
PADME, RABE, SACHE) are surrounded by TWENTY DROIDS. CAPTAIN PANAKA and
FOUR NABOO GUARDS are also held at gunpoint. NUTE and RUNE stand in the
middle of the room.

BIBBLE : ...how will you explain this invasion to the Senate?
NUTE : The Naboo and the Federation will forge a treaty that will
legitimize our occupation here. I've been assured it will be ratified by
the Senate.
AMIDALA : I will not co-operate.
NUTE : Now, now, your Highness. You are not going to like what we have in
store for your people. In time, their suffering will persuade you to see
our point of view. Commander. (OOM-9 steps forward) Process them.
OOM-9 : Yes, sir! (turns to his sergeant) Take them to Camp Four.

The SERGEANT marches the GROUP out of the throne room.

EXT. PALACE - PLAZA - DAY

QUEEN AMIDALA, PADME, EIRTA, YANE, RABE, SACHE, CAPTAIN PANAKA, SIO
BIBBLE,
and FOUR GUARDS are led out of the palace by ten BATTLE DROIDS. The plaza
is filled with tanks and BATTLE DROIDS, which they pass on their way to the
detention camp. Unbeknownst to them, QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, and JAR JAR sneak
across on a walkway above the plaza and jump from a balcony to begin an
attack to rescue the QUEEN.

FOUR BATTLE DROIDS are instantly cut down. MORE DROIDS move forward and are
also cut down by the JEDIS' flashing lightsabres until there is only the
DROID SERGEANT left. The SERGEANT starts to run but is pulled back to
QUI-GON by the Force, until finally he is dispatched by the JEDI.

JAR JAR : Yousa guys bombad!

QUEEN AMIDALA and the OTHERS are amazed. JAR JAR is getting used to this.
They move between two buildings.

QUI-GON : Your Highness, we are the Ambassadors, for the Supreme
Chancellor.
BIBBLE : Your negotiations seem to have failed, Ambassador.
QUI-GON : The negotiations never took place. Your Highness, we must make
contact with the republic.

CAPTAIN PANAKA steps forward.

CAPT. PANAKA : They've knocked out all our communications.
QUI-GON : Do you have transports?
CAPT. PANAKA : In the main hanger. This way.

THEY disappear down an alleyway as the ALARMS are sounded

INT. CENTRAL HANGER - HALLWAY - DAY

CAPTAIN PANAKA cracks open a side door to the central hanger. QUI-GON looks
in over his shoulder. OBI-WAN, JAR JAR, and the rest of the group are
behind him. They see several Naboo spacecraft guarded by about FIFTY BATTLE
DROIDS. ALARMS can be heard in the distance.

CAPT. PANAKA : There are too many of them.
QUI-GON : That won't be a problem. (to Amidala) Your Highness, under the
circumstances, Isuggest you come to Coruscant with us.
AMIDALA : Thank you, Ambassador, but my place is here with my people.
QUI-GON : They will kill you if you stay.
BIBBLE : They wouldn't dare.
CAPT. PANAKA : They need her to sign a treaty to make this invasion of
theirs legal. They can't afford to kill her.
QUI-GON : The situation here is not what it seems. There is something else
behind all this, Your Highness. There is no logic in the Federation's move
here. My feelings tell me they will destroy you.
BIBBLE : Please, Your Highness, reconsider. Our only hope is for the Senate
to side with us... Senator Palpatine will need your help.
CAPT. PANAKA : Getting past their blockade is impossible, Your Highness.
Any attempt to escape will be dangerous.
BIBBLE : Your Highness, I will stay here and do what I can...They will have
to retain the Council of Governors in order to maintain control. But you
must leave...

The QUEEN turns to PADME and EIRTAE.

AMIDALA : Either choice presents a great risk...to all of us...
PADME : We are brave, Your Highness.
QUI-GON : If you are to leave, Your Highness, it must be now.
AMIDALA : Then, I will plead our case before the Senate. (to Bibble) Be
careful, Governor.

INT. CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

The door opens to the main hanger. QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, JAR JAR, CAPTAIN
PANAKA, TWO GUARDS, and THREE HANDMAIDENS (PADME, EIRTAE, RABE),
followed
by QUEEN AMIDALA, head for a sleek chrome spacecraft. SIO BIBBLE, YANE and
SACHE stay behind. The HANDMAIDENS begin to cry.

CAPT. PANAKA : We need to free those pilots.

CAPTAIN PANAKA points to TWENTY GUARDS, GROUND CREW, and PILOTS held in a
corner by SIX BATTLE DROIDS.

OBI-WAN : I'll take care of that. OBI-WAN heads toward the group of
captured pilots.

QUI-GON and the QUEEN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, JAR JAR, and the rest Of the GROUP
approach the GUARDS at the ramp of the Naboo craft.

GUARD DROID : Where are you going?
QUI-GON : I'm Ambassador for the Supreme Chancellor, and I'm taking those
people to Coruscant.
DROID GUARD : You're under arrest!

The DROID GUARD draws his weapon, but before any of the DROIDS can fire,
they are cut down. OTHER GUARDS run to their aid. OBI-WAN attacks the
GUARDS around the PILOTS. QUI-GON stands, fighting off DROIDS as the OTHERS
rush on board the spacecraft. OBI-WAN, the FREED PILOTS (including RIC
OLIE), GUARDS and GROUND CREW MEMBERS rush on board the ship. The OTHER
PILOTS and GUARDS race to SIO BIBBLR. After everyone has made it onto the
ship, QUI-GONjumps on board. ALARMS sound. MORE DROIDS rush into the hanger
and fire as the ship takes off.

EXT. THEED - HANGER ENTRY - DAY (FX)

The ship exits the hanger. BATTLE DROIDS standing in the hanger shoot at
them.

EXT. SPACE (FX)

The sleek spacecraft speeds away from the planet of Naboo and heads for the
deadly Federation blockade.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - COCKPIT

The PILOT, RIC OLIE, navigates toward the massive battleship, QUI-GON and
CAPTAIN PANAKA watch.

RIC OLIE : ....our communications are still jammed.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - DROID HOLD

JAR JAR is led into a low, cramped doorway by OBI-WAN.

OBI-WAN : Now stay here, and keep out of trouble.

OBI-WAN closes the door. JAR JAR looks around and sees a long row of five
short, dome-topped ASTRO DROIDS (R-2 units). The all look alike, except for
thier paint color, and they all seem to be shut down.

JAR JAR : Ello, boyos. (no response) Disa wanna longo trip...hey?

JAR JAR taps a bright red R-2 UNIT on the head, and its head pops up a bit.
He lets out a gasp as he lifts the head.

JAR JAR : (Cont'd) Tis opens?...Oooops! Many springs and things come flying
out.

JAR JAR quickly closes it again, very embarrassed.

JAR JAR : (Cont'd) Yoi! Just yoken!
RIC OLIE : Powers back! That little droid did it. He bypassed the main
power drive. Deflector shield up, at maximum.

The lone BLUE DROID finishes his repairs and goes back into the ship. The
Naboo spacecraft races away from the Federation battleship.

RIC OLIE : There's not enough power to get us to Coruscant...the hyperdrive
is leaking.
QUI-GON : We'll have to land somewhere to refuel and repair the ship.

QUI-GON studies a star chart on a monitor.

OBI-WAN : Here, Master. Tatooine... It's small, out of the way, poor... The
Trade Federation has no presence there.
CAPT. PANAKA : How can you be sure?
QUI-GON : It's controlled by the Hutts...
CAPT. PANAKA : The Hutts??
OBI-WAN : It's risky...but there's no alternative.
CAPT. PANAKA : You can't take Her Royal Highness there! The Hutts are
gangsters... If they discovered her...
QUI-GON : ...It would be no different than if we landed on a system
controlled by the Federation...except the Hutts aren't looking for her,
which gives us an advantage.

CPATAIN PANAKA takes a deep breath in frustration.

EXT. SPACE - NABOO SPACECRAFT (FX)

The Naboo spacecraft races away.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM

NUTE and RUNE sit around a conference table with a hologram of DARTH
SIDIOUS.

NUTE : We control all the cities in the North and are searching for any
other settlements...
DARTH SIDIOUS : Destroy all high-ranking officials,
Viceroy...slowly...quietly. And Queen Amidala, has she signed the treaty?
NUTE : She has disappeared, My Lord. One Naboo cruiser got pat the
blockade.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Viceroy, find her! I want that treaty signed.
NUTE : My Lord, it's impossible to locate the ship. It's out of our range.
DARTH SIDIOUS : ...not for a Sith...

A second SITH LORD appears behind DARTH SIDIOUS.

DARTH SIDIOUS : (Cont'd) ...Viceroy, this is my apprentice. Lord Maul. He
will find your lost ship.
NUTE : Yes, My Lord. The hologram fades off.
NUTE : (Cont'd) This is getting out of hand...now there are two of them.
RUNE : We should not have made this bargain. What will happen when the Jedi
become aware of these Sith Lords?

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - QUEENS CHAMBERS

QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and the LITTLE BLUE DROID stand before
QUEEN AMIDALA and her THREE HANDMAIDENS, PADME, EIRTAE and RABE.

CAPT. PANAKA : ...An extremely well put together little droid. Without a
doubt, it saved the ship, as well as our lives.
AMIDALA : It is to be commended...what is its number?

The LITTLE BLUE DROID lets out a series of bleeps.CAPTAIN PANAKA leans over
and scrapes some dirt off of the side of the DROID and read the number:

CAPT. PANAKA : R2-D2, Your Highness.
AMIDALA : Thank you, Artoo Detoo. You have proven to be very loyal...Padme!

PADME bows before the QUEEN.

AMIDALA : (Cont'd) Clean this droid up the best you can. It deserves our
gratitude...(to Panaka) Continue, Captain.

CAPTAIN PANAKA looks nervously to OBI-WAN and QUI-GON.

QUI-GON : Yor Highness, we are heading for a remote planet called Tatooine.
It is a system far beyond the reach of the Trade Federation. There we will
be able to make needed repairs, then travel on to Coruscant.
CAPTAIN PANAKA : Your Highness, Tatooine is very dangerous. It's controlled
by an alliance of gangs called the Hutts. I do not agree with the Jedi on
this.
QUI-GON : You must trust my judgement, Your Highness.

AMIDALA and PADME exchange looks. PADME moves next to the DROID.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - MAIN AREA

PADME sits in the Main Area, cleaning R2-D2, the brave little Astra Droid.
JAR JAR pops out of an open door.

JAR JAR : Hidoe!

Both PADME and ARTOO jump and let out a little SCREAM. The Gungan is
embarrassed that he frightened them.

JAR JAR : (Cont'd) Sorry, nomeanen to scare yousa.
PADME : That's all right.
JAR JAR : I scovered oily back dare. Needen it?
PADME : Thank you. This little guy is quite a mess.

JAR JAR hands PADME the oil can.

JAR JAR : Mesa Ja Ja Binksss... PADME : I'm Padme, I attend Her Highness,
You're a Gungan, aren't you? (Jar Jar nods) How did you end up here with
us?
JAR JAR : Me no know...mesa day starten pitty okeyday witda brisky morning

ARTOO BEEPS a sympathetic beep.

INT. ANBOO SPACECRAFT - COCKPIT

OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, and CAPTAIN PANAKA watch over RIC OLIE'S shoulder. A
large yellow planet appears directly ahead. RIC OLIE searches his scopes.

OBI-WAN : Tahyt's it. Tatooine.
RIC OLIE : There's a settlement...a spaceport, looks like.
QUI-GON : Land near the outskirts. We don't want to attract any attention.

EXT. TATOOINE - SPACE (FX)

The ship heads toward the planet of Tatooine.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY (FX)

The Naboo spacecraft lands in the desert in a swirl of dust. The spaceport
of Mos Espa is seen in the distance.

EXT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - MAIN AREA

OBI-WAN is hoisting the hyperdrive out of a floor panel. JAR JAR rushes up
to him and falls to his knees.

JAR JAR : Obi-Wan, sire, pleeese, no mesa go!
OBI-WAN : Sorry, Qui-Gon's right. You'll make things less obvious.

JAR JAR walks back to ARTOO in the hallway as QUI-GON (dressed as a farmer)
enters the main area.

OBI-WAN : (Cant'd) The Hyperdrive generator is gone. We will need a new
one.

QUI-GON moves closer to OBI-WAN and speaks quietly to him.

QUI-GON : Don't let them send ant transmissions. Be wary...I sense a
disturbance in the Force.
OBI-WAN : I fell it also, Master.

QUI-GON goes into the hallway to meet up with ARTOO and JAR JAR. They head
to the exit ramp.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - SPACESHIP - DAY

They start their trek across the desert toward the city of Mos Espa. In the
distance, a strange looking caravan makes its way toward the spaceport.

JAR JAR : Dis sun doen murder tada skin.

From the spaceship, CAPTAIN PANAKA and PADME run toward them.

CAPT. PANAKA : Wait!

QUI-GON stops as they catch up. PADME is dresses in rough peasant's garb.

CAPT. PANAKA : (Cont'd) Her Highness commands you to take her handmaiden
with you. She wishes for her to observe the local...
QUI-GON : No more commands from Her Highness today, Captain. This spaceport
is not going to be pleasant...
CAPT. PANAKA : The Queen wishes it. She is curious about this planet.
PADME : I've been trained in defense... I can take care of myself.
CAPT. PANAKA : Don't make me go back and tell her you refuse.
QUI-GON : I don't have time to argue. But this is not a good idea. Stay
close to me.

He gives PADME a stern look.

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - DAY

The little GROUP walks down the main street of Mos Espa. They pass
dangerous looking citizens of all types. PADME looks around in awe at this
exotic enviroment.

QUI-GON : ...moisture farms for the most part, but also a few indigenous
tribes and scavengers. The few spaceports like this one are havens for
those who do not wish to be found...
PADME : ....like us. JAR JAR is in a constant state of panic.

ARTOO whistles along, with perfect confidence.

JAR JAR : Dissen berry berry bad. (steps in ooze)
Ooooh...icky...icky...goo.

EXT. MOS ESPA - JUNK DEALER PLAZA - DAY

The GROUP comes to a little plaza surrounded by several junk spaceship
dealers.

QUI-GON : We'll try one of the smaller dealers.

They head for a little junk shop that has a huge pile of broken spaceships
stacked up behind it.

INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY

QUI-GON, JAR JAR, PADME, and ARTOO enter the dingy junk shop and are
greeted by WATTO, a pudgy blue alien who flies on short little wings like a
hummingbird.

WATTO : (subtitled) Hi chuba da naga? (What do you want?)
QUI-GON : I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.
WATTO : Ah yes, ah yes. Nubian. We have lots of that. What kinda junk?
(subtitled) Peedenkel! Naba dee unko (Boy, get in here! Now!)
QUI-GON : My droid here has a readout of what I need.

A disheveled boy, ANAKIN SKYWALKER, runs in from the junk yard. He is about
nine years old, very dirty, and dressed in rags. WATTO raises a hand, and
ANAKIN flinches.

WATTO : (subtitled) Coona tee-tocky malia? (What took you so long?)
ANAKIN : (subtitled) Mel tassa cho-passa... (I was cleaning the bin like
you...)
WATTO : (subtitled) Chut-Chut! Ganda doe wallya. (Never mind! Watch the
store) Me dwana no bata. (I've got some selling to do here.) (to Gui-Gon)
Soooo, let me take- a thee out back. Ni you'll find what you need.

ARTOO and QUI-GON follow WATTO toward the junk yard, leaving JAR JAR with
PADME and the young boy ANAKIN. JAR JAR picks up a gizmo, trying to figure
out its purpose. QUI-GON takes the part out of his hand and puts it back.

QUI-GON : Don't touch anything.

JAR JAR makes a rude face to QUI-GON's back and sticks out his long tongue.
ANAKIN sits on the counter, pretending to clean a part, staring at PADME.
She is the most beautiful creaure he has ever seen in his life. PADME is a
little embarrassed by his stare, but she musters up an amused smile.
Finally, he gets the courage to speak.

ANAKIN : Are you an angel?
PADME : What?
ANAKIN : An angel. I've heard the deep space pilots talk about them. They
live on the Moons of Iego I thimk. They are the most beautiful creatures in
the universe. They are good and kind, and so pretty they make even the most
hardened spice pirate cry.

PADME looks at him, not knowing what to say. PADME : I've never heard of
angels.

ANAKIN : You must be one...maybe you just don't know it.
PADME : You're a funny little boy. How do you know so much?
ANAKIN : Since I was very little, three, I think. My Mom and I were sold to
Gardulla the Hutt, but she lost us, betting on the Podraces, to Watto,
who's a lot better master than Gardulla, I think.
PADME : You're...a slave?

ANAKIN looks at PADME defiantly.

ANAKIN : I am a person! My name is Anakin.
PADME : I'm sorry. I don't fully understand. (looking around)This is a
strange world to me.

ANAKIN studies her intently.

ANAKIN : You are a strange girl to me.

JAR JAR pushes the nose on what appears to be a LITTLE DROID, and it
instantly comes to life, grows legs and arms, and starts marching around,
knocking over everything. JAR JAR hold on but can't stop it.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Hit the nose!

JAR JAR hits the nose, and the DROID collapses back into its original
state. ANAKIN and PADME laugh. ANAKIN watches PADME straighten her hair.

EXT. WATTO'S JUNK YARD - BEHIND SHOP - DAY

WATTO reads a small portable monitor he is holding. He stands before a
hyperdrive.

WATTO : ...Here it is...a T-14 hyperdrive generator!! Thee in luck, I'm the
only one hereabouts who has one...but thee might as well buy a new ship. It
would be cheaper, I think...Sying of which, how's thee going to pay for all
this?
QUI-GON : I have 20,000 Republic dataries.
WATTO : Republic credits?!? Republic credits are no good out here. I need
something more real...
QUI-GON : I don't have anything else. (raising his hand) But credits will
do fine.
WATTO : No they won'ta. QUI-GON, using his mind power, waves his hand
again.
QUI-GON : Credits will do fine.
WATTO : No, they won'ta. What you think you're some kinda Jedi, waving your
hand around like that? I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks don'ta work on me-only
money. No money, no parts! No deal! And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive,
I promise you that.

INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY

JAR JAR pulls a part out of a stack of parts to inspect it, and they all
come tumblimg down. He struggles to catch them, only to knock more down.
ANAKIN and PADME are oblivious.

ANAKIN : ...wouldn't have lasted long if I weren't so good at fixing
things. I'm making my own droid...

QUI-GON hurries into the shop, followed by ARTOO. QUI-GON : We're leaving.
JAR JAR follows QUI-GON. PADME gives ANAKIN a loving look.

PADME : I'm glad I met you,....ah...
ANAKIN : ...Anakin.
PADME : Anakin.
ANAKIN : Anakin Skywalker.
PADME : Padme Naberrie.

PADME turns, and ANAKIN looks sad as he watches her leave.

ANAKIN : I'm glad I met you too.

WATTO enters the junk yard, shaking his head.

WATTO : (subtitled) Ootmians! Tinka me chasa hopoe ma booty na nolia.
(Outlanders! They think because we live so far from the center, we don't
know nothing.)
ANAKIN : (subtitled) La lova num botaffa. (They seemed nice to me.) WATTO :
(subtitled) Fweepa niaga. Tolpa da bunky dunko. (Clean the racks, then you
can go home.)

ANAKIN lets out a "yipee" and runs out the back.

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - ALCOVE - DAY

QUI-GON, ARTOO, JAR JAR, and PADME have found a quiet spot between two
buildings. The busy street beyond is filled with dangerous looking
creatures. QUI-GON is talking on his com-link, while JAR JAR nervously
watches the street. OBI-WAN is in the main hold of the Naboo craft.

QUI-GON : ...Obi-Wan, you're sure there isn't anything of value left on
board?
OBI-WAN : (V.O) A few containers of supplies, the Queen's wardrobe, maybe.
Not enough for you to barter with. Not in the ammounts you're talking
about.
QUI-GON : All right. Another solution will present itself. I'll check back.

QUI-GON puts his comlink away and starts out into the main street. JAR JAR
grabs his arm.

JAR JAR : Noah gain...da beings hereabouts cawazy. Wesa be robbed un
crunched.
QUI-GON : Not likely. We have nothing of value, that's our problem.

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - MARKET - DAY

QUI-GON, PADME, JAR JAR, and ARTOO move out into the street. JAR JAR is
walking behind the others. They walk by an outdoor cafe filled with a rough
gang of aliens, one of which is especially ugly, SEBULBA, a spider-like
creature. JAR JAR stops for a moment in front of a stall selling dead frogs
hanging on a wire. He looks around to see if anyone is looknig, then sticks
out his tongue, and gets hold of one, pulling it into his mouth.
Unfortunately, the frog is tied tightly to the wire. The vendor suddenly
appears.

VENDOR : Hey, that will be seven truguts!!

JAR JAR opens his mouth in surprise, and the frog snaps away, ricochets
around the market, and lands in Sebulba's soup, splashing him. As JAR JAR
moves away from the VENDOR, SEBULBA jumps up on the table and grabs the
hapless Gungan.

SEBULBA : (subtitled) Chuba!! (You!!) JAR JAR : Who, mesa?? SEBULBA :
(subtitled) Ni chuba na?? (Is this yours??)

SEBULBA holds the frog up to the Gungan threateningly. SEVERAL OTHER
CREATURES start to gather. SEBULBA shoves JAR JAR to the ground. The Gungan
desperately tries to scramble to safety.

JAR JAR : (to himself) Why mesa always da one??
ANAKIN : (V.O) Because you're afraid.

JAR JAR turns to see ANAKNI pushing his way next to him. The boy stands up
to SEBULBA in a very self-assured way.

ANAKIN : (subtitled) Chess ko, Sebulba...Coo wolpa tooney rana. (Careful,
Sebulba...This one's very connected.)

SEBULBA stops his assault on JAR JAR and turns to ANAKIN.

SEBULBA : (subtitled) Tooney rana nu pratta dunko, shag. (Connected?? Whada
you mean, slave?)
ANAKIN : (subtitled) Oh da Hutt...cha porko ootman geesa...me teesa rodda
co pana pee choppa chawa. (As in Hutt...big time outlander, this one... I'd
hate to see you diced before we race again.)
SEBULBA : (subtitled) Neek me chowa, wermo, mo killee ma klounkee(Next time
we race, wermo, it will be the end of you!) Una noto wo shag, me wompity du
pom pom. (If you weren't a slave, I'd squash you right now.)

SEBULBA turns away.

ANAKIN : (subtitled) Eh, chee bana do mullee ra. (Yeah, it'd be a pity if
you had to pay for me.)

QUI-GON, PADME and ARTOO arrive.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Hi! Your buddy here was about to be turned into orange
goo. He picked a fight with a Dug. An especially dangerous Dug called
Sebulba.
JAR JAR : Nosir, nosir. Mesa hate crunchen. Dat's da last ting mesa wanten.
QUI-GON : Nevertheless, the boy is right...you were heading for trouble.
Thank you, my young friend.

PADME looks at ANAKINB and smiles; he smiles back. They start walking down
the crowded street.

JAR JAR : Mesa doen nutten!
ANAKIN : Fear attracts the fearful. He was trying to overcome his fear by
squashing you...be less afraid.
PADME : And that works for you.
ANAKIN : To a point. (he smiles)

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - SPACESHIP - DAY

OBI-WAN stands in front of the Naboo spacecraft as the wind picks up and
begins to whip at his robe. CAPTAIN PANAKA exits the ship and joins him.

OBI-WAN : This storm's going to slow them down.
CAPT. PANAKA : It looks pretty bad. We'd better seal the ship.

CAPTAIN PANAKA'S comlink sounds off.

CAPT. PANAKA : (Cont'd) Yes? CAPT. PANAKA : We'll be right there.

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - FRUIT STAND - DAY

ANAKIN and the GROUP stop at a fruit stand run by a jolly, but very poor,
old lady named JIRA.

ANAKIN : How are you feeling today, Jira?
JIRA : The heat's never been kind to me, you know, Annie!
ANAKIN : Guess what? I've found that cooling unit I've been searching for.
It's pretty beat up, but I'll have it fixed up for you in no time, I
promise.
JIRA : You're a fine boy, Annie.
ANAKIN : I'll take four pallies today. (to Padme) You'll like these...

ANAKIN reaches in his pocket and comes up with three coins. He drops one.
QUI-GON picks it up, revealing for a moment, his lightsabre.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Whoops, I thought I had more...Make thgat three, I'm not
hungry.

The wind picks up. SHOP OWNERS are starting to close up their shops as JIRA
gives them their pallies.

JIRA : Gracious, my bones are aching...storm's coming on, Annie. You'd
better get home quick.
ANAKIN : (to QUI-GON) Do you have shelter?
QUI-GON : We'll hed back to our ship.
ANAKIN : Is it far?
PADME : On the outskirts.
ANAKIN : You'll never reach the outskirts in time...sandstorms are very,
very dangerous. Come with me. Hurry!

The GROUP follows ANAKIN as he rushes down the windy street.

EXT. MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - STREET - SANDSTORM - DAY

The wind is blowing hard as QUI-GON, JAR JAR, and PADME follow ANAKIN down
the street and into a slave hovel.

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY

QUI-GON, JAR JAR, ARTOO, and PADME enter a small living space.

ANAKIN : Mom! Mom! I'm home.
JAR JAR : Dissen cozy.

Anakin's mother, SHMI SKYWALKER, a warm, friendly woman of forty, enters
from her work area and is startled to see the room full of people.

SHMI : Oh, my!! Annie, what's this?
ANAKIN : These are my friends, Mom. This is Padme, and...gee, I don't know
any of your names.
QUI-GON : I'm Qui-Gon Jinn, and this is Jar Jar Binks. ARTOO lets out a
little beep.
PADME : ...and our droid, Artoo-Detoo.
ANAKIN : I'm building a droid. You wanna see?
SHMI : Anakin! Why are they here?
ANAKIN : A sandstorm, Mom. Listen.

The wind HOWLS outside.

QUI-GON : Your son was kind enough to offer us shelter.
ANAKIN : Come on! Let me show you Threepio!

ANAKIN leads PADME into the other room. ARTOO follows, beeping all the way.
QUI-GON takes five small capsules from his utility belt and hands them to
SHMI.

QUI-GON : I have enough food for a meal.
SHMI : Oh, tank you. Thank you so much. I'm sorry if I was abrupt. I'll
never get used to Anakin's surprises.
QUI-GON : He's a very special boy. SHMI looks at him as if he's discovered
a secret.
SHMI : Yes, I know.

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - BEDROOM - DAY

ANAKIN shows off his ANDROID, which is lying on his workbench. There is one
eye in the head; the body, arms, and legs have no outer coverings.

ANAKIN : Isn't he great?! He's not finished yet.
PADME : He's wonderful!
ANAKIN : You reall like him? He's a protocol droid...to help Mom. Watch!

ANAKIN pushes a switch, and the DROID sits up. Anakin rushes around, grabs
an eye and puts it in one of the sockets.

THREEPIO : How do you do, I am See-Threepio, Human Cyborg Relations. How
might I serve you?
PADME : He's perfect.
ANAKIN : When the storm is over, you can see my racer. I'm building a
Podracer!

PADME smiles at his enthusiasm. ARTOO lets out a flurry of beeps and
whistles.

THREEPIO : I beg your pardon....what do you mean I'm naked?

ARTOO BEEPS

THREEPIO : (Cont'd) My parts are showing? Oh, my goodness. How
embarrassing!

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - QUEENS CHAMBERS

AMIDALA, EIRTAE, RABE, and OBI-WAN watch a very bad transmission of a SIO
BIBBLE hologram.

BIBBLE : ...cut off all food supplies until you return...the death toll is
catastrophic...we must bow to their wishes, Your Highness...Please tell us
what to do! If you can hear us, Your Highness, you must contact me...

AMIDALA looks upset...almost nervous.

OBI-WAN : It's a trick. Send no reply... Send no transmission of any kind.

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY

QUI-GON listens to his comlink. OBI-WAN is in the cockpit.

OBI-WAN : ...the Queen is upset...but absolutly no reply was sent.
QUI-GON : It sounds like bait to establish a connection trace.
OBI-WAN : What if it is true and the people are dying?
QUI-GON : Either way, we're running out of time.

EXT. CORUSCANT - BALCONY OVERLOOKING CITY - NIGHT

DARTH SIDIOUS and DARTH MAUL look out over the vast city.

DARTH MAUL : Tatooine is sparsely populated. If the trace was correct, I
will find them quickly, Master.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Move against the Jedi first...you will then have no
difficulty taking the Queen back to Naboo, where she will sign the treaty.
DARTH MAUL : At last we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi. At last we will
have revenge.
DARTH SIDIOUS : You have been well trained, my young apprentice, they will
be no match for you. It is too late for them to stop us now. Everything is
going as planned. The Republic will soon be in my command.

The hologram of DARTH MAUL fades off as DARTH SIDIOUS looks out over the
city. EXT. MOS ESPA - SANDSTORM - DAY

The giant sandstorm engulfs the town, including the Naboo spaceship on the
outskirts of the city center, where Watto's ship is; and the slave
quarters, where drifts of sand begin building up against Anakin's house.

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY

QUI-GON, ANAKIN, SHMI, JAR JAR, and PADME are seated around a makeshift
table, having dinner as the wind howls outside.
JAR JAR slurps his soup rather loudly. Everyone looks at him. He turns a
little brighter red.

SHMI : All slaves have transmitters placed inside their bodies somewhere.
ANAKIN : I've been working on a scanner to try and locate them, but no
luck.
SHMI : Any attempt to escape...
ANAKIN : ...and they blow you up...poof!

PADME and JAR JAR are horrified.

JAR JAR : How wude.
PADME : I can't believe there is still slavery in the galaxy. The
Republic's anti-slavery laws...
SHMI : The Republic doesn't exist out here...we must survive on our own.

An awkward silence. ANAKIN attempts to end the embarrassment.

ANAKIN : Have you ever seen a Podrace?

PADME shakes her head no. She notices the concern of SHMI. JAR JAR snatches
some food from a bowl at the other end of the table with his tongue.
QUI-GON gives him a dirty look.

QUI-GON : They have Podracing on Malastare. Very fast, very dangerous.
ANAKIN : I'm the only human who can do it.

SHMI looks askance at her son.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Mom, what? I'm not bragging. It's true. Watto says he's
never heard of a human doing it.
QUI-GON : You must have Jedi reflexes if you race Pods.

ANAKIN smiles. JAR JAR attempts to snare another bit of food from the bowl
with his tongue, but QUI-GON, in a flash, grabs it between his thumb and
forefinger. JAR JAR is startled.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) Don't do that again.

JAR JAR tries to acknowledge with some silly mumbling. QUI-GON lets go of
the tongue, and it snaps back into JAR JAR's mouth.

ANAKIN : I...I was wondering...something...
QUI-GON : What?
ANAKIN : Well, ahhh...you're a Jedi Knight, aren't you?
QUI-GON : What makes you think that?
ANAKIN : I saw your laser sword. Only Jedi carry that kind of weapon.

QUI-GON leans back and slowly smiles.

QUI-GON : Perhaps I killed a Jedi and stole it from him.
ANAKIN : I don't think so... No one can kill a Jedi Knight.
QUI-GON : I wish that were so...
ANAKIN. I had a dream I was a Jedi. I came back here and freed all the
slaves...have you come to free us?
QUI-GON : No, I'm afraid not...
ANAKIN : I think you have...why else would you be here?

QUI-GON thinks for a moment.

QUI-GON : I can see there's no fooling you...(leans forward) You mustn't
let anyone know about us...we're on our way to Coruscant, the central
system in the Republic, on a very important mission, and it must be kept
secret.
ANAKIN : Coruscant...wow...how did you end up here in the outer rim?
PADME : Our ship was damaged, and we're stranded here until we can repair
it.
ANAKIN : I can help! I can fix anything!
QUI-GON : I believe you can, but our first job is to aquire the parts we
need...
JAR JAR : Wit no-nutten mula to trade.
PADME : These junk dealers must have a weakness of some kind.
SHMI : Gambling. Everything here revolves around betting on those awful
races.
QUI-GON : Podracing... Greed can be a powerful ally.. if it's used
properly.
ANAKIN : I've built a racer! It's the fastest ever...There's a big race
tomorrow, on Boonta Eve. You could enter my pod. It's all but finished...
SHMI : Anakin, settle down. Watto won't let you...
ANAKIN : Watto doesn't know I've built it. (to Qui-Gon) You could make him
think it's your's, and you could get him to let me pilot it for you.

QUI-GON looks to SHMI. She is upset.

SHMI : I don't want you to race, Annie...It's awful. I die every time Watto
makes you do it.

ANAKIN : But Mom, I love it...and they need help...they're in trouble. The
prize money would more than pay for the parts they need. JAR JAR : Wesa ina
pitty bad goo.
GUI-GON : Your mother's right. Is there anyone friendly to the Republic who
might be able to help us?

SHMI shakes her head no.

ANAKIN : We have to help them, Mom...you said that the biggest problem in
the universe is no one helps each other...
SHMI : Anakin, don't...

JAR JAR belches. There is silence for a moment as they eat.

PADME : I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want to put your son in danger. We will
find another way...
SHMI : No, Annie's right, there is no other way... I may not like it, but
he can help you...he was meant to help you.
ANAKIN : Is that a yes? That is a yes!

The storm continues to rage outside the slave hovel.

EXT. MOS ESPA - JUNK DEALER PLAZA - DAY

The storm has passed. VENDORS and STREET PEOPLE clean up the mess and
rebuild their food stalls. JAR JAR sits on a box in front of Watto's parts
shop, watching all the activity with growing nervousness. ARTOO is standing
next to him. PADME stops QUI-GON as he is about to enter the shop.

PADME : Are you sure about this? Trusting our fate to a boy we hardly know.
The Queen will not approve.
QUI-GON : The Queen does not need to know.
PADME : Well, I don't approve.

QUI-GON turns and starts into the shop.

INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY

WATTO and ANAKIN are in the middle of an animated discussion in Huttese.

WATTO : Patta go bolla!
ANKAIN : No batta!
WATTO : Pedunky. Maa kee cheelya.
ANAKIN : Bayno, Bayno!

QUI-GON walks in, and WATTO and ANAKIN join him.

WATTO : The boy tells me you wanta sponser hi insa race. You can't afford
parts. How can you do this? Not on Republic credits, I think. (he laughs)
QUI-GON : My ship will be the entry fee.

QUI-GON pulls a small object that looks like a watch out of his pocket, and
a hologram of the Naboo spacecraft appears about a foot long in front of
WATTO. He studies it.

WATTO : Not bad...not bad...a Nubian.
QUI-GON : It's in good order, except for the parts we need.
WATTO : ...but what would the boy ride? He smashed up my Pod in the last
race. It will take some time to fix it.

ANAKIN is embarrassed and steps forward.

ANAKIN : Ahhhh....it wasn't my fault really...Sebulba flashed me with his
vent ports. I actually saved the Pod...mostly.
WATTO : (laughing) That you did. The boy is good, no doubts there.
QUI-GON : I have...acquired a Pod in a game of chance. "The fastest ever
built."
WATTO : I hope you didn't kill anyone I know for it. (laughs) So, you
supply the Pod and the entry fee; I supply the boy. We split the winnings
fifty-fifty, I think.
QUI-GON : Fifty-fifty!?! If it's going to be fifty-fifty, I suggest you
front the cash for the entry. If we win, you keep all the winnings, minus
the cost of the parts I need...If we lose, you keep my ship.

WATTO thinks about this. ANAKIN tries not to be nervous.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) Either way, you win.
WATTO : (subtitled) Deal! Yo bana pee ho-tah, meedee ya. (Your friend is a
follish one, methinks.)

EXT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - TATOOINE DESERT - DAY

OBI-WAN stands outside the Naboo spacecraft, speaking into his comlink.
QUI-GON is on the back porch of the hovel.

OBI-WAN : What if this plan fails, Master? We could be stuck here for a
long time.
QUI-GON : (V.O) A ship without a power supply will not get us anywhere, and
there is something about this boy...

EXT MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - PORCH - DAY

QUI-GON puts the comlink away as SHMI comes onto the porch

PADME, ANAKIN, JAR JAR, and ARTOO work on the engines of the Podracer in
the courtyard below.

QUI-GON : You should be proud of your son. He gives without any thought of
reward.
SHMI : He knows nothing of greed. He has...
QUI-GON : He has special powers.
SHMI : Yes...
QUI-GON : He can see things before they happen. That's why he appears to
have such quick reflexes. It is a Jedi trait.
SHMI : He deserves better than a slave's life.
QUI-GON : The Force is unusally strong with him, that much is clear. Who
was his father?
SHMI : There was no father, that I know of...I carried him, I gave him
birth...I can't explain what happened. Can you help him?
QUI-GON : I'm afraid not. Had he been born in the Republic, we would have
identified him early, and he would have become Jedi, no doubt...he has the
way. But it's too late for him now, he's too old.

EXT. MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - BACK YARD - DAY

KITSTER (a young boy about Anakin's age), SEEK (a boy of ten), AMEE (a girl
of six), and WALD (a Greedo Type, six years old) join ANAKIN, JAR JAR,
ARTOO, and PADME securing some wiring.

ANAKIN : Padme and Jar Jar, this is my friend Kitster, and seek, Amee, and
Wald.

All whistle, hoot, and speak a greeting.

KITSTER : Wow, a real Astro Droid...how'd you get so lucky?
ANAKIN : This isn't the half of it. I'm entered in the Boonta Race
tomorrow!
KITSTER : What? With this??
WALD : (subtitled) Annie, Jesko na joka. 9You are such a joke, Annie.)
AMEE : You've been working on that thing for years. It's never going to
run.
SEEK : Come on, let's go play ball. Keep it up, Annie, and you're gonna be
bug squash.

SEEK, WALD, and AMEE take off, laughing. JAR JAR is fiddling with one of
the energy binder plates.

ANAKIN : Hey! Jar Jar! Stay away from those energy binders...
JAR JAR : Who, mesa?
ANAKIN : If your hand gets caught in that beam, it will go numb for hours.

JAR JAR peeks at the energy plate; it makes a little electronic pop, zaps
him in the mouth and jumps back. JAR JAR tries to say something, but his
mouth is numb and his words are garbled.

JAR JAR : Ouch-dats muy bigo Oucho. (Gibberish)
KITSTER : But you don't even know if this thing will run.
ANAKIN : It will.

QUI-GON approaches the GROUP and gives ANAKIN a small battery. JAR JAR gets
his hand caught in the afterburner and tries to tell Anakin, but can't get
words out that make sense.

QUI-GON : I think it's time we found out. Use this power charge. ANAKIN :
Yes, sir!!

ANAKIN jumps into the little capsule behind the two giant engines. He puts
the power pack back into the dashboard. EVERYONE backs away, except for JAR
JAR who calls for help. Finally PADME frees him and the engines ignite with
a ROAR. EVERYONE cheers.

EXT. MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - PORCH - DAY

SHMI, watching from the porch, smiles sadly.

EXT. SLAVE QUARTERS - BALCONY - NIGHT

ANAKIN sits on the balcony rail of his hovel as QUI-GON tends to a cut. The
BOY leans back to look at the vast blanket of stars in the sky.

QUI-GON : Sit still, Annie. Let me clean this cut.
ANAKIN : There are so many! Do they all have a system of planets?
QUI-GON : Most of them.
ANAKIN : Has anyone been to them all?
QU-IG0N : (laughs) Not likely.
ANAKIN : I want to be the first one to see them all... Ouch!

QUI-GON wipes a patch of blood off ANAKIN'S arm.

QUI-GON : There, good as new...

SHMI yells from inside the hovel.

SHMI : (O.S.) Annie, bedtime!

QUI-GON scrapes ANAKIN's blood onto a comlink chip.

ANAKIN : What are you doing?
QUI-GON : Checking your blood for infections.
ANAKIN : I've never seen...
SHMI : (O.S.) Annie! I'm not goiung to tell you again!
QUI-GON : Go on, you have a big day tomorrow. (beat) Goodnight.

ANAKIN rolls his eyes and runs into the hovel. QUI-GON takes the blood
stained chip and inserts it into the comlink, then calls OBI-WAN.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) Obi-Wan...
OBI-WAN : Yes, Master.
QUI-GON : Make an analysis of this blood sample I'm sending you.
OBI-WAN : Wait a minute...
QUI-GON : I need a midi-chlorian count.
OBI-WAN : All right. I've got it.
QUI-GON : What are your readings?
OBI-WAN : Something must be wrong with the transmission.
QUI-GON : Here's a signal check.
OBI-WAN : Strange. The transmission seems to be in good order, but the
reading's off the chart...over twenty thousand.
QUI-GON : (almost to himself) That's it then.
OBI-WAN : Even Master Yoda doesn't have a midi-chlorian count that high!
QUI-GON : No Jedi has.
OBI-WAN : What does it mean?
QUI-GON : I'm not sure.

The JEDI KNIGHT looks up and sees SHMI in the doorway watching him.
Embarrassed, she goes back into the kitchen while QUI-GON ponders the
situation.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT MESA - NIGHT

The sinister looking Sith spacecraft lands on top of a desert mesa at dus,
scattering a herd of banthas. DARTH MAUL walks to the edge of the mesa and
studies the landscape with a pair of electrobinoculars. He picks out the
lights of three different cities in the distance, then pushes buttons on
his electronic armband.

Six football-sized PROBE DROIDS float out of the ship and head off in three
different directions toward the cities.

DARTH MAUL stands on the mesa and watches them through his
electrobinoculars.

EXT. MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - PORCH - SUNRISE

Padme exits the hovel.

EXT. MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - BACK YARD - SUNRISE

As the twin suns rise, ARTOO is busy painting the racing Pod. ANAKIN is
asleep. PADME passes ARTOO.

PADME : I hope you're about finished.

ARTOO whistles a positive reply. PADME sees KITSTER riding toward them on
an EOPIE, a strange camel-lile creature. He is leading a second EOPIE
behind him. PADME goes over to ANAKIN. He looks very vulnerable as he
sleeps. She watches him, then touches him on the cheek. ANAKIN wakes up,
yawns, and looks at her, a little puzzled.

ANAKIN : You were in my dream...you were leading a huge army into battle.
PADME : I hope not; I hate fighting. Your mother wants you to come in and
clean up. We have to leave soon. ANAKIN stands up and stretches just as
KITSTER arrives.

ANAKIN : Hook 'em up, Kitster. (to Padme) I won't be long. Where's Qui-Gon?

PADME : He and Jar Jar left already. They're with Watto at the arena.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY

RACE CREWS mill about outside the Main Hanger.

INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY

The hanger is a large building with a dozen or so Podracers being readied
for the race. ALIEN CREWS and PILOTS rush about, making last minute fixes
on their vehicles. WATTO, QUI-GON, and JAR JAR walk through the activity.

WATTO : ...I want to see your spaceship the moment the race is over.
QUI-GON : Patienc, my blue friend. You'll have your winnings before the
suns set, and we'll be far away from here.
WATTO : Not if your ship belongs to me, I think...I warn you, no funny
business.
QUI-GON : You don't think Anakin will win?

WATTO stops before an orange racer. Sitting to one side, having his
shoulders and neck massaged by TWIN YOBANAS, is SEBULBA.

WATTO : Don't get me wrongo. I have great faith in the boy. He's a credit
to your race, but Sebulba there is going to win, I think.
QUI-GON : Why?
WATTO : He always wins. (laughs) I'm betting heavily on Sebulba.
QUI-GON : I'll take that bet.
WATTO : (suddenly stops laughing) What??!! What do you mean?
QUI-GON : I'll wager my new racing pod against...say...the boy and his
mother.
WATTO : A Pod for slaves. I don't think so...well, poerhaps. Just one...the
mother, maybe...the boy isn't for sale.
QUI-GON : The boy is small, he can't be worth much.

WATTO shakes his head.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) For the fastest Pod ever built?!

WATTO shakes his head again.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) Both, or no bet.
WATTO : No Pod's worth two slaves...not by a long shot...one slave or
nothing.
QUI-GON : The boy, then...

WATTO pulls out a small cube from his pocket.

WATTO : We'll let fate decide. Blue it's the boy, red his mother...

WATTO tosses the cube down. QUI-GON lifts his hand slightly; it turns blue.
QUI-GON smiles. WATTO is angry.

WATTO : (Cont'd) You won the small toss, outlander, bou you won't win the
race, so...it makes little difference.

ANAKIN and PADME enter the hanger on one of the EOPIES, pulling an engine.
KITSTER, on the other EOPIE, is pulling another engine. With THREEPIO
walking alongside, ARTOO trundles behind, pulling the Pod with SHMI sitting
on it. WATTO passes ANAKIN as he leaves.

WATTO : (Cont'd) (subtitled) Bonapa keesa pateeso, o wanna meetee chobodd.
(Better stop your friends betting, or I'll end up owning him, too.)

WATTO walks off, laughing.

ANAKIN : What did he mean by that?

QUI-GON : I'll tell you later.

ARTOO beeps at THREEPIO.

THREEPIO : Oh my! Space travel sounds rather perilous.

ARTOO emits a series of beeps.

THREEPIO : I can assure you they will never get me onto one of those
dreadful starships!
KITSTER : (to Anakin) This is so wizard! I'm sure you'll do it this time,
Annie.
PADME : Do what?
KITSTER : Finish the race, of course!
PADME : You've never won a race?
ANAKIN : Well...not exactly...
PADME : Not even finished?!

ANAKN looks sheepish.

ANAKIN : ...but Kitster's right, I will this time.
QUI-GON : Of course you will.

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - DAY

One of Darth Maul's PROBE DROIDS slowly floats down the main street of
Tatooine. It looks in shops and studies PEOPLE as it searches for OBI-WAN,
QI-GON, or the QUEEN.

EXT. MOS ESPA - DESERT RACE ARENA - DAY

An EXTREME HIGH WIDE ANGLE reveals a vast arena in the Tatooine desert. A
large semi-circular amphitheatre that holds at least a hundred thousand
people dominates the landscape. Large viewing platforms loom over the
racetrack. INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA ANNOUNCER'S BOX - DAY (FX)

A two-headed ANNOUNCER describes the scene.

FODE/BEED : -
A: Toogi! Toogie! (Greetings) Toong mee cha kulkah du Boonta magi! tah oos
azalus ooval Poddraces. (We have perfect weather today for the Boonta
classic. The most hazardous of all Podraces.)
B : That's absolutly right. And a big turnout here, from all corners of the
Outer Rim territories. I see the contestants are making their way out onto
the starting grid.

EXT. MOS ESPA - DESERT RACE ARENA - DAY

On the left side of the tracks across from the grandstands, a line of
Podracers emerges from the large hanger, surrounded by several CREW
MEMBERS. Pods are pulled by a wide variety of CREATURES and are led by
aliens carrying flags. The PILOTS stand facing the royal box.

FODE/BEED : -
(O.S) A : La Yma beestoo (Yes, there they are!)
B : I see Ben Quadinaros from the Tund system.
A : ...eh Gasgano doowa newpa Ord Petrovia! (And Gasgano in thenew Ord
Pedrovia.)
B : Two time winner, Boles Roor...
A : Poo tula moosta, woe grane champio Sebulba du Pixelito! Splastyleeya

Pixelito. By far the favorite today.)
B : And a late entry, Anakin Skywalker, a local boy.
A : Wampa peedunkee unko ( I hope he has better luck this time.)
B : I see the flaggers are moving onto the track.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - GRANDSTAND - DAY

Colorful canopies shade some of the SPECTATORS. VENDORS sell barbecued
creature parts and colorful drinks.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - ROYAL BOX - DAY (FX)

All the PILOTS bow from the waist as JABBA THE HUTT enters the box and
waves to the crowd.

FODE/BEED : -
A : O grandio lust, Jabba Du Hutt, amu intoe tah parena. (His honor, our
glorious host, Jabba the Hutt has entered the arena.)

The crowd ROARS. SEVERAL OTHER SLUG-LIKE HUTTS follow, along with humans
and aliens. Several SLAVE GIRLS on a chain are led alongside JABBA.

JABBA : (subtitled) Chowbaso! Tam ka chee Boonta rulee ya, kee madda
hodrudda du wundee. (Welcome!) Sebulba tuta Pixelito...

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - STARTING GRID - DAY

SEBULBA, who is right next to ANAKIN, stands and waves to his fans. A small
pep band plays as his fans wave and cheer.

KITSTER attaches the giant engins to Anakin's Pod with a long cable. SHMI
gives ANAKIN a big hug and kiss. She looks him right in the eye.

SHMI : Be safe.
ANAKIN : I will, Mom. I promise.

She leaves as ANAKIN checks the cable hitches.

JABBA : ...Mawhonic tuta Hok, Teemto Pagalies tuta Moonus Mandel, Anakin
SKywalker tuta Tatoonine....

The CROWD YELLS. ANAKIN waves to the crowd, as JABBA continues with his
introductions. SEBULBA moves over to one of Anakin's engines. KITSTER and
JAR JAR unhitch the EOPIES, and KITSTER leads them away. ARTOO beeps that
everything is OK. JAR JAR pats ANAKIN on the back.

JAR JAR : Dis berry loony, Annie. May da guds be kind, mesa palo.

PADME comes up and gives ANAKIN a little kiss on the cheeek. SEBULBA bangs
on a part protruding from Anakin's engine. He looks around to see if anyone
has noticed.

PADME : You carry all our hopes.
ANAKIN : I won't let you down.

PADME moves away as SEBULBA edges his way next to ANAKIN and gives him a
sinister grin.

SEBULBA : Bazda wahota, shag. Dobiella Nok. Yoka to Bantha poodoo. 9You
won't walk away from this one, slave scum! You're Bantha poodoo.)
ANAKIN : (subtitled) Cha skrundee da pat, sleemo. (Don't count on it,
slime-ball.)

ANAKIN looks the evil SEBULBA in the eye with a cold stare. QUI-GON
approaches, and SEBULBA backs off toward his racer.

JABBA : (sutitled)...Ka bazza kundee hodrudda! (...Let the challenge
begin!)

The CROWD lets out a LOUD CHEER. QUI-GON helps ANAKIN into his Pod. The boy
straps himself into the tiny racer.

QUI-GON : Are you all set, Annie? (Anakin nods) Remember, concentrate on
the moment. Feel. Don't think. Trust your instincts. (he smiles) May the
Force be with you.

QUI-GON steps away as ANAKIN puts on his goggles. The PILOTS flip switches,
and powerful energy binders shoot between the engines. ANAKIN flips a
switch, and his engine starts. The incredible ROAR of high-powered engines
igniting echoes throughout the arena. One driver, ODY MANDRELL, yells at a
droid (DUM-4) to get away from the front of his engine. The crowd is tense.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - STARTING GRID - DAY

The giant power-house engines torque as the PILOTS gun them. The PILOTS
flip switches, and poerful energy binders shoot between the engines. Aliens
carrying large flags move off the track. JAR JAR covers his eyes.

JAR JAR : Mesa no watch. Dissen ganna be messy!
FODE/BEED : -
A : Ya pawa culka doe rundee! (The power couplings are being activated)
B : Hey, it looks like they're clearing the grid.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - VIEWING PLATFORM - DAY

SHMI looks nervously to QUI-GON as he enters a veiwing platform. PADME and
JAR JAR are already on board. The platform rises like an elevator.

SHMI : Is he nervous?
QUI-GON : He's fine.
PADME : You Jedi are far too reckless. The Queen...
QUI-GON : The Queen trusts my judgment, young handmaiden. You should too.
PADME : You assume too much.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA ANNOUNCER'S BOX - DAY (FX)

FODE/BEED : -
B : Start your engines.

The earth-pounding ROAR of the engines revving is deafening.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - ROYAL BOX - DAY (FX)

Jabba bites off the head of a frog and spits it at a gong, signaling the
start of the race.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - STARTING GRID - DAY

On a bridge over the track, a great green light at the center flashes. The
Podracers shoot forward with a high-pitches scream. ANAKIN'S engine floods
and coughs - then dies. All the other Podracers except one swerve around
him and dissapear down the track. The slave boy struggles to get his racer
started. The two-headed announcer reports.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
A : An dare ovv! (And they're off!)
B : Oh...wait. Little Skywalker has stalled.

PADME and JAR JAR are very dissapointed with ANAKIN. QUI-GON puts his arm
around a very worried SHMI to comfort her. Finally, Anakin's engines
ignite. He zooms away after the receeding pack of competitors, leaving one
quadra-Pod racer still trying to get started. The two-headed ANNOUNCER
describes the race as it progresses.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
B : And there goes Skywalker... He'll be hard pressed to catch up with the
leaders today.

EXT. MOS ESPA - RACETRACK - DAY (FX)

The Podracers fly across the desert. SEBULBA is running neck and neck with
MAWHONIC. They round the first turn in the track, side by side. SEBULBA
drives his Pod into his rival, forcing him into the wall of a large rock
formation. MAWHONIC crashes in a spectacular display of fire and smoke.
ANAKIN is much faster than the back-end stragglers and passes them easily.
One of the drivers, GASGANO, won't let ANAKIN by. ANAKIN tries to pass him
on one side and is cut off. He then tries to pass him on the other side
ansd is cut off. As they come up on a cliff drop-off, ANAKIN backs off,
then guns it as GASGANO goes over the cliff. ANAJIN accelerates so fast
that he sails right over the top of GASGANO and speeds away.
Four TUSKEN RAIDERS perched above the race course fire their rifles at the
Pods racing in the canyon below them. One shot ricochets off the back of
Anakin's Pod.

FODE/BEED : -
B : Looks like a few Tusken Riaders have campe out on the canyon dune turn.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - VIEWING PLATFORM - DAY

JABBA THE HUTT and the crowd watch the progress of the race on small,
hand-held view screens. JAR JAR is looking over the shoulder of a strange
alien named FANTA.

JAR JAR : Where's Skywalker?

FANTA moves the view screen out of Jar Jar's view. PADME, SHMI, and QUI-GON
watch another screen and look worried.
ARTOO, down in the pits with KITSTER, lets out a worried sigh. The driver
of the quadra-Pod looks worried.

EXT. MOS ESPA - RACETRACK - DAY (FX)

ANAKIN is powering around corners and over hills and cliffs, passing other
racers right and left. SEBULBA is in the lead. He is being challenged by
another racer, XELBREE.
SEBULBA slows a little, and as XELBREE pulls alongside, he opens a side
vent on the racer's engine and the exhaust starts to cut through the
alien's engine.
The blast cuts along the engine until finally it EXPLODES. SEBULBA deftly
veers away.
ANAKIN works his way through a dense mass of racers as they zoom over a
dune sea, kicking up dust. His Pod shakes violently as he goes over a jump.
One of the Podracers, ODY, catches one of his engines in the sand, and the
whole thing EXPLODES.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - VIEWING PLATFORM - DAY

QUI-GON sits quietly, meditating. PADME and SHMI search the landscape for
any sign of the racers. JAR JAR is still annoying FANTA for information.
The crowd SCREAMS. WATTO is laughing with his friends, confident in
Anakin's defeat.
The quadra-Pod engines start just as the racers come around the corner. The
DRIVER, BEN QUADINAROS, puts it in gear, and the four engines go off in all
directions, EXPLODING in a spectacular display. The Pod drops to the ground
as SEBULBA enters the arena, closely followed by all the OTHER RACERS.
KITSTER strains to see as ARTOO beeps excitedly. The announcer continues.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S)
B ; There goes Quadinaros' power couplings.
A : Sebulba! Ka pa me cheespa wata! (Here comes Sebulba in record time.)

QUI-GON, PADME, SHMI, and JAR JAR yell for joy as ANAKIN passes. JAR JAR is
very nervous and pounds on the back of his alien neighbor, FANTA. JAR JAR :
What gooie-on?
FANTA : Bug off.

Lap two. SEBULBA and the pack race past the main arena. The crowd stands
and YELLS as the Podracers scream off into the distance. QUI-GON and PADME
look worried.

JAR JAR : He musta crash-ud.
PADME : Here he comes!

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - PIT AREA - DAY (FX)

ARTOO lets out an excited whistle, as KITSTER yells.

THREEPIO : He has to complete two more circuits? Oh dear!

EXT. MOS ESPA - RACETRACK - DAY (FX)

Sure enough, coming around the bend is ANAKIN, quickly gaining on the pack.
The two-headed announcer describes the action. The crowd goes wild.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
B : It looks like Skywalker is moving up through the field. He's in...
A : Steeth pa nagoola! (Sixth place, not bad.)

ANAKIN continues to gain on the pack. Tension for SHMI and PADME is
unbearable.
ODY stops in the pits. Droids work on his engines. DUM-4 stands in front of
the engine and is sucked in, causing the engine to die. DUM-4 is spit out
the back of the engine, very bent up. The engine lets out one final wheeze,
then EXPLODES in a puff of smoke.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
A : Ody Mandrell! Coona wa wunda dunko! (Ody Mandrell into the pits for
some attention.)
ODY : Droids!

TERTER is getting close to SEBULBA, who purposely breaks a small part off
his Pod, sending it into Terter's engine, causing him to veer into ANAKIN,
and unhooks one of the main straps on Anakin's engines that links the Pod
to his engines.
ANAKIN struggles to keep control of the little Pod. It whips about wildly.
As the Pod swings near the broken engine strap, ANAKIN grabs for it.
Finally, he catches the strap and manages to unhook it to the Pod.
SEBULBA cuts the engine of OBITOKI with his side exhaust, and the racer
crashes with a cloud of dust. A THIRD RACER, HABBA, flie into the cloud of
dust and crashes into OBITOKI. ANAKIN rounds a corner and heads into the
cloud of smoke. He hits a part of one of the engines but regains control.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
B :At the start of the third and final lap, Sebulba is in the lead, closely
followed by Skywalker...

ANAKIN finally catches up with SEBULBA, and runs neck and neck over the
rough terrain. JAR JAR, QUI-GON, SHMI, and PADME all SCREAM s ANAKIN comes
through the arena. The lights in the tower indicate that this is the third
and last lap. WATTO begins to worry.
SEBULBA uses his side exhaust port to try to cut through Anakin's engines.
ANAKIN manages to avoid having his engine disabled but is forced off
course.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
B : Skywalker is forced onto the service ramp!
A : Oh noah!

On a tight corner, ANAKIN dives to the inside and takes the lead.

FODE BEED : - (O.S.)
B : Amazing... a controlled thrust and he's back on course! What a move!

SEBULBA is furious. He stay's right on Anakin's tail, crowding him and
pushing him through the turns.
SEBULBA pushes ANAKIN harder, and the young boy has a difficult time
keeping control. One of the parts on Anakin's engines begins to shake
loose. ANAKIN sees it and switches over to an auxiliary system. While he is
trying to accomplish this maneuver, SEBULBA races past him.
ANAKIN tries to get around SEBULBA, to no avail. Every move ANAKIN makes,
SEBULBA is able to block.
Finally, ANAKIN fakes a move into the inside as he usually does, then tries
to go around SEBULBA on the outside. They race sid by side down the final
stretch of the track.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
B : He's catching Sebulba.
A : Inkabunga. (Incredible!)

SEBULBA veers toward ANAKIN and bangs into his Pod. He crashes into ANAKIN
over and over. The young boy struggles to maintain control as the steering
rods on the two Pods become hooked together. SEBULBA laughs at ANAKIN.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
B : That little human being is out of his mind.
A : Punda tah punda! (They're neck and neck!)
B : They're side by side!
A : Bongo du bongu! (Shoulder to shoulder!)

As they head for the final stretch, ANAKIN fights to unlock the steering
rods by trying to pull away from SEBULBA. The strain on the steering rod is
tremendous. Suddenly, ANAKIN's steering arm breaks, and his Pos starts
spinning.
The release of tension sends SEBULBA into an ancient statue. One engine
EXPLODES, then the other. SEBULBA skids through the fire-balls, blackened,
but unhurt. He slides to a smoking stop, gets out of his racer, and throws
what's left of a shifter arm on the ground. Suddenly he realizes his pants
are on fire, and he struggles to put them out. ANAKIN flies through the
EXPLOSION as the crowd stands, CHERRING. PADME and JAR JAR jump up and down
with excitment, PADME screaming for joy. ARTOO and KITSTER whistle
hysterically. QUI-GON and SHMI smile. ANAKIN races over the finish line,
the winner.

INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA ANNOUNCERS BOX - DAY (FX)

The two-headed announcer excitedly calls the finish.

FODE/BEED : -
B : It's Skywalker! The crowd are going nuts! Oh Ah Oh Ah (rock head in
tandem with partner)

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - DAY

As ANAKIN stops the Podracer, KISTER turns up, and they embrace. Hundreds
of SPECTATORS join them and put ANAKIN on their shoulders, marching off,
CHEERING AND CHANTING. Darth Maul's PROBE DROIDS move through the crowd.

INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - PRIVATE BOX - DAY

Several ALIENS leave Watto's box, laughing and counting their money. WATTO
sees QUI-GON standing in the doorway.

WATTO : You! You swindled me! You knew the boy was going to win! Somehow
you knew it! I lost everything.

WATTO flies up to QUI-GON and puts his face right up against QUI-GON's.
QUI-GON simply smiles.

QUI-GON : Whenever you gamble, my freind, eventually you'll lose. Bring the
parts to the main hanger. I'll come by your shop later so you can release
the boy.
WATTO : You can't have him! It wasn't a fair bet!
QUI-GON : Would you like to discuss it with the Hutts...I'm sure they can
settle this.
WATTO : No, no! I want no more of your tricks! Take him!

The SITH PROBE DROID watches with great interest.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY

The Main Hanger is almost deserted as RACERS depart.

INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY

JAR JAR gives ANAKIN a great hug, then PADME gives him a hug, then SHMI.

ANAKIN : Ah, gee...enough of this...
SHMI : It's so wonderful, Annie. You have brought hope to those who have
none. I'm so very proud of you...
PADME : We owe you everything.
ANAKIN : Just feeling this good was worth it.

In the background, QUI-GON has harnessed the EOPIES to containers full of
parts.

QUI-GON : Padme. Jar Jar, let's go, we've got to get these parts back to
the ship.

The GROUP walks over to QUI-GON and the EOPIES.
PADME climbs on behind QUI-GON. JAR JAR swings up onto the second EOPIE,
only to slwly slide off the other side. ARTOO whistles. ANAKIN and SHMI
wave as they ride off.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) I'll return the eopies by midday.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY

ARTOO cruises ahead of QUI-GON and PADME, who are riding one of the EOPIES;
JAR JAR ridses the other. They stop in front of the sleek Naboo spacecraft.
OBI-WAN comes out of the ship and joins them.

QUI-GON : Start getting this hyperdrive generator installed. I'm going
back...some unfinished business. I won't be long.
OBI-WAN : Why do I sense we've picked up another pathetic life form...?
QUI-GON : It's the boy who's responsible for getting those parts.

On a hill far overlooking the Naboo spacecraft, the SITH PROBE DROID turns
and speeds away.

EXT. TATOOINE - STREET - SLAVE QUARTERS - DAY

ANAKIN and A GREEDO are rolling around on the floor, fighting. About A
DOZEN OR SO KIDS are standing around them, yelling. Suddenly, a long shadow
is cast over the TWO BOYS; they stop fighting and look up. QUI-GOMN is
towering above them. KITSTER is with them.

QUI-GON : What's this?
ANAKIN : He said I cheated.
QUI-GON : Did you?
ANAKIN : No!
QUI-GON : Do you still think he cheated?
GREEDO : Yes.
QUI-GON : Well, Annie. You know the truth... You will have to tolerate his
opinion, fighting won't change it.

QUI-GON moves off down the street. Anakin follows. The GREEDO wanders over
to WALD who has been watching the goings-on.

WALD : Keep this up, Greedo, and you're gonna come to a bad end.

Farther down the street QUI-GON and ANAKIN head toward Anakin's hovel.
QUI-GON takes a handful of credits from beneath his poncho and hands them
to the boy.

QUI-GON : These are yours. We sold the Pod.
ANAKIN : (suddenly beaming) Yes!

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY

SHMI is cleaning up as ANAKIN bursts through the door, followed by QUI-GON.

ANAKIN : Mom, he sold the Pod. Look at all the money we have!

ANAKIN pulls a bag of coins out of his pocket.

SHMI : Oh, my goodness, That's wonderful.
QUI-GON : And Anakin has been freed.
ANAKIN : What?!?
QUI-GON : You're no longer a slave.

ANAKIN jumps for joy! SHMI is stunned.

ANAKIN : Did you hear that, Mom? (to Qui-Gon) Was that part of the prize,
or what?
QUI-GON : Let's just say Watto has learned an important lesson about
gambling.
SHMI : Now you can make your dreams come true, Annie. You're free! (turns
to Qui-Gon) Will you take him with you? Is he to become a Jedi?
QUI-GON : Our meeting was not a coincidence. Nothing happens by accident.
You are strong with the Force, but you may not be accepted by the Coucil.
ANAKIN : A Jedi! Mighty blasters, you mean I get to go with you in your
starship and everything?!

QUI-GON kneels down to the boy.

QUI-GON : Anakin, training to be a Jedi will not be a easy challenge. And
if you succeed, it will be a hard life.
ANAKIN : But it's what I want. What I've always dreamed about. Can I go,
Mom?!
QUI-GON : This path has been placed for you, Annie; the choice to take it
is yours alone.

ANAKIN thinks, looks to his mother, then to QUI-GON.

ANAKIN : I want to go.
QUI-GON : Then, pack your things. We haven't much time.
ANAKIN : Yipee!!

ANAKIN hugs his mom and starts for the other room, then stops. SHMI and
QUI-GON give each other a knowing look. ANAKIN has realized something.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) What about Mom? Is she free too? You're coming, aren't
you, Mom
QUI-GON : I tried to free your mother, Annie, but Watto wouldn't have it.
ANAKIN : But the money from selling...
QUI-GON : It's not nearly enough.

SHMI comes over to her son and sits next to him. Taking both of his hands
in hers, she draws him close.

SHMI : Son, my place is here. My future is here. It is time for you to let
go...to let go of me. I cannot go with you.
ANAKIN : I want to stay with you. I don't want things to change.
SHMI : You can't stop change any more than you can stop the suns from
setting. Listen to your feelings; Annie, you know what's right.

ANAKIN takes a deep breath, drops his head. QUI-GON and SHMI exchange a
look of concern. When ANAKIN raises up, there are tears in his eyes.

ANAKIN : I'm going to miss you so much, Mom...
SHMI : I love you, Annie...now hurry.

ANAKIN and SHMI hug. ANAKIN runs into the other room.

SHMI : (Cont'd) Thank you.
QUI-GON : I will watch after him. You have my word. Will you be all right?
SHMI : He was in my life for such a short time.

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - SECOND ROOM - DAY

ANAKIN has thrown the last of his things in a small backpack. As he leaves,
he stops and pushes the button that wakes his droid up. THREEPIO stares at
him blankly.

ANAKIN : Well, Threepio, I'm free...and I'm going away...in a starship...
THREEPIO : Master, Annie, you are my maker, and I wish you well. Although
I'd like it better if I were a little less naked.
ANAKIN : I'm sorry I wasn't able to finish you, Threepio...give you
coverings and all... I'm going to miss working on you. You've been a great
pal. I'll make sure Mom doesn't sell you or anything. Bye.

THREEPIO stares at ANAKIN as he rushes out of the room.

THREEPIO : Sell me?!?

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - SLAVE QUARTERS - DAY

KITSTER runs up to ANAKIN as he and QUI-GON exit Anakin's hovel. SHMI
stands in the doorway. ANAKIN pulls a handful of coins out of his pocket
and gives them to KITSTER.

KITSTER : There are so many of us who want you to stay, Annie... You're a
hero.
ANAKIN : I... (looks to SHMI) I... have to go.

QUI-GON has moved a short way down the street.

KITSTER : Well.
ANAKIN : Well.
KITSTER : Thank's for every moment you've been here. You're my best friend.
ANAKIN : I won't forget.

ANAKIN hugs KITSTER and runs toward QUI-GON, then stops to look back at his
mother standing in the doorway. He turns back to QUI-GON, then turns and
runs back to his mother.

ANAKIN : (starting to cry) I can't do it, Mom. I just can't.

SHMI hugs ANAKIN. QUI-GON watches from the distance. She kneels down and
looks him in the face.

SHMI : Annie, remember when you climbed the great dune in order to chase
the Banthas away so they wouldn't be shot... Remember how you collapses
several times, exhausted thinking you couldn't do it?

ANAKIN shakes his head.

SHMI : (Cont'd) This is one of those times when you have to do something
you don't think you can do. I know how strong you are, Annie. I know you
can do this...
ANAKIN : Will I ever see you again?
SHMI : What does your heart tell you?
ANAKIN : I hope so...yes...I guess.
SHMI : Then we will see each other again.
ANAKIN : I.. will become a Jedi and I will come back and free you, Mom...I
promise.
SHMI : No matter where you are, my love will be with you. Now be brave, and
don't look back... don't look back.
ANAKIN : I love you so much.

SHMI hugs ANAKIN, then turns him around so he is facing QUI-GON, and off he
marches, like the brave little trooper that he is. He marches right past
QUI-GON, starring right ahead, tears in his eyes, determined not to look
back.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT MESA - DAY

The PROBE DROID beeps and whistles to DARTH MAUL. The SITH LORD gets on a
speeder bike and follows the PROBE DROID into Mos Espa.

EXT MOS ESPA - STREET - FRUIT STAND - DAY

ANAKIN and QUI-GON exit WATTO'S and stop before JIRA'S fruit stand. ANAKIN
hands JIRA some coins.

ANAKIN : I've been freed, and I'm going away. Buy yourself a cooling unit
with this... Otherwise I'll worry about you.

JIRA is astonished. She stares, not knowing what to say.

JIRA : Can I give you a hug
ANAKIN : Sure.

She gives him a hug.

JIRA : I'll miss you, Annie.. there isn't a kinder boy in the galaxy. You
be careful...

ANAKIN runs to join QUI-GON, who has already started down the street. As
they walk along together, QUI-GON notices something out of the corner of
his eye.
Suddenly, without breaking his stride, he ignites his laser sword, swing
around, and lunges forward and cuts a lurking PROBE DROID in half. QUI-GON
inspects the sparking and fizzing DROID.

ANAKIN : What is it?
QUI-GON : Probe droid. Very unusual... not like anything I've seen before.
Come on.

QUI-GON and ANAKIN start running.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY

QUI-GON and ANAKIN run toward the Naboo spacecraft. ANAKIN is having a hard
time keeping up.

ANAKIN : Master Qui-Gon,sir, wait!

QUI-GON turns to answer and sees a DARK-CLOAKED FIGURE bearing down on a
speeder bike.

QUI-GON : Anakin, drop!

ANAKIN drops to the ground just as DARTH MAUL sweeps over him. DARTH MAUL
jumps off his speeder bike, and before he has hit the ground, the Sith Lord
has swund a death blow with his laser sword that is barely blocked by
QUI-GON.
ANAKIN picks himself up. The two galactic warriors, Sith and Jedi, are
bashing each other with incredible blows. They move in a continual cloudof
dust, smashing everything around them. This is a fierce fight. ANAKIN gets
up, bewildered by the confrontation.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) Annie, get to the ship! Take off! Go! Go!

QUI-GON struggles to fend off the relentless onslaught as ANAKIN races to
the ship.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - HALLWAY

ANAKIN runs into the main hallway of the spaceship, where PADME and CAPTAIN
PANAKA are working.

ANAKIN : Qui-Gon's in trouble. He says to take off...now!!
CAPT. PANAKA : Who are you?
PADME : He's a friend.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - COCKPIT

CAPTAIN PANAKA, ANAKIN, and PADME rush into the cockpit where OBI-WAN and
RIC OLIE are checking the hyperdrive.

CAPT. PANAKA : Qui-Gon is in trouble, he says to take off!
PILOT : I don't see anything.
OBI-WAN : Over there! Fly low!

In the distance is a small cloud of dust.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY

QUI-GON and DARTH MAUL continue theirsword battle. Leaping over one another
in an incredible display of acrobatics, the two warrios hear the ship fly
over them a few feet off the ground. QUI-GON almost dissapears for a
moment.
Before DARTH MAUL knows what's happening, QUI-GON is on the spacecrat's
ramp.

EXT. TATOOINE - NABOO SPACECRAFT RAMP - DAY

The SITH LORD immediately jumps onto the ramp after QUI-GON, but barely
makes it. His heels hang over the edge of a forty-foot drop. QUI-GON swings
his laser sword with all his might and knocks DARTH AMUL off the ramp and
onto the desert floor. The ramp closes, and the Naboo craft rockets away,
leaving the Sith Lord standing alone.

EXT. SPACE - NABOO SPACECRAFT (FX)

The sleek spacecraft rockets away from the planet Tatooine.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - HALLWAY

ANAKIN and OBI-WAN rush into the hallway to find QUI-GON collapsed on the
floor opposite the entry. ARTOO is looking over him. The JEDI is breathing
hard, wet with sweat and covered in dirt.

ANAKIN : Are you all right?
QUI-GON : I think so... that was a surpirse I wont soon forget.
OBI-WAN : What was it?
QUI-GON : I don't know... but he was well trained in the Jedi arts. My
guess is he was after the Queen...
ANAKIN : Do you think he'll follow us?
QUI-GON : We'll be safe enough once we're in hyperspace, but I have no
doubt he knows our destination.
ANAKIN : What are we going to do about it?

OBI-WAN gives ANAKIN a "who are you?" look. ANAKIN returns an innocent
stare.

QUI-GON : We will be patient. Anakin Skywalker, meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.
ANAKIN : Pleased to meet you. Wow! You're a Jedi too?

OBI-WAN gives the boy a skeptical look.

INT. COCKPIT - SPACE

RIC OLIE pulls back on the hyperdrive. OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, and ANAKIN watch.

QUI-GON : Let's hope this hyperdrive works and Watto didn't get the last
laugh.

The stars streak outside the cockpit window.

EXT. SPACE - NABOO SPACECRAFT (FX)

The ship streaks into hyperspace.

EXT. THEED - STREET - NIGHT (FX)

SEVERAL FEDERATION DROIDS patrol a deserted city street. The Palace can be
seen in the distance.

INT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM - THEED - NIGHT

NUTE sits in a strange, mechanical walking chair, which approaches SIO
BIBBLE and SEVERAL OTHER NABOO OFFICIALS. RUNE follows a few paces behind.
DROID GUARDS surround SIO BIBBLE and THE OTHERS as FOUR COUNCIL MEMBERS
watch.

NUTE : When are you going to give up this pointless strike? Your Queen is
lost, your people are starving, and you, Governor, are going to die, much
sooner than your people, I'm afraid. Take him away!
BIBBLE : This invasion will gain you nothing. We're a democracy. The people
have decided... They will not live under your tyranny.

BIBBLE is taken away as OOM-9 approaches NUTE.

OOM-9 : My troops are in position to begin searching the swamps for these
rumored underwater villages... they will not stay hidden for long.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - MAIN AREA

The ship is asleep. The lights are dim as PADME walks into the main room.
She goes to a monitor and watches the BIBBLE plea recording. JAR JAR is
stretched out on the floor, snoring. ARTOO is to one side, cooing as he
rests.
PADME appears tired. She senses someone watching her and turns around with
a start. She sees ANAKIN sitting in the corner, shivering and looking
verydejected. She goes over to him. He looks up at her with tears in his
eyes. He is holding his arms to keep himself warm.

PADME : Are you all right?
ANAKIN : It's very cold.

PADME gives him her over-jacket.

PADME : You're from a warm planet, Annie. Too warm for my taste. Space is
cold.
ANAKIN : You seem sad.
PADME : The Queen is...worried. Her people are suffering...dying. She must
convince the Senate to intervene, or...I'm not sure what will happen.
ANAKIN : I'm...I'm not sure what's going to happen to me. I dunno if I'll
ever see you again.. (he pulls something from his pocket) I made this for
you. Sou you'd remember me. I carved it out of a japor snippet... It will
bring you good fortune.

ANAKIN hands a wooden pendant to PADME. She inspects it, then puts it
around her neck.

PADME : It's beautiful, but I don't need this to remember you. Many things
will change when we reach the capital, Annie. My caring for you will always
remain.
ANAKIN : I care for you too. Only I...miss...

ANAKIN is disturbed about something. Tears are in his eyes.

PADME : ...You miss your mother.

ANAKIN looks at her, unable to speak. She hugs him.

ANAKIN looks out the cockpit window in awe.

RIC OLIE : Coruscant...the capital of the Republic...the entire planet is
one big city.
ANAKIN : Wow! It's so huge!

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY (FX)

The ship flies through the cityscape of Coruscant.

EXT. CORUSCANT - SENATE LANDING PLATFORM - DAY

Supreme Chancellor VALORUM, SEVERAL GUARDS, and SENATOR PALPATINE stand on
a landing platform.
The sleek Naboo spacecraft lands on the platform high above the street
level of the galactic capital. The ramp lowers. OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, JAR JAR
and ANAKIN descend the ramp first and bow before PALPATINE and VALORUM.
CAPTAIN PANAKA, TWO GUARDS, QUEEN AMIDALA, then PADME, RABE, EIRTAE,
and
MORE GUARDS descend the ramp. QUEEN AMIDALA stops before the group.
ANAKIN and JAR JAR stand to one side, looking at the huge city. PADME
smiles at ANAKIN. PALPATINE bows before the Queen.

PALPATINE : It is a great gift to see you alive, Your Majesty. May I
present Supreme Chancellor Valorum.
VALORUM : Welcome, Your Highness. It is an honor to finally meet you in
person. I must relay to you how distressed everyone is over the currant
situation. I've called for a special session of the Senate to hear your
position.
AMIDALA : I am grateful for your concern, Chancellor.

PALPATINE starts to lead QUEEN AMIDALA and her RETINUE off the platform
toward a waiting air taxi.

PALPATINE : There is a question of precedure, but I feel confident we can
overcome it...

JAR JAR and ANAKIN start to follow, then stop, noticing that OBI-WAN and
QUI-GON are staying with the SUPREME CHANCELLOR. QUEEN AMIDALA waves to the
duo to follow her. ANAKIN looks back to QUI-GON, and he nods to go ahead.
ANAKIN and JAR JAR join the QUEEN, PALPATINE, PADME, RABE and EIRTAE in the
taxi. PALPATINE gives the Gungan and the boy in the back of the taxi a
skeptical look. JAR JAR leans over to ANAKIN.

JAR JAR : Da Queens- a bein grossly nice, mesa tinks. (he looks around)
Pitty hot!

VALORUM and the JEDI watch the taxi move off into the city.

QUI-GON : I must speak with the Jei Council immediately, Your Honor. The
situation has become more complicated.

INT. PALPATINE'S QUARTERS - ANTEROOM - DAY

QUEEN AMIDALA is sitting listening to PALPATINE. EIRTAE and RABE stand
behind the QUEEN; PADME is nowhere to be sen. ANAKIN and JAR JAR are
waiting in an adjoining room. They can see the Queen but cannot hear what
is being said.

JAR JAR : Dissen all pitty odd to my.
ANAKIN : Don't look at me. I don't know what's going on.

CAPTAIN PANAKA enters, then goes into the room with QUEEN AMIDALA.

INT. PALPATINE'S QUARTERS - LIVING AREA - DAY

PALPATINE is pacing as CAPTAIN PANAKA enters. EIRTAE and RABE stand to one
side.

PALPATINE : ...the Republic is not what it once was. The Senate is full of
greedy, squabbling delegates who are only looking out for themselves and
their home sytems. There is no interest in the common good...no civility,
only politics...its disgusting. I must be frank, Your Majesty, there is
little chance the Senate will act on the invasion.
AMIDALA : Chancellor Valorum seems to think there is hope.
PALPATINE : If I may say so, Your Majesty, the Chancellor has little real
power...he is mired down by baseless accusations of corruption. A
manufactured scandal surrounds him. The bureaucrats are in charge now.
AMIDALA : What options do we have?
PALPATINE : Our best choice would be to push for the election of a stronger
Supreme Chancellor. One who will take control of the bureaucrats, enforces
the laws, and give us justice. You could call for a vote of no confidence
in Chancellor Valorum.
AMIDALA : He has been our strongest supporter. Is there any other way?
PALPATINE : Our only other choice would to be to submit a plea to the
courts...
AMIDALA : There's no time for that. The courts take even longer to decide
things than the Senate. Our people are dying, Senator...more and more each
day. We must do something quickly to stop the Federation.
PALPATINE : To be realistic, Your Highness, I'd say we're going to have to
accept Federation control for the time being.
AMIDALA : There is something I cannot do.

EXT. TEMPLE OF THE JEDI - DAY (FX)

A unique building with it tall spires stands out against the Coruscant
skyline. A small transport passes by the vast temple.

INT. TEMPLE OF THE JEDI - COUNCIL CHAMBERS - DAY

QUI-GON stands in a tall stately room. Twelve JEDI sit in a semi-circle.
OBI-WAN stands behind QUI-GON in the center of the room.
The Senior Jedi is MACE WINDU. To his left is an alien Jedi named
KI-ADI-MUNDI, and to his right, the Jedi Master, YODA.

QUI-GON : ...my only conclusion can be that it was a Sith Lord.
MACE WINDU : A Sith Lord?!?
KI-ADI : Impossible! The Sith have been extinct for a millenium.
YODA : The very Republic is threatened, if involved the Sith are.
MACE WINDU : I do not believe they could have returned without us knowing.
YODA : Hard to see, the dark side is. Discover who this assassin is, we
must.
KI-ADI : I sense he will reveal himself again.
MACE WINDU : This attack was with purpose, that is clear, and I agree the
Queen is the target.
YODA : With this Naboo queen you must stay, Qui-Gon. Protect her.
MACE WINDU : We will use all our resources here to unravel this mystery and
discover the identity of your attacker... May the Force be with you.
YODA : May the Force be with you.

OBI-WAN turns to leave, but QUI-GON continues to face the Council.

YODA : (Cont'd) Master Qui-Gon more to say have you?
QUI-GON : With your permission, my Master. I have encountered a vergence in
the Force.
YODA : A vergence, you say?
MACE WINDU : Located around a person?
QUI-GON : A boy... his cells have the highest concentration of
midi-chlorians I have seen in a life form. It is possible he was conceived
by the midi-chlorians.
MACE WINDU : You're referring to the prophesy of the one who will bring
balance to the Force...you believe it's this boy??
QUI-GON : I don't pressume...
YODA : But you do! Rrevealed your opinion is.
QUI-GON : I request the boy be tested.

The JEDI all look to one another. They nod and turn back to OBI-WAN and
QUI-GON.

YODA : Trained as a Jedi, you request for him?
QUI-GON : Finding him was the will of the Force...I have no doubt of that.
There is too much happening here...
MACE WINDU : Bring him before us, then.
YODA : Tested he will be.

INT. QUEENS QUARTERS - CORUSCANT - DAY Anakin, tentative, walks down one of
the long hallways in Senator Palpatine's quarters. He stops before a dor
that is flanked by TWO GUARDS.

GUARD : May I help you, son?
ANAKIN : I'm...I'm looking for the handmaiden, Padme.

The GUARD speaks into his comlink as ANAKIN looks around a bit nervously.

GUARD : The boy is here to see Padme.
RABE : Send him in.

The doors open, and ANAKIN enters the Queen's quarters.
RABE greets ANAKIN as TWO OTHER HANDMAIDENS come and go into the next room.

ANAKIN : I'd like to speak with Padme, if I could.
RABE : I'm sorry, Annie. Padme is not here right now.

The Queen speaks out in the next room.

AMIDALA : (O.S.) Who is it?
RABE : Anakin Skywalker, to see Padme, Your Highness.

The QUEEN moves into the doorway and studies ANAKIN. ANAKIN bows and looks
down, then takes a peek at her.

AMIDALA : I've sent Padme on an errand.
ANAKIN : I'm going to the Jedi temple to start my training, I hope.

The QUEEN just stares at him.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I may not see her again...and... I just wanted to say
goodbye.
AMIDALA : We will tell her for you. We're sure her heart goes with you.

ANAKIN bows again.

ANAKIN : Thank you, Your Highness. I'm sorry to have disturbed you.

The QUEEN dissapears behind the doorway, and ANAKIN exits.

EXT. CORUSCANT - GALACTIC SENATE BUILDING - DAY (FX)

A large, distinctive looking domed building stands out amid the cityscape
of Coruscant.

INT. MAIN ROTUNDA - GALACTIC SENATE - DAY

The Senate chambers are huge. Thousands of SENATORS and their AIDES sit in
the circular assembly area. CHANCELLOR VALORUM sits in an elevated area in
the center. Hindreds of AIDES and DROIDS hurry about. SENATOR PALPATINE,
QUEEN AMIDALA, EIRTA, RABE, and CAPTAIN PANAKA sit in the Naboo
congressional box, which is actually a floating platform. PALPATINE leans
over to the QUEEN.

PALPATINE : If the Federation moves to defer the motion...Your Majesty,
Ibeg of you to ask for a resolution to end this congressional session.
AMIDALA : I wish I had your confidence in this, Senator.
PALPATINE : You must force a new election for Supreme Chancellor...I
promise you there are many who will support us...it is our best chance...
Your Majesty, our only, chance.
AMIDALA : You truely believe Chancellor Valorum will not bring our motion
to a vote?
PALAPATINE : He is distracted...he is afraid. He will be of no help.
VALORUM : The Chair recognizes the Senator from the sovereign system of
Naboo.

The Naboo congressional box floats into the center.

PALPATINE : Supreme Chancellor, delegates of the Senate. A tragedy has
occured on our peaceful system of Naboo. We have become caugt in a dispute
you're all well aware of, which began right here with the taxation of trade
routes, and has now engulfed our entire planet in the oppresion of the
Trade Federation.

A second box rushes into the center of the Senate. It is filled with
Federation trade barons led by LOTT DOD, the Senator for the Federation.

LOTT DOD : This is outrageous! I object to the Senator's statements!
VALORUM : The Chair does not recognize the Senator from the Trade
Federation at this time. Please return to your station.

LOTT DOD reluctantly moves back to his place.

PALPATINE : To state our allegations, I present Queen Amidala, the recently
elected ruler of Naboo, to speak on our behalf.

QUEEN AMIDALA stands and addresses the assembly. There is some applause.

AMIDALA : Honorable representatives of the Republic, distinguished
delegates, and Your Honor Supreme Chancellor Valorum, I come to you under
the gravest of circumstances. The Naboo system has been invaded by force.
Invaded...against all the laws of the Republic by the Droid Armies of the
Trade...
LOTT DOD : I object! There is no proof. This is incredible. We recommend a
commision be sent to Naboo to assertain the truth.
VALORUM : Overruled.
LOTT DOD : Your Honor, you cannot allow us to be condemned without
reasonable observation. It's against all the rules of procedure.

A third box representing Malastare moves into the center of the room. AKS
MOE, the Ambassador, addresses the convention.

AKS MOE : The Congress of Malastare concurs with the honorable delegate
from the Trade Federation. A commision must be appointed...that is the law.
VALORUM : The point...

VALORUM confers with several of his AIDES and VICE CHAIRMAN MAS AMEDDA.
PALPATINE whispers something to the QUEEN.

PALPATINE : Enter the bureaucrats, the true rulers of the Republic, and on
the payroll of the Trade Federation, I might add. This is where Chancellor
Valorum's strength will dissapear.
VALORUM : The point is conceded...Section 523A take precedence here. Queen
Amidala of the Naboo, will you defer your motion to allow a commission to
explore the validity of your accusations?

QUEEN AMIDALA is angry but remains composed.

AMIDALA : (angrily) I will not defer...I have come before you to resolve
this attack on our sovereignty now. I was not elected to watch my people
suffer and die while you discuss this invasion in a committee. If this body
is not capable of action, I suggest new leadership is needed. I move for a
"vote of no confidence"...in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.
VALORUM : What?...No!

This causes a great stir in the assembly. A loud mumur cresendos into a
roar of approval and jeers. CHANCELLOR VALORUM is stunned and stands
speechless. His Vice Chair, MAS AMEDDA, takes over.

MAS AMEDDA : Order! We shall have order...

Things settledown a little. The Federation box settles next to AMIDALA.
PRINCE BAIL ORGANA moves his box into the arena.

BAIL ORGANA : Alderaan seconds the motion for a vote of no confidence in
Chancellor Valorum.
MAD AMEDDA : The motion has been seconded by Bail Organa of Alderaan.

MAS AMEDDA turns to the confused VALORUM, and whispers something to him.

BAIL ORGANA : There must be no delays. The motion is on the floor and must
be voted upon in this session.
LOTT DOD : The Trade Federation moves the motion be sent to the procedures
committee for study.

The assembly begins to chant. VALORUM talks to MAS AMEDDA.

ASSEMBLY : Vote now! Vote now! Vote now!

PALPATINE stands next to AMIDALA.

PALPATINE : You see, Your Majaesty, the tide is with us...Valorum will be
voted out, I assure you, and they will elect in a new Chancellor, a strong
Chancellor, one who will not let our tragedy continue...
MAS AMEDDA : Thew Supreme Chancellor requests a recess. Tomorrow we will
begin the vote.

The Federation delegation is furious. VALORUM turns to PALPATINE.

VALORUM : Palpatine, I thought you were my ally...my friend. You have
betrayed me! How could you do this?

EXT. PALACE OF THE JEDI - BALCONY - SUNSET

OBI-WAN and QUI-GON stand outside the palace on a balcony.

OBI-WAN : The boy will not pass the Council's tests, Master, and you know
it. He is far too old.
QUI-GON : Anakin will become A Jedi...I promise you.
OBI-WAN : Don't defy the Council, Master..not again.
QUI-GON : I will do what I must.
OBI-WAN : Master, you could be sitting on the Council by now if you would
just follow the code. They will not go along with you this time.
QUI-GON : You still have much to learn, my young apprentice.

INT. PALACE OF THE JEDI - COUNCIL CHAMBERS - SUNSET

ANAKIN stands before the TWELVE JEDI. MACE WINDU holds a small hand-held
viewing screen. In rapid succession, images flash across the screen.

ANAKIN : A ship...a cup...a speeder.

MACE WINDU turns the viewing screen off and nods toward YODA.

YODA : Good, good, young one. How feel you?
ANAKIN : Cold, sir.
YODA : Afraid are you?
ANAKIN : No, sir.
MACE WINDU : Afraid to give up your life?
ANAKIN : I don't think so.

ANAKIN hesitates for a moment.

YODA : See through you, we can.
MACE WINDU : Be mindful of your feelings...
KI-ADI : YOur thoughts dwell on your mother.
ANAKIN : I miss her.
YODA : Afraid to lose her..I think.
ANAKIN : (a little angry) What's that got to do with anything?
YODA : Eveything. Fear is the path to the dark side... fear leads to
anger... anger leads to hate.. hate leads to suffering.
ANAKIN : (angrily) I am not afraid!
YODA : A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. I
sense much fear in you.
ANAKIN : (quietly) I am not afraid.
YODA : Then continue, we will.

INT. PALPATINES QUARTERS - SUNSET

QUEEN AMIDALA is standing, staring out the window, with JAR JAR. The lights
of the city shimmer before them. EIRTAE and SABE stand near the door. JAR
JAR turns to face the QUEEN and sees her sadness.

JAR JAR : Mesa wonder why da guds invent pain?
AMIDALA : To motivate us, I imagine...
JAR JAR : Yousa tinken yousa people ganna die?
AMIDALA : I don't know.
JAR JAR : Gungans ganna get pasted too, eh?
AMIDALA : I hope not.
JAR JAR : Gungans do die'n without a fight.... wesa warriors. Wesa gotta
grand army. Dat why you no liken us, metinks.

PALPATINE and CAPTAIN PANAKA rush into the rom and bow before the QUEEN.

CAPT. PANAKA : Your Highness, Senator Palpatine has been nominated to
succeed Valorum as Supreme Chancellor.
PALPATINE : A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one. I promise, Your
Majesty, if I am elected, I will bring democracy back to the Republic. I
will put an end to corruption. The Trade Fedreation will lose its influence
over the bureaucrats, and our people will be freed.
AMIDALA : Who else can be nominated?
CAPT. PANAKA : Bail Antilles of Alderaan and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.
PALPATINE : I feel confident...our "situation" will create a strong
sympaphy vote for us... I will be Chancellor, I promise you.
AMIDALA : I fear by the time you have control of the bureaucrats, Senator,
there will be nothing left of our cities, our people, our way of life...
PALPATINE : I understand your concern, Your Majesty; unfortunately, the
Federation has possession of our planet. The law is in their favor.
AMIDALA : With the Senate in transition, there is nothing more I can do
here...Senator, this is your arena. I feel I must return to mine. I have
decided to go back to Naboo. My place is with my people.
PALPATINE : Go back!! But, Your Majesty, be realistic! You would be in
danger. They will force you to sign the treaty.
AMIDALA : I will sign no treaty, Senator. My fate will be no different from
that of our people. Captain!
CAPT. PANAKA : Yes, Your Highness?
AMIDALA : Ready my ship!
CAPT. PANAKA : Please, Your Majesty, stay here...where it's safe.
AMIDALA : No place is safe, if the Senate doesn't condemn this invasion. It
is clear to me now that the Republic no longer functions as a democracy. If
you win the election, Senator, I know you will do everything possible to
stop the Federation. I pray you will bring sanity and compassion back to
the Senate.

AMIDALA and her RETINUE exit the room. PALPATINE has a self-satisfied smile
on his face.

INT. TEMPLE OF THE JEDI - COUNCIL CHAMBERS - TWILIGHT

ANAKIN, OBI-WAN, and QUI-GON stand before the TWELVE MEMBERS OF THE JEDI
COUNCIL.

YODA : ...Correct you were, Qui-Gon.
MACE WINDU : His cells contain a high concentration of midi-chlorians.
KI-ADI : The Force is strong with him.
QUI-GON : He's to be trained, then.

The COUNCIL MEMBERS look to one another.

MACE WINDU : No. He will not be trained.

ANAKIN is crestfallen; tears begin to form in his eyes.

QUI-GON : No??!!

OBI-WAN smiles.

MACE WINDU : He is too old. There is already too much anger in him.
QUI-GON : He is the chosen one...you must see it.
YODA : Clouded, this boy's future is. Masked by his youth.
QUI-GON : I will trin him, then. I take Anakin as my Padawan learner.

OBI-WAN reacts with surprise. ANAKIN watches with interest.

YODA : An apprentice, you have, Qui-Gon. Impossible, to take on a second.
MACE WINDU : We forbid it.
QUI-GON : Obi-Wan is ready...
OBI-WAN : Iam ready to face the trials.
YODA : Ready so early, are you? What know you of ready?

ANAKIN watches as QUI-GON and OBI-WAN exchange angry looks.

QUI-GON : Headstrong....and he has much to learn about the living Force,
but he is capabe. There is little more he will learn from me.
YODA : Our own council we will keep on who is ready. More to learn, he
has...
MACE WINDU : Now is not the time for this...the Senate is voting for a new
Spreme Chancellor. Queen Amidala is returning home, which will put pressure
on the Federation, and could widen the confrontation.
YODA : And draw out the Queen's attacker.
KI-ADI : Events are moving fast...too fast.
MACE WINDU : Go with the Queen to Naboo and discover the identity of the
dark warrior. That is the clue we need to unravel this mystery of the Sith.

YODA : Young Skywalker's fate will be decided later.
QUI-GON : I brought Anakin here; he must stay in my charge. He has nowhere
else to go.
MACE WINDU : He is your ward, Qui-Gon...we will not dispute that.
YODA : Train him not. Take him with you, but train him not!
MACE WINDU : Protect the Queen, but do not intercede if it comes to war
until we have the Senate's approval.
YODA : May the Force be with you.

OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, and ANAKIN leave.

EXT. CORUSCANT - SENATE LANDING PLATFORM - NIGHT

QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, and ANAKIN stand on the landing platform outside the
ship. ARTOO whistles a happy tune as he leans over the edge of the
platform, watching the traffic. Suddenly, he leans over too far and falls
overboard. After a moment, he reappears, using his on-board jets to propel
himself back onto the landing platform. The wind whips at ANAKIN as he
listens to the JEDI.

OBI-WAN : It is not disrespect, Master, it is the truth.
QUI-GON : From your point of view....
OBI-WAN : The boy is dangerous...they all sense it. Why can't you?
QUI-GON : His fate is uncertain, not dangerous. The Council will decide
Anakin's future...that should be enough for you. Now get on board!
OBI-WAN reluctantly boards the Naboo spacecraft followed by ARTOO. QUI-GON
goes over to ANAKIN.
ANAKIN : Master Qui-Gon, sir, I do not wish to be a problem.
QUI-GON : You won't be, Annie....I'm not allowed to train you, so I want
you to watch me and be mindful...always remember, your focus determines
your reality. Stay close to me and you will be safe.
ANAKIN : Master, sir...I've been wondering...what are midi-chlorians?
QUI-GON : Midi-chlorians are a microcopic lifeform that reside within all
living cells and communicates with the Force.
ANAKIN : They live inside of me?
QUI-GON : In your cells. We are symbionts with the midi-chlorians.
ANAKIN : Symbionts?
QUI-GON : Life forms living together for mutual advantage. Without the
midi-chlorians, life could not exist, and we would have no knowledge of the
Force. They continually speak to you, telling you the will of the Force.
ANAKIN : They do??
QUI-GON : When you learn to quiet your mind, you will hear them speaking to
you.
ANAKIN : I don't understand.
QUI-GON : With time and training, Annie...you will.

Two taxis pull up, and CAPTAIN PANAKA, SENATOR PALPATINE, TWENTY OR SO
TROOPS, GUARDS, and OFFICERS walk briskly toward the ship, followed by
QUEEN AMIDALA, PADME, EIRTAE, and finally, JAR JAR. AMIDALA and her
HANDMAIDENS stop before the JEDI.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) Your Highness, it is our pleasure to continue to serve
and protect you.
AMIDALA : I welcome your help. Senator Palpatine fears the Federation means
to destroy me.
QUI-GON : I promise you, I will not let that happen.

AMIDALA enters the ship, followed by her HANDMAIDENS. JAR JAR hugs QUI-GON
and ANAKIN.

JAR JAR : Wesa goen home!

They ALL move onto the ship. The ship takes off.

INT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM - THEED - NIGHT

NUTE and RUNE stand before a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS.

DARTH SIDIOUS : The Queen is on her way to you. I regret she is of no
further use to us. When she gets there, destroy her.
NUTE : Yes, my Lord.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Viceroy, is the planet secure?
NUTE : Yes, my Lord, we have taken over the last pockets of primitive life
forms. We are in complete control of the planet now.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Good. I will see to it that in the Senate, things stay as
they are. I am sending Darth Maul to join you. He will deal with the Jedi.
NUTE : Yes, my Lord.

DARTH SIDIOUS fades off.

RUNE : A Sith lord here with us?!!

INT. SPACE - NABOO SPACECRAFT COCKPIT

ANAKIN stands next to the PILOT, RIC OLIE, pointing to various buttons and
gauges.

ANAKIN : ...and that one?
RIC OLIE : The forward stabalizer.
ANAKIN : And those control the pitch?
RIC OLIE : You catch on pretty quick.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - QUEEN'S CHAMBERS

SABE and EIRTAE stand behind QUEEN AMIDALA as she talks with QUI-GON and
CAPTAIN PANAKA. OBI-WAN and JAR JAR watch.

CAPT. PANAKA : The moment we land the Federation will arrest you, and force
you to sign the treaty.
QUI-GON : I agree...I'm not sure what you hope to accomplish by this.
AMIDALA : I'm going to take back what's ours.
CAPT. PANAKA : There are only twelve of us, Your Highness....we have no
army.
QUI-GON : I cannot fight a war for you, Your Highness, only protect you.
AMIDALA : Jar Jar Binks!

JAR JAR looks around, puzzled.

JAR JAR : Mesa, Your Highness?
AMIDALA : Yes. I need your help.

INT. NABOO CRUISER COCKPIT - DAY

The Naboo Cruiser heads toward the lush green planet. There is only one
Federation battle cruiser orbiting. OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN PANAKA spot it on
the view screen.

PANAKA : The blockade's gone.
OBI-WAN : The war's over...No need for it now.
RIC OLIE : I have one battleship on my scope.
OBI-WAN : A droid control ship.
PANAKA : They've probably spotted us.
OBI-WAN ; We haven't much time.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - MAIN HOLD

The QUEEN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, TROOPS, and HANDMAIDENS get ready to disembark
as the ship alnds. The elevator door slides open, and ANAKIN emerges into
the hold area. He see PADME and run up to her.

ANAKIN : Hi! Where have you been?
PADME : Annie! What are you doing here?
ANAKIN : I'm with Qui-Gon...but...they're not going to let me be a Jedi.
I'm too old.
PADME : This is going to be dangerous, Annie.
ANAKIN : Is it? I can help... Where are we going?
PADME : To war, I'm afraid. The Queen has had to make the most difficuld
decision of her life. She doesn't believe in fighting, Annie. We are a
peaceful people...
ANAKIN : I want to help...I'm glad you're back.

ANAKIN smiles. PADME smiles back.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP - DAY

The Naboo spacecraft has landed in the Gungan swamp. TROOPS unload the
ships in the background as OBI-WAN approaches QUI-GON.

OBI-WAN : Jar Jar is on his way to the Gungan city, Master.

QUI-GON's thoughts are elsewhere.

QUI-GON : Good.

OBI-WAN and QUI-GON stand silently for a moment.

OBI-WAN : Do you think the Queen's idea will work?
QUI-GON : The Gungans will not easily be swayed, and we cannot use our
power to help her.
OBI-WAN : I'm...I'm sorry for my behavior, Master. It is not my place to
disagree with you about the boy. I am grateful you think I am ready for the
trials.

QUI-GON looks at him for a long moment.

QUI-GON : You have been a good apprentice. You are much wiser than Iam,
Obi-Wan. I foresee you will become a great Jedi Knight.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP - UNDERWATER - DAY (FX)

JAR JAR swims down into Bubble City.

INT. OTOH GUNGA - CITY SQUARE

JAR JAR enters the main square of the bubble city. He stands, stunned, in
amazement and fear. He is nervous and shaking.

JAR JAR : Ello! Where das everybody?

The plaza is empty. He notices that many of the buildings are shot up as if
there had been a battle of some kind.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP LAKE - DAY

JAR JAR exits the swamp lake and walks over to QUEEN AMIDALA, CAPTAIN
PANAKA, OBI-WAN, and QUI-GON. PADME, EIRTAE, RABE, ANAKIN, and ARTOO,
FOUR
PILOTS, and EIGHT GUARDS stand in the background near the starship.

JAR JAR : Dare-sa nobody dare. All gone. Some kinda fight, I tink. Sorry,
no Gungas...no Gungas.
CAPT. PANAKA : Do you think they have been taken to camps?
OBI-WAN : More likely they were wiped out.
JAR JAR : No...mesa no tink so. Gungan hiden. When in trouble, go to sacred
place. Mackineeks no find them dare.
QUI-GON : Do you know where they are?

EXT. NABOO SWAMP - DAY

The GROUP follows JAR JAR as he moves through the swamp. JAR JAR stops and
sniffs the air. The GROUP stop behind him.

JAR JAR : Dissen it.

JAR JAR makes a strange chattering noise. Suddenly, out of nowhere, CAPTAIN
TARPALS and SIX OTHER GUNGAN TROOPS riding on KAADUS emerge from the brush.

JAR JAR : (Cont'd) Heyo-dalee, Captain Tarpals.
CAPT. TARPALS : Binks!! Noah gain!
JAR JAR : We comen to see da boss.

CAPTIAN TARPALS rolls his eyes.

CAPT. TARPALS : Ouch time, Binks... Ouch time for all-n youse.

EXT. NABOO SACRED TEMPLE RUINS - DAY

JAR JAR, QUEEN AMIDALA, ANAKIN, ARTOO, QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, PADME, RABE,
EIRTAE, and the rest of her group are led through a clearing full of GUNGAN
refugees. At the far end are the ruins of a grand temple with massive
carved heads. BOSS NASS and several other COUNCIL MEMBERS walk out on the
top of a three-quarter-submerged head.

BOSS NASS : Jar Jar, yousa payen dis time. Who's da uss-en others??

QUEEN AMIDALA steps forward. CAPTAIN PANAKA and the JEDI stand behind her.

AMIDALA : I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo...I come before you in peace.
BOSS NASS : Naboo biggen. Yousa bringen da Mackineeks... Dya busten uss-en
omm. Yousa all bombad. Yousa all die'n, mesa tink.

CAPTAIN PANAKA and HALF A DOZEN GUARDS and PILOTS look around nervously,
and the GUNGAN TROOPS lower their long power poles. The JEDI stay relaxed.
ANAKIN watches everything with great interest.

AMIDALA : We wish to form an alliance...

Suddenly, PADME steps forward.

PADME : Your Honor...

ARTOO whistles a quiet "uh oh."

BOSS NASS : Whosa dis?
PADME : I am Queen Amidala (points to Queen) This is my decoy...my
protection...my loyal bodyguard.

ANAKIN is stunned. OBI-WAN and QUI-GON give each other a knowing look.

PADME : (Cont'd) ...I am sorry for my deception, but under the
circumstances it has become necessary to protect myself. Although we do not
always agree, Your Honor, our two great societies have always lived in
peace...until now. The Trade Federation has destroyed all that we have
worked so hard to build. You are in hiding, my people are in camps. If we
do not act quickly, all will be lost forever...I ask you to help us...no, I
beg you to help us.

PADME drops to her knees and prostrates herself before BOSS NASS. There is
a gasp from CAPTAIN PANAKA, HIS TROOPS, and the HANDMAIDENS.

PADME : (Cont'd) We are your humble servants...our fate is in your hands.

Slowly, CAPTAIN PANAKA and his TROOPS bow down before the GUNGAN COUNCIL.
Then the HANDMAIDENS, ANAKIN, and finally the JEDI. The GUNGANS are puzzled
by this. BOSS NASS begins to laugh.

BOSS NASS : Yousa no tinken yousa greater den da Gungans.. Mesa like dis.
Maybe wesa bein friends.

INT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM - DAY

NUTE, RUNE, and DARTH MAUL walk with a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS.

NUTE : ...we've sent out patrols. We've already located their starship in
the swamp....It won't be long, My Lord.
DARTH SIDIOUS : This is an unexpected move for her. It's too aggresive..
Lord Maul, be mindful.
DARTH MAUL : Yes, my Master.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Be patient... Let them make the first move.

EXT. NABOO EDGE OF SWAMP/ GRASS PLAINS - DAY

A GUNGAN SENTRY sits on top of the ancient temple heah, searching the
landscape with a pair of electrobinoculars. He sees something and yells
down to ANAKIN at the foot of the statue.

GUNGAN LOOKOUT : Daza comen!
ANAKIN : All right. They're here!

ANAKIN yells and runs over to PADME and the JEDI, who are discussing a
battle plan with FIVE GUNGAN GENERALS. SABE and EIRTAE stand nearby. BOSS
NASS puts his arm around JAR JAR.

BOSS NASS : Yousa doen grand. Jar Jar bringen da Naboo together.
JAR JAR : Oh, no, no, no...
BOSS NASS : So, wesa maken yousa Bombad General.
JAR JAR : General??! Oh, no..

JAR JAR's eyes roll back, his tongue flops out and he faints.
FOUR SPEEDERS pull up to the GROUP. CAPTAIN PANAKA and a DOZEN OR SO
GUARDS
and PILOT pile out and join the group.

PADME : What is the situation?
CAPT. PANAKA : Almost everyone's in camps. A few hundred police and guards
have formed an underground movement. I brought as many of the keaders as I
could. The Federation Army's also much larger than we thought, and much
stronger. Your Highness, this is a battle I do not think we can win.
PADME : The battle is a diversion. The Gungans must draw theDroid Army away
from the cities. We can enter the city using the secret passages on the
waterfall side. Once we get to the main entrance, Captain Pnaka will create
a diversion, so that we can enter the palace and capture the Viceroy.
Without the Viceroy, they will be lost and confused.

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN look on with interest.

PADME : (Cont'd) What do you think, Master Jedi?
QUI-GON : The Viceroy will be well guarded.
CAPT. PANAKA : The difficulty's getting into the throne room. Once we're
inside, we shouldn't have a problem.
QUI-GON : There is a possibility with this diversion many Gungans will be
killed.
BOSS NASS : Wesa ready to do are-sa part.

JAR JAR smiles a very worried and sheepish grin. ANAKIN watches with
interest, as does ARTOO.

PADME : We have a plan which should immobilize the Droid Army. We will send
what pilots we have to knock out the Droid control ship which is orbiting
the planet. If we can get past their rayshields, we can sever communication
and their droids will be helpless.
QUI-GON : A well-conceived plan. However, there's great risk. The weapons
on your fighters may not penetrate the shields on the control ship.
OBI-WAN : And there's an even bigger danger. If the Vicroy escapes, Your
Highness, he will return with another droid army.
PADME : That is why we must not fail to get to the Viceroy. Everything
depends on it.

INT. THEED - PALACE - THRONE ROOM - DAY

NUTE, RUNE, DARTH MAUL, OOM-9, and a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS walk through
the throne room.

DARTH SIDIOUS : ...she is more foolish than I thought.
NUTE : We are sending all available troops to meet this army of hers
assembling near the swamp. It appears to be made up of primitives. We do
not expect much resistance.
OOM-9 : I am increasing security at all Naboo detention camps.
DARTH MAUL : I feel there is more to this, My Master. The two Jedi may be
using the Queen for their own purposes.
DARTH SIDIOUS : The Jedi cannot become involved. They can only protect the
Queen. Even Qui-Gon Jinn will not break that conenant.... This will work to
our advantage...
NUTE : I have your approval to proceed then, My Lord.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Proceed. Wipe them put...all of them. INT. NABOO SWAMP LAKE
- DAY (FX)

All is peaceful. SMALL CRITTERS drink out of a large swamp lake. Suddenly
there is a disturbance in the middle of the lake. A rush of bubbles, then a
GUNGAN SOLDIER riding a KAADU emerges from the water, followed by SEVERAL
OTHERS. FROGS and OTHER LITTLE ANIMALS flee in all directions as the GUNGAN
ARMY marches through the swamp. The KAADU shake themselves off as they exit
the lake. When JAR JAR's KAADU shakes off, JAR JAR falls off.
SOLDIERS on huge, lizard-like FAMBAAS with large shield generators mounted
on their backs follow the marching WARRIORS. The GUNGAN ARMY heads out of
the swamp and onto the rolling grassy hills.
HUNDREDS OF GUNGAN WARRIORS march in lon lines toward the horizon.
Federation tanks move up to a ridge and stop. In the distance they see the
GUNGAN ARMY marching toward them. The GUNGAN GENERAL CEEL sees the tanks on
the ridge and orders a halt. The GUNGANS are spread out in a large line.
JAR JAR is nervous. GENERAL CEEL signals to the shield operators.

GENERAL CEEL : Energize the shields.

A red ray shoots out of the generator and blasts into a large dish on the
back of a second FAAMBA and spreads like an umbrella over the assembled
WARRIORS.

EXT. THEED - CENTRAL PLAZA - DAY

PADME, followed by EIRTAE, OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, ANAKIN, and ARTOO, stealthily
makes her way toward the entrance to the main hanger. They are followed by
about TWENTY NABOO GUARDS, PILOTS, and TROOPS. They stop, and PADME uses a
small red laser light to signal across the plaza to CAPTAIN PANAKA, RABE
and TWENTY OTHER ASSORTED NABOO TROOPS. They signal back. QUI-GON leans
over to ANAKIN.

QUI-GON : Once we get inside, Annie, you find a safe placeto hide and stay
there.
ANAKIN : Sure.
QUI-GON : And stay there!

DROID TROOPS mill about the tank-filled plaza. At the far end of the plaza,
SEVERAL DROIDS begin to run and fire. NABOO SOLDIERS begin to fire back at
the BATTLE DROIDS.
As the ruckus erupts at one end of the plaza, PADME and her TROOPS rush
into the main hanger. CAPTAIN PANAKA and HIS SOLDIERS continue to engage
the DROIDS outside.

INT. THEED - CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

ALARMS ARE SOUNDING a PADME, the JEDI, ANAKIN, EIRTAE, and PADME's TROOPS
rush into the hanger. BATTLE DROIDS begin firing at them as they run for
cover. ANAKIN runs under a Naboo fighter. The JEDI deflect bolts aimed at
PADME back onto the BATTLE DROIDS, causing them to EXPLODE.

INT. THEED - PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY

NUTE, RUNE, and FOUR COUNCIL MEMBERS watch the plaza battle on a large view
screen.

NUTE : I thought the battle was going to take place far from here...this is
too close!
RUNE : What is going on?

DARTH MAUL enters the throne room.

DARTH MAUL : I told you there was more to this...the Jedi are involved.

EXT. NABOO GRASS PLAINS - DAY (FX)

The Federation tanks begin to fire on the GUNGANS, but they are protected
by their energy shield. The tanks stop firing, and the GUNGANS CHEER, until
they see the doors to the massive transports open, and racks of BATTLE
DROIDS are pulled out and lined up by a squad of STAPS.
The BATTLE DROIDS reconfigure into their standing position. The GUNGANS get
ready for an attack. OOM-9 gives the command to move forward, and THOUSANDS
OF DROIDS march toward the GUNGANS.
The GUNGANS power up their weapons. The DROIDS slowly march through the
protective shield and start firing. The GUNGANS throw their power poles and
fling small balls of energy with slingshots. The WARRIORS dump large balls
of energy into mortars that heat up and fire the energy goo onto the BATTLE
DROIDS, causing them to short out.
The battle rages and the GUNGANS defend their shield generators against the
ARMY OF DROIDS. OOM-9 watches from a tank on a hill overlooking the battle.

INT. THEED - CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

ANAKIN hides behind one of the Naboo fighters, ducking as large bolts whiz
past and EXPLODE near him. PADME and the TWO JEDI destroy BATTLE DROIDS
right and left. The QUEEN'S TROOPS and EIRTAE also blast away at the
DROIDS. PADME signals to her pilots.

PADME : Get to your ships!

The PILOTS and ARTOO UNITS run for the Naboo fighter craft stacked in the
hanger bay. ONE OF THE PILOTS jumps into a fighter right above where ANAKIN
is hiding.

FIGHTER PILOT : Better find a new hiding place, kid. I'm taking this ship.

The ship begins to levitate out of the hanger. BATTLE DROIDS fire at it as
it falls in behind five other fighters. ARTOO whistles to ANAKIN from a
second fighter not far away. ANAKIN runs and jumps into the second fighter
to hide.

EXT. THEED - CENTRAL PLAZA - DAY (FX)

Two Naboo starfighters exit the main hanger. A tank fires at them, hitting
one of them, which causes it to pinwheel into the ground and EXPLODE.

INT. THEED - CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

CAPTAIN PANAKA, SABE and NABOO TROOPS rush into the hanger and overwlm the
few remaining BATTLE DROIDS. PADME, OBI-WAN, and QUI-GON join forces with
CAPTAIN PANAKA.

PADME : My guess is the Viceroy is in the throne room.

She looks to QUI-GON.

QUI-GON : I agree.

They start to head for the exit, on the way passing the fighter where
ANAKIN is hiding. ARTOO whistles a greeting as ANAKIN peeps out of the
cockpit.

ANAKIN : Hey! Wait for me.
QUI-GON : No, Annie, you stay there. Stay right where you are.
ANAKNI : But, I...
QUI-GON : Stay in that cockpit.

They head for the exit. As they are about to go through the door, suddenly
everyone scatters, revealing DARTH MAUL standing in the doorway. CAPTAIN
PANAKA, PADME, and HER TROOPS back away. QUI-GON and OBI-WAN step forward.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) We'' handle this...

The TWO JEDI take off their capes and ignite their laser swords. DARTH MAUL
takes off his cape, and ignites his laser sword. Both ends of the sword
light up.
At the far end of the hanger, SIX WHEEL DROIDS roll in and transform into
their battle position. ARTOO calls ANAKIN's attention to the DROIDS. The
JEDI begin to fight the Sith Lord.

ANAKIN : Oh, no...

The DROIDS begin to advance and start firing on PADME and HER TROOPS.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) We gotta do something, Artoo.

ARTOO whistles a reply. Suddenly, the ship's systems go on, and the ship
begins to levitate.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) All right, thanks Artoo! Great idea! I'll take over.
Let's see...

ANAKIN steers the ship toward the DROIDS. He pushes a button, and the ship
begins to shake.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Where's the trigger? Oops, wrong one.. Maybe this one....

ANAKIN pushes a second button, and the lasers begin to fire, wiping out
several DESTROYER DROIDS. ARTOO whistles a cheer.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Yeah, all right. "Droid blaster." Yeah!

The JEDI are engaged in a fierce sword fight with DARTH MAUL. They have
moved into the center of the hanger. While the WHEEL DROIDS are momentarily
distracted by ANAKIN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, PADME, and HER TROOPS exit into a
palace hallway.
The WHEEL DROIDS start firing at ANAKIN. There are EXPLOSIONS all around
him.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Oops...shield up! Always on the right...shields always on
the right.

ANAKIN flips several switches, and the after-burner ignites.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I know we're moving. I'll shut the energy drive down.

The fighter rockets out of the hanger. ARTOO and ANAKIN hold on for dear
life.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Oops!! Wrong one.

ARTOO beeps.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I'm not doing anything!

ARTOO beeps.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I know...I didn't push anything.

The SITH LORD's moves are incredible. He is fighting the TWO JEDI at once,
flipping into the air, outmaneuvering them at every turn.

INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT - SPACE

The Naboo fleet leaves the planet and heads toward the space station.

RIC OLIE : Bravo Flight A, take on the fighters. Flight B, make the run on
the transmitter.
BRAVO TWO : Roger, Bravo Leader.

The fleet approaches the space station. Many Federation fighters exit the
hangers and attack.

RIC OLIE : Enemy fighters straight ahead!

EXT. NABOO GRASS PALINS - DAY

JAR JAR's clumsiness works for him in the battle. He gets caught up in the
wiring of a blasted DROID, dragging the torso around with him, the DROID's
gun firing randomly, accidently blasting SEVERAL DROIDS in one process.
OOM-9 decides to send in the WHEEL DROIDS and gives the signal. HUNDREDS OF
WHEEL DROIDS roll out of the transports and head down toward the battle.
They slowly roll through the deflector shields, then transform themselves
once they get on the other side. The GUNGANS blast the WHEEL DROIDS with
energy balls. The DESTROYER DROIDS blast many GUNGANS.

INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT - SPACE

A giant dogfight ensues. ANAKIN's fighter flies into space above Naboo.
ARTOO beeps a worried concern.

ANAKIN : The Autopilot is searching for what other ships?

ARTOO beeps and whistles.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) There is no manual override, Artoo. You'll have to rewire
it or something.

ARTOO chirps that he's trying.

ANAKIN : (cont'd) Look! There they are! That's where the autopilot is
taking us.

ANAKIN's fighter flies toward the Federation Battleship.

INT. THEED - CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

The SITH LORD drives the JEDI out of the hanger and nto the power generator
area next door.

INT. THEED - POWER GENERATOR PIT - DAY

Three swords are crossed in an intense display of swordmanship. The JEDI
and the SITH LORD fight their way across the narrow bridge of the Theed
power generator. DARTH MAUL jumps onto the bridge above them. The JEDI
follow, one in front of the SITH LORD and one behind. They continue their
sword fight.

INT. THEED - PALACE - HALLWAY - DAY

PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, EIRTAE, SABE and THIER TROOPS are trapped in a
hallway by BATTLE DROIDS.

PADME : We don't have time for this, Captain.
CAPT. PANAKA : Let's try the outside stairway.

CAPTAIN PANAKA blasts a hole in the window, and they make their way outside
the building onto a ledge about six stories above a raging waterfall. SABE,
EIRTAE and about TWENTY NABOO SOLDIERS stay in the hallway to hold off the
BATTLE DROIDS.

EXT. THEED - PALACE - OVER WATERFALL - DAY

PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and about TEN OTHER NABOO SOLDIERS are lined up
along the edge. They have pulled small attachments out of their pistols and
fire at a ledge about four stories above them. Thin cables shoot out of the
pistols and are embedded into the ledge. PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and the
OTHERS begin to climb up the wall.

EXT . NABOO GRASS PLAINS DAY

The GUNGAN ARMY is no match for the DESTROYER DROIDS. JAR JAR tries to run
from the BATTLE DROIDS.

GENERAL CEEL : Retreat! Retreat!

The GUNGANS begin to turn and run, on foot, on their kaadu, and in wagons.
JAR JAR attempts to escape on a wagon of energy balls but only manages to
unhitch the back gate, causing all of the energy balls to roll out of the
wagon and down the hill. JAR JAR scrambles to avoid being hit by one of the
balls. FOUR DESTROYER DROIDS aren't so lucky. They get blasted by the
energy balls.
The GUNGANS renew their attack on the DROID ARMY. JAR JAR's bumbling
destroys several more DESTROYER DROIDS.

INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT -SPACE

ANAKIN finds himself in the middle of the space battle. A ship explodes
behind him (over his left shoulder).

ANAKIN : Whoo, boy! This is tense!

He looks forward to see enemy ships approaching head on.

ANAKN : (Cont'd) : Oops! Artoo, get us off Autopilot!

ARTOO screams a reply.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I've got control?

ANAKIN fips switches.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Okay, let's go left!

He moves the controls left and the ship responds, turning left.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Yes...I've got control. You did it, Artoo!

ARTOO beeps

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Go back!?! Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit and
that's what I'm gonna do. Now c'mon!

An enemy fighter comes into his sights. ANAKIN pushes the controls and
instead of firing, his fighter accelerates past the enemy ship.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Oops! Whoa!

Now the enemy ship is on his tail. He tries evasive maneauvers.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I'll try spinning, that's a good trick.

ANAKIN rolls the ship as ARTOO screams desperately.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I know we're in trouble! Hang on! The way out of this
mess is the way we got into it.

ARTOO beeps a reply.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Which one? This one?

ANAKIN yanks on the reverse thrusters and the ship slows instantly- the
enemy fighter shoots past and explodes against the space station.

INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT - SPACE

The SQUADRON attacks the space station.

RIC OLIE : Bravo flight...go for the central bridge.
BRAVO TWO : ROger, Bravo Leader.

The attack is fruitless.

RIC OLIE : Their deflector shield is too strong. We'll never get through
it.

Meanwhile, ANAKIN is being chased by another fighter. ARTOO shrieks.

ANAKIN : I know, Artoo! This isn't Podracing!

The enemy ship fires and hits ANAKIN's fighter, sending it into a spin.
ARTOO screams.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) We're hit!

ANAKIN regains control as his ship enters the space station hanger.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Great gobs of bantha poo-doo!

ANAKIN's ship dodges parked transport ships and other obstacles. A huge
bulkhead blocks his way. ARTOO beeps.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I'm trying to stop! I'm trying to stop! Whoa!

ANAKIN hits the reverse thrusters and the ship skids to a stop on the
hanger deck. ARTOO givesout a worried whistle.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) All right! All right! Get the system started!

ANAKIN ducks down to adjust a control panel.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Everything's overheated. All the lights are red.

ARTOO sees DROIDS appraoching, and beeps frantically.

INT. THEED - POWER GENERATOR PIT - DAY

The laser sword battle continues on the small catwalk around the vast power
pit. DARTH MAUL kicks OBI-WAN off one of the ramps and he falls several
levels. QUI-GON knocks the DARK LORD off another ramp, and he lands hard on
a ramp two levels below. QUI-GON jumps down after him. The DARK LORD backs
away along the catwalk into a small door. QUI-GON follows as OBI-WAN runs
to catch up.

INT. THEED - POWER GENERATOR ELECRIC BEAM - HALLWAY

The SITH LORD, followed by QUI-GON, enters a long hallway filled with a
series of deadly rays that go on and off in a pulsing pattern that shoots
down the corridor every minute or so. DARTH MAUL makes it down several
walls of deadly rays before they close. QUI-GON is one wall away from the
DARK LORD. OBI-WAN is just starting into it and is five walls way from
DARTH MAUL.
The JEDI must wait until the next pulse to advance down the corridor.
OBI-WAN is impatient and paces, waiting for the wall of rays to open.
QUI-GON sits and meditates. The SITH LORD tries to patch up his wounds.

INT. THEED - PALACE - HALLWAY TO THRONE ROOM

A window in the hallway blasts apart. PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and HER
SOLDIERS climb into the hallway. They head for the door to the throne roo.
Suddenly, two DESTROYER DROIDS skitter in front of the door. PADME turns
around and sees TWO MORE appear at the far end of the hallway, trapping
them in the middle.
PADME throws down her pistol and turns to CAPTAIN PANAKA.

PADME : Throw down your weapons. They win this round.
CAPT. PANAKA : But we can't....
PADME : Captain, I said throw down your weapons.

CAPTAIN PANAKA and HIS MEN throw down their weapons.

EXT. NABOO GRASS PLAINS - DAY

A DESTROYER DROID blasts one of the shield generators, causing it to
EXPLODE. The protective shield begins to weaken and fall apart.OOM-9 sees
the shield weaken and orders his tanks forward. The GUNGAN GENERAL signals
a retreat as the tanks enter the battle.
The GUNGANS flee as fast as they can. JAR JAR is blown off his KAADU and
lands on one of the tank guns. A GUNGAN WARRIOR signals JAR JAR to jump
off. JAR JAR is afraid. The gun swings around trying to knock JAR JAR off.
JAR JAR hangs from the tank barrel as it moves along. Finally, he jumps
onto a KAADU behind a GUNGAN WARRIOR. EXPLOSIONS from the tank fire are
everywhere. It is chaos.

INT. THEED - POWER GENERATOR ELECTRIC BEAM - HALLWAY

The electric rays cycle as QUI-GON sits meditating. The wall of the deadly
rays turn away, and OBI-WAN starts running toward QUI-GON and the DARK
LORD. When the wall between QUI-GON and DARTH MAUL opens, QUI-GON is in a
split second fighting the DARK LORD with a ferocity not seen before. They
move into the area at the end of the corridor called the melting pit, a
small area that is mostly made up of a deep hole.
The electron ray gates begin to close. OBI-WAN tries to make it to the
melting pit but is caught one gate short. He slides to a stop just before
he hits the deadly electron field.
QUI-GON and DARTH MAUL battle around the melting pit as a frustrated
OBI-WAN watches.
DARTH MAUL cathces QUI-GON off guard. The SITH makes a quick move, bashes
his lightsaber handle into QUI-GON's chin, and runs him through. QUI-GON
slumps to the floor in a heap.

EXT. NABOO GRASS PLAINS - DAY

The GUNGANS have beeb overrun. Some flee into the hills, chased by BATTLE
DROIDS on STAPS. Many OTHERS are herded into groups by BATTLE DROIDS and
DESTROYER DROIDS.
JAR JAR and GENERAL CEEL are held in a small group with OTHER OFFICERS.

JAR JAR : Dissa bad, berry bombad.
GENERAL CEEL : Mesa hopen dissa working for da Queen.

INT. THED - PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY

PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and SIX OTHER OFFICERS are brought by TEN BATTLE
DROIDS before NUTE and RUNE and FOUR NEIMOIDIAN COUNCIL MEMBERS.

NUTE : Your little insurrection is at an end, Your Highness. Time for you
to sign the treaty...and end this pointless debate in the Senate.

SADBE dressed like the Queen appears in the doorway with SEVERAL TROOPS.
Several destroyed battle droids can be seen in the distance.

SABE : I will not be signing any treaty, Viceroy, because you've lost!

NUTE and THE OTHERS are stunned to see a SECOND QUEEN. NUTE yells at the
TEN GUARDS in the room.

NUTE : After her! This one is a decoy!

SIX OF THE DROIDS rush out of the throne room after SABE. NUTE turns to
PADME.

NUTE : (Cont'd) Your Queen will not get away with this.

PADME slumps down on her throne and immediately hits a security button that
opens a panel in her desk opposite CAPTAIN PANAKA.
PADME grabs two pistols, tosses one of the to CAPTAIN PANAKA and one to an
OFFICER. She takes a third pistol and BLASTS the last of the BATTLE DROIDS.
The OFFICERS rush to the door control panel as PADME hits the switch to
close the door. The OFFICER at the door jams the controls. CAPTAIN PANAKA
throws more pistols to the OTHER GUARDS. The NEIMODIANS are confused and
afraid.

PADME : Now, Viceroy, this is the end of your occupation here.
NUTE : Don't be absurd. There are too few of you. It won't be long before
hundreds of destroyer droids break in to rescue us.

INT. THEED - POWER GENERATOR - MELTING PIT

OBI-WAN screams as the pulsing electron gate opens, and the SITH LORD
attacks him. The DARK LORD is relentless in his assault on the young JEDI.
OBI-WAN and DARTH MAUL use the Force to fling objects at each other as they
fight. DARTH MAUL seems to have the upper hand as OBI-WAN grows weary.
DARTH MAUL catches OBI-WAN off guard, and the JEDI slips into a melting
pit. He is barely able to hold onto a nozzle on the side of the pit. DARTH
MAUL grin evilly at OBI-WAN as he kicks OBI-WAN's lightsaber down the
endless shaft.
The SITH LORD smiles as he goes in for the kill. At the last moment,
OBI-WAN jumps up out of the pit, calls QUI-GON's lightsaber to hi, throwing
DARTH MAUL off. The young JEDI swings with a vengeance, cutting the SITH
down. DARTH MAUL falls into the melting pit to his death.
OBI-WAN rushes over to QUI-GON, who is dying.

OBI-WAN : Master! Master!
QUI-GON : It is too late...It's...
OBI-WAN : No!
QUI-GON : Obi-Wan promise...promise me you'll train the boy...
OBI-WAN : Yes, Master...
QUI-GON : He is the chosen one...he will...bring balance...train him!

QUI-GON dies. OBI-WAN cradles his Master, quietly weeping.

INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT - FEDERATION HANGER

ANAKIN peeks over the edge of the cockpit to see BATTLE DROIDS surrounding
the ship. He ducks back down.

ANAKIN : Uh oh. This is not good.

He looks at the dashboard to see red lights.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) The systems are still overheated, Artoo.

The BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN walks up to the ship and sees ARTOO.

BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN : Where's your pilot?

ARTOO beeps a reply.

BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN : (Cont'd) You're the pilot?

ARTOO whistles.

BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN : (Cont'd) Let me see your identification!

ANAKIN sees the dashboard lights go from red to green.

ANAKIN : Yes...we have ignition.

He flips the switch and the engine starts.

BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN : (seeing Anakin) You! Come out of there or we'll
blast you!
ANAKIN : Not if I can help it! Shields up!

ANAKIN flips a switch and the ship levitates, knocking over the BATTLE
DROID CAPTAIN. The OTHER DROIDS shoot, but the lasers are deflected by
ANAKIN's shields. ARTOO beeeps.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) This should stop them.

ANAKIN fires lasers as the ship begins to rotate.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) ...and take this!

He presses a button and launches two torpedos which miss the DROIDS.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Darn...I missed!

The two torpedos fly down a hallway and explode inside the reactor room.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Let's get out of here!

ANAKIN's ship roars through the hanger deck, bouncing over the DROIDS.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Now, this is Podracing! Whoopee!

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

TEY HOW turns to CAPTAIN DOFINE.

RIC OLIE : I don't know, we didn't hit it.
BRAVO THREE : Look! One of ours! Outta the main hold!!

EXT. NABOO GRASS PLAINS - DAY

Suddenly, all of the DROIDS begin to shake upside down, run around in

RIC OLIE and the OTHER PILOTS gather around as thye exit their ships.

BRAVO TWO : He flew into the hold, behind the deflector shield and blasted
the main reactor...
BRAVO THREE : Amazing... They don't teach that in the academy.

ANAKIN's ship skids to a stop behind the other Naboo starfighters. RIC
OLIE, BRAVO TWO, the OTHER PILOTS, and GROUND CREW rush to his ship.

RIC OLIE : We're all accounted for. Who flew that ship?

ANAKIN sheepishly opens the cockpit and stands up. All the PILOTS stare in
amazement.

ANAKIN : I'm not going to get into trouble, am I?

ARTOO beeps. oh. oh.

INT. MAIN HANGER - COURTYARD - DAY

The large, grand cruiser of the Supreme Chancellor lands in the courtyard
of the main hanger. CAPTAIN PANAKA and TWENTY TROOPS guard NUTE GUNRAY and

PADME : Now, Viceroy, you are going to have to go back to the Senate and
explain all this.
CAPT. PANAKA : I think you can kiss your Trade franchise goodbye.

The main ramp of the cruiser is lowered as OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN PANAKA lead

INT. TURRET ROOM - NABOO PALACE - LATE DAY

The sun streams into the multi-windowed room at a low angle. It is not
quite sunset. YODA paces before OBI-WAN, who is kneeling in the center of
the room.

YODA : Confer on you, the level of Jedi Knight the Coucil does. But agree
on you taking this boy as your Padawan learner, I do not.
OBI-WAN : Qui-Gon believed in him. I believe in Qui-Gon.
YODA : The Chosen One the boy may be; nevertheless, grave danger I fear in
his training.
OBI-WAN : Master Yoda, Igave Qui-Gon my word. I will train Anakin. Without
the approval of the Council if I must.
YODA : Qui-Gon's defiance I sense in you. Need that, you do not. Agree, the
council does. Your apprentice, young Skywalker will be.

JAR, BOSS NASS, and TWENTY OTHER GUNGAN WARRIORS watch. There is a drum
roll that stops. Doves are released, and the body is gone. ANAKIN looks to
OBI-WAN.

OBI-WAN : He is one with the Force, Anakin...You must let go.
ANAKIN : What will happen to me now?
OBI-WAN : I am your Master now. You will become a Jedi, I promise.

To one side, MACE WINDU turns to YODA.

MACE WINDU : There is no doubt. The mysterious warrior was a Sith.
YODA : Always two there are....no more...no less. A maste and an
apprentice.
MACE WINDU : But which one was destroyed, the master or the apprentice?

They give each other a concerned look.

               The wail of a siren grows out of the distance and very faintly 
               through the fog we see the headlights and flashing blue rack 
               lights of a police car coming toward us. It drops into a 
               dip, reappears almost immediately, hurtling down the center 
               of the deserted highway. It gets closer and closer until the 
               lights and siren fill our senses then zooms past us.

               INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT

               A frightened SECURITY GUARD is tensed forward off the back 
               seat, his hands clutched into the fabric between the two 
               regular POLICE OFFICERS in front.

                              (an edge of fear in 
                              his voice)
                         It's coming up... Slow down...
                              (he points out between 
                              them)
                         There, right there...

               Through the windshield we can see the headlights pick up a 
               billboard announcing a 'new' housing development.

               EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               The squad car skids off the asphalt in front of the sign and 
               starts up a rutted dirt road. The sign tells us we are headed 
               for 'Pinewood Estates,' a housing development financed by 
               the Farmers Bank of Wisconsin.

               INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT

               The Security Guard is becoming more agitated. He wipes a 
               cold sweat off his brow. The blue flashers reflect off the 
               fog onto the faces of the men. Suddenly the Security Guard 
               lunges forward and slaps off the rack lights and siren.

                                     OFFICER
                              (startled)
                         Benny, God, take it easy...

                                     BENNY (GUARD)
                         I don't want to scare them away.

               The two Police Officers exchange an indulgent look.

               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT

               Using only its parking lights, the police car creeps up the 
               dirt road between skeletons of unfinished houses.

               INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT

               The windows are rolled down. Periodically one of the men 
               leans out for a better look at the terrain around them.

                                     SECOND OFFICER
                         Smells smoke...

                                     BENNY
                         I told you.

               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT

               The police car comes around a curve on the hillside and stops. 
               Above them on the next hill, a necklace of embers from a 
               grass fire and a burning tree flicker through the fog. The 
               men get out of the car.

                                     BENNY
                              (loud whisper)
                         There!! Up on the hill!!

               The officer steps forward for a better look. Benny hangs on 
               his shoulder.

                                     BENNY
                         Right in line with that burning tree.

                                     OFFICER
                         I don't see anything.

                                     BENNY
                         It's there. The fog's thicker now, 
                         but it's there. What do you think 
                         started those fires?

               The officer strains to see through the fog.

                                     OFFICER
                         Benny, there's nothing there.

                                     BENNY
                         There is. They came out of the belly 
                         of the ship and then went to the 
                         first terrace and flew down into the 
                         houses.

                                     OFFICER
                         Flew?! Oh, come on Benny...

               The second officer is peering intently at something down 
               among the houses.

                                     OFFICER
                         You hear that, Mike? Now he's telling 
                         us...

                                     MIKE (SECOND OFFICER)
                         What's that?

               Benny and the officer look to where Mike is pointing. What 
               appears to be the beam of a powerful headlight bobs among 
               the houses below them. Further into the track another beam 
               of light moves slightly from right to left but seems otherwise 
               stationary.

                                     BENNY
                         What did I tell you?

                                     OFFICER
                         Probably kids.

               One of the lights rises over a house and settles on the other 
               side.

                                     MIKE
                              (not convinced)
                         Probably...

               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT

               A light shines directly into our eyes. As it swings away 
               from us we realize that it was the searchlight on the police 
               car which is idling along the dirt road with its running 
               lights off. The fire on the hill gives the fog down here a 
               red tint.

               INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT

               The police officers are beginning to feel anxious. Benny's 
               nervous fidgeting in the back seat doesn't help them any.

                                     BENNY
                         Don't you think you should call a 
                         backup?

                                     OFFICER
                         No, we can handle this.

               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT

               The police car passes a road perpendicular to the one it is 
               on. A couple of houses down that road a faint glow spills 
               over the sides of an industrial dumpster. As we watch we 
               hear an eerie high pitched whistle, a shaft of light slowly 
               rises out of the metal box and seems to fly off between the 
               houses.

               INT. FINISHED HOUSE - NIGHT

               As a humanoid silhouette passes in front of the picture 
               window, a shaft of light floats by in the fog outside. The 
               silhouette continues around to look at the kitchen. It raises 
               a hand to eye level. There is a sharp "SNAP" and a hard-edged 
               cone of light shoots out of the darkness to capture the inside 
               of the kitchen and pulls back a three-dimensional image of 
               stove, sink, cupboards, electrical fixtures and walls to the 
               silhouette.

               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT

               The police car is parked in the middle of the dirt road. 
               Benny and the officers are intent on a light that reaches 
               them only in strobes as it moves through the houses in the 
               direction of the fire on the hill. The police searchlight 
               swings onto the house.

                                     OFFICER
                              (over outside speakers)
                         This is the police. Identify 
                         yourselves.

               It is deathly silent.

               Carrying a shotgun the officer motions Benny and Mike to fan 
               out on either side of him and, guns drawn, they cut across 
               the tract to where they last saw the bobbing light.

               The fog quickly isolates them, heightening their fear. Each 
               man becomes acutely aware of the loudness of his breathing 
               and the crunch of his footsteps on the ground. They drift in 
               and out of visual contact with each other.

               Benny freezes as he hears a burst of the high pitched whistle 
               sweep by on his left. He turns slowly to see, through the 
               ribs of an unfinished house, a shaft of the white light 
               pointing at a cement mixer.

                                     BENNY
                              (to the officers, his 
                              voice cracking)
                         There's one over here...

               The brilliant light swings toward him. Benny, his hands 
               trembling, raises the gun.

                                     BENNY
                         Stop!! Police!!

               The light fixes on Benny and terrified he shakes off a couple 
               shots. The light goes out immediately.

                                     MIKE
                              (in Benny's direction)
                         What happened?

                                     BENNY
                         I think I shot one.

                                     MIKE
                         Jesus, Benny. What are you doing?

               INT. FINISHED HOUSE (BEDROOM) - NIGHT

               We are looking at the back of the humanoid figure. It crosses 
               to a high window and looks out. The reddish tinge of the fog 
               outlines him.

               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT

               The men strain to see something through the silent fog.

                                     OFFICER
                         You see anything, Mike?

               Before Mike can answer, a strange percussive clicking sound 
               is heard. He pumps a shell in the chamber of his shotgun and 
               swallowing his fear moves toward the voices. They stop.

                                     OFFICER
                         This is the police. Identify 
                         yourselves.

               Benny, his flashlight throwing a feeble beam in front of 
               him, inches around the house looking for what he shot at. He 
               gets to where it should be but it's not there. His light 
               searches the area. There is nothing but a stack of lumber. 
               Shaking visibly he shuffles to it and peers around its corner. 
               Nothing. Benny relaxes and allows himself to breathe again.

                                     BENNY
                              (shouts to the officers)
                         You wanna give me some help over 
                         here.

                                     MIKE
                         Okay...

               Benny continues around the house. He flashes his light into 
               a doorway. There is nothing but framing. When he moves on, a 
               figure steps out of the darkness to fill the space, then 
               raises its arms. With a sharp snap cylindrical devices swing 
               off its wrist into its hands.

               At the corner of the house Benny hears the snap and stops. 
               The high pitched whistle starts behind him. He stumbles around 
               to face a brilliant white light flying directly at him. Benny 
               screams in terror and fires at it. The light swerves and a 
               laser streak from one of the hand rockets sears Benny's chest 
               and knocks him to the ground in pain. Holding his shoulder 
               he watches the light rise and fall erratically between the 
               houses.

               The officers watch in awe as the beam wobbles through the 
               air, then crashes to the earth.

                                     OFFICER
                         Mike, call for back-up.
                              (shouting)
                         Benny, you all right?

                                     BENNY
                         I don't think so...
                              (clutching his shoulder)

                                     OFFICER
                              (waving the beam of 
                              his flashlight, shouts)
                         Benny, this is me. I'm going to take 
                         a look.

               Benny's beam flashes back.

                                     BENNY
                         Don't leave me. I'm coming.

               The two men begin to trot toward the light. It swings wildly 
               around and, accompanied by the high-pitched whistle, starts 
               to stagger back up the hill. Benny and the officer break 
               into a run. They are on their way up the hill when the light 
               in front of them crashes to the earth. It rolls over and 
               lays still, the beam shooting straight up into the air. Benny 
               and the officer slow their pursuit, terrified of what they 
               might find. Suddenly a high-pitched whistle is bearing down 
               on them from behind. Before they can turn a light rockets 
               over their heads. With a rumble the hill begins to vibrate. 
               As they follow its flight, they see lights beginning to ripple 
               to life across the skin of a saucer-shaped spacecraft resting 
               at the edge of the forest on top of the hill. With a rumble 
               the hill begins to vibrate. Frightened, the officers stop.

               INT. FINISHED HOUSE - NIGHT

               The humanoid figure walks rapidly down the hall into the 
               kitchen. An indistinct image plays on the inside of its 
               faceplate and we hear the faint sounds of a percussive 
               language. Through the window over the sink we can see the 
               lights of the spaceship.

               The rockets flip into the humanoid's gloved hands and it is 
               airborne out the open back door.

               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT

               From the road Benny and the officer watch as the humanoid 
               figure that just blasted over them flies between the trees 
               and into the white light emitting from the underbelly of the 
               spacecraft. The noise from the ship's power plant is deafening 
               as it begins to rise above the trees.

               With Mike at the wheel the police car, its rack lights 
               flashing, fishtails up the dirt road and slides sideways to 
               a bone-jarring stop next to Benny and the officer. As they 
               jump out of the way they find themselves facing into the 
               super white beam of the figure that was in the house. They 
               are between it and the ship. At the angle that it is coming 
               up the hill, the light looks like it is heading directly for 
               them. This is too much for the officer and in terror he raises 
               his shotgun and fires wildly at it. The figure veers off and 
               disappears into the fog.

               With an awesome roar the spacecraft reaches escape velocity 
               and hurtles into the night sky. The concussion waves knock 
               Benny and the officers off their feet.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

               The escaped figure's light comes out of the fog at tree 
               height. We hear the high-pitched whistle of its rockets. A 
               burst of percussive language comes from behind the faceplate.

               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT

               The fires on the hillside have been renewed. Shaking, Benny 
               and the officer rise to their feet and start toward the light 
               shafting straight up from the figure lying on the hillside. 
               The only sound is police chatter coming out of the radio in 
               the open squad car.

               EXT. LOGGING ROAD - NIGHT

               An 18-wheeler with a load of logs lumbers past us.

               INT. TRUCK - NIGHT

               It feels cozy with the wipers slapping the rain off the 
               windshield. The DRIVER is trying to steal a cigarette out of 
               his snoring PARTNER'S pocket without waking him up. He gets 
               one and reaches for the lighter.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

               The escaped figure banks around a blind corner.

               INT. TRUCK - NIGHT

               The driver gets a glimpse of something in his headlights and 
               slams on the brakes, but it is too late. The figure hits the 
               spoiler above the cab. We hear the smack of impact. One of 
               its boots scars the windshield.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

               The figure bounces off the jack-knifing truck and like a 
               wounded bird tumbles through the air into the trees. With 
               the light spinning crazily, it plunges through the boughs 
               and smashes face first into the mud at the bottom of an 
               embankment. The strip lights on the sides of its helmet go 
               out.

               EXT. TRUCK - NIGHT

               The driver and his partner, standing in the shafts of the 
               high beams, are peering into the woods.

                                     PARTNER
                         What the hell was it anyway?

                                     DRIVER
                         Damned if I know.

               EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

               The figure thrashes over on its back and tries to close a 
               shoulder-to-hip tear in its life-support suit. By the faint 
               identification light that flickers on and off inside its 
               helmet, we see a MAN FROM THE STARS. His skin is translucent 
               coral. He is gasping as our atmosphere mixes with his and 
               threatens to suffocate him.

               Under his translucent skin a maze of veins and arteries extend 
               from a white mass that sits in the upper half of his head. 
               He is hairless. Underneath a graceful fore-head, transparent 
               eyelids droop over black pupilless eyes. The thin lips that 
               delineate his mouth are chalk-white.

               He tries to clutch the edges of the tear together but is too 
               weak. His hands drop limply from the suit, allowing the rent 
               to gape open and reveal the translucent body underneath.

                                     PARTNER (V.O.)
                         Come on. I'm getting wet.

                                     DRIVER (V.O.)
                         It musta been a bird.

                                     PARTNER (V.O.)
                         How about if I drive now?

               Behind the faceplate a piece of white light breaks off from 
               the shining mass in the STAR MAN'S head and moves down his 
               neck. Through the hole in the suit we see it arrive at the 
               top of his single lung. The white light spreads throughout 
               the organ like a phosphorescent tide. The STAR MAN lapses 
               into unconsciousness as we hear the truck pull away.

               INT. HELICOPTER (COCKPIT) - DAWNBREAK

               A light rain is falling.

               We are looking through the windscreen at the gray landscape 
               passing under the helicopter. MARC SHERMIN, a grizzled man 
               in his mid-fifties with an honest stubborn face, shifts his 
               attention from the right side to the left side of the craft. 
               Below him he can see the road leading into the housing tract 
               is blocked by police cars. The helicopter leans into a banking 
               turn and the spacecraft's blackened landing site comes into 
               view. Below it an orange nylon tent has been erected over 
               the dead extraterrestrial. It glows from the inside. An Air 
               Force helicopter is parked on the other side of the burn.

               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - DAWNBREAK

               A man in a white contamination suit is helping Benny and the 
               two officers into the Air Force helicopter. The three men 
               are glassy-eyed and wrapped in blankets. Benny has a bandage 
               across his chest. They look up at Shermin's descending 
               helicopter. They are still looking at it when they disappear 
               inside.

               Shermin's unmarked S65 settles on the clearing. The nose 
               door is open and Shermin, carrying the hood of his 
               contamination suit, comes down the ladder. A tall homespun 
               man, also in a hoodless contamination suit, steps forward to 
               greet him.

                                     MAN
                              (around a cigarette)
                         Major Aaron Bell...

                                     SHERMIN
                         Marc Shermin, National Security 
                         Agency.

               Shermin takes a moment to look over at the tent, the green 
               hillside and the forest beyond. It is pastoral in the soft 
               light of dawn.

                                     SHERMIN
                         This has always been my favorite 
                         time of day.

                                     MAJOR BELL (MAN)
                         Very beautiful country up here...

                                     SHERMIN
                         Any signs of biological contamination, 
                         excessive radiation, anything like 
                         that?

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         Not on the landscape. We're trying 
                         to get a tube under the faceplate 
                         for a reading on possible deadly 
                         lifeforms but it's hard going.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Can you see under the faceplate?

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         No.

               Bell's hands shake as he lights a new cigarette off the one 
               in his mouth.

                                     SHERMIN
                         There's a good chance you could be 
                         wrong about this thing then...

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         Wait'll you see it.

               He throws away the cigarette and begins to put on his 
               contamination hood. Shermin follows as they start for the 
               tent.

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         We had a flight of F16's play tag 
                         with the spaceship over Michigan for 
                         an hour. Then it shot straight up 
                         and disappeared.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Was there visual contact?

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         No, sir. Radar.

                                     SHERMIN
                         It could have been anything.

               EXT. BLACKENED LANDING SITE - DAWNBREAK

               Hooded, Bell and Shermin make their way past three suited 
               scientists examining the landscape with geiger counters and 
               other sensing instruments. With the coming of dawn and Bell's 
               handlight we can clearly see the pod indentations and the 
               huge black glass cup of earth that was fused by the energy 
               blasting out of the spaceship's power plant.

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         After I called in, I had a chance to 
                         sit down with the three locals. They 
                         swear there's another one that didn't 
                         make the ship... It might be alive.

                                     SHERMIN
                         People have made mistakes in these 
                         situations before.

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         I've been investigating sightings 
                         for seventeen years, Mr. Shermin. 
                         This one's real. We have a dead extra-
                         terrestrial in that tent and another 
                         one in the area that might be alive. 
                         We've been visited. It's finally 
                         happened and the sooner Washington 
                         accepts that and starts figuring out 
                         how we're going to deal with these 
                         beings, the better off we're going 
                         to be.

               EXT. FOOT OF EMBANKMENT - DAWNBREAK

               It is still raining.

               The STAR MAN stirs and awakens with a start. He parts the 
               tear in his suit and looks at his lung through his translucent 
               body. It has changed in color from brown to a rich yellow 
               ocher. He takes several deep breaths of our atmosphere and 
               his lung expands and contracts easily. He conducts a quick 
               inventory of his damaged spacesuit, then struggles to his 
               knees and stands up.

               INT. BIOQUARANTINE TENT (HOUSING TRACT) - DAWNBREAK

               The sound of a powerful slow-speed drill greets Bell and 
               Shermin as they enter. The extraterrestrial is still on its 
               back with its helmet lights shining straight up. A hose that 
               extends from a portable gas chromatograph has been suction-
               sealed to a corner of the faceplate. A SCIENTIST is making 
               adjustments at the chromatograph while his COMPANION is 
               monitoring the progress of the drill into the faceplate. 
               Both are wearing contamination suits.

               A foam-lined coffin-shaped metal box is on the ground next 
               to one of the walls. Bell and Shermin approach the body. 
               Shermin's first look is at the faceplate, but all he can see 
               is his own reflection. His eyes travel down the body.

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         Look at the hands.

               The gloved hands of the figure have only three fingers and a 
               thumb.

               Shermin takes Bell's flashlight. He angles it at the 
               faceplate. As he leans in to follow the beam, the pitch of 
               the drill rises. He shifts the light. The drill breaks through 
               and the faceplate explodes out of the helmet. The men throw 
               themselves back in panic. When they turn back to look, 
               distorted impressions of the face inside the helmet reflect 
               on the glass of their contamination hoods. (Pause)

                                     SHERMIN
                         Oh, Jesus.

                                     MAJOR BELL
                              (moving toward the 
                              body)
                         We better get it into the box. Come 
                         on...

               The other men approach the body but before they can bend to 
               it a burst of percussive language, followed by a low buzz, 
               comes from inside the extraterrestrial's helmet. The men 
               freeze. There is another burst of percussive language and a 
               projection beam shoots out of the helmet throwing the image 
               of the escaped STAR MAN onto one of the scientists. He jumps 
               aside and the beam falls out of focus and indistinct on the 
               tent wall behind him.

                              (incredulous)
                         The other one is alive!

               EXT. FOOT OF EMBANKMENT - DAWNBREAK

               The STAR MAN is standing. We hear the sounds of his percussive 
               language coming from behind his mirrored faceplate.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (subtitle)
                         Mapmaker Wind. Do you hear me?

               His answer is nothing but the low buzz. He taps a series of 
               buttons on his chest panel and speaks again.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Mapmaker Wind. Do you hear me?

               Again the buzz.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Mapmaker Wind. Do you hear me?

               The buzz continues. He is very still for a moment. Then he 
               presses the palms of his hands together, prayer fashion, and 
               concentrates. When he pulls them apart, a blue force field 
               pulses between them. He stops at shoulder width. A solarized 
               aerial view of the United States forms on the force field. A 
               green dot appears in the area of western Wisconsin, a red 
               dot in the area of Death Valley, California. He drops his 
               hands to his lap and sits very still. The solarized compass 
               remains floating in the air in front of him. After a long 
               moment he reaches up and squeezes it into a ball that 
               disappears when his palms come together.

               INT. HELICOPTER - DAWNBREAK

               Shermin steps through the open bay door into a communications 
               room. The radar and radio consoles each have a TECHNICIAN. A 
               third technician, LYMAN, sits in front of a square of six 
               medium-sized television screens.

                                     LYMAN
                         Is it for real?

                         Get Fox.

               Lyman taps a code into the computer keyboard. There's a shower 
               of static on one of the TV screens. When it clears up GEORGE 
               FOX, mid-forties, hair slicked straight back, round wire-
               rimmed glasses, is peering intently into the camera.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (before Fox can speak)
                         It's real, George.

                                     FOX
                         There's no mistake? You're absolutely

                                     SHERMIN
                         I saw it with my own eyes. We've 
                         killed an extraterrestrial and...

                         Is there any possibility that it's a

                         None. And there's another one in the 
                         area that's alive. I don't know if 
                         it's the only one. I don't know if 
                         it was left here by accident or it's

                              accusation)
                         Neither did I.

               Major Bell enters the helicopter.

                                     FOX
                         We're going... Damn!
                              (he shakes his head 
                              in disbelief)
                         We'll tell the press that there was 
                         an accident. Chemical warfare spill. 
                         That cover cannot be violated in any 
                         way. Understand me, Shermin?

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         Major Bell here, sir. We have to 
                         tell these people that we're friendly. 
                         That this whole thing was a mistake. 
                         Is anyone trying to contact the ship?

                                     FOX
                              (ignores this)
                         Shermin, I want you and Bell to start 
                         looking for the one on the ground.

                                     SHERMIN
                         We'll need a lot of help, George. 
                         You could hide an army up here.

                                     FOX
                         I'm going to the White House right 
                         now. I'll try and get you everything 
                         you need.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Wait, wait... What are my orders if 
                         we find this thing?

               Fox sits silently for a second.

                                     FOX
                         Contain it and get back to me.

                                     SHERMIN
                         What do you mean by 'contain?'

               Fox knows Shermin is looking for a definite order.

                                     FOX
                         Just what I said.

               The television screen is reduced to static. Shermin stares 
               at it blankly then Lyman turns it off.

               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - MORNING

               The lift off of Shermin's helicopter reveals contamination -- 
               suited scientists slipping the dead extraterrestrial's coffin 
               into the Air Force helicopter.

               EXT. WOODS - DAY

               The STAR MAN, still in his life-support suit, looks surreal 
               in the twilight world under the canopy of firs. The morning 
               rain has gone. A hum of traffic pulls him across the hill to 
               a stand of alders that border the forest. Through the leaves 
               he can see a highway entering the sprawl of Eau Claire, 
               Wisconsin. The cars and trucks zipping along the asphalt are 
               of particular interest to him.

               When he has absorbed them he walks through the trees to get 
               a better look at the town. On the wind he can hear shouts 
               from students boarding a line of yellow buses in front of a 
               grade school off to his right. Suburban houses have begun to 
               snuggle up to the base of the hill he is on.

               Keeping to the tree line well above them he continues his 
               search for an avenue of escape. His head swivels to watch a 
               Volvo station wagon come down the street. It swings into the 
               driveway of the house directly below him and stops next to a 
               Mustang Hatchback. The back door opens and JENNY HAYDN, a 
               pretty girl in her mid-twenties, gets out carrying a crudely 
               lettered be-ribboned sign 'Welcome Back, Mrs. Haydn.' Female 
               voices drift up to the STAR MAN from inside the car.

                                     VOICES
                         It was great to have you back... The 
                         kids loved it. We loved it. You're 
                         doing the right thing...

               EXT. HOUSE - DAY

                                     JENNY
                         I hope so... We'll see... See you 
                         tomorrow... Bye. Bye.

                                     VOICE
                              (as the Volvo backs 
                              out of the driveway)
                         Remember you're required to have a 
                         lesson planned tomorrow.

               Jenny laughs and waves. With the Volvo moving away up the 
               street Jenny picks her newspaper off her walk and goes into 
               the house.

               EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY

               The STAR MAN presses on through the trees. He hears a light 
               plane overhead. He stops and watches until the branches cut 
               off his view. A path between two logs leads him to the tip 
               of a promontory. From behind the cedars growing there, he 
               sits and looks down on the center of Eau Claire.

               Arm in arm, a YOUNG COUPLE meander through the trees. The 
               boy has a blanket over his shoulder and the girl's hair is 
               disheveled. Without seeing him, they walk past the STAR MAN 
               crouched in a thicket of small pines. After they've gone by, 
               he straightens up and watches them walk down toward the 
               highway.

               EXT. HILLSIDE - LATE AFTERNOON

               The sun is setting over suburban Eau Claire. The colors are 
               reflected in the STAR MAN's faceplate as he watches Jenny 
               push a hand mower over her back yard.

               He takes a dusty gray marble out of a leg pocket and while 
               Jenny finishes the lawn he rolls it between his gloves. It 
               turns a glowing gold as it grows in size. When it reaches 
               the dimensions of a baseball, he brings it close to his 
               faceplate and speaks into it.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (subtitles)
                         Iron channel message. Suit and rockets 
                         destroyed. Radical mixture of this 
                         atmosphere and ours in helmet allowed 
                         chemo-ion response time to adapt my 
                         body to this air. Am going to attempt 
                         extreme transformation in order to 
                         cross land mass to site of our 
                         practice landings. If transformation 
                         is not fatal, second message ball by 
                         next darkness.

               He opens his hands and the ball rises quickly into the sky. 
               Jenny is dumping the grass clippings into a garbage can at 
               the side of the house when the sudden motion of the message 
               ball catches her eye and she watches it quizzically until it 
               disappears.

               EXT. WISCONSIN SKIES - LATE AFTERNOON

               We are on the belly of Shermin's helicopter looking at the 
               tree tops rushing underneath.

               INT. HELICOPTER - LATE AFTERNOON

               Shermin is standing back of Lyman and Bell who are seated in 
               front of the square of television screens watching various 
               shots of the wooded landscape flowing by under them. Shermin 
               scrubs his hands over his face then bends over to stretch 
               his back.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a 
                         little league game tomorrow.

                                     LYMAN
                         I wouldn't worry about it... There 
                         might not be any little league 
                         tomorrow.

               Pause.

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         I'm telling you they're probably 
                         friendly.

                                     LYMAN
                         Then why did they try and sneak in 
                         the back door? Tell me that. Why 
                         didn't they contact us first and 
                         say...

                                     RADAR TECHNICIAN
                              (loud)
                         UFO coming out of the grass.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Lock in.

                                     RADAR TECHNICIAN
                         Got it.

               Lyman and the technicians tap out orders to their tracking 
               units and the views of the forest on three of the television 
               screens change to images from their microwave scanners, 
               neutron back scatters and doppler radar. On a fourth screen 
               the forward-looking infrared module begins creating a picture 
               of the UFO. The men relax as they recognize the configurations 
               of a light sea plane.

                                     LYMAN
                         This is crazy. What were we going to 
                         do if that had been the ship? We 
                         have two thirty calibre machine guns, 
                         three M16's and some handguns.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Give it a rest, Lyman.

                                     MAJOR BELL
                              (after a pause)
                         I've never once heard of anybody 
                         being hurt by an extraterrestrial...

               Shermin goes hand over hand along the overhead straps to the 
               radio operator. He begins to flip through a stack of telex 
               messages.

                                     LYMAN
                         That's because the ones that were 
                         hurt, died. They couldn't talk to 
                         you.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (to technician, after 
                              a look at Lyman)
                         Any reports about monsters, people 
                         in Halloween masks, anything like 
                         that?

                                     TECHNICIAN
                         No, but there sure were a lot of 
                         people who saw lights in the sky 
                         last night. Reports are still coming 
                         in.

                                     MAJOR BELL
                              (under above)
                         I've heard of blood being drawn, 
                         sometimes they were taken for a ride 
                         in the ship, a lot of times they 
                         said they had sex... But nobody was 
                         ever hurt...

                                     LYMAN
                         But you decided those weren't real. 
                         This one is.

               There is a buzz and a red dot appears in the center of one 
               of the screens.

                                     LYMAN
                              (over his shoulder to 
                              Shermin)
                         Fox.

               He taps a three digit code and Fox comes into view.

                                     FOX
                         I've got something for you.

               A photograph of a very thin slab of yellow plastic pops up 
               on a second screen next to Fox. Above lines of glowing colored 
               dots are symbols of a hydrogen atom, pulsars, a nude man and 
               a woman and Earth's position in our solar system.

                                     FOX
                         Recognize this?

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent 
                         into space on the Pioneer probes.

                                     FOX
                         Houston found it in the 
                         extraterrestrial's suit.

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         They must have picked it up in space.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Then it's not an accident that they 
                         found us.

                                     FOX
                         We don't think that's necessarily 
                         bad. At least it's a point of contact.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Not necessarily bad! If they knew we 
                         were here why didn't they let us 
                         know they were coming?

                         find the one you're looking for.

                         That's not going to happen, George, 
                         unless you get us the help you 
                         promised us.

                         We've been back and forth on this 
                         all day and keeping in mind the panic 
                         that would occur if this got to the 
                         general public, it's been decided 
                         not to expand the search at this 
                         time.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Don't let them do it this way, George. 
                         It's too important. We can't find 
                         this thing alone.

               The television screen is reduced to static. Lyman shuts it 
               off.

                         We always were.

               EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

               We are looking through the living room window at Jenny 
               watching television while she irons the clothes she plans to 
               wear to work tomorrow. The STAR MAN stands just outside the 
               light-fall in the back yard watching her.

               A commercial interrupts the old movie with a jolly fat MAN 
               in a jumpsuit touting his used cars. The two words 'We 
               have...' are repeated constantly during the pitch. 'We have 
               automatics... We have sticks... We have colors... We have 
               financing...' ...

               We move in close on the STAR MAN'S faceplate.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (practicing the human 
                              sound)
                         Wehave...
                              (more precise)
                         Wehave...
                              (well-formed)
                         Wehave...

               Jenny finishes the skirt, unplugs the iron, picks up the 
               clothes, shuts off the television, the light and heads 
               upstairs. Half way up she stops.

                                     JENNY
                              (faint through the 
                              glass)
                         Damn!

               She turns around and looks down indecisively, then hurries 
               upstairs. A light goes on in the bedroom. The STAR MAN backs 
               away to look up at it. He can't see anything. He is on his 
               way to try and get in the side door when Jenny comes clumping 
               down the stairs in an old sweatshirt and pulling on a pair 
               of jeans. She disappears into the kitchen. Without warning 
               the door ahead of him is swung open and Jenny rushes out. 
               The STAR MAN barely has time to step into the shadows. Jenny 
               grabs the handle of one of the garbage cans lined against 
               the house and drags it down to the street. When she comes 
               back for the second one we see that the STAR MAN is no longer 
               in the shadows.

               INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

               Jenny comes in and locks the door. She passes through the 
               kitchen and is on her way to the stairs when the STAR MAN 
               steps out of the darkness in the living room. A scream catches 
               in Jenny's throat.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (precise)
                         Wehave...

               Jenny bolts for the front door. At the end of the hallway 
               her foot catches in a phone cord pulling the phone off an 
               end table. The receiver is jarred out of its cradle. Jenny 
               regains her balance and gets to the door ahead of the STAR 
               MAN. She jerks it open, but the guard chain stops it three 
               inches from the jamb. Frantically, she tries again but the 
               chain holds.

               The STAR MAN slams the door shut and reaches out to grab 
               her. She flails back at him. One of her hands strikes the 
               panel on his chest and the identification light comes on 
               inside his helmet. At the sight of the STAR MAN, Jenny begins 
               to scream. He presses her back against the wall and puts a 
               mittened hand over her mouth.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Wehave...

               Jenny ceases her struggle and begins to cry. The STAR MAN 
               takes his hand away from her mouth.

                                     JENNY
                         Please don't hurt me... please... 
                         please.

               Holding her with his eyes he grasps one of Jenny's hands and 
               lifts it up to look at it.

               He raises a piece of skin off her wrist, rolls it between 
               his thumb and forefinger.

               Jenny lets out a blood-curdling scream and strikes out at 
               him. Flashes of light erupt off his exposed chest where she 
               hits. The ferocity of her attack knocks him aside and she 
               sprints up the stairs.

               The STAR MAN recovers and starts after her.

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Jenny gets there two steps ahead of the STAR MAN. She slams 
               the door in his face and locks it. With him POUNDING ON THE 
               OUTSIDE, Jenny throws open the closet and begins rummaging 
               madly through the side pockets of her jackets and coats.

               The POUNDING STOPS. It takes her a moment to hear the silence. 
               When she does, she whirls toward the door expecting the worst, 
               but it remains closed. She waits. All she can hear is the 
               sound of the rain. She intensifies her search.

                                     JENNY
                              (hysteria creeping 
                              into her voice)
                         It's got to be here... it's got to 
                         be here...

               She finds it in the pocket of a down jacket. The Army issue 
               .45 looks big in her hand. She releases the safety and, with 
               a wary eye on the door, reaches for the phone on the night 
               table next to the bed.

               Long before the receiver gets to her ear, she can hear the 
               "BLEET" caused by the PHONE BEING OFF THE HOOK for so long 
               in the living room. She hangs up and walks around the bed to 
               sit on the corner facing the door. In the distance, we can 
               HEAR the THUMP OF AN APPROACHING HELICOPTER. After a moment's 
               indecision, Jenny gets up and releases the lock. Again she 
               waits.

               Nothing happens. With the gun ready, she turns the knob and 
               opens the door a crack. The hallway is empty. She kicks off 
               her shoes and lets herself out of the bedroom.

               INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Jenny creeps toward the stairs in her stockinged feet. She 
               looks in the bathroom. The STAR MAN isn't there. She decides 
               to go downstairs.

               INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

               The STAR MAN isn't in the living room. Jenny sidles along 
               the wall for the front door. At the archway to the den a 
               hissing sound stops her. She peers around the molding. The 
               spill from the stairwell light provides the only illumination.

               The STAR MAN is sitting on the edge of a chair with his back 
               to her. He is naked. A dot of light is HISSING around his 
               head. The shadows in the room make it difficult for Jenny to 
               tell exactly what is going on.

               Pointing the .45 at the STAR MAN, she steps into the room 
               for a better look. The floor creaks and the STAR MAN turns 
               to her. Jenny shudders at what she sees. The STAR MAN is 
               holding an 8x10 color photograph of Jenny and a man in his 
               mid-twenties standing on a beach in their bathing suits.

               The dot of light is copying the man's features onto the STAR 
               MAN'S translucent head. The top two-thirds of the face is 
               already done. Everything is perfect, even the eyes. Jenny 
               begins to tremble and lowers the gun.

                                     JENNY
                              (in a small voice)
                         No... please don't...

               She sags against the armchair, racked by sobs that are drowned 
               out by the FLAP OF THE APPROACHING HELICOPTER. The STAR MAN, 
               with the dot of light stopped on his left cheek, gets up and 
               takes the gun from her.

               He drops it on the couch and raises his eyes to the sound of 
               the helicopter NOW DIRECTLY OVER THE HOUSE. THROUGH THE 
               WINDOWS, we can SEE the searchlight scouring the hillside 
               next to the back yard.

               The STAR MAN returns to the picture and resumes his 
               transformation. He completes the chin, then continues downward 
               weaving skin and filling in the human characteristics over 
               the entire body.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. CLEAN ROOM (HOUSTON) - NIGHT

               We come down an electrical cord that ends in a micro-phone, 
               then down further to DR. BERGEN, a tall thin balding man in 
               his late fifties dressed in the medical equivalent of a 
               contamination suit.

                                     DR. BERGEN
                         The creature was hit three times...

               Using a laser light indicator Dr. Bergen shows us where.

                                     DR. BERGEN
                         ...the arm, the abdomen and the upper 
                         chest, the one in the chest being 
                         the cause of death. It shattered, 
                         for want of a better term, the 
                         creature's backbone. It's not really, 
                         because it's not jointed. It's simply 
                         a hollow shaft of very pliable 
                         silicate material, as is its entire 
                         endoskeleton. The creature seems to 
                         have tremendous regenerative powers. 
                         Although it must have died within 
                         minutes of receiving the fatal wound, 
                         the arm and abdomen wounds are almost 
                         totally healed and the bullet here...
                              (indicates with the 
                              light)
                         has begun to dissolve...

               INT. SMALL RECTANGULAR ROOM - NIGHT

               Fox, another CIVILIAN and two MEN in uniform are watching 
               the autopsy on a bank of screens which show Dr. Bergen, the 
               room and various close-ups of the dead extraterrestrial lying 
               on a white glass table lit from underneath.

                                     DR. BERGEN
                         It has veins but no blood. We think, 
                         and this is just speculation, that 
                         some form of energy flows from the 
                         brain, which is much more 
                         sophisticated than ours, throughout 
                         the rest of the body... We don't 
                         think there is any danger of bacterial 
                         contamination. Our biochemistries 
                         are too different...

               INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

               Shermin and his crew are glued to the monitors, watching the 
               autopsy from Houston.

                                     DR. BERGEN (V.O.)
                         The flesh is gelatinous, the skin is 
                         very porous and very moist. This is 
                         another guess, but it probably comes 
                         from a planet that receives only 
                         reflected light, perhaps from a ring 
                         of moons. Its atmospheric pressure 
                         is slightly less than ours and it 
                         contains a great deal more water...

                                     FOX (V.O.)
                         Dr. Bergen, George Fox here in 
                         Washington. Can you give us an idea 
                         of why they're here?

                                     DR. BERGEN (V.O.)
                         They're so advanced... I... eh... 
                         can't imagine what they would want 
                         from us. I know they could be 
                         dangerous. But they could also be 
                         the greatest thing that ever happened 
                         to mankind...

               Shermin and his crew share mixed reactions.

               INT. JENNY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAWNBREAK

               Jenny, sitting on the floor with her arms wrapped around her 
               knees, is reflected in a mirror fastened to the back of the 
               closet door. The STAR MAN edges around the door to look at 
               himself in the glass. In baggy tan cords, a windbreaker and 
               a plaid shirt, buttoned all the way to the neck and a button 
               in the wrong hole halfway down the front, he looks like an 
               innocent abroad. He notices the shirt is askew across his 
               chest and, with his new hands, awkwardly resets the buttons. 
               He looks himself over. His movements resemble a human's but 
               are noticeably more precise.

               The clothes seem right so he leans into the mirror to inspect 
               his face. He squeezes the skin on his cheeks, examines his 
               eyes, turns his head as far as he can to inspect the sides 
               of his face, folds his ears forward to check the skin behind 
               them and he even gives a good two-fisted tug to his hair to 
               see if it is on securely.

               He turns from the mirror and goes over to where the .45 and 
               a leg pouch from his life-support suit are lying on the bed 
               next to a snapshot of the man whose identity he has taken. 
               In the picture the man is dressed exactly as the STAR MAN is 
               now. The STAR MAN picks up the gun and the pouch and, speaking 
               to Jenny in his own language, steps to the door and motions 
               for her to follow. Jenny consciously ignores him. The STAR 
               MAN comes over, reaches down and grabs her arm to pull her 
               to her feet. Jenny squirms back, but he holds her tight. She 
               looks at the hand, almost touches it, then up at the familiar 
               yet disturbingly unfamiliar face above her.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Please...

                                     JENNY
                         Don't... don't do this... please...

               The STAR MAN gets her to her feet and hustles her out of the 
               room. On the dresser is Jenny's wedding picture. The man the 
               STAR MAN has become is her husband.

               INT. HOUSE - DAWNBREAK

               The STAR MAN pulls Jenny down the stairs.

                                     JENNY
                              (struggles to free 
                              herself)
                         You're hurting me. Stop.

               The STAR MAN guides her into the entryway and reaches for 
               the front door. Realizing his intentions, Jenny increases 
               her struggle and manages to pull away.

                                     JENNY
                         Oh, God, no! I'm not leaving this 
                         house with you. You're going to hurt 
                         me, I know...

               The STAR MAN looks intently at her, then opens the front 
               door. He taps his chest, points to Jenny and motions to the 
               dawn outside.

                                     JENNY
                              (through tears)
                         I can't. I'd like to help. You look 
                         like Scott, but I know you're not. I 
                         don't know what you are. You gotta 
                         understand, I'm afraid of you...

               As Jenny backs into the living room, the STAR MAN closes the 
               door. He raises the gun, examines it quickly, then with his 
               finger around the trigger, points it at Jenny.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Please.

                                     JENNY
                         Why are you doing this to me? I'll 
                         give you whatever...

               The STAR MAN swings the muzzle sights across Jenny's body 
               and FIRES. A FLOOR VASE EXPLODES. Jenny turns to look at the 
               remains, then back to the STAR MAN.

               EXT. JENNY'S HOUSE - DAWNBREAK

               The Mustang is backing out of the driveway with Jenny behind 
               the wheel and the STAR MAN perched nervously on the passenger 
               seat.

               INT. MUSTANG - DAWNBREAK

               Wary of what will happen next, the STAR MAN watches Jenny 
               move the gear selector to the drive position.

               The car jerks forward and he grabs the dashboard to keep 
               from toppling back in the seat.

               During the ride up the block, his head swivels from side to 
               side trying to take in as much of the darkened urban landscape 
               as he can. When the car stops at a 'stop' sign, he looks at 
               Jenny questioningly.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Please...

                                     JENNY
                         Which way do you want to go?

               She motions ahead and he turns to look at an inter-section 
               with streets running in three directions off of it. His eyes 
               question Jenny again.

                                     JENNY
                         You can go that way...
                              (points left)
                         That way...
                              (straight ahead)
                         That way...

               She points right. After another look at Jenny, the STAR MAN 
               presses the palms of his hands together, concentrates briefly, 
               then slowly draws them apart. The force field appears between 
               them. On it the solarized view of the United States rotates 
               until the red destination dot is on his right. He drops his 
               hands and points to the right.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (measured)
                         That way.

               The satel compass continues to hover over the dashboard.

                                     JENNY
                              (staring incredulously 
                              at the compass)
                         God, what are you?

               She starts her right turn without looking left and fails to 
               see a little MG approaching from that direction. The WAIL OF 
               THE AIR HORN startles Jenny and reflexively she slams on the 
               brakes.

               The Mustang stalls and the MG squeals around them. Jenny 
               checks the STAR MAN. He has pressed himself against the 
               passenger door. The gun lies on the seat next to him. They 
               both look at it. The STAR MAN recovers and picks it up.

                                     JENNY
                              (starting the engine)
                         I'm sorry...

               This time when Jenny puts the car into drive, the STAR MAN 
               is ready for the acceleration. The car completes the turn 
               and the compass rotates to its new heading. Looking at it 
               from this angle, Jenny suddenly recognizes it for what it 
               is: an aerial view of the United States.

                                     JENNY
                         That green dot, that's us, isn't 
                         it... and the red's where you want 
                         to go?... You don't understand me, 
                         do you?

               The STAR MAN looks at her uncomprehendingly.

                                     JENNY
                              (to herself)
                         I gotta get out of here.

               EXT. STREET - DAWNBREAK

               The Mustang cruises through the industrial section of Eau 
               Claire.

               INT. MUSTANG - DAWNBREAK

               The STAR MAN is watching Jenny drive. A set of headlights 
               rushes TOWARD US in the other lane. Jenny twists around to 
               follow the car as it goes by and we SEE the desperation on 
               her face.

               When she returns her attention to the road, she sneaks a 
               glance at the STAR MAN to see if her action has given away 
               her state of mind. His expression hasn't changed. Jenny takes 
               a deep breath and lets it out slowly. Uttering a phrase in 
               his own language, the STAR MAN touches the steering wheel.

                                     JENNY
                              (startled)
                         What?

                                     STAR MAN
                              (thinking the steering 
                              wheel is called 
                              'what," he repeats)
                         What.

               With the same phrase in his language, he points to the 'gear 
               shift.'

                                     JENNY
                              (realizing her mistake)
                         Ah... no...

                                     STAR MAN
                              (repeats)
                         Ah no.

               He points to the dashboard. Jenny senses there is going to 
               be a great deal of misunderstanding if she uses more words. 
               She shakes her head 'no' and touches the steering wheel.

                                     JENNY
                              (enunciates)
                         Steering wheel...

                                     STAR MAN
                              (correcting her)
                         What.

               Jenny shakes her head 'no.'

                                     JENNY
                         Steering wheel.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (repeats)
                         Steering wheel.

                                     JENNY
                              (points to the gear 
                              shift)
                         Gear shift.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Gear shift.

                                     JENNY
                              (slaps the dashboard)
                         Dashboard.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Dashboard.

               Jenny sees a police car creeping across the intersection 
               ahead of her and interrupts the lesson to stare at it. The 
               STAR MAN looks to where she is looking.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (alarmed)
                         What?!

                                     JENNY
                         Eh... police.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (remembering)
                         Police...

               He raises the gun off his lap. Jenny tries to distract him.

                                     JENNY
                              (raps on the steering 
                              wheel)
                         What?...

               With his eyes on the police car the STAR MAN ignores her.

                                     JENNY
                         Steering wheel...
                              (she points to the 
                              gear shift)
                         What?

               The STAR MAN is intent on the police car. Jenny gives up 
               trying to distract him. The patrol car passes out of their 
               view. The STAR MAN lowers the gun and looks at Jenny.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (unprompted, points 
                              correctly at each 
                              item)
                         Steering wheel... gear shift... 
                         dashboard...

                                     JENNY
                              (this frightens Jenny 
                              even more)
                         Good.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Good.

               EXT. INTERSECTION - DAWN

               We COME DOWN FROM a red light TO FIND the Mustang stopped 
               behind the limit line.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         Which way?

                                     STAR MAN (V.O.)
                         That way.

               The light changes and the car proceeds straight across the 
               intersection.

                                     STAR MAN (V.O.)
                         Good.

               INT. MUSTANG - DAWN

               While the STAR MAN picks through the contents of the glove 
               compartment, Jenny looks for a way to escape. An all-night 
               laundromat is a possibility, but it's deserted. The STAR MAN 
               finds the switch on a flash-light and flicks it on and off.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What?

                                     JENNY
                              (distant)
                         Flashlight.

               He puts the flashlight in his lap along with the owner's 
               manual and gas slips and takes a stack of Discount Coupons 
               out of the glove compartment.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What?

                                     JENNY
                         Coupons.

               Jenny sees a set of headlights turn into the oncoming lane. 
               She slides her eyes toward the STAR MAN. He is busy looking 
               through the Coupons. Jenny measures the distance between the 
               Mustang and the oncoming lights. The STAR MAN holds up one 
               of the Coupons and points to a picture of the product.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What?

                                     JENNY
                              (curt)
                         Pancakes.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Pancakes.

               He points to the cluster of letters that spells SAVE 35¢.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What?

               Jenny doesn't answer. The distance between the two vehicles 
               is narrowing rapidly.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What?

               Jenny sets her jaw and wrenches the steering wheel violently 
               to the left.

               EXT. STREET - DAWN

               The Mustang skids sideways across the center line. The 
               oncoming van jams on its brakes and swerves to its left. 
               Locked in a skid, it drifts toward the Mustang.

               INT. MUSTANG - DAWN

               The STAR MAN sucks himself back in terror as the van descends 
               on him. It swings past his window and clips the rear fender 
               of the Mustang. Both vehicles shudder to a stop. Jenny claws 
               at her door. It swings open. She is halfway out before the 
               STAR MAN manages to grab the tail of her sweatshirt. Jenny 
               begins to scream at the top of her lungs and keeps it up 
               while he tries to wrestle her down on the seat.

               EXT. STREET - DAWN

               A tall, raw-boned MAN in his late twenties storms around the 
               front of his van.

                                     MAN
                         You stupid son of a bitch!!

               He kicks the Mustang.

                                     JENNY
                              (screaming)
                         Help me!!

                                     MAN
                         You could have killed us both!!

                              her grip on the door

                         He's kidnapping me!!!

               The Man bends down to look at the struggle.

                                     MAN
                         Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...

                                     JENNY
                         Call the police!!

                                     MAN
                              (not sure he wants to 
                              get involved)
                         Hey buddy... let her go...

               The STAR MAN increases his efforts and Jenny loses her grip 
               on one of the door frames.

                                     JENNY
                         Help me!!!

                                     MAN
                              (grabbing her other 
                              arm)
                         Hey, she doesn't want to go with 
                         you. Come on.

               The STAR MAN frees his right hand and blindly searches the 
               floor for the gun. He comes up with it and, shoving the barrel 
               in the Man's face, barks a harsh command in his language. 
               The Man freezes and Jenny stops struggling. It's suddenly 
               very quiet on the street.

                                     MAN
                         Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My 
                         mistake... I'm sorry...

                                     JENNY
                         He doesn't understand... just walk 
                         away...

               The STAR MAN claps a hand over her mouth.

                                     MAN
                         I promise I'm not going to tell 
                         anybody about this... None of my 
                         business... I'm going to move now, 
                         okay...
                              (takes a step to one 
                              side)
                         You guys want to fight, that's up to 
                         you...
                              (takes another step)
                         I'm leaving now... I won't say a 
                         word...

               He keeps his eyes on the STAR MAN until he reaches the back 
               of the Mustang, steals a quick look at the license plate, 
               then blots for his van. The STAR MAN takes his hand off 
               Jenny's mouth and slams her back into her seat. Uttering an 
               expletive in his language he points the gun in her face and 
               keeping it there indicates the red dot on the satel compass 
               floating undisturbed above the dashboard.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Go.

               EXT. STREET - DAWN

               The Mustang moves back into the correct lane and continues 
               on.

               INT. MUSTANG - DAWN

                                     JENNY
                         Could you put the gun down?

               The STAR MAN just stares at her. She points to the gun.

                                     JENNY
                         Gun... Down... Down.

               Slowly, he lowers it to his lap.

                                     JENNY
                         Thank you.

               EXT. ABANDONED LOGGING CAMP - EARLY MORNING

               Shermin's helicopter is taking on fuel from an Army tanker 
               truck. The pilot and co-pilot are catching forty winks on 
               the grass next to the old bunkhouse.

               INT. HELICOPTER - EARLY MORNING

               Major Bell, bleary-eyed and unshaven, is huddled in front of 
               the television screens eating a breakfast off a styrofoam 
               plate. On the top left screen is a satellite picture of 
               Northern Michigan and half of Wisconsin taken with a Doppler 
               radar.

               On the lower left screen is an infrared view of the same 
               area. Over both these views is a schematic of the state 
               boundaries and major cities. On the screens to the right of 
               these views are blow-ups of smaller sections of the overview.

               Lyman and the radar technician are asleep on the floor. Seated 
               in front of the radio console Shermin is going through the 
               telex messages. Next to him the radio technician is bent 
               over the desk with his head in his forearms.

                                     SHERMIN
                         There's nothing... No reports of 
                         sightings or landings or anything... 
                         in the other parts of the country or 
                         overseas... Seems like a totally 
                         isolated incident.

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         It was only an accident that we 
                         discovered them.

                                     SHERMIN
                         I know, but...

               Shermin continues on through the messages. Bell asks the 
               computer to change the pictures on the screens. Rhythmically, 
               a sequence of images appears and disappears.

                                     SHERMIN
                         You married, Major?

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         Twenty-eight years.

                                     SHERMIN
                         To the same woman?

                                     MAJOR BELL
                              (smiling)
                         Yes.

                                     SHERMIN
                         I tried it once... Fourteen years 
                         ago... 'I was a lousy husband and a 
                         worse father. The only thing I'm 
                         good at is this... At least until 
                         yesterday.

               Bell stuffs his breakfast plate into a garbage bag and goes 
               to get a breath of fresh air in the open doorway. Shermin 
               stops at a point on the telex sheet. He reads the message to 
               himself again.

                                     SHERMIN
                         How would you describe the sounds we 
                         heard coming out of that thing's 
                         helmet?

                                     MAJOR BELL
                              (after trying to 
                              imitate them)
                         It was kind of like clicking, maybe 
                         a language wasn't it?

                                     SHERMIN
                         Listen to this.
                              (paraphrasing the 
                              telex)
                         A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire 
                         this morning. When a citizen went to 
                         her rescue the kidnapper threatened 
                         him with a gun and shouted at him in 
                         a strange 'clicking gibberish'...

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         It was a man though... right?

                                     SHERMIN
                         The police think he was high on 
                         drugs...

               Bell shrugs.

                                     SHERMIN
                         What do you think?

               EXT. WISCONSIN FOREST - EARLY MORNING

               With a rush the helicopter rises out of the trees and thunders 
               away.

               EXT. JENNY'S HOUSE - MORNING

               There are Eau Claire police cars on the street. Shermin is 
               out back watching Bell pick his way down the hill. Through 
               the windows we see uniformed policemen in the living room.

                                     MAJOR BELL
                              (slides the last few 
                              feet down the hill)
                         Nothing up there... The grass is 
                         matted down in a few places, but 
                         that could have been anything.

                                     SHERMIN
                         It was the husband. The police finally 
                         got a hold of the witness at work 
                         and showed him a picture of the woman.

               The man standing next to her in the picture was her husband 
               and the witness said that was the guy who kidnapped her.

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         It's the right area, that's for sure.

               Throughout the above, Shermin has noticed a WOMAN in the 
               house next door peeping through her blinds at the activity 
               around Jenny's. She closes the drapes suddenly when she 
               realizes Shermin has spotted her.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Why the clicking language though?

               EXT. NEXT-DOOR HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

               Shermin knocks and waits on the steps with Bell for someone 
               to answer. We hear a chain being pulled off and the door is 
               opened by a freckled-face MAN in his late thirties, dressed 
               in a business suit and wiping the traces of a breakfast from 
               around his mouth.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Sorry to disturb you, sir, but there's 
                         been some trouble next door. I'd 
                         like to ask you a few questions.

                                     MAN
                         What happened?

                                     SHERMIN
                         There's a possibility that Mrs. 
                         Haydn's been kidnapped. We're hoping 
                         you might have seen something.

               A WOMAN in a robe opens the door a little wider to include 
               herself in the conversation. She is as freckled as the man 
               and about the same age.

                                     WOMAN
                              (to the Man)
                         I told you...

                                     MAN
                         Judy, that's stupid.

                                     WOMAN
                         Well, maybe these men won't think 
                         so. We were asleep when a helicopter 
                         woke me up. It made me so nervous I 
                         went into the kitchen for something 
                         to eat. I happened to look out the 
                         window and there was Scott Haydn 
                         with this green thing draped over 
                         his arm pulling Jenny down the walk 
                         to the car.

                                     MAN
                         You know that's impossible!

                                     WOMAN
                         I know what I saw. I've seen him 
                         enough times.

                                     MAN
                              (giving up on his 
                              wife and addressing 
                              Shermin and Lyman)
                         Scott Haydn is dead. He died about 
                         three months ago. We went to the 
                         funeral.

               Shermin and Bell exchange a glance.

               EXT. INTERSTATE - DAY

               Jenny's Mustang is sailing through the beautiful Wisconsin 
               farmland.

                                     STAR MAN (V.O.)
                         R-r-S-s...

               INT. MUSTANG - DAY

               The STAR MAN is copying the letters, upper and lower case, 
               from the Owner's Manual he found in the glove compartment, 
               onto the back of an envelope.

                                     STAR MAN
                         T-t-U...

               He draws the upper case but has to check the manual for the 
               lower case.

                                     STAR MAN
                         u-V-v...

               The STAR MAN looks up as they go by a farm.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (pointing correctly 
                              to the various animals)
                         Cow... Dog... Pig...

               He looks to Jenny for confirmation. She nods absently. He 
               returns to the alphabet.

                                     STAR MAN
                         W-w...

               He forms both the upper and lower case 'X-x' and shows them 
               to Jenny.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What?

                                     JENNY
                              (knows what's coming)
                         X...

               Without smiling the STAR MAN opens his mouth and emits a 
               short chirping laugh.

                                     JENNY
                         What's so funny about X?

               The STAR MAN laughs harder. Jenny watches him warily. He 
               starts to hiccup. He is unable to control it through the 
               laughter.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. SMALL RECTANGULAR ROOM - DAY

               Shermin's image waits on the television screen. He is gaunt, 
               tired and visibly shaken. The picture sizzles and breaks up 
               intermittently. Fox and the three men who watched the autopsy 
               stride quickly into the room.

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                              (his voice quavering)
                         George, we've just confirmed the 
                         existence of the live 
                         extraterrestrial.

                                     FOX
                              (after a beat)
                         When can we expect containment?

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         Well, we're in pursuit of a green 
                         Mustang...

                                     FOX
                              (very controlled)
                         It's in a green Mustang?

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         Yes. It's kidnapped a woman at 
                         gunpoint and from what we can make 
                         out is forcing her to drive it 
                         somewhere.

                                     MILITARY MAN
                              (to the room)
                         This one has a weapon.

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         No, no... A .45, it probably got it 
                         in the woman's house. They were last 
                         seen in downtown Eau Claire...

                                     FOX
                         Why did you let it get into a 
                         populated area?

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         It's taken on a disguise.

                                     FOX
                         Clarify that.

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         It's made itself look like the woman's 
                         dead husband.

               Static breaks up the t.v. picture. When it returns, Fox leans 
               toward the screen.

                                     FOX
                         Repeat the last item.

               Almost reluctantly Shermin holds up Scott Haydn's picture.

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         The extraterrestrial now looks like 
                         this.

                                     FOX
                              (softly)
                         Oh shit!!!

               EXT. INTERSTATE - AFTERNOON

               Jenny's Mustang moves along through the traffic.

               INT. MUSTANG - AFTERNOON

               We are CLOSE ON the back of a ten-dollar bill.

                                     STAR MAN (O.S.)
                              (reading slowly)
                         The United States of America. In God 
                         We Trust. Ten dollars.

               We pull back as he holds the ten up to Jenny.

                                     JENNY
                         Money.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Money.

               He holds up a quarter.

                                     JENNY
                         Money.

               Confused, the STAR MAN puts the money back into Jenny's wallet 
               and reads the first card through its plastic window.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... 
                         Jennyhaydn... Money?

                                     JENNY
                              (shaking her head 
                              'no,' exhausted)
                         We're going to have to stop for gas 
                         soon.

               Under the license is a picture of Jenny smiling broadly. The 
               STAR MAN looks at Jenny, back at the picture, then imitates 
               the smile for Jenny.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What?

                                     JENNY
                         Smile.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Smile... good?

                                     JENNY
                         Yes.

               He practices curling the corners of his mouth up into a smile. 
               One of them freezes as the Interstate curves and a glistening 
               skyline backlit by the afternoon sun comes into view across 
               a river.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (impressed)
                         What?!

                                     JENNY
                         Minneapolis.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (reaching into the 
                              leg pouch he took 
                              from his life-support 
                              suit)
                         Minneapolis... Minneapolis...

                                     JENNY
                         What are you doing?

               He takes out his camera.

                                     JENNY
                         ...What's that?

               He points the white disc at Minneapolis. With a 'POP,' a 
               cone of light flashes out. It sucks back, almost instantly, 
               bringing with it a three-dimensional image of the skyline.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Minneapolis... good.

                                     JENNY
                         You're full of tricks, aren't you?

               The car starts across the twin cities' bridge.

                                     JENNY
                              (taps the fuel gauge)
                         We need gas.

               The STAR MAN looks at the gauge. Jenny scrunches against the 
               door to avoid contact with him.

                                     JENNY
                         No gas.

                                     STAR MAN
                         No gas.

                                     JENNY
                         This car runs on gas.

               She presses the accelerator to the floor. The car jumps 
               forward.

                                     JENNY
                         Gas...

               She takes her foot off the accelerator and the car quickly 
               slows down.

                                     JENNY
                         No gas.

               EXT. BRIDGE - AFTERNOON

                                     JENNY
                              (V.O.)
                         Gas.

               The Mustang spurts forward a few yards.

                                     JENNY
                              (V.O.)
                         No gas.

               It staggers down to a crawl.

                                     JENNY
                              (V.O.)
                         Gas.

               The car leaps forward again.

                                     JENNY
                              (V.O.)
                         No gas.

               It drops back to a crawl.

               INT. MUSTANG - AFTERNOON

                                     JENNY
                         No gas... car dead.
                              (her head lolls forward 
                              on her chest)
                         We need gas. I don't want to get 
                         shot for running out of gas.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Gas good?

                                     JENNY
                         Yes. Very good.

               INT. MUSTANG - AFTERNOON

               We are LOOKING DOWN Jenny's arm AT a gas station just off 
               Interstate 169 in the Minneapolis suburbs.

                                     JENNY
                         Gas...

               The STAR MAN contemplates the station as they pass it, then 
               turns to Jenny, puzzled:

                                     STAR MAN
                         Go.

                                     JENNY
                         It's closed... closed. We need one 
                         that's open.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Closed?

                                     JENNY
                         You'll see.

               There are no more gas stations in sight. The STAR MAN becomes 
               bored with the silence. He picks up Jenny's wallet. The 
               driver's license is familiar so he flips to the next window. 
               In it is a picture of an older man and woman standing in 
               front of a church.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What?

                                     JENNY
                              (snaps)
                         Not what. Who. What is for things.
                              (touching the steering 
                              wheel, dashboard, 
                              seat, gear shift)
                         What? What? What? What? For people 
                         you use who. Who is he?

                              the picture)
                         Who is she?
                              (points to the woman)
                         Who are you?

                              MAN)
                         Who am I?

               She touches her chest.

                              (mirrors her gestures)
                         Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? 
                         Who am I?
                              (pause; it clicks for 
                              him and he points at 
                              Jenny)
                         Who are you?

               Jenny nods.

                         Who are you?

                         That's a big help. Where are you 
                         from?

                         explain...
                              (leans back)
                         But that's the only place you could 
                         be from.

               The STAR MAN spots a station on the other side of the 
               Interstate.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Gas.

                                     JENNY
                              (shakes her head 'no')
                         Closed.

               He taps the fuel gauge which has dipped below empty.

                                     STAR MAN
                         No gas.

                                     JENNY
                         I know.

               They both scan the horizon for a gas station. When one doesn't 
               come up immediately, the STAR MAN flips to the next picture 
               in the wallet. It is of the man he has become. He is leaning 
               against a fire truck, in uniform.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Who?

                                     JENNY
                         My... husband.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I am husband?

                                     JENNY
                         No. I don't know what you are, but 
                         you're not Scott.

               Silence. The STAR MAN catches her mood. A tear rolls down 
               Jenny's cheek.

                                     JENNY
                              (brushes it away 
                              angrily)
                         Shit.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Shit?

                                     JENNY
                         No, no... don't say that. Bad word.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (likes the sound of 
                              it)
                         Shit... shit... what shit?

                                     JENNY
                              (screams)
                         Stop!! Enough!! Jesus! You're worse 
                         than a parrot!!

               Like closing a zipper, she slides her fingers across her 
               mouth.

                                     JENNY
                         Mouth closed... closed.

               The STAR MAN does as he is told. He doesn't like it, but he 
               does it. With his lips puckered, he looks straight down the 
               road. The car rises out of a gulley. Topping a knoll straight 
               ahead is a gas station with an enormous Exxon sign revolving 
               above it. With his lips firmly pressed together, he tugs 
               Jenny's sleeve and points.

                                     JENNY
                         I see it.

               The STAR MAN reaches forward and squeezes the satel compass 
               back into his palms.

               EXT. GAS STATION - AFTERNOON

               The Mustang comes up the off-ramp toward the pumps.

               INT. MUSTANG - AFTERNOON

               The STAR MAN'S hand closes around the butt of the .45 when 
               he sees the ATTENDANT step out of the office.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Who?

                                     JENNY
                         Attendant. He'll give us gas. Put 
                         the gun down. Under the seat. Under 
                         the seat...

                                     STAR MAN
                         No.

                                     JENNY
                         Oh God! You're going to get us both 
                         killed. Okay... in your pocket...

               She shoves her hand into the pocket of her slacks showing 
               him what to do.

                                     JENNY
                         In your pocket... pocket...

               Jenny eases in next to the pumps and stops. The Attendant is 
               already coming around the front of the car.

                                     JENNY
                         In your pocket, please...

                                     STAR MAN
                              (draws his fingers 
                              over his lips)
                         You. Mouth closed.

                                     JENNY
                         Okay.

               The STAR MAN stuffs the gun into the left pocket of his baggy 
               cords just as the Attendant arrives at the driver's door.

                                     ATTENDANT
                         Morning, folks. Fill her up?

               The STAR MAN looks at Jenny for help. She sweeps her fingers 
               across her mouth to indicate her lips are sealed. The STAR 
               MAN peeks around her at the Attendant.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (overly loud)
                         ...Gas...

                                     ATTENDANT
                         You got it.

               He leaves the window. The STAR MAN watches him until the 
               nozzle is in the Mustang, then pleased with himself, turns 
               to Jenny and lifts his face into a 'smile.'

                                     JENNY
                         I'm going to the ladies' room. You 
                         stay here.

               EXT. GAS STATION - AFTERNOON

               Jenny gets out of the car. When she straightens up, she finds 
               the STAR MAN staring at her over the roof. She slams the 
               door and strides rapidly in the direction of the ladies' 
               room. Stuffing the green pouch in his pocket, the STAR MAN 
               trots after her.

                                     JENNY
                              (wheels on him as he 
                              catches up)
                         Go back to the car.

               The STAR MAN looks at her but doesn't move. Jenny snarls in 
               frustration, then with the STAR MAN on her heels, stalks to 
               the ladies' room and throws open the door.

               INT. LADIES' ROOM - AFTERNOON

               The STAR MAN follows Jenny inside.

                                     JENNY
                         See. It's a bathroom. I'm not trying 
                         to escape. I just have to go to the 
                         bathroom.

               He checks out the stall.

                                     JENNY
                         Satisfied? Now get out. Out.

                                     STAR MAN
                         No.

               Furious, Jenny steps around him and opens the door. She points 
               to the sign on it.

                                     JENNY
                         Women... me.

               She continues out. The STAR MAN goes after her.

               EXT. RESTROOMS - AFTERNOON

               Jenny points to the sign on the next door.

                                     JENNY
                         Men. You go in here.

               She cracks the door for him.

                                     JENNY
                         Come on.

               He takes the door from her and pushes it open for a look 
               inside. Jenny ducks into the ladies' room. He is confused 
               for a moment then takes a long look at the men's room. It 
               means nothing to him. He backs out and tries the ladies' 
               room. It is locked. Not knowing what to do, the STAR MAN 
               stands uncomfortably in front of the door, then like a child 
               waiting for his mother, he sits on the curb. He watches the 
               Attendant lift the Mustang's hood and reach in for the 
               dipstick. The numbers on the pumps turn over, adding up the 
               gallons and the cost of the gas.

               Everything is peaceful and quiet within the circle of light 
               cast by the gas station. The STAR MAN pulls the camera disc 
               out of his pocket and points it at the pumps. The cone of 
               light flashes out and pulls back its three-dimensional image. 
               The Attendant turns around and waves genially at the STAR 
               MAN, who waves back a perfect imitation of the gesture.

               The SHARP RUMBLE of a SOUPED-UP HONDA MOTORCYCLE coming up 
               the off-ramp shatters the mood and the STAR MAN gets to his 
               feet.

               He is startled by the image of the RIDER. In a one piece 
               driving skin and helmet he looks amazingly like a space 
               traveller. The STAR MAN steps cautiously forward for a better 
               look and mutters something to himself in his language. The 
               rider stops his bike at the second row of pumps and swings 
               himself stiffly out of the seat.

                                     RIDER
                         Do I need a key for the head?

                                     ATTENDANT
                         It's open.

               Without taking off his helmet, the Rider sets out for the 
               men's room.

                                     RIDER
                              (over his shoulder)
                         Fill it up.

                                     ATTENDANT
                         You got it.

               The rider's approach frightens the STAR MAN. He backs up to 
               the ladies' room door and knocks. There is no answer. He 
               tries the knob. With the other hand he inches the gun slightly 
               out of his pocket.

               INT. LADIES' ROOM - AFTERNOON

               Jenny is bent over the sink dabbing nail polish around the 
               corners of a paper towel. Her head snaps around to look at 
               the doorknob. It holds.

                                     JENNY
                         Just a minute.

               EXT. RESTROOMS - AFTERNOON

               The STAR MAN tenses and forces a smile as the Rider passes 
               in front of him. A VOICE comes from behind the faceplate.

                                     RIDER
                         Howdy... can't get her out.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (thru the smile)
                         Gas.

                                     RIDER
                         I know how she feels.

               The rider enters the men's room. As the door closes behind 
               him, the STAR MAN's face falls and he knocks frantically on 
               the ladies' room door. Jenny opens it under his knuckles. He 
               blocks the doorway and she backs up as he steps inside.

               INT. LADIES' ROOM - AFTERNOON

               The STAR MAN looks around. Jenny's eyes widen at what is 
               happening behind him. The pneumatic arm above the door is 
               pulling it shut to reveal her paper towel pasted to the back. 
               The message on it, written in red lipstick, reads: KIDNAPPED 
               GOING W ON 169 JADE MUS. LIC#PXV237.

                                     JENNY
                              (stepping around him)
                         It's still a toilet. Hasn't become a 
                         ballroom.

               She tries to swing the door open and hide her message against 
               the wall, but she is too slow. The STAR MAN sees it and steps 
               forward to read.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Kid-nap-ped... go-ing W o-n...

               Jenny realizes he doesn't know what it means.

                                     JENNY
                              (on her way out)
                         That's very good.

               Other graffiti on the door helps convince the STAR MAN Jenny's 
               message has nothing to do with him and after a last look at 
               it, he follows her.

               EXT. GAS STATION - AFTERNOON

               A CAN of Coke CLATTERS DOWN the chute of a drink dispenser. 
               Jenny picks it up and, with the STAR MAN hovering at her 
               shoulder, moves on to the candy machine. He watches a quarter 
               disappear into the slot and when Jenny picks another one out 
               of her purse, he points to it.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Money.

                                     JENNY
                         Yes.

               She inserts the quarter and makes her selection. A Reese's 
               Peanut Butter Cup drops from its position into the pickup 
               bin.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What?

                                     JENNY
                         Candy.

               Using the change from this and another quarter, she selects 
               an Almond Joy.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (as it tumbles into 
                              the bin)
                         Money... candy.

                                     ATTENDANT
                              (to the STAR MAN)
                         That'll be fifteen fifty, sir.

                                     JENNY
                         Here.

               She hands him a twenty.

                                     ATTENDANT
                         Thank you.

               He goes to make change.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (to himself)
                         Thank you.

               Jenny pops the top on the Coke can and on the way to the car 
               takes a sip.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What is...
                              (reads off the can)
                         ...Coke?

                                     JENNY
                         A drink.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (holds his hand out 
                              for it)
                         I...

                                     JENNY
                         You want to try it?

                                     STAR MAN
                         I want to try it.

                                     JENNY
                         This stuff could kill...
                              (changes her mind and 
                              smiles)
                         Be my guest.

               The STAR MAN fills his mouth, swirls it around and swallows.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (after a loud burp)
                         Good.

               He hands the can back to Jenny. She looks at it and knows 
               there are alien bacteria there her body would not like to 
               meet.

                                     JENNY
                         Eh... you keep it. I've had enough.

               The STAR MAN takes another drink. He stops dead when he lowers 
               the can. Jenny continues for a few steps before she realizes 
               he isn't with her. She looks back over her shoulder. Her 
               eyes go immediately to where he is looking. The license plate 
               PXV 237 hangs like an accusation on the front bumper of the 
               Mustang. Jenny decides to brazen it out.

                                     JENNY
                         What's the matter?

                                     STAR MAN
                              (throws the can to 
                              the ground)
                         Shit!

               INT. MUSTANG - AFTERNOON

               Jenny and the STAR MAN ride along in tight-lipped silence.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What is kidnapped?

               Jenny ignores him.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (yells)
                         Kidnapped!!!

               She flinches but remains silent. The STAR MAN snatches the 
               paper towel off his lap and flaps it in her face, jabbing at 
               the word violently with a forefinger.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Kidnapped!!! What is kidnapped?!!

               Jenny can't take it anymore and screams back at him through 
               tears.

                                     JENNY
                         Kidnapped is what you're doing to me 
                         now!!! Kidnapped is pointing a gun 
                         at me and taking me from my house! 
                         Kidnapped is changing yourself into 
                         my husband. I don't know what you 
                         are and I don't care. I just want to 
                         get away from you!

               Jenny's outburst rocks the STAR MAN back into silence. He 
               waits for her to calm down, then slowly takes the gun out of 
               his pocket.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Jennyhaydn.

               She doesn't dare look at him.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I am good.
                              (and he slides the 
                              .45 under his seat)

               EXT. INTERSTATE - NIGHT

               Jenny speeds up to pass a truckload of horses.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What is that?

               She doesn't answer. The car passes the truck. The highway 
               before them is empty.

                                     JENNY
                              (finally)
                         Horses.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (without looking at 
                              her)
                         Horses.

               Jenny TURNS ON the RADIO and finds a COUNTRY AND WESTERN 
               STATION.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What?

                                     JENNY
                         Music.

               It is pleasing to him and he listens for a while, then reaches 
               in his pouch and takes out one of the dusty gray marbles. He 
               rolls it between his palms. It changes to a glowing gold as 
               it grows to the size of a baseball.

                                     JENNY
                              (alarmed)
                         What are you doing?!

               The STAR MAN brings the globe close to his mouth and speaks 
               into it.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (subtitles)
                         Iron channel message. Transmute was 
                         successful. Have captured one of 
                         them. It is taking me to the pick-up 
                         point in a land vehicle.
                              (eyeing Jenny)
                         I think I can control it by mastering 
                         its language, which is primitive and 
                         easy to learn. Will arrive on time. 
                         Wait for me.

               The STAR MAN opens his hands and, to Jenny's astonishment, 
               the ball rises quickly and seeps through her roof without 
               leaving a trace.

               EXT. INTERSTATE - NIGHT

               The Mustang swerves violently, then straightens itself as 
               the ball comes through the roof and surges into the sky.

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT

               Unexpectedly, Shermin's helicopter storms into view. It is 
               so close we can count the rivets. As it clears, we go to:

               INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

               The flow of traffic on the Interstate below is being fed 
               into the six television screens from infrared cameras on the 
               belly of the craft. The image on the screen under the master 
               begins to move and ends in a close-up of a green Mustang. 
               It's not Jenny's. With a buzz the red dot appears and Fox's 
               face interrupts the view of the Mustang.

                                     FOX (V.O.)
                         I just came from a meeting with the 
                         Security Council and
                              (the picture breaks 
                              up, but the voice 
                              continues)
                         in view of the extraterrestrial's 
                         radical change and the fact that all 
                         our efforts
                              (the picture re-
                              assembles)
                         to contact its ship remain unanswered, 
                         it was decided to issue a ten state 
                         'all points bulletin' for Scott Haydn, 
                         Jenny Haydn and the green Mustang. 
                         The officers have been instructed 
                         not to approach the people or the 
                         vehicle but to contact you. You will 
                         then move in and contain the subjects.

               Shermin rubs his hands over his face while he digests this.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (sorting it out)
                         You sure you want this, because... 
                         that's putting an awful lot of faith 
                         in people we have no control over...

                                     FOX (V.O.)
                         I'm afraid the situation demands 
                         that kind of risk.

                                     SHERMIN
                         I don't like it, George...

                                     FOX (V.O.)
                         Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were 
                         asking for help. What's changed?

                                     SHERMIN
                         It's messy... the thing's got a gun... 
                         We're just asking for somebody to 
                         get killed...

                                     FOX (V.O.)
                         We don't know what else to do. We 
                         need results.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (accepting)
                         You'll get results one way or the 
                         other, that's for sure... Okay.

                                     FOX (V.O.)
                         I'm gonna be here if you need 
                         anything.

               His image is replaced by one of the highway.

                         They're gonna let some local cop 
                         blow him away.

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.

                                     LYMAN
                         Bullshit!

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         You have no conception of this, do 
                         you?

                                     LYMAN
                         You jerk! You look at all the 
                         sweetness and light and goodness you 
                         think'll come out of this. You know 
                         what's gonna come out of this... The 
                         end of religion, the end of 
                         civilization, the end of the earth. 
                         We could become slaves, we could 
                         become a colony of these things. 
                         Don't you see that? Are you too stupid 
                         to see that?

                                     SHERMIN
                         Are you ladies through?...

               Bell and Lyman look at their feet.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Good... It looks like we might be 
                         the welcoming committee, so I think 
                         we should try and figure out what 
                         we're gonna do if we have to come 
                         face to face with this creature.

                                     LYMAN
                         Bell wants us to get down on our 
                         knees and bow.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (to Bell)
                         Did your people have any contingencies 
                         rehearsed?

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         No... I guess we never thought it 
                         would happen.

               It's Shermin's turn to look at his feet.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Terrific.

               On one of the screens behind him the camera has picked up a 
               lighted billboard advertising 'Kellogg's Corn Flakes' with 
               its slogan 'HAVE A GREAT DAY.'

               EXT. HIGHWAY - EARLY MORNING

               Jenny's Mustang is barreling along well over the speed limit. 
               As it PASSES US, we PAN WITH it TO a sign: SLOW FOR 
               INTERSECTION.

               EXT. INTERSECTION - EARLY MORNING

               A truckload of corn is hurtling down ON US from the north. 
               An empty semi is rumbling up from the south. The light is in 
               their favor.

               INT. MUSTANG - EARLY MORNING

               The STAR MAN is driving. It is obvious that he doesn't see 
               the red light facing him. But Jenny does. And she also sees 
               the trucks closing in from either side.

                                     JENNY

                         Red light!

               The STAR MAN doesn't see it, doesn't believe her, doesn't 
               slow down.

                                     JENNY
                              (screams)
                         Stop!!!

               EXT. INTERSECTION - EARLY MORNING

               It is as if all three vehicles have heard Jenny. They slam 
               on their brakes at the same time and begin to skid toward 
               each other. It's going to be close.

               INT. MUSTANG - EARLY MORNING

               The prows of the trucks loom over Jenny and the STAR MAN 
               and, for a fleeting instant, it looks like they will join 
               the bugs imbedded in the radiators.

               EXT. INTERSECTION - EARLY MORNING

               The Mustang barely squeaks through and the trucks slam into 
               each other behind it, spilling corn all over the highway.

               INT. MUSTANG - EARLY MORNING

               It finally comes to a stop on the center line.

                                     JENNY
                         That was a red light!! I told you 
                         you have to stop at a red light!!

                                     STAR MAN
                              (sheepish)
                         It was yellow.

                                     JENNY
                         You didn't even see it.

               The STAR MAN looks back for the traffic light. It is hanging 
               from a pole in the middle of the road. Under it the truck 
               DRIVERS are climbing out of the cabs.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I will see it next time.

                                     JENNY
                         You better.

               The STAR MAN angles back into his lane and begins to pick up 
               speed.

               EXT. SIOUX FALLS - SOUTH DAKOTA - DAY

               Deftly, the STAR MAN moves in and out of the afternoon 
               traffic. A bus coming in the other direction hits a pothole 
               filled with water and the SPLASH covers the Mustang.

               INT. MUSTANG - DAY

               Jenny watches the STAR MAN calmly turn on the wipers and the 
               washer and clean the windshield. The light above the 
               intersection ahead turns red and, even though he is still 
               fiddling with the wipers, the STAR MAN manages a smooth stop 
               back of the crosswalk.

                                     JENNY
                              (indicating the red 
                              dot on the satel 
                              compass)
                         Why are you going here? What is here?

                                     STAR MAN
                         My...
                              (searches for word)
                         ...car will take me...
                              (pokes finger toward 
                              sky)
                         ...up there... home.

               The light changes and the STAR MAN continues down the street.

                                     JENNY
                              (at the red dot again)
                         When do you have to be here?

                                     STAR MAN
                         I do not understand.

                                     JENNY
                              (rubs her temples and 
                              laments to herself)
                         How will I do this one?...

               The answer is hovering above the city in front of them.

                                     JENNY
                              (pointing to the sun)
                         Sun...

                                     STAR MAN
                         Yes.

                                     JENNY
                         Sun... day. No sun... night. You 
                         understand?

                                     STAR MAN
                         Yes. Day... night.

                                     JENNY
                         How many days and nights do you have 
                         to go...
                              (prods the red dot)
                         ...here?

                                     STAR MAN
                         Three nights... two days.

                                     JENNY
                         That's not much time. I'll just slow 
                         you down. I have to sleep. I'm very 
                         tired. And I have to wash and eat. 
                         You don't...

                                     STAR MAN
                         I need you.

                                     JENNY
                         I won't tell anybody if that's what 
                         you're worried about. I promise. 
                         You'll keep...

                                     STAR MAN
                         No.

                                     JENNY
                         You'll keep the car. I'll take a 
                         bus...
                              (an awful possibility 
                              occurs to her)
                         Am I going up there with you... in 
                         your ship... up there?

                                     STAR MAN
                         No.

                                     JENNY
                         Then let me go. You don't need me.

                                     STAR MAN
                         No.

                                     JENNY
                         I feel like I'm going crazy here. 
                         You're Scott. But he's dead. I don't 
                         know what's real anymore. I can't be 
                         here with you.

               The STAR MAN is unyielding.

                                     JENNY
                         Do you understand what I'm saying to 
                         you? You can keep the car.
                              (she hands him some 
                              money)
                         That should be enough for gas from 
                         here to there. Please let me go.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (taps the red dot on 
                              the satel compass)
                         When we get here.

               Jenny slams herself angrily back in the seat.

                                     JENNY
                         You bastard.

               Her upper lip trembles and, in spite of herself, she might 
               cry. The STAR MAN sees the center lane is open. He checks 
               his side mirror and drifts over, only to be caught by a light. 
               The car is still rolling when Jenny makes her move. She throws 
               open the door and, by the time the STAR MAN turns around, 
               she is out and running.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Jennyhaydn!

               He takes his foot off the brake to go after her and the car 
               lurches into the cross traffic. He clambers back behind the 
               wheel, regains control and cuts a hard right in front of the 
               other car waiting at the light.

               EXT. STREET - SIOUX FALLS - DAY

               Over her shoulder, Jenny can see the Mustang coming. She 
               dodges up a brick walkway toward a J.C. Penney shopping mall. 
               The Mustang skids to a stop at the curb. The STAR MAN jumps 
               out in time to see Jenny push her way past a stream of 
               pedestrian traffic and enter the mall. He leaves the car and 
               zigzags through the people in that direction.

               INT. SHOPPING MALL - DAY

               As he barges in, the STAR MAN accidentally knocks a cup of 
               Coke out of a YOUNG MAN's hand.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Hey!!

               In a panic to find Jenny, he continues jostling past people 
               to look in the shops that border the atrium.

               MEZZANINE

               Jenny warily approaches the railing and peers over. Below 
               her the STAR MAN comes out of a record store. She turns away 
               and gets on the escalator to the second floor.

               ON THE GROUND FLOOR

               The STAR MAN thinks he sees Jenny in an electronics store, 
               but when the girl turns around, it is obviously not her. 
               Backing out of there, he knocks over a sandwich board 
               advertising a restaurant. The LOUD THWACK it makes when it 
               hits the cement turns faces in his direction.

               Jenny's is not among them. His eyes raise to the mezzanine. 
               Maybe she's there. He looks wildly around for a way up. He 
               spots the escalator and, trying to keep the upper floor in 
               view while he runs for it, he slams into an unattended pram.

               It begins to tip over. The BABY INSIDE SCREAMS. The STAR MAN 
               manages to snatch it out of the carriage before it hits the 
               floor. He is looking for a place to put it when the MOTHER 
               comes charging out of a plant store.

                                     MOTHER
                         My baby!!! He's stealing my baby! 
                         Burt!!

               The STAR MAN holds the baby out to her.

               She grabs it out of his hands and he turns to leave.

                                     MOTHER
                         Burt!! Somebody stop him!! He was 
                         stealing my baby!!

               Two tough-looking MEN in T-shirts step in to block the STAR 
               MAN's way to the escalator.

                                     MAN
                         Where you think you're going?

               Not understanding, the STAR MAN tries to get by them. They 
               push him back.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Please.

               A tall, skinny blond man with spectacles elbows his way to 
               the Mother.

                                     MOTHER
                         He was trying to steal Gloria.

               Two steps and Burt is on the STAR MAN. He spins him around.

                                     BURT
                         Is that right? Huh?

               He throws him back against the crowd that has gathered.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (stutters)
                         Please.

               Burt pulls the STAR MAN up by his shirt front and shakes 
               him.

                                     BURT
                         Is that right? Come on. Answer me.

               Fear erases the STAR MAN's tenuous grasp of English and he 
               begins to jabber in his own language. This makes Burt even 
               madder.

                                     BURT
                         Were you trying to steal my baby? 
                         Huh? Answer me!

                                     STAR MAN
                         Jennyhaydn!

               SECOND FLOOR

               Jenny has just gotten on the escalator to the third floor 
               when she hears her name. She knows she shouldn't but she 
               gets off and joins the crowd at the railing. From there, she 
               can see the STAR MAN trapped in a circle of people. He clubs 
               Burt away from him and tries to thrash his way out of the 
               mob.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Jennyhaydn!

               One of the T-shirts throws him back and Burt begins to punch 
               him. We MOVE IN UNTIL we are CLOSE ON Jenny's face.

               GROUND FLOOR

               Some of the onlookers have joined Burt in his attempt to 
               bring the STAR MAN down. Growling in his own language, the 
               STAR MAN fights back as best he can. The sleeve of his 
               windbreaker is torn. One of the T-shirts lands a blow on his 
               right shoulder that turns the STAR MAN around. He takes a 
               blow on the chest. Another in the kidneys. Burt gets a grip 
               on the STAR MAN's left wrist and holds on. The attackers 
               close in. Jenny's voice cuts through the din.

                                     JENNY (O.S.)
                         Stop it!!! Stop it!!!

               She barges into the fray and starts peeling the men away 
               from the STAR MAN.

                                     JENNY
                         Get away from him!! Leave him alone!! 
                         You stupid jerks!! He's retarded!! 
                         Can't you see that?!! Get away from 
                         him!!

               The men do. Jenny pushes the sleeve of the torn wind-breaker 
               back up on the STAR MAN's shoulder.

                                     MOTHER
                         He was stealing my baby...

                                     JENNY
                         You're wrong!! He would never do 
                         anything like that!!
                              (takes STAR MAN's 
                              hand)
                         Let's go...

                                     MOTHER
                         He had Gloria in his hands!

                                     JENNY
                         He's retarded! I shouldn't have left 
                         him alone!

               She starts to push out of the circle. Burt steps in to block 
               her.

                                     JENNY
                              (hisses)
                         Get out of my way.

               She stares at him until he does, then leads the STAR MAN 
               down the path that opens for them in the crowd. They pass a 
               MALL GUARD who has just arrived.

               EXT. STREET - SIOUX FALLS - DAY

                                     JENNY
                         Are you okay?

               Still shaken, the STAR MAN nods. Jenny realizes that it is 
               comforting to him to have his hand in hers and she leads him 
               like a child down the sidewalk to the Mustang.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (as Jenny puts him in 
                              the passenger seat)
                         Thank you.

               The Mall Guard follows them down the walk-way and watches 
               them drive off. He scribbles the license number in his 
               notebook.

               INT. GREYHOUND BUS STATION - SIOUX FALLS - DAY

               At the counter Jenny puts her Visa card back into her wallet 
               while the CLERK staples the pages of a ticket into a travel 
               folder.

                                     CLERK
                              (handing it to her)
                         Gate three. It's boarding now.

                                     JENNY
                         Thank you.

                                     CLERK
                         Have a nice trip.

               We FOLLOW Jenny THROUGH the people milling around the benches 
               in the waiting area TO the STAR MAN seated in an open-faced 
               coffee shop. He is watching a MOTHER feed her baby in the 
               booth across from him. A map of the United States is spread 
               out on the formica. Jenny plunks herself down catty-cornered 
               from him. The tear in his sleeve has been closed with safety 
               pins.

                                     JENNY
                         The closest I was able to get you 
                         was Lathrop Wells...

                                     STAR MAN
                              (pointing to baby)
                         Is that a baby?

                                     JENNY
                         Yes.

                                     STAR MAN
                         A baby is a new person?

                                     JENNY
                         Eh... yes...

                                     STAR MAN
                         Do you have a baby?

                                     JENNY
                         No... The closest...

                                     STAR MAN
                         Why?

                                     JENNY
                         I'd love to have a baby. But I 
                         can't...

                                     STAR MAN
                         Why?

                                     JENNY
                         I can't... Forget the baby. Okay? 
                         The closest I was able to get you 
                         was Lathrop Wells. You'll have to 
                         hitchhike the rest of the way.

               The STAR MAN looks at the map. Lathrop Wells is a small town 
               north of Las Vegas on Highway 95. From there he runs his 
               finger to a spot in the Funeral Range of Death Valley.

                                     STAR MAN
                         But I must go here.

                                     JENNY
                         I know that. But the buses don't go 
                         there.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (suspicious)
                         What is hitchhike?

                                     JENNY
                         That's easy. I'll explain that in a 
                         minute. This is your ticket. When 
                         you get on the bus here, the driver 
                         will take this part. You will ride 
                         to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask 
                         the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. 
                         I do not speak English.'

               The STAR MAN nods that he understands.

                                     JENNY
                         Say it.

                                     STAR MAN
                         'Salt Lake City, please. I do not 
                         speak English.'

                                     JENNY
                         The driver will...

                                     STAR MAN
                         But I speak English.

                                     JENNY
                         Will you please do it my way? You'll 
                         get into trouble if you don't. If 
                         anybody talks to you, tell them... I 
                         do not speak English.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (indignant)
                         I do not speak English.

                                     JENNY
                         Right. In Omaha the driver will put 
                         you on the bus for Salt Lake City 
                         and the new driver will take...
                              (bends back second 
                              portion of ticket)
                         ...this part. When you get to Salt 
                         Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, 
                         please'...

                                     STAR MAN
                              (impatient)
                         'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak 
                         English.' What is hitchhike?

                                     JENNY
                         You want this ticket?

                                     STAR MAN
                         Yes.

                                     JENNY
                         Then don't be smart.

                                     P.A. SYSTEM (V.O.)
                         Last call for bus 33 to Vermillion, 
                         Sioux City and Omaha... loading at 
                         Gate 3.

                                     JENNY
                         That's your bus.
                              (picks up the map and 
                              folds it)
                         When you get to Las Vegas, ask the 
                         driver. 'Lathrop Wells, please. I do 
                         not speak English.'

                                     STAR MAN
                              (falling into step 
                              next to her)
                         'Lathrop Wells, please. I do not 
                         speak English.'

                                     JENNY
                              (hands him the map)
                         You keep this. Now this is hitch-
                         hike...
                              (stops in the middle 
                              of the waiting area 
                              to illustrate)
                         You stand on the side of the road, 
                         the highway... you understand? And 
                         you face the cars going in the 
                         direction you want to go. When you 
                         see a car or a truck coming, you 
                         stick out your thumb like this...

               Jenny takes a few sweeps at an imaginary highway with her 
               thumb. The stares this pantomime draws make the STAR MAN 
               more nervous about the bus trip than he already is.

                                     JENNY
                         Your thumb tells the driver that you 
                         want a ride.

                                     STAR MAN
                         The car will stop?

                                     JENNY
                              (continuing toward 
                              the loading platform)
                         Not every car, but... a car will 
                         stop... Maybe not the first car... 
                         maybe number eight, number fifteen...

               The STAR MAN stops.

                                     STAR MAN
                         When do I get to Lathrop Wells?

                                     JENNY
                         Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking 
                         right away and...

               Jenny pushes open a glass door to:

               EXT. LOADING PLATFORM - DAY

                                     JENNY
                         ...you'll have plenty of time to get 
                         to where you want to go.

               The STAR MAN hangs back when he sees the security guards.

                                     JENNY
                         Don't worry. They're not going to 
                         hurt you. Come on.
                              (gives him ticket)
                         Only show this to the driver. Nobody 
                         else. And don't lose it.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Can I have the gun?

                                     JENNY
                         No.

               She maneuvers him into the end of the line.

                                     JENNY
                         You might need this.

               She takes some of the paper money out of her wallet and stuffs 
               it in his pocket.

                                     JENNY
                         Don't be afraid. Do what I told you 
                         and you'll be okay.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (nervous)
                         Yes.

               The line moves forward a step.

                                     JENNY
                         Well... I'm going to go now.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Go?

                                     JENNY
                         Yes. I have a long ride ahead of 
                         me...
                              (takes his hand)
                         Goodbye.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Goodbye.

               He watches her walk away.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Jennyhaydn.

                                     JENNY
                         Yes?

                                     STAR MAN
                         Please stay.

               Jenny comes back and takes his hand.

                                     JENNY
                         I'll stay till you get on the bus.

               A family of four climbs aboard and the line moves up. The 
               STAR MAN is alert to everything happening on the platform. 
               Jenny sneaks him an affectionate look. No one in front of 
               him has baggage to check and they move quickly past the DRIVER 
               until the STAR MAN is next in line.

                                     DRIVER
                         Ticket?

               The STAR MAN hands the Driver his ticket. The Driver rips 
               out the first coupon and hands it back.

                                     JENNY
                         See? You're going to be okay.

               When they stop at the door, she impulsively kisses him on 
               the cheek.

                                     JENNY
                         Goodbye.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (touches his cheek)
                         What?

                                     JENNY
                         It's a kiss...
                              (she motions for him 
                              to get on the bus)
                         Goodbye...

                                     DRIVER
                         Let's go.

               The STAR MAN climbs the steps just ahead of him. The door 
               closes. Its ENGINE REVVING, the bus backs out of its stall. 
               Jenny catches a glimpse of the STAR MAN bent over in the 
               aisle looking out at her. She waves until the bus rounds the 
               building.

               EXT. GREYHOUND PARKING LOT - DAY

               Jenny's green Mustang loops around the end of a row of cars 
               and heads for the street.

               INT. MUSTANG - DAY

               LOOKING OVER Jenny's SHOULDER, we SEE the Star Man waiting 
               for her at the curb.

                                     JENNY
                              (softly)
                         Oh no...

               She stops next to him and rolls down her window.

                                     JENNY
                         What happened?

                                     STAR MAN
                         I was afraid.

               Jenny moans and lays her head on the vinyl of the window 
               sill. When she raises up, he smiles at her.

                                     JENNY
                         Okay, you win. Get in.

               INT. SHOPPING MALL - DAY

               Shermin is standing next to the security guard in the middle 
               of a knot of shouting people.

                                     SHOPKEEPER
                         This kind of thing's real bad for 
                         business...

                                     TOUGH
                         He couldn't even speak English.

                                     MOTHER
                         Those kind of people should be shot.

                                     ONLOOKER
                         What happened?

                                     WAITRESS
                         I think he was just lost...

                                     BURT
                         Who's side are you on?

                                     TOUGH
                         No way he was going to get away from 
                         me.

               We move in on a lapel mike pinned to the front of Shermin's 
               shirt.

               INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

               The hubbub in the shopping center is being recorded on a 
               tape deck. Lyman, a phone to his ear, is seated in front of 
               the television screens.

                                     LYMAN
                         Where's that?... And it was one 
                         person, one way...

               He hangs up and heads for the rear door. Jenny Haydn's current 
               Visa statement occupies the upper left screen. The last two 
               items are circled: The charge for the Greyhound ticket and 
               the credit for the return of that ticket.

               EXT. SHOPPING MALL - DAY

               The security guard tags Shermin into the parking lot.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Eyewitnesses are the worst. You get 
                         two of them together. You got three 
                         stories. You know what I mean?

               Shermin sees Lyman come out of the crowd surrounding the 
               police cars in front of the helicopter.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Is there a reward in this?

                                     SHERMIN
                         Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Because I'm the one who called the 
                         police, you know.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Hey, it's none of my business why 
                         you're chasing a retard... You want 
                         my opinion, it's the girl. She had 
                         to hold the guy's hand all the way 
                         to the car like he was a kid.

                                     SHERMIN
                         You saw that?

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Hey... he didn't look like no big 
                         time criminal to me.

               Lyman meets them. It is obvious he has something to tell 
               Shermin.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Eh... the store tells you to call 
                         when there's trouble, so they won't 
                         get sued... But that shouldn't matter 
                         if there's a reward, right?

                                     SHERMIN
                         I wouldn't think so.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                              (peeling off)
                         That's what I thought. So remember 
                         it was me because sometimes rewards 
                         come late, you know.

                                     SHERMIN
                         We will.
                              (he turns to Lyman)
                         Something's wrong here. She's helping 
                         him now.

                                     LYMAN
                              (alarmed)
                         I know. She bought him a ticket for 
                         Lathrop Wells and put him on the 
                         bus. He didn't stay on though and 
                         they drove off together.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (shaking his head)
                         Doesn't make sense.

                                     LYMAN
                         Maybe he's turned her into one of 
                         them. They enter the crowd around 
                         the helicopter.

               EXT. INTERSTATE 29 - DAY

               The Mustang cruises along between fields of corn.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         Why did your ship land on this 
                         planet... on Earth?

                                     STAR MAN (V.O.)
                         It was a mistake.

               INT./EXT. MUSTANG - DAY

               The following conversation will be played over various views 
               of Americana: a station wagon load of kids, waving and 
               laughing, lovers kissing at a bus stop, billboards, car lots, 
               a dog taking a leak against a tree, cheerleaders practicing 
               on a football field, a funeral cortege, a telephone repairman 
               up on a pole.

                                     JENNY
                         You thought we were a different 
                         planet?!

                                     STAR MAN
                         No. My ship was doing a map of all 
                         the suns and...

                                     JENNY
                         Stars... When a sun is far away, we 
                         call it a 'star.'

                                     STAR MAN
                         We were doing a map of the stars and 
                         all the other things up there when 
                         we saw a small ship. My... eh... we 
                         kidnapped it. On it there was a map 
                         that said how to come to Earth. This 
                         was very important. Before then, we 
                         thought we were the only people in 
                         all the stars.

                                     JENNY
                         You did? That's funny. So did we.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Yes?

                                     JENNY
                         Yes.

                                     STAR MAN
                         We told our home, and the people who 
                         tell us what to do on my planet said 
                         to come and look but not to talk, 
                         not to land, not to shoot. Just to 
                         look from up there. We came and... 
                         the driver of my ship...

                                     JENNY
                         The captain...

                                     STAR MAN
                         The captain wanted to land to see 
                         close and to get some things from 
                         Earth to take home. The police came 
                         and shot at us. One of the people 
                         from my ship was killed.

                                     JENNY
                         Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was 
                         he a good friend?

                                     STAR MAN
                         I don't understand 'friend.'

                                     JENNY
                         A friend is a person that is good to 
                         you... someone you like to be with... 
                         someone you like to laugh with...

                                     STAR MAN
                         He was a good friend... The captain 
                         took the ship away fast and I was 
                         not in the ship.

                                     JENNY
                         The police shouldn't have started 
                         shooting. But you can hardly blame 
                         them. You surprised them. They didn't 
                         know you were up there. When they 
                         saw you, they thought you were here 
                         to hurt us.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I understand.

                                     JENNY
                         Sounds like your captain's going to 
                         get hell when he gets back home.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What is hell?

                                     JENNY
                         It's bad.

                                     STAR MAN
                         He will.

               Pause. Jenny feels the STAR MAN staring at her. She turns to 
               look at him. His gaze doesn't waver. She looks back at the 
               road, then back at the STAR MAN.

                                     JENNY
                         What are you doing?

                                     STAR MAN
                         Are you my friend?

                                     JENNY
                         Yes.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (smiles)
                         I am your friend.

               EXT. INTERSTATE 80 - NIGHT

               Jenny's Mustang is whipping west out of Lincoln, Nebraska. 
               We HEAR A JUMBLE OF RADIO STATIONS as the SELECTOR is RUN 
               THROUGH THE FREQUENCIES.

               INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT

               Jenny is driving. The STAR MAN finds a RELIGIOUS STATION ON 
               the RADIO.

                                     PREACHER (V.O.)
                              (on radio)
                         God is your creator. God is your 
                         master. God is you savior. God is 
                         the only reason that you exist. If 
                         God...

                                     STAR MAN
                              (during the above)
                         Who is God?

               Jenny is tired. She doesn't want to get into that.

                                     JENNY
                         Nobody knows.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Why?

                                     JENNY
                         I don't know.

               The STAR MAN lets it drop and finds a COUNTRY AND WESTERN 
               STATION.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I like this music.

                                     JENNY
                         I've noticed... Do you understand 
                         what they're saying?

                                     STAR MAN
                         Not all... but it feels like a kiss.

               Jenny smiles at him, then:

                                     JENNY
                         Do you have music up there?

                                     STAR MAN
                         Yes.

                                     JENNY
                         I'd like to hear it. Can you sing 
                         something?

                                     STAR MAN
                         I do not want to.

                                     JENNY
                         Don't be afraid... I'd really like 
                         to hear it.

               She TURNS OFF the RADIO.

                                     JENNY
                         Please.

               He turns away from her, clears his throat and begins. His 
               singing is like nothing we have ever heard. Vibrations of 
               tones and glottal stops blend into a haunting, seductive 
               fugue. The STAR MAN stops.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I am not a good singer.

                                     JENNY
                         That was beautiful.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (incredulous)
                         You liked my singing?

                                     JENNY
                         Yes. Sing some more.

               EXT. INTERSTATE 80 - NIGHT

               With the STAR MAN's SERENADE WAFTING over the Nebraska plains, 
               we FALL BACK TO FIND a Highway Patrol car tagging along at a 
               safe distance behind the Mustang.

               EXT. BEST WESTERN MOTEL - NIGHT

               The STAR MAN stops the Mustang in front of the office. He 
               and Jenny get out and go inside. As the door closes on them, 
               three Nebraska Highway Patrol cars speed up the off-ramp. 
               The lead car turns right on a surface street and enters the 
               motel parking lot at the far end.

               The middle car goes straight across the intersection and 
               positions itself at the curb next to the driveway, giving 
               access to a frontage road which leads to an on-ramp. The 
               last car also turns right on the surface street, but parks 
               in a restaurant parking lot directly across from the office.

               INT. OFFICE - BEST WESTERN MOTEL - NIGHT

               In answer to Jenny's bell, the night CLERK comes out of the 
               living quarters in the back, finger combing his sleep-rumpled 
               hair.

                                     CLERK
                         What can I do for you folks?

                                     JENNY
                         How much are your rooms?

                                     CLERK
                         Thirty-seven fifty for one person, 
                         forty-nine fifty for two.

               Drawn by the bright colors on their covers, the STAR MAN 
               wanders over to the magazine rack. By chance, he selects a 
               copy of 'Playgirl' and begins to look through it.

                                     JENNY
                         You have one with two beds?

                                     CLERK
                         Sure.

                                     JENNY
                         I'll take that.

                                     CLERK
                              (slides her a 
                              registration card)
                         Fill this out.
                              (as Jenny writes)
                         Will this be cash or credit card?

                                     JENNY
                         Credit card.

                                     CLERK
                         I'll have to run your card off now.

                                     JENNY
                              (digging through her 
                              purse)
                         We're only going to be here a few 
                         hours...

                                     CLERK
                         It's still the full price.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Jenny, look...

               From behind the STAR MAN, we WATCH Jenny react to the open 
               Playgirl centerfold that he is holding up.

                                     JENNY
                         Put that back.

                                     STAR MAN
                         But I have never seen this before. I 
                         am not complete.

               Although we cannot see it, we know what he is pointing at.

                                     JENNY
                         Put it back.

               The STAR MAN swivels the picture around so that he can see 
               it. Jenny hands the smirking Clerk her credit card. He steps 
               to the side and inserts it into the imprinter. Out of the 
               corner of his eye, he sees a dot of light leave the STAR 
               MAN's forehead to drop behind the magazine and into his 
               trousers.

               The Clerk glances over at Jenny to see if she hears the 
               HISSING that is going on behind the STAR MAN's fly. She does 
               and she hopes it'll stop soon. His eyes on the STAR MAN, the 
               Clerk fumbles the key to 117 off the rack.

                                     CLERK
                         You can park your car in front of 
                         the room.

               He drops the key on the counter.

               INT. MIDDLE PATROL CAR - NIGHT

               Through his side window, the DRIVER can see the motel office.

                                     DRIVER
                              (into microphone of 
                              his radio)
                         What did these two do?

               INT. LAST PATROL CAR - NIGHT

                                     SECOND DRIVER
                         All anybody knows is that they're 
                         armed and dangerous.

               In the office, he can see Jenny and the STAR MAN leave the 
               counter and head for the door. He raises a pair of binoculars 
               to his eyes for a good head-on look at them.

               THROUGH THE BINOCULARS

               We SEE Jenny and the STAR MAN come out of the motel office.

               BACK TO SCENE

               The Second Officer lowers the glasses and looks down at the 
               telex pictures of Jenny and the STAR MAN taped to the 
               dashboard.

                                     SECOND OFFICER
                         Be a piece of cake for us to take 
                         'em.

               INT. LEAD PATROL CAR - NIGHT

               THROUGH the WINDSHIELD, we can SEE Jenny and the STAR MAN 
               approaching the Mustang.

                                     THIRD DRIVER
                         National Security folks should be 
                         here any minute. Let them take care 
                         of it. That's what they get the big 
                         bucks for.

               EXT. BEST WESTERN MOTEL - NIGHT

                                     STAR MAN
                         I want a drink. May I have two 
                         quarters?

               At the passenger door, Jenny sets her purse on the car roof 
               to take out her wallet.

                                     JENNY
                              (handing it to him)
                         You shouldn't drink so much of that 
                         stuff. It's bad for you.

                                     STAR MAN
                         On the radio they say it's good.

                                     JENNY
                         Hurry up.

               Over her purse she notices the patrol car facing her from 
               the restaurant parking lot. There is certainly nothing unusual 
               about a patrol car in a restaurant parking lot. She shrugs 
               it off and gets in the Mustang.

               INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT

               Jenny's behind hasn't even hit the seat before she sees the 
               patrol car parked on the frontage road off to her left. She 
               looks at the STAR MAN. He's busy pounding on the drink 
               machine. She turns around to check the lot behind her and 
               spots the patrol car there.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (coming to the car 
                              with a drink can in 
                              each hand)
                         The machine gave me two. Should I 
                         put one back?

                                     JENNY
                         No. Get in.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (rounding the hood)
                         You can have one.

                                     JENNY
                              (as he gets in)
                         I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive 
                         for a little while longer.

               The STAR MAN stiffens when he sees the patrol car on the 
               frontage road.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Are you angry at me?

                                     JENNY
                         No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.

               EXT. BEST WESTERN MOTEL - NIGHT

               The Mustang moves toward the frontage road.

               INT. LAST PATROL CAR - NIGHT

                                     SECOND DRIVER
                              (as the Mustang rolls 
                              onto the frontage 
                              road)
                         They made us. Let's get 'em.

               EXT. BEST WESTERN MOTEL - NIGHT

               All three patrol cars jam on their rack lights and, with 
               their SIRENS HOWLING, peel out after Jenny and the STAR MAN.

               INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT

               At the SOUND, the STAR MAN snaps his attention to the rear 
               view mirror. It's ablaze with police lights. He tromps on 
               the gas.

                                     JENNY
                         No.

               INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

               Shermin is patched into the Nebraska Highway Patrol and is 
               listening to the pursuit.

               EXT. INTERSTATE 80 - NIGHT

               The Mustang careens down the on-ramp and squeezes into the 
               traffic a hair's breath ahead of an 18-wheeler. This cuts 
               off the patrol cars momentarily, but the Mustang doesn't 
               have the speed to stay ahead of them. Using the other cars 
               on the road as shields, the STAR MAN dodges from lane to 
               lane trying to keep the police from coming alongside.

               INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT

               The lead patrol car feints forward on the STAR MAN's side. 
               The STAR MAN sways over to cut it off and the middle patrol 
               car slips in next to Jenny. The STAR MAN grabs the gun from 
               under the seat.

                                     JENNY
                         No!!! No!!!

               INT. MIDDLE PATROL CAR - NIGHT

                                     DRIVER
                         He's got a gun!!

               INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT

               Jenny screams.

               A shotgun blast from the middle patrol car rips through the 
               door and into Jenny. Part of the FRONT WINDOW is BLOWN OUT. 
               Bleeding badly, she slumps against the STAR MAN.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Jennyhaydn! Jennyhaydn!!

               Her eyelids flutter open and she tries to speak, but can't. 
               The middle patrol car is lining up for another shot. The 
               STAR MAN slams the Mustang into it, sending it spinning onto 
               the shoulder and into a ditch.

               The last patrol car speeds up to replace it. The lead patrol 
               car slips in next to the STAR MAN. They've got him in a 
               sandwich. The STAR MAN stands on his brakes.

               EXT. INTERSTATE 80 - NIGHT

               Caught by surprise, the patrol cars rocket ahead of him. The 
               Mustang cuts across the swatch of land that acts as a center 
               divider in the highway and races west in the eastbound lanes.

               INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT

               The STAR MAN squints against the headlights of the on-coming 
               traffic as he calmly wedges his way straight through it.

               EXT. INTERSTATE 80 - NIGHT

               The lead patrol car tries to follow him but is clipped by a 
               Cadillac swerving to avoid the STAR MAN and bounced back 
               into the center divider. The last patrol car parallels the 
               Mustang in the westbound lanes.

               INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT

               The STAR MAN realizes he's still boxed in. A car carrier 
               swerves by on his left. The lane behind is open. The STAR 
               MAN takes advantage of the opportunity.

               EXT. INTERSTATE 80 - NIGHT

               The Mustang vaults off the shoulder of the highway into an 
               open field and bullets away through the weeds.

               The rush of oncoming traffic traps the three patrol cars in 
               the center divider.

               INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT

               Jenny moans as the car jostles over the rough ground. The 
               STAR MAN puts out a hand to cushion her ride. His headlights 
               pick up a gravel road splitting the field and he turns onto 
               it. In a quick look back, he sees the patrol car shooting 
               across the highway after him.

               EXT. GRAVEL ROAD - NIGHT

               We FOLLOW the Mustang as it winds upward through the grazing 
               lands sparsely dotted with clumps of trees. The plume of 
               dust kicked up by the fleeing car is turned silver by a full 
               moon. The WAIL OF the PATROL CARS is DISTANT BUT CLOSING.

               EXT. PASTURE - NIGHT

               The Mustang barrels around a curve and slides to a surprise 
               stop before a gate in a barbed wire fence that ends the road. 
               With the .45 in his hand, the STAR MAN jumps out of the car 
               and tries the gate. It is locked.

               When he turns back to the car, he sees something that 
               frightens him more than the approaching patrol cars. A 
               helicopter has joined the chase. He looks for a place to 
               hide. A stand of cottonwood and elm fifty yards on the other 
               side of the gate offers the only protection.

               The STAR MAN opens the passenger door. Jenny is soaked in 
               her own blood. He hooks the strap of her purse over his 
               shoulder, lifts her tenderly and, cradling her in his arms, 
               wiggles between a fence post and the gate and jogs into the 
               trees.

               EXT. PASTURE - NIGHT

               The helicopter sets down behind the Mustang. Shermin leads 
               Bell, Lyman and the technicians to the car.

                                     LYMAN
                              (seeing the blood on 
                              the passenger seat)
                         One of them must be pretty badly 
                         hurt.

               Shermin pushes the seat forward. The STAR MAN's life-support 
               suit is stuffed in the space behind it. The patrol cars skid 
               around the curve.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (to Bell, indicating 
                              the suit)
                         Get this back to the copter.

               Shermin takes a bullhorn from Lyman and goes around to the 
               front of the Mustang. The highway patrolmen get out of their 
               cars behind him.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (bullhorn to woods)
                         Mrs. Haydn, please come out. We don't 
                         want to hurt you or your friend. 
                         Please put down your weapon and come 
                         out.

               EXT. TREES - NIGHT

               Jenny's limp weight is beginning to slow the STAR MAN. He 
               hears the bullhorn but doesn't stop.

               EXT. PASTURE - NIGHT

               Shermin lowers the bullhorn and speaks to the patrolmen.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Okay, fan out. These people have a 
                         gun but we want them alive. 
                         Understand?

               EXT. TREES - NIGHT

               A deep shadow on the other side of an elm offers a likely 
               hiding place. He moves through the underbrush toward it. 
               Without warning, his feet begin to slip out from under him. 
               He struggles to regain his balance.

               When he does he looks down to find himself staring at a RAGING 
               RIVER 150 feet below. The bank on the other side is just a 
               few feet above the water and in the moonlight he can see a 
               flat plain cut by a highway that stretches into the distance. 
               Slowly, he backs away from the edge of the cliff.

               From under the elm he watches the helicopter sweep out over 
               the ravine. Its searchlight darts toward him bleaching the 
               treeline. The overhanging branches cloak him and Jenny and 
               the light passes without picking them up. The STAR MAN adjusts 
               his grip on Jenny and starts off in the opposite direction 
               from the helicopter to look for a way down the cliff.

               EXT. TREES - NIGHT

               Shermin, his people and the patrolmen are combing the woods 
               with flashlights in a picketline search. The Third Driver 
               stops at the mouth of a clearing that runs between the 
               cottonwood and elm to the cliff. He takes a bite off a block 
               of chewing tobacco.

               As he replaces it in his pocket, he sees a shadow flit across 
               the far end of the clearing. He swings his flashlight in 
               that direction. The beam catches a piece of Jenny and the 
               STAR MAN.

                                     THIRD DRIVER
                         Over here! They're over here!

               EXT. TREES - NIGHT

               Standing on the rim of the gorge, the STAR MAN sees the rays 
               of his pursuers' flashlights choking off any possible escape. 
               He eases Jenny to the ground behind a boulder. She whimpers 
               with the pain.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (strokes her cheek)
                         You will be all right.

               He stretches over the top of the boulder and scatters FOUR 
               SHOTS at the lights.

               EXT. TREES - NIGHT

               The patrolmen, the technicians and Shermin all hit the ground 
               and kill their lights.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Mrs. Haydn, we don't want to hurt 
                         you. Put down your gun and come out. 
                         We just want to talk to your friend.

               THE STAR MAN AND JENNY

               The STAR MAN peers around the boulder. At that instant the 
               searchlight from the helicopter happens to splash across the 
               men in the field. He sees that their guns are drawn and 
               pointed in his direction. The STAR MAN pulls back and takes 
               a marble from his pouch. It grows and glows gold as the STAR 
               MAN rolls it between his palms. When it reaches the size of 
               a baseball, he clutches it firmly in his right hand and 
               EMPTIES the .45 toward Shermin and the police. This time, 
               there is a BARRAGE OF ANSWERING FIRE.

               With the BULLETS RICOCHETING around him, the STAR MAN lifts 
               Jenny to his shoulder. He massages the golden orb until it 
               becomes the size of a soccer ball, then takes two quick steps 
               to the edge of the cliff and leaps into the abyss.

               EXT. ABYSS - NIGHT

               The upward thrust of the ball supports their fall and under 
               its glow they begin a slow descent to the other side of the 
               river. Above them, the helicopter dips back and locks its 
               searchlight on the shelf of boulders they just left.

               EXT. PLAIN - NIGHT

               The STAR MAN sets down with the smoothness of a man stepping 
               off an escalator. He looks over his shoulder. The helicopter 
               is still concentrating its spotlight on the ridge. He speaks 
               to the ball in his language.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (subtitles)
                         Iron channel message. Almost caught 
                         by pursuers. This may hinder escape. 
                         Wait for me.

               He lets the ball go and, with even more velocity than the 
               others, it zips into the sky.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. TRUCK STOP - NIGHT

               A WOMAN in a Frederick's of Hollywood negligee lets a TRUCK 
               DRIVER out of one of the Winnebagos parked to the side of 
               the main building.

                                     WOMAN
                         Don't forget to tell the boys where 
                         you had a good time.

                                     DRIVER
                              (calling back to her)
                         You weren't that good.

               Her rusty laugh follows him into the parking lot. He walks 
               between the trucks to a semi which has half of a pre-fab 
               mobile home tied onto its flat-bed. The polyethylene that 
               covers the open side of the house flaps in the WIND at the 
               lower corner next to the cab. The Driver opens his door. He 
               takes out a staple gun and refastens the dark green plastic 
               to the house frame.

               INT. HALF HOUSE - NIGHT

               In the middle of the empty bedroom, the STAR MAN tries to 
               cushion Jenny against the sudden JOLTS made by the semi as 
               it lumbers out of the parking lot.

               EXT. HIGHWAY 76 - NIGHT

               With the Driver taking it smoothly through the gears, the 
               semi picks up speed.

               INT. HALF HOUSE - NIGHT

               The STAR MAN moves Jenny into a rectangle of moonlight shaped 
               on the floor by a high, wide window and strips off her blouse.

               The cold light marbles Jenny's skin and makes the blood from 
               her wounds appear black. With her blouse, the STAR MAN wipes 
               away the blood on the right side of her head and neck. He 
               finds a deep glass cut on her cheek and two entry points in 
               her neck. He concentrates on her cheek and we can SEE the 
               glow of his brain through his human skin.

               A bit of the white light comes out of his forehead. It tumbles 
               across to Jenny's cheek and settles into the wound. The STAR 
               MAN watches intently as one end of the wound flares brightly 
               for an instant, then dies. The flesh left behind has been 
               closed without a scar.

               A larger piece of light drops out of his forehead into what's 
               left of the gash. With that area suffused in a healing glow, 
               he shifts his focus to the pellet holes on her neck. He sends 
               two pieces of light plunging into the wounds. Immediately, 
               they spread into halos which we can SEE radiating from under 
               the skin.

               Out of the night comes a LONG BLAST ON the AIR HORN and the 
               STAR MAN has to steady Jenny as the truck swerves around 
               something in the highway.

               When it settles back into its ride, the STAR MAN wipes the 
               blood off Jenny's shoulder. The beams of the passing cars 
               through the plastic catch the fatigue on the STAR MAN's face 
               as he works over Jenny.

               EXT. HIGHWAY 76 - NIGHT

               With its pre-fab house, the semi rumbles through Julesburg, 
               Sterling and Ft. Morgan. By the time it gets to Denver, dawn 
               is beginning to color the tips of the Rocky Mountains.

               INT. HALF HOUSE - DAWNBREAK

               It's still dark in here. With a chunk of light in his left 
               hand, the STAR MAN dabs at the last of Jenny's wounds, leaving 
               behind a phosphorescent bandage. More of these patches glimmer 
               up and down her right side. He checks her over to see if 
               he's missed a wound. He hasn't.

               He covers her with his windbreaker and, exhausted by his 
               efforts, sits back against the wall. He waits to see that 
               Jenny is sleeping comfortably, then presses the palms of his 
               hands together. The satel compass appears between them. The 
               green dot tells him he is still on course.

               EXT. INTERSTATE - SUNRISE

               Colorado Highway PATROLMEN are dropping orange fluorescent 
               cones across two of the three westbound lanes to form a 
               roadblock. The sound of a harmonica draws us to Shermin's 
               helicopter parked in a meadow beside the road.

               EXT. HELICOPTER - SUNRISE

               As the radio technician plays the harmonica, Lyman clangs 
               down the steps and bends to wake Shermin who is sacked out 
               under the fuselage.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Tell him I'm not here.

                                     LYMAN
                         I did.

               Shermin sighs and rolls over on his back. He looks terrible.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Get me a radio. At least I won't 
                         have to look at his face.

               EXT. MEADOW - SUNRISE

               Shermin is holding a field radio to his ear.

                                     FOX (V.O.)
                         We're growing very concerned back 
                         here. There's no use pretending 
                         otherwise. We're rapidly approaching 
                         a 'condition red.' People are 
                         beginning to ask difficult questions.

                                     SHERMIN
                         I'll make this as simple as I can, 
                         George. They disappeared.

                                     FOX (V.O.)
                         I don't care where you're from you 
                         just can't disappear into thin air.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (through a punchy 
                              hysterical laugh)
                         George, listen to what you're saying. 
                         This thing's changed itself into a 
                         man. Disappearing may not be that 
                         big a deal.

                                     FOX (V.O.)
                         So far you've let it cross the heart 
                         of America. For two days it has been 
                         absorbing information that is 
                         detrimental to our security. I don't 
                         see the humor in that.

               Stung, Shermin takes a deep breath, controls himself and 
               returns the radio to his ear.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Maybe... look, this is just something 
                         to think about... from what I got at 
                         the shopping center, it was more 
                         scared than anything else... I don't 
                         feel it's as big a threat as you 
                         think it is...

                         Is that what's affecting your

                         I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm 
                         doing my damndest to catch them. 
                         Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 
                         70 past Grand Junction. They're 
                         heading west. If they're not flying 
                         we have a damn good chance of getting 
                         them. All I'm asking is that you 
                         people think about it.

                         You just do your job, Shermin. We'll 
                         make the policy.

               EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DAY

               The semi is in the slow lane. Its right rear turn signal 
               blinks steadily telling US that it is leaving the highway 
               and going north at the intersection ahead.

               INT. HALF HOUSE - DAY

               Jenny stirs awake under the windbreaker in the bedroom as a 
               sloppy DOWNSHIFT JOLTS the house. Her eyes flutter open and 
               she looks around the room trying to figure out where she is. 
               The truck leans into the turn. Jenny braces herself on one 
               arm and sits up.

               Catching the windbreaker as it slips off her front, she 
               remembers that she was shot and examines her right side. She 
               runs her fingers over her cheek and neck, across her shoulder 
               and down her side, feeling for traces of the wounds she knows 
               she sustained. She has been completely healed and there are 
               no scars. She leans forward and looks down the hallway.

                                     JENNY
                         Hello... hello.

               The WIND snapping the polyethylene is the only answer she 
               gets. She picks her blouse off the floor next to her purse, 
               but throws it aside and shrugs into the windbreaker when she 
               sees the blood and bullet holes.

               Her sudden rise to a standing position makes her light-headed 
               and she has to lean against the doorway until the spinning 
               stops. With her hands outstretched, as guards against the 
               sway of the truck, Jenny shuffles down the hallway.

                                     JENNY
                         Hello. Where are you?

               There is no one in the kitchen and she continues into the 
               living room. It is empty. Jenny opens the door to an enclosed 
               back porch. It is also empty. The STAR MAN is gone. She 
               returns to the living room and stands there not really knowing 
               what to do next. The countryside rushes by outside a floor-
               to-ceiling picture window.

               A WAIL FROM the semi's AIR HORN jars Jenny out of her reverie 
               and she goes to press her cheek against the window. She is 
               looking past her left hand at the road when she notices a 
               wide green ring on her finger above her wedding band. She 
               steps back from the window to examine it, then with some 
               trepidation, twists it off. As it clears the end of her 
               finger, the STAR MAN's VOICE SPEAKS OUT OF IT.

                                     STAR MAN (V.O.)
                         Jennyhay...

               Jenny drops the ring as if she'd been stung. The STAR MAN's 
               voice stops as soon as she does and the ring bounces across 
               the floor until it hits the baseboard. It looks innocent 
               enough lying there, but Jenny has a great deal of trouble 
               making herself approach it.

               When she finally picks it up, it does nothing. She turns it 
               in her hand and when the side of the ring hole that was facing 
               her when she took the ring off faces her again, the STAR 
               MAN's VOICE CONTINUES.

                                     STAR MAN (V.O.)
                         ...nd. You are all fixed. I'm sorry 
                         you were shot. I was a big problem 
                         for you. Thank you for your help. I 
                         can go to my ship alone now.

               EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

               The semi is picking up speed as it heads north.

               EXT. SEMI'S CAB - DAY

               The Driver checks his side view mirror to see if the lane 
               next to him is clear and is astonished to see a woman's arm 
               sticking out of the polyethylene waving a blouse at him.

               EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

               Smoke billows from under the tires as the semi skids to a 
               stop.

               EXT. SEMI - DAY

               Jenny, her purse over her shoulder, is running toward the 
               cab as the Driver steps out with a wrench in his hand.

                                     JENNY
                         Where did you stop last?

                                     DRIVER
                         What the hell do you think you're 
                         doing?

                                     JENNY
                         Where did you stop last?

                                     DRIVER
                         Stay right there...

                                     JENNY
                         What was your last stop?

                                     DRIVER
                         Elmo's...

                                     JENNY
                         Where's that?

                                     DRIVER
                         About five miles back.

               Jenny's thumb is already out for a ride as she sprints across 
               the highway.

                                     DRIVER
                              (shouting after her)
                         Are there any more in there?

               EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DAY

               A passing car TAKES US TO the STAR MAN as he runs along the 
               shoulder to a maroon and white '57 Chevy that has pulled off 
               to pick him up.

               EXT. '57 CHEVY - DAY

               A swarthy, bald MAN with hairy arms leans across the seat.

                                     MAN
                         Where are you going?

                                     STAR MAN
                         Las Vegas, please. I do not speak 
                         English.

                                     MAN
                         Hop in.

               INT. '57 CHEVY - DAY

                                     MAN
                              (re-entering the flow 
                              of traffic)
                         I can only take you to Grand Junction, 
                         but you'll have a better chance to 
                         get a ride from there.

               The STAR MAN smiles.

                                     MAN
                         Where you from?

               The STAR MAN starts to point to the sky, then catches himself.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I don't understand.

                                     MAN
                         Parlez vous Francais?... Habla 
                         Ingles?... Sprechen zie deutsch?

               These are foreign words to the STAR MAN and he pastes on his 
               smile.

                                     MAN
                         Good job, neither do I. What do you 
                         do for a living?

                                     STAR MAN
                              (pretending)
                         I don't understand.

                                     MAN
                         I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'

                                     STAR MAN
                         No.

                                     COOK (MAN)
                         Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as 
                         a cook. That's how I make money.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I understand.

                                     COOK
                         What do you do?

                                     STAR MAN
                              (searches for an 
                              answer, then)
                         I make maps.

                                     COOK
                         Hey, that sounds interesting. You 
                         like it?

                                     STAR MAN
                         Eh... yes.

                                     COOK
                         Make any money?

                                     STAR MAN
                         No.

                                     COOK
                              (takes a pack of Camels 
                              out of his pocket)
                         You don't get rich as a cook, either, 
                         believe me. I got a girl going to 
                         college this fall. The wife had to 
                         go back to nursing to help pay for 
                         it.

               He sticks a cigarette in his mouth and flips one up for the 
               STAR MAN.

                                     COOK
                         Smoke?

               The STAR MAN takes it, quickly examines it, then positions 
               it in his mouth at the exact angle the Cook did. His eyebrows 
               raise when the Cook flicks his Bic and puffs an ash on the 
               end of his cigarette.

               The butane flame is swung in his direction and he flinches 
               back before allowing the Cook to singe his Camel. He copies 
               the Cook's puffing and the end of his cigarette begins to 
               glow.

                                     COOK
                         She wants to become a doctor. She's 
                         a bright kid. Hard worker. I think 
                         she'll make it. But the damned 
                         inflation's driven the tuition up so 
                         high it makes it real tough on a 
                         family like ours.

               The Cook inhales deeply from his cigarette and blows smoke 
               at the windshield. The STAR MAN mimics the inhalation, then 
               chokes. His eyes bulge and his cheeks puff out as he tries 
               to be cool and not cough. The Cook takes no notice of his 
               struggles.

                                     COOK
                         I got two other kids. I don't know 
                         what we'll do when they get old enough 
                         for college.

               Smoke starts to dribble out of the Star Man's nose and mouth. 
               Puzzled, he re-examines his cigarette.

                                     COOK
                         Everybody blames it on the oil crisis. 
                         That might be where it starts. But I 
                         think a lot of people are just using 
                         that as an excuse to rip the rest of 
                         us off. I see it every day in the 
                         kitchen. Peaches. We use the gallon 
                         cans. The price has gone up three 
                         times in the last year. And now the 
                         cans are only half full.

               The Cook takes another drag. As if etiquette required it, 
               the STAR MAN hurries to copy him. This time there are no ill 
               effects.

                                     COOK
                         Do you have children?

                                     STAR MAN
                         No.

                                     COOK
                         They're damned expensive and a pain 
                         in the ass sometimes, but I wouldn't 
                         trade having them for anything.

               The Cook flicks his ash out of the window. A moment later, 
               the STAR MAN mirrors his action.

                                     COOK
                         What do you think of America?

                                     STAR MAN
                         It is beautiful.

               EXT. ELMO'S - DAY

               A truck stop set back as little as the law allows from the 
               BUZZ OF INTERSTATE 70.

                                     JENNY (O.S.)
                         I'm looking for a guy about this 
                         tall, with brown hair and really 
                         gray eyes...

               We FIND Jenny at the set of fuel pumps nearest the highway 
               dogging an ATTENDANT while he services an 18-wheeler

                                     JENNY
                         He had on tan cords, a plaid shirt 
                         and a baseball cap... probably 
                         hitchhiking.

                                     ATTENDANT
                         I don't pay much attention to those 
                         guys.

                                     JENNY
                              (taking out her wallet)
                         In the last hour or so...

                                     ATTENDANT
                         Nope.

               Jenny folds back the plastic windows to the picture of her 
               husband.

                                     JENNY
                         This is him.

                                     ATTENDANT
                              (shakes his head)
                         Sorry.

               We FOLLOW Jenny as she wends her way through the trucks 
               questioning other attendants. The RUMBLE OF TRAFFIC DROWNS 
               OUT their CONVERSATION, but the answer is always the same. 
               Finally, we FOLLOW the picture as Jenny hands it up to an 
               ATTENDANT cleaning the windshield on a Peterbilt cab.

                                     SECOND ATTENDANT
                              (looking at picture)
                         I don't know... I'm not sure. I might 
                         have seen him up the road a piece on 
                         my way in. He's long gone by now.

               He hands the snapshot back to Jenny. She nods a 'thank you' 
               and looks wistfully around the yard. There is nothing she 
               can do. Fitting the picture back into her wallet, she walks 
               away. After a few steps she turns back.

                                     JENNY
                         You know if anybody here's going to 
                         Wisconsin?

                                     SECOND ATTENDANT
                         Ask inside.

               INT. ELMO'S DINER - DAY

               It's bustling, loud and smoky. Jenny is standing just inside 
               the entrance. She licks her lips and tries to clear the frog 
               out of her throat.

                                     JENNY
                              (small voice)
                         Anybody going to...

               Nobody pays any attention to her. Her voice trails off. She 
               swallows hard and tries again, this time booming out.

                                     JENNY
                         Anybody going to Wisconsin?

               The activity in the diner comes to a screeching halt and in 
               the silence Jenny adds in a normal voice:

                                     JENNY
                         I need a ride.

               An OLDER MAN, with a face seamed by cigarettes and weather, 
               waves at her from the counter.

                                     OLDER MAN
                         I'm going to Des Moines. If you can 
                         wait till I finish here, you're 
                         welcome to ride along.

               This gets some good-humored cheers and catcalls.

                                     JENNY
                         I can wait.

               Smiling self-consciously, she takes a seat at the end of the 
               counter and orders coffee from the waitress. While she is 
               waiting for it to come, she happens to glance outside and 
               sees a Colorado Highway patrol car stopped in the yard.

               The officer on the passenger side is talking to one of the 
               attendants. Jenny turns away from the window and finds that 
               she is able to watch the conversation in a strip of mirrors 
               that runs around the top of the pie case. The squad car leaves 
               and her coffee arrives.

                                     JENNY
                              (to the waitress)
                         Where's the phone?

               INT. SIT-DOWN PHONE BOOTH - DINER HALLWAY - DAY

               Jenny drops a dime in the slot and dials 'O.'

                                     OPERATOR (V.O.)
                         Operator... may I help you?

                                     JENNY
                         Could you give me the highway patrol, 
                         please?

               After TWO RINGS, the phone is picked up on the other end of 
               the line.

                                     MALE (V.O.)
                         Sergeant Packert, Highway Patrol.

                                     JENNY
                         My name's Jenny Haydn. I think you're 
                         looking for me. I was kidnapped in 
                         Eau Claire, Wisconsin a couple of 
                         days ago. But I'm free now.

                                     SERGEANT (V.O.)
                         What was your name again?

                                     JENNY
                         Jenny Haydn. I'm on my way home and 
                         I don't want anybody I'm with shot 
                         at when you...

                                     SERGEANT (V.O.)
                         Hold on.

               EXT. ROADBLOCK (INTERSTATE 70) - DAY

               Standing back of the officers, Shermin watches them check to 
               cars passing through the squeeze point. Every car trunk is 
               opened. Vans and campers are looked into.

               Lyman runs up and whispers in Shermin's ear. Shermin is 
               startled by what he hears. He leaves Lyman in charge and 
               hurries to the helicopter parked in the field beside the 
               roadblock.

               INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

               A TECHNICIAN gives Shermin a headset phone as he enters.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (hand over the mouth-
                              piece)
                         You trace it yet?

                                     TECHNICIAN
                         All we know right now is that it's 
                         east of here.

               Shermin puts on the headset and the technician starts a tape 
               recorder.

                                     SHERMIN
                         This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, 
                         Mrs. Haydn?

               INT. SIT-DOWN PHONE BOOTH

                                     JENNY
                         I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. 
                         Look, I just wanted to tell you that 
                         I'm all right and I'm on my way home.

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         You've been through quite an ordeal, 
                         Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where 
                         you are and let us pick you up? We'll 
                         fly you home.

                                     JENNY
                         No. You'll want to ask a lot of 
                         questions I don't want to answer 
                         right now. I already have a ride.

               INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

               The Technician hands Shermin a note which reads: ELMO"S TRUCK 
               STOP/ABOUT 30 MILES EAST.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         I only called to tell you I was free 
                         and not to shoot anybody I was with 
                         if you see me.

               Shermin jabs his thumb upward, indicating that the helicopter 
               should lift off.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Is the man who kidnapped you there 
                         now?

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         I told you. He let me go. I'm on my 
                         way home.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (his hand over the 
                              mouthpiece)
                         Get a highway patrol unit over there.

               EXT. ROADBLOCK - DAY

               Shermin's helicopter lifts off.

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         Mrs. Haydn, I'm going to have to ask 
                         you to stay where you are.

               INT. SIT-DOWN PHONE BOOTH

               A sharp rap on the glass startles Jenny and she turns around 
               to see her ride.

                                     OLDER MAN
                         Ready?

               Jenny holds up a finger that asks for a moment longer on the 
               phone.

                                     JENNY
                              (into phone)
                         Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name 
                         again?

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         Marc Shermin.

                                     JENNY
                         Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If 
                         you want to ask me any questions, 
                         call me at home in a couple of days. 
                         I'm in the book.

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         Do you know what you were kidnapped 
                         by?

               Pause.

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         Mrs. Haydn...

                                     JENNY
                         He doesn't want to hurt anybody. 
                         Please leave him alone.

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         Is he on his way to Lathrop Wells?

               This hits Jenny like a kick in the stomach. She leans her 
               head back against the wall. Her ride is pacing outside the 
               booth.

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         What's he planning to do in Lathrop 
                         Wells? Is he meeting someone there?

               Jenny smashes the receiver back in its cradle and throws 
               open the door.

                                     JENNY
                              (on her way past the 
                              weathered driver)
                         I changed my mind. Thanks.

               She rushes down the hallway to the dining area where again 
               she stands just inside the entrance.

                                     JENNY
                              (at the top of her 
                              lungs)
                         It's me again...

               The place goes quiet except for a smattering of laughter.

                                     JENNY
                         I need a fast ride west.

               INT. PORSCHE - DAY

               The speedometer reads 90. The driver, a bespectacled, pimply-
               faced SIXTEEN YEAR OLD, shifts into fifth gear. Jenny is 
               harnessed in the passenger seat. Chatter from a CB under the 
               dash COMPETES WITH ROCK N' ROLL ON THE TAPE DECK.

                                     JENNY
                         You sure this is your car?

                                     TEENAGER
                              (with a stutter)
                         My grandmother's rich.

                                     JENNY
                              (as they come up on a 
                              station wagon)
                         Slow down, slow down.

                                     TEENAGER
                         Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.

               But he downshifts. The Porsche is going a mere 80 when they 
               pass the station wagon.

                                     JENNY
                              (peering at its 
                              occupants)
                         I told you I'm looking for someone.

                                     TEENAGER
                         In the cars, too?!

                                     JENNY
                         I don't know where he is.

                                     TEENAGER
                         This is going to be a real drag. I 
                         thought you wanted to go fast.

               Howling at full throttle, three highway patrol cars rush 
               past them in the opposite direction. Jenny swivels around to 
               follow their progress until they are out of sight.

                                     TEENAGER
                         They after you?

                                     JENNY
                         What? No, of course not.

                                     TEENAGER
                              (his stutter thicker 
                              than before)
                         Would be kinda neat if they were. I 
                         think I could outrun them. Maybe get 
                         my picture in the papers.

               Jenny takes a second look at this guy. He flashes her a gap-
               toothed grin.

               EXT. OVERPASS - DAY

               The Cook's '57 Chevy makes a left on the street intersecting 
               the off-ramp and stops at the curb. Behind it a large plastic 
               yellow chicken twirls on a pole above the restaurant it 
               advertises.

                                     COOK
                         Well, here we are... You go down 
                         that ramp there, you're sure to get 
                         a ride.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (getting out)
                         Thank you.

                                     COOK
                         And don't be shy about your English. 
                         You speak better than a lot of people 
                         I know.
                              (leaving)
                         Take care of yourself.

               As an afterthought, the STAR MAN duplicates the Cook's wave, 
               then heads down the ramp. As he clears the frame, our VIEW 
               ZOOMS AND ZOOMS AND ZOOMS UNTIL we can SEE a piece of the 
               roadblock in the valley below him. During the MOVE-IN, we 
               BEGIN TO PICK UP CB CHATTER.

                                     VOICES (V.O.)
                         Flash for all you good buddies heading 
                         west on 70. Smoky's got a roadblock 
                         just beyond Grand Junction... Better 
                         dump your dope, they're going through 
                         everything... He's right. I was just 
                         there and I'm still sore...

               INT. PORSCHE - DAY

               Jenny TURNS DOWN the ROCK 'N ROLL to listen to the CB.

                                     VOICES (V.O.)
                         Ah loves to be frisked! What are 
                         they looking for? I'm holding. Any 
                         way around it? Where are you? Oh 
                         no!! There it is!!

                                     TEENAGER
                         I bet you we find your friend at the 
                         roadblock.

               Jenny doesn't answer immediately. She takes her time checking 
               out the people in a VW they are passing.

                                     JENNY
                              (to the road ahead)
                         We better find him before that.

               EXT. INTERSTATE 70 - DAY

               In the style prescribed by Jenny, the STAR MAN raises his 
               thumb to a dilapidated Vega shimmying down the on-ramp. The 
               two blue-haired ladies inside are afraid to look at him as 
               they go by. He has the same luck with an attractive blonde 
               secretary that passes on the highway.

               EXT. ELMO'S - DAY

               A highway PATROLMAN is standing behind the open door of his 
               car speaking into the mike of his radio.

                                     PATROLMAN
                         The girl's not here, Mr. Shermin. 
                         Seems right after she talked to you, 
                         she got a ride west with a kid.

               INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

               All six TV screens display the road rushing under it.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (into mouthpiece of 
                              his headset)
                         You get that, Lyman?

                                     LYMAN (V.O.)
                         We're ready.

               EXT. SKY ABOVE INTERSTATE 70 - DAY

               Shermin's S65 banks through a U-turn and chases west.

               EXT. INTERSTATE 70 - DAY

               A dun-colored Roadrunner gurgles down the ramp and stops in 
               front of the STAR MAN. Two grubby LONG HAIRS in worn western 
               clothes are inside with boxes of house-hold utensils and 
               duffle bags.

                                     LONG HAIR
                         Where you going?

                                     STAR MAN
                         Las Vegas, please.

                                     LONG HAIR
                         We're going to L.A.

               He looks at his buddy stretched on the jumble in the back. 
               The buddy nods.

                                     LONG HAIR
                         Sure. Get in. We can drop you in 
                         Vegas or get you darn close.

               The STAR MAN opens the door and gets in.

               INT. PORSCHE - DAY

               The CB CONTINUES TO CRACKLE with news of the roadblock. 
               Jenny's eyes restlessly search the overpass under the whirling 
               yellow chicken for any sign of the STAR MAN. She sees the 
               dun-colored Roadrunner waiting at the foot of the on-ramp 
               for a break in the traffic, but she is too far away to see 
               who's inside. As the Porsche gets closer, it overtakes an 18-
               wheeler and Jenny's view of the Roadrunner is cut off 
               entirely. She passes without seeing the STAR MAN.

               EXT. INTERSTATE 70 - DAY

               The Porsche weaves through the traffic giving Jenny a chance 
               to look into the cars and trucks it shoots by.

               INT. PORSCHE - DAY

               Jenny is turned around looking back at a camper.

                                     TEENAGER
                         I'm telling you, you're going to 
                         find him at the roadblock, or right 
                         after, or not at all.

                                     JENNY
                         If he didn't want to go through the 
                         roadblock, is there any other way to 
                         get to Vegas?

                                     TEENAGER
                         Fly.

               Jenny gives him a withering look.

                                     TEENAGER
                         The five-fifty. We already passed 
                         it. But it'll take him way out of 
                         his way.

                                     JENNY
                         Pull over. I've got to get back there.

                                     TEENAGER
                         Why wouldn't he want to go through 
                         the roadblock?... What did you guys 
                         do?... I won't tell anybody.

                                     JENNY
                         It's easier not to tell if you don't 
                         know.

               EXT. INTERSTATE - DAY

               The Porsche slows to a stop on the shoulder.

                                     TEENAGER
                              (as Jenny opens the 
                              door)
                         Wait. Could I have your autograph?

                                     JENNY
                         Sure.

               She leans back and gives the startled Teenager a kiss on the 
               mouth, then gets out.

                                     TEENAGER
                         I have nothing to do. I'd like to 
                         help you.

                                     JENNY
                         Don't worry. I'll be all right.

               She closes the door. The Teenager takes a last look at her 
               before pulling back on the highway. Jenny waits for a car in 
               the slow lane to go by, then runs across to the line and 
               waits for cars in the fast lane to go by.

               INT. ROADRUNNER - DAY

               The STAR MAN spots Jenny standing on the line peering into 
               the on-coming cars for signs of him. He becomes agitated and 
               his mouth begins to move soundlessly. There is a break in 
               the traffic and Jenny dashes to the center divider. The STAR 
               MAN leans across his driver and yells as the Roadrunner 
               plunges by her.

                                     STAR MAN
                         JENNYHAYDN!!!

               EXT. INTERSTATE - DAY

               Jenny spins around to see the Roadrunner skid to a stop on 
               the shoulder and the STAR MAN get out. A motorcycle bombs 
               by. He starts across the lanes of traffic toward Jenny. A 
               truck blasts past him in the slow lane. He is buffeted into 
               the fast lane. Jenny runs down the center divider to meet 
               him. A VW honks, its tires squeal on the pavement as it 
               swerves around him. He reaches the safety of the center 
               divider. Jenny throws her arms around him and lays her head 
               against his chest. He stands there uncomfortably not knowing 
               how to respond to this human emotion.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I told you goodbye. Why are you here?

                                     JENNY
                         The police are waiting for you up 
                         ahead. There's a roadblock. You have 
                         to go back.

                                     STAR MAN
                         This car will take me to Las Vegas. 
                         I cannot go back.

                                     JENNY
                         The police know about Lathrop Wells. 
                         We have to go another way. Come on.

               She grabs his wrist but he hangs back.

                                     STAR MAN
                         If I don't meet the ship, my people 
                         will go home without me.

                                     JENNY
                         Please understand. If you go this 
                         way, you'll never get to your ship. 
                         The police know about Lathrop Wells. 
                         We have to go another way. I'll get 
                         you to your ship. I promise.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I will go. But not you.

                                     JENNY
                         You shit! I'll decide if I go or 
                         not. Not you. I don't know what you 
                         do on your planet, but I didn't think 
                         that was very nice walking out on me 
                         like you did.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I don't want you to be hurt.

                                     JENNY
                         Come on.

               Holding the STAR MAN's hand, Jenny pulls him toward the road.

                                     JENNY
                         I didn't ask to come along on this 
                         trip, but I sure as hell am going to 
                         be the one to say when I get off.

               They bolt across the lanes of traffic to the other side of 
               the road where she flags down an old black pickup truck. She 
               says something to the driver and she and the STAR MAN climb 
               into the back. As the truck returns to the highway, the CLACK 
               OF AN APPROACHING HELICOPTER OVERPOWERS the TRAFFIC SOUNDS.

               EXT. SKY - DAY

               Shermin's helicopter slices around a pine-dotted peak 
               following the twists of Interstate 70 below. In the near 
               distance, we can SEE the roadblock.

               INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

               Unnoticed by Shermin or the Technicians, the black pickup 
               passes off the television screens carrying their quarry east.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (into headset)
                         Any sign of either of them yet?

               The roadblock appears on the television screens.

               EXT. ROADBLOCK - DAY

               Lyman, wearing a headset plugged into a belt pack, is walking 
               down the line of cars.

                                     LYMAN
                         I don't think they're going to show.

               INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

               A swift kick from Shermin sends a stool clanging into a 
               bulkhead. The Technicians won't meet his eyes when he turns 
               back to them.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Okay. Tell the highway patrol to 
                         block all major arteries off 70 from 
                         here to Elmo's.

               EXT. INTERSTATE 70 - DAY

               Two highway patrol cars scatter the traffic in front of them 
               with their rack lights and SIRENS.

               EXT. PICKUP - DAY

               Jenny and the STAR MAN are sitting against the cab, a horse 
               blanket drawn up around their shoulders. They can see the 
               flashing lights coming from way down the road and watch 
               helplessly as the patrol cars eat up the distance between 
               them.

               EXT. INTERSTATE 70 - DAY

               The pickup makes the turn onto Highway 550.

               EXT. PICKUP - DAY

               For a moment, Jenny and the STAR MAN think they're safe. 
               That hope turns to despair when the two patrol cars loop 
               after them. They keep getting closer. The STAR MAN inches 
               the blanket up over his nose. Unexpectedly, the patrol cars 
               are thrown into a skid. When they stop, they are facing each 
               other ready to inspect the traffic coming off 70. They lower 
               the blanket from their faces. Jenny lays her head back against 
               the cab, exhausted.

                                     STAR MAN
                         The Cook said I speak good English.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. HIGHWAY 550 - LATE AFTERNOON

               A RUMBLE OF DISTANT THUNDER follows the lightning that flashes 
               from the dark clouds hanging on the horizon. Looking 
               incomplete without its trailer, the tractor/cab of a Mack 
               truck makes a turn on a farm road, revealing Jenny and the 
               STAR MAN standing on the gravel. The STAR MAN looks back to 
               where they came from. There is nothing coming so he sets out 
               in the other direction.

                                     JENNY
                         Where are you going?

                                     STAR MAN
                         I must meet my ship.

                                     JENNY
                         Why can't we wait here for a ride?

                                     STAR MAN
                         I feel better if I move.

                                     JENNY
                         We're hundreds of miles from where 
                         you have to be.

               The STAR MAN ignores her and continues to walk.

                                     JENNY
                              (shouts at him)
                         Even if we walk five miles, it's not 
                         going to make any difference.

               Jenny turns toward an oncoming car and sticks out her thumb. 
               The STAR MAN falls into the same pose just back of her. The 
               car honks at them as it breezes by.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (screams after it)
                         Asshole!!

                                     JENNY
                              (shocked)
                         Where did you learn that?

                                     STAR MAN
                         The cook.

               EXT. ROADSIDE - LATE AFTERNOON

               A torrential rainstorm lashes the countryside. The STAR MAN 
               and Jenny splash along the edge of the asphalt. Their heads 
               are lowered against the weather. They are both drenched to 
               the skin.

                                     JENNY
                              (after a few steps)
                         We're not going to get a ride tonight.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I can't stay on this planet.

                                     JENNY
                         No one's traveling in this weather.

                                     STAR MAN
                         You promised you would get me to my 
                         ship.

                                     JENNY
                              (shouts after him)
                         I will. I will. We still have another 
                         day.

                                     STAR MAN
                         You promised.

                                     JENNY
                         What do you want from me? There are 
                         no cars on this road. I didn't ask 
                         for this stupid storm.

               The STAR MAN mutters in his language.

                                     JENNY
                         What are you saying?

                                     STAR MAN
                         You can stop. I will go on alone.

                                     JENNY
                         We're too far away to walk. Don't 
                         you understand?

               The STAR MAN looks at her. With the rain streaming off his 
               face, he looks at her. For the first time, the reality of 
               the situation hits him. He turns and, swearing in his own 
               language, flails at the rain. A distance from Jenny, he stops 
               and cries out in English.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I can't stay here. I want to go home. 
                         I don't want this skin. I don't want 
                         to look like this.

               Jenny can see him standing with his head bowed. She walks 
               over to him.

                                     JENNY
                              (trying to ease his 
                              pain)
                         Why don't you send one of your radio 
                         balloons and tell your captain that 
                         you might be late?

                                     STAR MAN
                         I used the last one to jump off the 
                         cliff...

                                     JENNY
                         Let's find a place out of the rain. 
                         I'm sure we'll get a ride in the 
                         morning.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I can't be late. I don't know if the 
                         radio balloons work above your planet. 
                         I don't know if my words went to the 
                         ship. If I'm not there, the captain 
                         will think I'm dead and go.

                                     JENNY
                         We'll get a ride in the morning.

               A flash of lightning shows us:

               EXT. DESERTED RAILROAD SIDING - DUSK

               Jenny and the STAR MAN are following the tracks to an 
               abandoned boxcar.

               INT. BOXCAR - DUSK

               The STAR MAN climbs in and pulls Jenny after him. Jenny is 
               shivering badly.

                                     JENNY
                         Can you close the door?

               The STAR MAN scrapes it forward. He activates the satel 
               compass which lights the interior of the boxcar. While he is 
               doing this Jenny turns her back to him and takes off her 
               jacket. Her teeth chattering, she tries to wring the water 
               out of it.

                                     STAR MAN
                         You are cold.

                                     JENNY
                         You're damn right I am.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I do not get cold.

               Clutching the windbreaker to her breasts, Jenny looks at the 
               STAR MAN over her shoulder. It doesn't take her long to make 
               up her mind.

                                     JENNY
                              (crossing to him)
                         Open your shirt.

               She waits while he struggles with the buttons. After two she 
               brushes away his hands and undoes the rest. She lets the 
               windbreaker drop and, slipping her arms around his waist, 
               presses her bare chest against his.

                                     JENNY
                              (savoring it)
                         Oh, you're warm... put your arms 
                         around me.

               The STAR MAN does and Jenny jumps as the wet sleeves touch 
               her back.

                                     JENNY
                         Take your shirt off.

               It is difficult with Jenny around his waist, but he manages. 
               He drapes his arms over her. She snuggles into him. The RAIN 
               POUNDS ON THE ROOF. Gradually, Jenny responds to the STAR 
               MAN's warmth and relaxes. She lifts her head off his chest 
               and looks at him.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What?

                                     JENNY
                         Nothing.

               She brushes her lips against his. The STAR MAN's not sure 
               what's happening. But he's not offended. Her next kiss is 
               full and long. He accepts it with his eyes open and when she 
               eases back he leans in for more. Jenny responds. As if on 
               command, the satel compass comes from around behind the STAR 
               MAN to hover in back of Jenny. He takes it between his palms 
               and extinguishes it.

               INT. BOXCAR - MORNING

               Jenny awakens and looks around. The STAR MAN is not with 
               her. As she stands up she hears his VOICE OUTSIDE. He is 
               speaking to something in his language.

               She goes to the door to find out what and sees him standing 
               beside a fenced-in pasture talking to the horses inside.

               EXT. PASTURE - MORNING

               Jenny joins the STAR MAN at the fence.

                                     JENNY
                         Good morning.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Horses.

                                     JENNY
                         You don't forget anything, do you?

                                     STAR MAN
                         No.

               Jenny pets one of the horses on the nose.

                                     JENNY
                              (to the horse)
                         Hello... hello. How are you this 
                         morning?

                                     STAR MAN
                         Do they talk?!

                                     JENNY
                              (laughs)
                         No, they don't talk... We talk to 
                         them.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I understand.

               An appaloosa nudges her way through the others to the fence.

                                     JENNY
                         Oh, you're pretty...

                                     STAR MAN
                         I gave you a baby last night.

               Shocked, Jenny looks at him from around the appaloosa's nose. 
               The STAR MAN is combing a horse's mane with his fingers and 
               he doesn't see her expression.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (meaning the horses)
                         They are beautiful.

                                     JENNY
                         Yes, they are.

                                     STAR MAN
                         You have been very good to me, 
                         Jennyhaydn.
                              (turns to face her)
                         You said you wanted a baby, so I 
                         gave you one.

                                     JENNY
                              (shakes her head 'no')
                         But...

                                     STAR MAN
                         It will be human and it will look 
                         like this.
                              (touches his face)
                         But when it comes it will know 
                         everything I know and everything you 
                         know. That is something from my planet 
                         that I want your baby to have.

                                     JENNY
                         I told you it's impossible for me to 
                         have a baby.

                                     STAR MAN
                         You will have this baby. If you want 
                         it. If you don't, I can stop it now.

               Jenny comes over and puts her arms around the STAR MAN.

                                     JENNY
                         I want it.

               EXT. SKY - DAY

               A formation of six black Bell Cobra helicopters rush at us 
               out of the blue. From above them we can see that they are 
               heading for a small desert town. 'Welcome to Lathrop Wells' 
               is spelled out on a hillside in white-washed stones.

               EXT. AIRSTRIP - DAY

               Grubby, unshaven and unwashed, Shermin, Bell, Lyman and the 
               rest of the crew watch the seven Cobras land in sequence. 
               Fox, immaculate in a freshly pressed black flight suit, climbs 
               out of the first one down and he and Shermin meet in the 
               middle of the runway.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Hello George.

                                     FOX
                         Shermin...

                                     SHERMIN
                         What's all this for?

                                     FOX
                         We have a new directive. I'm taking 
                         over.

                                     SHERMIN

                         Lathrop Wells was never anything but 
                         a bus stop. East is the nuclear site. 
                         There are no roads in there. She was 
                         teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling 
                         you. We block the four roads into 
                         Death Valley and we got him.

                         to hold him? He can change himself 
                         into a man. He can disappear.

               EXT. LAS VEGAS - LATE AFTERNOON

               A fire-engine-red Pontiac convertible with two COWBOYS (late 
               fifties) in the front and Jenny and the STAR MAN in the back 
               moves with the traffic along the main drag in the downtown 
               area. The STAR MAN's head swivels from side to side trying 
               to take in the neon that juts up around him. The convertible 
               stops at a light. The cowboy on the passenger side opens the 
               door and tips his hat to Jenny as she and the Star Man get 
               out of the back seat.

               EXT. SIDEWALK (LAS VEGAS) - LATE AFTERNOON

               The STAR MAN is afraid of the crush of people and wants to 
               stay close to Jenny, but is fascinated by the whir and click 
               and jingle of the one-armed bandits that seem to be 
               everywhere.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Is this gambling?

               Jenny nods. A LADY in curlers and pedal pushers hits a twenty 
               dollar jackpot. Hanging onto Jenny's hand the STAR MAN turns 
               around and walks sideways to watch the quarters tumble out 
               into the lady's shopping bag.

                                     STAR MAN
                         The cowboys were right. You can make 
                         money fast gambling.

                                     JENNY
                         You don't make money gambling. You 
                         lose it.

               INT. DRUG STORE - LATE AFTERNOON

               The STAR MAN hangs back to examine a one-armed bandit inside 
               the front door while Jenny goes to the counter. An almost 
               imperceptible blue haze seems to seep from under the STAR 
               MAN's palms as he runs his hands up and down the sides of 
               the machine.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                              (to the clerk)
                         Do you have a good map of Death 
                         Valley?

                                     CLERK (V.O.)
                         We should have. Let me see.

               While the clerk searches for the map the STAR MAN comes up 
               to Jenny.

                                     STAR MAN
                         May I have twenty-five cents, please?

                                     JENNY
                         What for?

                                     STAR MAN
                         I want to gamble.

               Jenny sighs and rolls her eyes and fishes two quarters out 
               of her purse and hands them to him.

                                     JENNY
                         Here are two quarters. When you lose 
                         these, you're not going to get 
                         anymore.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I understand.
                              (heading back to the 
                              machine)
                         Thank you.

               He drops a quarter into the slot and pulls the handle. While 
               the pictures of fruit spin behind the view window, his hands 
               stroke the sides of the machine. An orange, a pear and a 
               cherry stop in the view window. At the counter Jenny explains 
               to the clerk that she is hitchhiking and wants the busiest 
               route into Death Valley without going through Lathrop Wells. 
               The STAR MAN looks long and hard at the machine before putting 
               in his last quarter. He pulls the handle. The blue haze flows 
               from his palms, three cherries lock into a line and the one-
               armed bandit begins to spit quarters.

               INT. CASINO - LATE AFTERNOON

               Jenny is nervous about being here. She feels every face that 
               looks at them could be a cop. The STAR MAN is pulling her 
               through a Maginot Line of slot machines toward a 'Super 
               Jackpot' machine that advertises a $275,000 payoff.

                                     JENNY
                         This is crazy. We don't have time 
                         for this.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I know how to gamble now.

                                     JENNY
                         You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we 
                         don't get a good ride before dark we 
                         could miss your ship.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I want to get money for you and the 
                         baby.

                                     JENNY
                         I don't need any money for the baby. 
                         I'll be fine.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Inflation, tuition, college. Children 
                         are damned expensive. I know.

                                     JENNY
                         The cook again?

                                     STAR MAN
                              (stepping up to the 
                              'Super Jackpot')
                         Yes.

                                     JENNY
                         If I ever run into that guy, I'm 
                         going to kick his ass.

               The STAR MAN pops a gleaming silver dollar into the machine, 
               pulls the handle and places his hands against the metal. 
               Jenny, knowing it can't work, but hoping that it will, stands 
               back and gnaws on her thumb. Then she sees the blue haze 
               vibrating out of the STAR MAN's palms. Jenny stifles a scream. 
               She looks around to see if anybody else has noticed. They 
               haven't. The STAR MAN smiles at her. The force field does 
               it's work. A picket line of 7's fills the view window. Amid 
               the jangle of bells and flashing lights that accompany a 
               winner Jenny doesn't know whether she should jump for joy or 
               hide her face.

               EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DUSK

               A dot in the distance becomes a brand new Camaro. As it blasts 
               away from under us we see a paper license in its back window. 
               The cabin light is on inside the car.

               INT. CAMARO - DUSK

               In the passenger seat the STAR MAN is riffling through a 
               Columbia "History of the World." A Webster's Dictionary is 
               on the dash in front of him. Wedged between his legs and the 
               transmission well is a shopping bag full of money.

                                     JENNY
                         It'll tell you pretty much everything 
                         about us...

                                     STAR MAN
                         This is very interesting. We are 
                         born knowing our history. We have 
                         other books. But not a book like 
                         this.

                                     JENNY
                         Any words you don't know you can 
                         find in the dictionary.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I understand.

                                     JENNY
                         It'll give you the different 
                         countries, how they came to be, what 
                         they are now, how America came to 
                         be, the governments, the languages... 
                         everything.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (chuckles)
                         Many of my people will not believe 
                         those things are possible. On my 
                         planet there is only one government, 
                         one people, one language. I will be 
                         asked a lot of questions.

                                     JENNY
                         What will you say about us?

                                     STAR MAN
                         I will say that we can be friends.

                                     JENNY
                         We can.

               She notices the green ring on her left hand and takes it 
               off.

                                     JENNY
                         This is yours...

                                     STAR MAN
                         If you want to keep it, you can.

                                     JENNY
                         I'd like to...

               She slips it back on her finger above her wedding band. They 
               drive in silence. The STAR MAN sets the history book on the 
               dash.

                                     JENNY
                              (takes the ring off 
                              again)
                         Would you put some of your singing 
                         in this for the baby?

                                     STAR MAN
                         You want the baby to laugh at me.

                                     JENNY
                         Yes.

               EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DUSK

               With the STAR MAN SINGING IN HIS LANGUAGE, the Camaro moves 
               further into Death Valley. The SONG FADES and we:

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               The Camaro blows by a gas station, closed for the night.

               INT. CAMARO - NIGHT

               The STAR MAN shifts restlessly in his seat as he searches 
               the ghostly landscape for something familiar. He activates 
               the satel compass. The red and green dots are touching.

                                     JENNY
                         How long will it take you to get 
                         home?

                                     STAR MAN
                              (absently)
                         Many, many days and nights...

               He presses the satel compass into his palms.

                                     JENNY
                         Would you like to listen to some 
                         music?

               The STAR MAN shakes his head "no."

                                     JENNY
                         I'm sure we could find a country and 
                         western station.

                                     STAR MAN
                         No, thank you.

               Jenny takes his hand in hers.

                                     JENNY
                         Don't worry. Everything's going to 
                         be fine.

               The STAR MAN smiles wanly at her.

                                     JENNY
                              (leans forward to 
                              look up at night sky)
                         Which star is yours?

               It only takes the STAR MAN an instant to find his home.

                                     STAR MAN
                         There.

                                     JENNY
                         Where?

               He directs Jenny's attention to the constellation Auriga.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (meaning the star 
                              Capella)
                         The yellow one.

                                     JENNY
                         Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When 
                         the baby is born, we'll go out in my 
                         back yard and wave to you.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (smiles)
                         I will wave to you.

               All we can HEAR are the TIRES HUMMING over the road. The 
               Camaro rounds the side of a low hill.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Oh, shit!

               Jenny slams on the brakes. One of the Cobra helicopters, lit 
               from the inside, is parked next to a line of flares across 
               the road ahead.

               EXT. CLOSED GAS STATION - NIGHT

               The STAR MAN is looking through a window at the repair bay, 
               lit by a work light. Jenny is standing in a phone shell on 
               the front of the garage, the receiver to her ear.

               The STAR MAN moves to the office door. He tries the knob. It 
               is locked.

                                     JENNY
                              (to the STAR MAN)
                         They're trying to get him.

               Suddenly the STAR MAN slams his shoulder against the door. 
               It swings open.

                                     JENNY
                         What are you doing?!!

               Fox's voice comes out of the receiver in her hand.

                              (a beat)
                         Okay...

               Tethered by the phone cord, Jenny tries to see what the STAR 
               MAN is doing inside the repair bay.

               INT. REPAIR BAY - NIGHT

               Using an air filter top as a basket, the STAR MAN scavenges 
               from the work bench and the car up on the lift, fuses, lengths 
               of wire, circuit boards from a radio, tubing, metal pipe and 
               a Black and Decker drill. While he is doing this we get 
               glimpses of Jenny pleading his case on the phone. Finally, 
               leaving the receiver dangling at the end of its cord, she 
               comes around to stand in the doorway.

                                     JENNY
                         Mr. Shermin wants to speak to you.

               Shermin looks warily at the headset. When the STAR MAN doesn't 
               speak immediately, he takes the initiative.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Hello...

                                     STAR MAN (V.O.)
                         I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.

                                     SHERMIN
                         We can't let you do that.

                                     STAR MAN (V.O.)
                         I don't want to hurt anybody. I just 
                         want to go home.

               INT. COBRA - NIGHT

               Fox is listening to the conversation.

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         All the roads into Death Valley are 
                         blocked. We'd like to talk to you.

                                     STAR MAN (V.O.)
                         If I talk to you, I will miss my 
                         ship.

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)

                         I'm afraid we can't let you go.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I understand.

               He hangs up.

               INT. REPAIR BAY - NIGHT

               The STAR MAN shaves the rubber off the electrical lines 
               leading into the fuse box and clips two wires of his own 
               onto the exposed copper. With Jenny watching we have a montage 
               of the STAR MAN working through the night: modifying the 
               insides of the Black and Decker drill, cutting out the mid-
               section above the trigger, fitting electrical components 
               into that area, screwing a pipe into the bit-clamp, welding 
               it together with the spark that arcs between the electrical 
               wires.

               INT. OFFICE (GAS STATION) - NIGHT

               Jenny folds a sheaf of money into a sheet of yellow paper 
               and props it on the cash register. 'For Damages. Thank You' 
               is scribbled on the front. She runs out to catch the STAR 
               MAN who is on his way to the Camaro.

               EXT. CAMARO - NIGHT

               Carrying the modified Black and Decker drill the STAR MAN 
               opens the driver's door.

                                     JENNY
                         Where do you think you're going?

                                     STAR MAN
                         Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. 
                         I must go alone now.

                                     JENNY
                         I said I would get you to your ship 
                         and that's where we're going to say 
                         goodbye.

               INT. CAMARO - NIGHT

               Both hands on the wheel, Jenny is burning down the center 
               line. The STAR MAN bends two thin wires trailing out from 
               the grip of the drill. Jenny winces as he buries them into 
               the flesh on either side of his left wrist. The car skates 
               around the corner of a low hill. They can see that the Cobra 
               is still sitting next to the road.

                                     JENNY
                              (glancing at the 
                              modified drill)
                         I hope that works.

               The STAR MAN is lost in concentration.

               Jenny kills her lights and glues the accelerator to the floor. 
               Three MEN scramble from the helicopter with M16s. A BURST OF 
               SLUGS RIPS THROUGH the Camaro's WINDSHIELD. The STAR MAN 
               leans out the passenger window and with an other-worldly 
               scream, fires. The helicopter is BLOWN TO SMITHEREENS. The 
               concussion throws the men to the ground.

               EXT. BURNING HELICOPTER - NIGHT

               The Camaro whizzes through the falling DEBRIS.

               INT. CAMARO - NIGHT

                                     JENNY
                         It works.

               The STAR MAN slumps in exhaustion and pain.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I do not know how many times I can 
                         do this.

               INT. SHERMIN'S HELICOPTER - NIGHT

               It is filled with the radio voices of the Cobra crews setting 
               up to attack the Camaro.

               EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               The Camaro becomes airborne at the crest of a dip. Only its 
               new shocks save the landing.

               INT. CAMARO - NIGHT

               The STAR MAN draws the satel compass out between his palms. 
               The green dot now covers the right half of the red dot. He 
               presses his palms together and looks past Jenny at the rugged 
               foothills.

               The first light of day is starting to color the sky behind 
               them. Jenny and the STAR MAN are startled by the DRUMMING 
               WHOMP OF A HELICOPTER. The STAR MAN looks out the window for 
               its source. He can't see anything. The SOUND FADES. In a 
               moment, it is REPEATED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CAR and AGAIN 
               IT FADES.

                                     STAR MAN
                         If my ship is not here, we are in 
                         trouble.

               This is a truism that Jenny doesn't want to hear and she 
               flexes her fingers on the wheel.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (points at a 
                              distinctive cone 
                              peak)
                         That's where we landed last time. 
                         Right under that mountain.

               Jenny and the STAR MAN steady themselves for the last leg of 
               their journey. Suddenly, their silence is exploded by a COBRA 
               dropping out of the sky in front of them. Its searchlight 
               bangs into their faces and, with its thirty-calibre MACHINE 
               GUNS BLAZING, it comes straight at them.

               Jenny yanks the Camaro onto the shoulder. The SLUGS CHEW UP 
               the asphalt beside it. She fishtails back onto the road. A 
               SECOND COBRA surprises them from the STAR MAN's side. Its 
               MACHINE GUN KNOCKS OUT the BACK WINDOW before he can FIRE.

               The STAR MAN crawls over his seat and arranges himself in 
               the hole that was the back window to meet the Cobras' next 
               FIRING RUN. It doesn't take them long. The first two have 
               been joined by a THIRD. They swoop down on the Camaro.

               INT. LEAD HELICOPTER - NIGHT

               The gunsights lock on the car below. The CO-PILOT squeezes 
               the trigger.

               EXT. CAMARO - NIGHT

               SHOTS THUMP INTO the trunk in front of the STAR MAN and he 
               FIRES. The lead HELICOPTER ERUPTS, raining pieces of hot 
               metal over the desert floor. The other helicopters are jarred 
               out of their run and their BULLETS harmlessly KICK UP SAND 
               on the shoulder. Before they can regroup, the STAR MAN BLOWS 
               THEM OUT OF THE SKY.

                                     JENNY
                         In front!!! In front!!!

               The STAR MAN has to hang on as Jenny dodges the car out of 
               the path of a Cobra skimming over the highway toward them. 
               As it goes over, he is able to get off a SHOT directly INTO 
               its UNDERBELLY. The BALL OF FLAME almost engulfs the Camaro.

               INT. CAMARO - NIGHT

               The STAR MAN slumps down into the back seat breathing hard. 
               Jenny looks over her shoulder at him and is shocked at the 
               strain that shows on his face.

                                     JENNY
                         Hang on.

               She throws the car into a skid and leaves the blacktop for a 
               dirt road winding between two low hills.

               EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

               At the base of a sandstone cliff, the Camaro slides to a 
               stop. Jenny helps the STAR MAN out. She supports him as they 
               struggle toward the protection of the boulders. Fox's Cobra 
               roars over the hill.

                         Over there.

               EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

               The STAR MAN turns toward the Cobra. Weakly, he raises his 
               weapon and pulls the trigger. Nothing happens. The searchlight 
               from the Cobra finds them. Its machine guns begin to raise 
               puffs of gravel around them. Jenny grabs the STAR MAN's arm 
               and pulls him into the relative safety of the rocks. The 
               STAR MAN collapses against the cool stone.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (gasps)
                         I can't shoot anymore.

               Jenny looks out between the crags. Shermin's helicopter 
               arrives to join the Cobra. With their searchlights flicking 
               over the sagebrush, they move cautiously toward the cliff. 
               Jenny turns back to the STAR MAN. He is too weak to run 
               anymore.

                                     JENNY
                              (touches his shoulder

                         End it, Shermin.

               Lyman taps his keyboard. The screens all change to a long-
               shot of Jenny and the STAR MAN with cross-hairs superimposed 
               on them.

               EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

               Shermin's helicopter moves toward Jenny and the STAR MAN 
               standing helpless in the circle thrown by the searchlight.

               INT. SHERMIN'S HELICOPTER - NIGHT

               The cross-hairs have locked on Jenny and the STAR MAN. Shermin 
               knows he can't do it. He picks up a headset.

                                     SHERMIN
                         George... Do you hear me, George?

                                     FOX (V.O.)
                         What?

                                     SHERMIN
                         I just retired.

                                     FOX (V.O.)
                         Shermin!! Shermin!!!

               Shermin flips a switch on the console that cuts Fox off.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (to his crew)
                         Let's get out of here.

               EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

               Shermin's helicopter passes over the heads of Jenny and the 
               STAR MAN and rises into the dawn sky.

               INT. COBRA - NIGHT

                                     FOX
                         Shermin!!!

               He throws down his headset.

                                     FOX
                              (to the pilot)
                         Lock in.

               The gunsights lock in on Jenny and the STAR MAN. Fox's grip 
               tightens on the trigger. Suddenly the helicopter begins to 
               vibrate and drift off its target. Fox looks toward the sound 
               coming from his right and his eyes widen in fear as he sees 
               the STAR MAN's ship looming over him.

               EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

               The spacecraft passes over the top of the helicopter. The 
               whirling downdraft emanating from the spaceship's underbelly 
               yanks the Cobra away from Jenny and the STAR MAN and whips 
               it into a spin which gets faster and faster until it 
               disintegrates and falls to the desert floor.

               EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

               Jenny and the STAR MAN shield their faces against the DUST 
               STORM that billows under the WHINING DESCENT of the 
               spacecraft. It settles into a landing across the dirt road 
               resting on its three pods. With a crack, a cone of bright 
               white light blasts from the underside.

                                     JENNY
                         Well...

                                     STAR MAN
                         I must go.

               Jenny nods.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What do I do now?

                                     JENNY
                         You say you love me and kiss me 
                         'goodbye.'

               The STAR MAN puts his arms around her and holds her tight.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I love you.

                                     JENNY
                              (her head on his 
                              shoulder)
                         I'm never going to see you again, am 
                         I?

                                     STAR MAN
                         No.

               He kisses the tears out of her eyes, then full on the mouth.

                                     JENNY
                         I love you.

               The STAR MAN steps back and places a hand on Jenny's stomach.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Tell the baby about me.

                                     JENNY
                         I will.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Goodbye.

               He turns from her and walks to his ship. Jenny watches him 
               go, then remembers something.

                                     JENNY
                         Wait!!

               She gets the Webster's Dictionary and the Columbia History 
               of the World from the Camaro and runs to the STAR MAN. He 
               takes them and kisses her again.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Thank you, Jennyhaydn.

               Jenny backs away as the STAR MAN walks under the ship into 
               the white light. He waves one last time to Jenny and is 
               swallowed into the ship by the light.

               EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

               Jenny turns away from the stinging sand as the space-craft 
               lifts off. When she looks again, it is high and moving over 
               the foothills. A banking turn brings it back. The ship dips 
               low over her, rocks itself in a gesture of farewell, then 
               shoots off into the stars. When she can no longer see it, 
               Jenny drops her wave with a sigh and starts back toward the 
               Camaro.

               Over her walk, we SUPER:

								FLASHBACK:

6	INT	NEW UNI HIGH - CLASSROOM - DAY - CARMEN IBANEZ

	is beautiful, just 18, and quite pleased with herself  because
	Johnny Rico is clearly infatuated with her.

				RASCZAK (O.S.)
		The end of another school year, and for 
		me no doubt another failure...
		Rico, pay attention !

	The teacher JEAN RASCZAK, 38, a rugged veteran who proudly
	displays his missing hand, scowls at Johnny, bemused.

				JOHNNY
		Sorry, Mr. Rasczak.

	But as soon as Rasczak turns back to the class, Johnny begins to sketch
	a cartoon on his desk's touch screen.

				RASCZAK
		Here in History and Moral Philosophy
		we've explored the decline of 
		Democracy when social scientists brought
		the world to the brink of chaos, and how the	
		veterans took control and imposed a stability 
		that has lasted for generations since...
		You know these facts but have I taught you
		anything of value ? You.
		Why are only citizens allowed to vote ?

	Rasczak points at LANNY, 17, with his stump
.
				LANNY
		It's a reward... what the Federation gives you
		for doing Federal Service.

	Rasczak is crestfallen, makes a big show of patience.

				RASCZAK
		No. Something given has no value !
		Haven't I taught you dimwits anything ?
		I guess they ought to revoke my 
		teaching credential...

	Laughter. Johnny's cartoon, meanwhile, is taking shape:
	Johnny and Carmen flying round planet Venus in a space ship.

				RASCZAK
		When you vote, you're exercising political
		authority. You're using force. And force, my
		friends, is violence, the supreme authority
		from which all other authority derives.

	CARL JENKINS, 18, a superintelligent geek, jumps in.

				CARL
		Gee, we always thought you were the
		supreme authority, Mr. Rasczak.

	Laughter. Rasczak grins.

				RASCZAK
		In my classroom, you bet. Whether it's 
		exerted by ten or ten billion, political 
		authority is violence by degree. The 
		people we call citizens have earned
		the right to wield it.

	DIZZY FLORES, 18, athletic, pretty, no nonsense, chimes in.

				DIZZY
		My mother always says that violence
		never solves anything.

				RASCZAK
		Really ? I wonder what the city fathers of
		Hiroshima would have to say about that.
		You.

	Rasczak points at Carmen.

				CARMEN
		They probably wouldn't say anything.
		Hiroshima was destroyed.

	Johnny presses ´"SEND" on his desk, and the cartoon appears
	across the way on Carmen's screen.

				RASCZAK
		Correct. Naked force has settled more
		issues in history than any other factor.
		The contrary opinion 'violence never
		solves anything' is wishful thinking
		at its worst.

	While Rasczak looks away, Carmen throws Johnny her wonderful
	smile, and Johnny's gone, checked out, flying round Venus.

				RASCZAK
		People who forget that always pay...
		They pay with their lives and their
		freedom.

	Dizzy notices the dreamy look on Johnny's face.
	So does Rasczak. He points at him with his stump,
	snaps Johnny to.

				RASCZAK
		You. Tell me the moral difference,
		if any, between the citizen and the civilian ?

				JOHNNY
		The difference lies in the field of civic
		virtue. A citizen accepts personal
		responsibility for the safety of the body politic,
		of which he is a member, defending it,
		if need be, with his life.
		The civilian does not.

				RASCZAK
		The exact words of the text. But do
		you understand it ?
		Do you believe it ?

				JOHNNY
		Uh, I don't know.

				RASCZAK
		Of course you don't. I doubt if any 
		of you here would recognize 'civic virtue'
		if it bit you in the ass.

	A bell rings. Rasczak shrugs, indifferent.

				RASCZAK
		Well, that's it. Have a nice life.

7	EXT	NEW UNI HIGH - HALLWAY - DAY - JOHNNY AND CARMEN

	walk with their friends. Several COUPLES hold hands. Johnny
	tries to take Carmen's hand, but she demurs. Johnny broods.

				CARMEN
		C'mon, let's see if they've posted the
		math final test yet.

				STUDENT
		Hey, Rico, we gonna take Tesla ?

				JOHNNY
		How should I know ?

				STUDENT
		You're captain of the team !

8	EXT	QUAD - DAY - JOHNNY AND CARMEN

	join other students around a MULTI-SCREEN KIOSK.

				CARMEN
		First thing Fleet Academy looks at
		is your math scores. 
		Wish me luck !

	Carmen enters her name, receives her score:	97% !	She beams.

				JOHNNY
		Good for you.

				CARMEN
		Your turn...

	Then she spots Carl across the way talking with MARCO, 17.

				CARMEN
		Hold on... I wanna talk to Marco.
		His sister's at Fleet !

	Carmen rushes off. Johnny checks his score:	35% ! Crushed, he
	makes sure no none else has seen. Carl walks up to him.

				CARL
		You still haven't kissed her yet ? Don't lie.

				JOHNNY
		What's the hurry ?

				CARL
		Others are waiting.

	Carl points out Dizzy, talking with friends.

				JOHNNY
		Did you read her mind ?

				CARL
		Don't have to... Some mating semaphore
		is pretty hard to miss.

	It's true. You can tell by the way she looks at Johnny.

				JOHNNY
		Yeah, but I want Carmen.

				CARL
		You got it bad.

	Carmen returns to Johnny as Carls heads off.

				CARL
		Don't forget about this afternoon.
			(to Carmen)
		He's always late when he walks you home
		to fish for a kiss.

	Carmen blushes, covers.
	
				CARMEN
		She's flying starships !

				JOHNNY
		Who ?

				CARMEN
		Marco's sister. Can you imagine 
		maneuvering half a million tons through
		crwoded space lanes...
		You gotta have nerves of steel !
		Reflexes are critical

				JOHNNY
		I have good reflexes.

	Carmen notices the way Dizzy's looking at Johnny, doesn't
	like it one bit, takes Johnny's arm.

				CARMEN
		C'mon Johnny, we'll be late for Biology.

9	INT	BIOLOGY LAB  -- DAY - THE BIOLOGY TEACHER

	is an older woman, very spry, also blind. Johnny, Carmen and
	other students gather around covered lab tables.

				BIOLOGY TEACHER
		For our final today, please identify the mouthparts,
		the abdominal organs, and for extra credit, locate the
		nerve cord and count the ganglia.
		You may begin.

	The students remove the cover to reveal large alien bugs, 60
	centimeter ARKELLIAN SAND BEETLES laid out for dissection.

				CARMEN
		Eeuch !

				JOHNNY
		Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.

				BIOLOGY TEACHER
		Just a bug, eh ? We humans like to think we are
		Nature's finest achievement. I'm afraid it isn't 
		true. This Arkellian Sand Beetle is superior in many
		ways. It has fewer moving parts, can reproduce itself
		in vast numbers, and unboud by concerns of ego and
		mortality, makes the perfect selfless member of 
		society.

				JOHNNY
		Better put your goggles on.

	Johnny slices the abdomen open with asurgical laser. Green
	fluid sprays from the slit. Carmen turns away looking ill.

				BIOLOGY TEACHER
		Our galaxy is teaming with insect life. We have
		identified over two billion species so far.
		Human, life, it would seem, is the anomaly.

				CARMEN
		But we 're intelligent. Human minds have invented
		art, mathematics and interstellar travel.

				BIOLOGY TEACHER
		True, we know of no insect society that has
		produced a Shakespeare, an Einstein or a
		Cherynkov, but before you let that go to your
		head, take the example of the Arachnids, a 
		highly organized, highly evolved insect society.

	She points to an insect evolution chart that starts with a
	common ant and ends with a two meter tall ARACHNID WARRIOR.

				BIOLOGY TEACHER
		They are relatively stupid by human standards. Workers
		have an IQ of 12, warriors around 35 , and yet the 
		Arachnids have colonized planets. Over a million years
		of evolution, Nature has provided the Arachnids with the 
		biological means to hurl their spore into space.

	Johnny applies a spreader and jacks the insects abdominal cavity 
	open with aresounding crack. Bug guts gush out.

				JOHNNY
		Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric
		caecal...

				CARMEN
		Excuse me...!

	She heads for the door, hand over her mouth.

10	EXT	CIVIC PARK - DAY - JOHNNY AND CARMEN

	walk home from school together.

				JOHNNY
		35% on the math final !  No one could be
		that dumb with numbers.

				CARMEN
		Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch
		over a bug. How embarassing.

				JOHNNY
		Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere
		if you don't know math.

				CARMEN
		Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are
		dumb with numbers.

				JOHNNY
		Then how come you won't hold hands with me
		at school ?

				CARMEN
		I don't want everyone to see.

				JOHNNY
		Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?

				CARMEN
		How come that's all you talk about anymore ?

				JOHNNY
		It's all I think about anymore.

	Indeed, they are all alone now. The look in Johnny's eye says how
	about it. Carmen grins, reaches for Johnny's hand.

11	EXT	PUPLIC TRANSPORTATION - DAY - CARMEN

	and Johnny stand together near a bank of TRANSPORTERS.

				CARMEN
		You can't walk me home.

				JOHNNY
		Why not ?

				CARMEN
		I thought you were going to help Carl.

				JOHNNY
		Carl can wait.

				CARMEN
		Johnny, my Dad's home today.

	Johnny's face darkens with frustration.

				JOHNNY
		What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm
		a teenager. You can't be a citizen when
		you're only a teenager !

				CARMEN
		It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich
		they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff
		means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.

				JOHNNY
		Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come
		we're such good friends ?

				CARMEN
		Sometimes I do what I want, eh ?

	Carmen steps into the flux.	ZAPPP!	She's gone.
	Johnny grins, happy to be in love.

12	INT	CARL'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY - JOHNNY

	is hard-wired to the stacks of processing units that comprise Carl's 
	basement workshop. Carl concentrates on the image of a playing card,
	the six of diamonds, displayed on a monitor.

				CARL
		Don't think about it... go on instinct.

				JOHNNY
		Ace of spades.

	The ace of spades appears, and the computer indicates "no match".
	Carl puts another card up, the jack of diamonds.

				CARL
		Statistically speaking you should've accidentally
guessed right by know.

				JOHNNY
		In addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves 
		I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts.

	Wrong again.

				CARL
		Luck is not a factor. No one really knows why 
		some people are sensitive and some aren't.
		Federal studies like this might provide a clue.

	The next card up is the nine of clubs.

				JOHNNY
		I wouldn't want to know what everyone was
		thinking. Four of spades.

	Suddenly, A GIANT YELLOW FROG jumps onto the keyboard, fritzing
	the monitor. Johnny removes the blindfold.

				CARL
		Cyrano, you big yellow turd !

	Johnny knows this frog, scratches him on the neck.

				JOHNNY
		He just wants attention. You don't play with 
		him like you used to.

	Carl concentrates for a moment.

				CARL
		Go bug Mom, Cyrano.

	Cyrano's eyes widen. He hops off the table and up the stairs two at
	a time. Carl clears the screen.

				JOHNNY
		How do you make him do that ?

				CARL
		I gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling
		up my mom's leg. He is going to go eat it.

	From upstairs, CARL'S MOM shrieks.

				MOM (O.S.)
		Get out ! Get out ! CARL...!

				JOHNNY
		Carl, promise me you won't ever do anything like that
		to me.

				CARL
		Don't be afraid. Can't do humans... yet.
		C'mon let's go.

	Carl, puts up more cards, Johnny misses them all.

				JOHNNY
		Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for
		Starside R&D ?

				CARL
		Passport to the Universe.
		Who wouldn't want that ?

				JOHNNY
		I've been thinking about applying for 
		Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.

				CARL
		Your father will never let you.

				JOHNNY
		I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd 
		make a pretty good pilot. I've good great
		reflexes. You need that for maneuvering,
		you know.

				CARL
		Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through
		stellar navigation.
		So what do you think your chances are ?

				JOHNNY
		Eight point... no, uh, seven...

				CARL
		If you can't do those numbers, you haven't
		got a chance.

				JOHNNY
		All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, 
		and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.

				CARL
		Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. 
		Now try and pay attention.

	Carl puts a card up.

				JOHNNY
		Queen of hearts.

	The computer indicates a match. Johnny peers around at the monitor.
	It is the Queen of hearts.

				CARL
		Well, what do you know about that !

	suit up in red and gold.

				JOHNNY
		We tumble good, too.

	three minutes and counting on the clock. Johnny grins.

				JOHNNY

				DIZZY

	hurls himself at Johnny, misses. Johnny scores.
	Zander tumbles into the crowd, loses a jump shoe.

19	EXT	SIDELINES - DAY-ZANDER

		I ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.

	Zander heads for the field. Carmen follows, interested.

				CARMEN
		You're going to the Academy ?
		That's where I want to go. I'd love
		to talk to you abou that.

	A REFEREE blows his whistle at Zander, signalling impatiently.

				ZANDER

				CARMEN

22	EXT	SCRIMMAGE LINE - DAY-THE GIANTS

	are in possession. Zander lands hard in front of Johnny.

				JOHNNY
		Don't get any ideas. She's my girl.

				ZANDER
		You can never be sure.

	Johnny scowls at Zander, turns his head to look back at Carmen.
	She waves, smiling. The Giants pull ablitz.

				DIZZY
		WATCH THE BLITZ...!

	Zander knocks Johnny on his ass, and the Giants score. It's
	TIGERS 21, GIANTS 22 and less than a minute to go.

23	EXT	HUDDLE -- DAY -- DIZZY

	orders up the next play. Johnny keeps looking over his shoulder
	because Zander's back talking to Carmen again.

				DIZZY
		Flip six, three hole. Rico ?
		Hey !

	Dizzy slams Johnny upside his helmet with her forearm.

				JOHNNY
		What ?

				DIZZY
		You were drifting. Flip six, three hole.
		On one, got it ?

				JOHNNY
		Just throw me the ball, Diz.

	They make fists and break.

24	EXT	SCRIMMAGE LINE -- DAY -- JOHNNY

	takes position again across the line from Zander who now grins at
	Johnny broadly. Johnny  doesn't grin back. 

				DIZZY
		Hut !

	At the snap, Johnny breaks for open field. Dizzy throws, Johnny catches
	it, trips Zander up painfully, and hurls himself into the end zone as a
	horn sounds the game's finish.

25	EXT	ATHLETIC FIELD - DAY - CHEERING UNI FANS

26	INT	JOHNNY'S HOUSE - NIGHT - JOHNNY

	walks throuh rooms filled with elegant furniture. He's all spiffed up
	for the big dance. His MOTHER catches him preening in front of a
	mirror by the TRANSPORTER in the hall.

				MOTHER
		Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time
		I checked you were only five years old. You had
		such a bright little face...

				JOHNNY
		Aw, don't get mushy.

	Johnny's FATHER enters carrying a FEDERAL SERVICE CATALOGUE.

				FATHER
		This came for you today. I presume on your
		request.

				JOHNNY
		A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...

				MOTHER
		You aren't thinking of applying...?

	Johnny shrugs.

				FATHER
		Have you lost you lost your mind ? I'd rather
		take ten lashes in Public Square than see you
		ruin your life.

				JOHNNY
		It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to
		get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a
		couple of years.

				MOTHER
		Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in
		the Federal Service. If something happened 
		to you I don't know what I would do...

				FATHER
		Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher.
		What's his name ? You know the one I
		mean.

				JOHNNY
		Mr. Rasczak.

				FATHER
		Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be
		a law against using a school as a 
		recruiting station !

				JOHNNY
		No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all.
		He sorta discourages you really.

				FATHER
		Good, because you're going to Harvard,
		and that's the end of it.

				JOHNNY
		I'm eighteen. It's my decision.

				FATHER
Oh, is that how it is ?

				MOTHER
		Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise
		for you that will settle this.
		Can you guess what it is ?

				JOHNNY
		Uh, no.

				FATHER
		A trip to the Outer Rings.
		Whad'ya think of that ?

				JOHNNY
		Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've
		always wanted to go there.

				MOTHER		
		Good good, then it's all settled.

				FATHER
		A year at Harvard and you'll  see this
		"Federal Service" is just menial training 
		for inferior people so they can call 
		themselves "citizens" and take airs for 
		the rest of their lives.

				JOHNNY
		Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal
		and he isn't inferior. He's the smartest 
		kid at school !

				FATHER
		Sorry. Carl's a fine boy...

	Johnny puts on his jacket.

				JOHNNY
		I don't know what they teach at Harvard,
		but I think I'm pretty good enough the
		way I am !
	
				MOTHER
		Johnny, please. Calm yourself.

				JOHNNY
		Well, that's what you're saying ! You're
		saying that I'm not good enough the way
		I am now !

	Johnny stomps out, the transporter goes ZAPPP !

				MOTHER
		Why did you go and do that ? He was all
		ready to go Zegema Beach !

				FATHER
		Teenagers !

27	INT	UNI HIGH GYMNASIUM - NIGHT - EVERYONE

	at the "Farewell Dance" is dressed up. Rasczak and other TEACHERS
	chaperon. A spotlight finds the BAND LEADER.

				BAND LEADER
		Alright, everybody, this is the last dance, so
		let's turn down the lights and make it a
		slow one.

	The lights go down. Dizzy, dressed pretty, brightens when she sees Johnny
	standing alone near the dance floor.

				DIZZY
		Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?

				JOHNNY
		Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...

				DIZZY
		Too bad for her if she's not around.

	Dizzy pulls him onto the floor, holds him close.

				DIZZY
		You know, it's sad... Most of us probably
		won't see each other again after tonight.
	
	There is an invitation here. Johnny doesn't take it.

				JOHNNY
		You still gonna play for Brazil ?

				DIZZY
		Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.

				JOHNNY
		Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.

				DIZZY
		How come we never got together ?

	Dizzy looks at Johnny meaningfully. He's distracted. Carmen crosses
	the room, stunning in her formal.

				JOHNNY
		Can't we just be friends, Diz ?

				DIZZY
		Sure.

				JOHNNY
		Uh, look, Diz...

				DIZZY
		Guess you gotta go.

				JOHNNY
		You're the best.

	Johnny heads for Carmen. Dizzy watches jealously as Carmen takes 
	his hand. She looks around for someone to dance with.
	Carl, a nerd in a tux, waves shyly.

28	INT	GYMNASIUM - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT - CARMEN AND JOHNNY

	dance. Johnny wants to kiss her, Carmen playfully avoids.

				JOHNNY
		Isn't it great to be in love ?

				CARMEN
		How do I know if this is love ?
	
				JOHNNY
		It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't...

				CARL
		Outa the way you two !

	Carl and Dizzy dance by, Dizzy smiling bravely because Carl is a terrible dancer.
	Johnny goes in for the kiss again.

				CARMEN
		Romance is just a vestigial biological
		response to procreation...

				JOHNNY
		Aw, you're in love with me... 
		You just dont know it yet.

	Johnny's confidence makes her smile. Johnny moves in to kiss her,
	but the music ends. Everyone applauds. The lights come up and 
	people head for the doors. Johnny sees Rasczak.

				JOHNNY
		Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.

				CARMEN
		I'll meet you outside.

	Johnny heads over to Rasczak.

				JOHNNY
		Mister Rasczak ?

				RASCZAK
		What is it, Rico ?

				JOHNNY
		I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History
		and Moral Philosophy was the best class
		I had this year.

				RASCZAK
			(smiling)
		Well, it's not really my job to please.
		Hope you learned something.

				JOHNNY
		I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I
		have what it take to be a citizen.

				RASCZAK
		Good for you. Go find out.

				JOHNNY
		Well, my parents are against it, and I 
		know it's my choice, but I was
		wondering...
		What would you do if you were me ?

				RASCZAK
		Figuring things out for yourself is the
		only freedom anyone really has.
		Use that freedom.
		Make your own choice, Rico.

29	EXT	UNI HIGH GYMNASIUM - NIGHT - JOHNNY
	
	walks out and finds Carmen talking with Zander. He wears the blue 
	uniform of a Fleet pilot trainee. Carmen examines his FLEET PIN,
	a pair of silver wings.

				CARMEN
		Johnny, this is Zander.

				ZANDER
		Yeah, we know each other from the game. 
		No hard feeling, eh, chum ?

				JOHNNY
		None at all... We won.

				CARMEN
		Good luck at the academy.

	Zander takes back the wings and pins the to his tunic.

				ZANDER
		Always.

30	EXT	PROMENADE - NIGHT - JOHNNY AND CARMEN

	walk together along the river holding hands.

				CARMEN
		He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy.
		Isn't that great ?

				JOHNNY
		Yeah, sure, I guess.

				CARMEN
		No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a
		chance.

				JOHNNY
		What are you talking about ? We both know
		you're gonna be a pilot.

				CARMEN
		Zander is going for pilot, too.

				JOHNNY
		You two have so much in common.

	Carmen pulls Johnny to a stop, looks him in the eye.

				CARMEN
		Johnny Rico, you're jealous !

				JOHNNY
		I can't help it.

				CARMEN
		He's nothing like you.

				JOHNNY
		I don't even know if you're my girl.

	Carmen smiles, leans in close to Johnny.
			
				CARMEN
		Are you the boy for me ?

				JOHNNY
		I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign
		up for Federal Service.

	They kiss, tentatively, but the passion grows and they break apart,
	breathless.

				CARMEN
		Oh, Johnny...

31	EXT	PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION - NIGHT - JOHNNY AND CARMEN

	making out as they wait their turn. There are a few other people around

		Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...

				JOHNNY
		Who cares ?

				CARMEN
		You're right. Let's never stop...

				POLICEMAN
		Hey, you, there's a place for that !

	Without stopping, Johnny pulls Carmen into the flux.	ZAPPP !

32	INT	FEDERAL HOUSING - NIGHT - JOHNNY AND CARMEN

	kissing at her front door. Johnny moves his hand tenatively to Carmen 's breast.
	She takes his hand, smiling, puts it under her shirt.

				JOHNNY
		I love you, Carmen.

				CARMEN
		Shhh...

	She puts her mouth on his and they melt together. The door flies open,
	and CARMEN'S DAD stands there.

				CARMEN'S DAD
		Carmen, it's late. Get inside.

				CARMEN
		Sorry, Dad. See you, Johnny.

	Carmen ducks inside. Her father looks Johnny over. He carries a terrible
	battle scar oon his face.

				CARMEN'S DAD
		I don't want you around Carmen anymore. Get me ?

				JOHNNY
		Maybe Carmen's gonna make her own decisions from
		now on, Mr. Ibanez.

	Carmen's Dad reddens. He'd like to punch Johnny out.
 
				CARMEN'S DAD
		Carmen's gonna be a citizen. She don't need you
		and your rich family. The Federation'll give her
		everything she needs.

				CARMEN (O.S.)
		Dad, leave him alone...
	
	Carmen's Dad slams the door in Johnny's face.

34	INT	LOBBY - DAY - THE RECRUITING SERGEANT

	is missing one arm. He smiles broadly at the three teenagers.

				RECRUITING SERGEANT
		Fresh meat for the grinder, eh ?

				CARL
		That's us. Where do we sign ?

	He turns in his chair to grab the forms. Johnny and his friends see that he is also
	missing both legs. The Recruiting Sergeant catches them looking, 
	smiles even wider.

				RECRUITING SERGEANT
		Here and here and here.

	As he signs, Johnny looks at the campaign ribbons on the Recruiting Sergeant's
	chest. We hear MUSIC: 	"The Mobile Infantery Anthem" plays softly in honor
	of distant battles.

				RECRUITING SERGEANT
		Welcome to the adventure of Federal Service.
		Follow the blue line.

35	INT	PROCESSING HALL - DAY - JOHNNY, CARMEN AND CARL

	are routed into different lines, joining other hopeful civilians.
	A COLONEL makes a speech over the loudspeaker.

				COLONEL
		There is no guarantee of service. We don't need
		all of you. It costs a great deal to train human beings
		for useful tasks. Many jobs are hazardous to your

37	INT	TESTING FACILITY -- DAY -- JOHNNY

	grimaces as a TECHNICIAN installs an INTERFACE PLATE on

				DON
		Oh, this is the part that hurts !

	A PSYCH OFFICER sits down across from each candidate.

				PSYCH OFFICER
		No talking please. I'm going to ask you some 
		questions. Please answer all questions truthfully.
		We'll know if you don't.
		Birthplace ?

				JOHNNY
		Here in Buenos Aires.

	The Psych Officer checks Johnny's response on a meter.

38	INT	VARIOUS TESTING STATIONS - DAY - JOHNNY

	is poked and prodded, subjected to aural, visual and pharmacological
	stimuli, and scanned from head to toe.

				PSYCH OFFICER (V.O.)
		Are your parents currently citizens ?

				JOHNNY (V.O.)
		No, sir.

				PSYCH OFFICER (V.O.)
		Which do you think is more important,
		courage or confidence ?

				JOHNNY (V.O.)
		Courage, I guess.

				PSYCH OFFICER (V.O.)
		Please complete this sentence.
		I want to be citizen because...

				JOHNNY (V.O.)
		I want to be a citizen because...
		well, because of my girl, sir.

39	INT	DEBRIEF - DAY - JOHNNY

	sits across from a MAJOR who views a list on a monitor Johnny can't see.

				MAJOR
		I'm happy to tell you that you've been
		accepted for Federal Service.

				JOHNNY
		Wow, that's great.

				MAJOR
		Looks like you're quite an athlete.
		Boy, look at those reaction stats.

	The Major clucks his tongue as he highlights the last category on his list:
	MOBILE INFANTERY.

				MAJOR
		My job is to dertermine what you're
		best suited for.

				JOHNNY
		I want to be a pilot, sir.

				MAJOR
		Sorry, son, no way. Your school records
		say you don't have the math skills.

	Johnny swallows this. He knew it was coming. The Major deletes
	"Pilot" from the list, then several other items.

				MAJOR
		That rules out the scientific and engineering
		applications, and I'm afraid we reserve
		non-military options for candidates who are
		frankly less able-bodied than you are, son...

	He turns the monitor around and shows Johnny the list.
	The only thing left is MOBILE INFANTERY.

				MAJOR
		It looks like the only thing you're good
		for is cannon fodder.
		I'm putting you down for the
		Mobile Infantery.

40	INT	AUDITORIUM - DAY - CARMEN

	proudly takes the Federal Service oath with about twenty-five other people,
	a gleaming silver FLEET PIN on her chest. She looks around for Johnny, 
	sees him grinning at her.

				JOHNNY ET AL
		...of my own free will, without promise, coercion,
		or inducement, after having been duly advised
		and warned of the meaning and consequence of
		this oath, do now enroll in the Federal Service
		of the Terran Federation for not less than two

41	INT	FEDERAL BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY - JOHNNY AND CARMEN

	walk out together happily, hand in hand.

				CARMEN
		I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?

				JOHNNY
		Naw, I made it, Carl made it.

	Just then, Don rushes past, shamefaced, crying.

				JOHNNY
		He was in the group with me.
		I guess he didn't...

				CARMEN
		Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse.

	The Recruiting Sergeant is getting ready to go home. He's got legs now,
	and he takes a prosthetic arm from its case and snaps it on.
	He grins when he sees them staring.

				RECRUITING SERGEANT
		They put me out front to discourage the weak-hearted,
		but at the end of the day I go home.
		How'd you kids do ?

				CARMEN
		I'm gonna go for pilot.

				RECRUITING SERGEANT
		Good for you. We need every pilot we can get.

	Johnny holds the door for Carmen and the Recruiting Sergeant. 
	Suddenly Carl appears looking a little paler than usual.

				CARMEN
		Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?

				JOHNNY
		Did you get Starside R&D ?

				CARL
		No.

42	EXT	FEDERAL BUILDING - DAY - JOHNNY AND CARMEN

	are stunned.

				JOHNNY
		I don't believe it !

				CARL
		I got Games & Theory.

	Well, everyone's a little impressed by this.

				CARMEN
		Games & Theory ? That's Military
		Intelligence... Oh, Carl !

				JOHNNY
		Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo !

				RECRUITING SERGEANT
		Next time we meet, I'll probably have to salute
		you. What about you, son ?

				JOHNNY
		Infantery, sir.

	The Recruiting Sergeant beams, offers a prosthetic hand.

				RECRUITING SERGEANT
		Well, good for you. The Mobile Infantery made me
		the man I am today.

	Just what Johnny wanted to hear. They watch the old Sergeant walk
	away.	MUSIC:	"The Mobile Infantery Theme".
	Carmen takes Johnny and Carl by the arm as they walk.

				CARMEN
		Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always
		be friends no matter what.

				JOHNNY
		I'll go for that.

				CARL
		Well, we're gonna be millions of light years away
		from each other, and chances are we'll never see
		each other again, but sure...

				CARMEN
		I can't wait to tell my Dad I'm in.
		He's gonna be so happy !

		I won't quit !

		You're not going back. You're going
		to go on vacation !

				JOHNNY
		I'm not going on vacation ! I want to
		be acitizen ! It's my decision. 
		I made it.

	Johnny turns for the door. His father throws his last shot.

				FATHER
		You walk out that door, you're cut off,
		young man... You understand me ?
		Alright, THAT'S IT, YOU'RE...

44	INT	JOHNNY'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT--JOHNNY

	walks out, grim, sees his mother, tears in her eyes.

		...CUT OFF !

				MOTHER
		Johnny, why won't you change your mind ?
		Does citizenship mean so much to you ?

				JOHNNY
		Well, yeah, sure...

				MOTHER
		I hope so. I hope you don't ruin your life
		over some silly little girl who wants to look 
		handsome in a uniform.

	Johnny's face reddens.

				JOHNNY
		Don't talk about my girl that way.

	Johnny turns on his heel, heads for the transporter.		ZAPPP !

45	EXT	FEDERAL TRANSPORTATION HUB - DAY - JOHNNY

				JOHNNY
		You're late.

				CARMEN
		My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly
		he's afraid he's never gonna see me 
		again or something. It was sweet, but it
		took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready
		to go.

	At the freight station, Carmen enters her Federal I.D. card and gets
	numbered tags for her bags.

				JOHNNY
		Me, too. I'm wearing everything I own.

	Johnny loads them onto a conveyor belt.

				CARMEN
		Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.

				JOHNNY
		Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything
		I need for the next two years, right ?
	
	Carmen's already moved to the next line. Johnny follows.

				CARMEN
		You talk to Carl ?

				JOHNNY
		He left this morning. He couldn't say where.

	Carmen logs in, enters her destination:	LUNA - TERESHKOVA
	FLEET ACADEMY.	The tickets station spits out a pass.

				CARMEN
		It's exciting, but it's scary, too isn't it.
		Going someplace new where you don't
know anyone.

	Carmen heads toward a bank of transporters. Johnny stops her,
	takes her by the arms.

				JOHNNY
		I'm gonna miss you.

				CARMEN
		I'll miss you, too, Johnny.

				JOHNNY
		I love you.

		Com'on, just say it. Try it on for size.

				CARMEN
		Alright, I love you.

	Carmen kisses him, jumps into the transporter.

	is 40, astoundingly fit, and like all drill instructors, he carries a small baton.
	He addresses sixty shorn RECRUITS.

				ZIM
		The problem with you is that none of you are
		good enough the way you are. 

	Johnny stands in formation with his squad, among them:

	BRECKINRIDGE, 18, DJANA'D, 19, KATRINA McINTIRE, 18, ACE LEVY, 
	18, SHUJUMI, 18, and KITTEN SMITH, 18.
		 	 
				ZIM
		I am your senior drill instructor,
		Career Sergeant Zim.
			(then)
		TO THINK THIS HAD TO HAPPEN TO
		ME ! What a bunch of apes. No, strike that.
		You don't rate that good...you sunken-chested,
		slack-bellied, drooling refugees from apron
		strings ! In my whole life I've never seen such
		a disgraceful huddle of momma's spoiled
		little darlings ! Suck in those guts !
		You there, EYES FRONT !

	Zim gives Kitten Smith the hairy eyeball. Smith cracks up.

				ZIM
		Do you think I'm funny ? Do I make
		you laugh ? Do you think I'm a
		comedian ?

	Kitten Smith shake his head  "no" , but he can't stifle himself.

				KITTEN SMITH
		Sorry...!

				ZIM
		The first and last words out of your
		stinking holes will be "sir".
		Do you get me ?

				KITTEN SMITH
		Sir, sorry...sir.

				ZIM
		See the armory ? Run around it !

	Kitten Smith squints. Out in the distance, a tiny building.
	Zim smacks him on the leg with his baton.

				KITTEN SMITH
		YEOW !

				ZIM
		RUN, I SAID. Bronski, keep pace !

	Kitten Smith runs. Big CORPORAL BRONSKI, 28, takes out after
	him, laying a baton across his backside every time he slows.

				ZIM
		You are now all brothers and sisters in
		the same family, my family, the Mobile
		Infantery. I will be your mother.
		I will be your father. If you do not 
		please me I will throw you out of my
		family because I hate all slackers and 
		negative hackers.
		Do you get me ?

				JOHNNY ET AL
		Sir, yes, sir !

	Zim points at the little WHITE PICKET FENCE leading to a
	transporter near the front gate.

				ZIM
		Anytime you think I'm being to tough,
		anytime you think I'm being unfair...
		QUIT ! Grab your gear and take a
		stroll down "Washout Lane". 
		Get me ?

				JOHNNY ET AL
		Sir, yes, sir !

				ZIM
		I wonder if there's a handful of
		guts in the whole bunch. Who
		thinks they've got what it takes
		to knock me down ?

	Breckinridge, a big guy from a farm planet, steps forward.

				BRECKINRIDGE
		Sir, I guess maybe I do, sir.

	Zim crooks afinger at him. Breckinridge charges. Zim knocks
	him flat. Breckinridge holds his arm, twisted now.

				ZIM
		You alright, Breckinridge ?

			BRECKINRIDGE
		Sir, yes, sir. It's my arm. I think it's
		broken, sir.

				ZIM
		MEDIC !

	A MEDIC charges up, checks Breckinridge's arm, grins.

				MEDIC
		Clean break... Doc'll have him back on
		active duty by tomorrow.

				ZIM
		Good. Who's next ?

	Shujumi steps up, assumes a fighting stance. Zim looks him over.
	There's not not much to him. Shujumi attacks Zim, counters his 
	counter, dances out of range.

				DJANA'D
		Lookit the little guy go !

	Now Zim attacks. Shujumi flip kicks Zim in the head.

				JOHNNY
		He's good alright.

				KATRINA
		I'll bet he makes squad leader.

				ACE
		He'll have to get past me.

	The recruits check Ace out. Zim sweeps Shujumi's legs, puts a
	knee in the little man's throat. Shujumi passes out.

				ZIM
		MEDIC !

51	EXT	OBSTACLE COURSE - DAY - THE RECRUITES

	tumble a brutal obstacle course using JUMP BOOTS.

				ZIM (V.O.)
		Some of you may not ´make it.

	Djana'd hits a tower and falls to the deck hard, dropping her rifle.
	She holds her knee, hurt. Zim races over to her.

				ZIM
		WHY IS THAT WEAPON ON THE GROUND ?
		YOUR WEAPON IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN
		YOU ARE ! PICK IT UP ! PICK IT UP !

	Zim begins to kick her because she doesn't move fast enough.

				ZIM (V.O.)
		You might think I am unfair.

52	EXT	ZERO GRAVITY COMBAT - DAY - THE RECRUITES

	watch poor Kitten Smith spar with Zim. Kitten Smith whacks Zim across the jaw.
	Zim doesn't even flinch.

				ZIM
		Is that all you got ? You hit like kitten, Smith !
		This is a punch.

	WHAM !	Zim knocks Kitten Smith for a loop.

				ZIM (V.O.)
		You will not like me.

53	INT	HYPERPHYSICAL TRAINING ENVIRONMENTS - DAY - ZIM

	watches the recruits face simulated 3-D OFF-WORLD FOES. In one room,
	CYCLOPS SOLDIERS of Antilles, in another, red DEATH WALKERS,
	and in a third, screeching ARACHNID WARRIORS.

				ZIM (V.O.)
		But if you survive you will thank me
		because you will be born again hard.
		You will be a new person.
		You will be a Cap Trooper. And then,
		MAYBE, you'll  be good enough...

54	EXT	COMBAT KNIFE PRACTICE - DAY - ZIM

	throws a knife, buries the point in a narrow post.

				ZIM (V.O.)
		...to serve in my family.

				ACE
		Sir, I don't understands who needs a
		knife in a nuke fight anyway...
		All you gotta do is push a button, sir !

	Zim yanks the knife out of the post.

				ZIM
		Put your hand on the post, private.

	Ace obeys. Zim throws, sticks his hand to the post.

				ACE
		AWK !

				ZIM
		The enemy cannot push a button if you
		disable his hand. MEDIC !

	Zim pays no attention to Ace who remains stuck to the post. A
	recruit trots up. Johnny stares, surprised. It's Dizzy.

				DIZZY
		Sir, recruit Flores, reporting for duty , sir.

	She snaps Zim a salute and hands him her orders.

				ZIM
		I see you specifically requested transfer
		from Fort Cronkite to this training group...

	Dizzy grins self-consciously at Johnny.

				DIZZY
		Sir, I heard it was the best, sir !

				ZIM
		It is the best... BUT WHAT MAKES YOU 
THINK YOU'RE GOOD ENOUGH ?
ON YOUR BELLY AND GIVE ME 
FIFTY, RECRUIT !

	Dizzy hits the deck and starts doing push-ups, counting off as
	MEDICS arrive and go to work on Ace's hand.

55	INT	MESS HALL - DAY - THE RECRUITES

	line up for mess piled four-square together on a single plate,
	meat on the bottom, ice cream on top.

				ACE
		I'd like to disable Zim...!

				KATRINA
		Improper Attitude ! They'll kick you out
		for talking like that...

				DJANA'D
		They can kick you out for anything.
		Improper Conduct, Unsatisfactory 
		Performance...

				KITTEN SMITH
		Off you go down Washout Lane, bye-bye !

	Ace cuts into the front off the mess line.

				ACE
		Aw, you either got what it takes
		or you don't.

				DJANA'D
		C'mon Ace, wait your turn !

				ACE
		At ease, soldier. It's all the same muck.

				JOHNNY
		Better get in line like everyone else, Ace.

	Silence. There could be a fight. Zim, standing nearby, watches
	with interest. Ace opens his hand.

				ACE
		You got some guts for a rich kid.
		I guess you and me could be buddies.

				JOHNNY
		What an honor...

				ACE
		Hey, don't laugh. Everyone oughta have
		a friend like me !

	Ace makes a big friendly show of trading places with Johnny.

				BRECKINRIDGE
		Come on, Ace, back off the line !
		Bacl off the line !

	Now everyone's laughing, pushing Ace to the back of the line.
	Johnny has his grub. Dizzy comes up with her tray.

				DIZZY
		Hey, amigo, come chow with me.

				JOHNNY
		No thanks, Diz.

				DIZZY
		What's your malfunction, Rico ?

				JOHNNY
		You are. I joined up to get out on my
		own. And you had to tag along.

				DIZZY
		What ? You think I joined the Mobile
		Infantery because of you ?

				JOHNNY
		You saying you didn't ?

	Johnny turns away. Dizzy watches him go, hurt.

56	EXT	OBSTACLE COURSE - DAY - THE RECRUITS

	tumble down the difficult course in their power suits. At the head of
	the pack , breathing hard, Johnny and Ace race.

				ACE
		What makes you think... you'll make...
		squad leader, Rico ?

				JOHNNY
		Something... I've got...you don't.

				ACE
		You rich kids... are all the same !

				JOHNNY
		It isn't about rich... It's about
		who's best...!

	They come to a trap, prepare to leap.

				DIZZY
		Coming through !

	Dizzy jumps over them from behind. Johnny and Ace tumble into the mud.
	They watch, chagrined, as Dizzy reaches the end of the course effortlessly.

				ZIM
		C'mon, move it, you apes !

57	INT	SHOWERS - NIGHT - DIZZY

	enters as the recruits scrub down.

				KITTEN SMITH
		We all have one thing in common. We were 
		all stupid enough to sign up for Mobile
		Infanterie. What's your excuse,
		Breckinridge ?

				BRECKINRIDGE
		Well, my family is all farmers. I hate farming.
		Mobile Infantery's pure picnic by comparison.

				KITTEN SMITH
		So the grow 'em big and dumb on the farm
		planet, eh ?	Djana'd ?

				DJANA'D
		I'm going in for politics. You gotta be a
		citizen for that. So here I am.

				KITTEN SMITH
		C'mon, keep it going... Katrina !

				KATRINA
		I wanna be a mom. It's easier to get
		a licence if you've served.

				ACE
		I'm going career... officer's training.
		That's why I wanna be squad leader.
		They look for that.

				JOHNNY
		Wanting it doesn't make you the best
		one for the job.

				ACE
		Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here
		with the chops to lead.

				JOHNNY
		Well, maybe you better look again.

				SHUJUMI
		Federation's gonna give me a scholarship
		when my hitch is up. I wanna be a
		neurologist, study brain chemisty and
		associated stimulus...

	Dizzy dresses down. Johnny and all the other guys check her out.
	She has a fabulous body. Dizzy cathes Johnny looking. He turns
	his back as she steps into the shower next to him.

				KITTEN SMITH
		Your turn, Rico !

				JOHNNY
		Aw, who asked you to be so nosey ?

				KITTEN SMITH
		Me, I got plans to be writer, and a writer's
		got a right to be nosey. Flores, you know 
		Rico from Buenos Aires... What's his story ?

	Dizzy uses her hand to divert the shower spray towards Johnny's crotch.

				DIZZY
		Well, some say he turned his back on the family
		fortune to be a citizen, others say he did it for
		a girl... missed a spot there, bucko... which is 
		funny because Johnny says I joined up to be
		with him, but why would I do that ?
		He doesn't even like me.

				BRECKINRIDGE
		Don't look that way to me.

	Everyone look down at Johnny's crotch, laughing. Johnny
	blushes, grabs a towel and exits the shower. 

58	INT BARRACKS - NIGHT - INTO CAMERA - JOHNNY

	pans the barracks with a little handcam, neat bunks in a row, other recruits
	lounging around in their skivvies.

				JOHNNY
		I know it's not much, but it's home. Over
		there's my bunk where I dream about you
		every night...

Ace, Kitten Smith, Shujumi and Breckinridge dance around and moon the
	camera.

				JOHNNY
		Hey, do you mind ?

	Johnny moves the camera away from the guys. Katrina walks by from the
	shower with Dizzy, mugs into frame.

				KATRINA
		Hey, what's going on ?

				DIZZY
		I bet it's that girl I was talking about...
		Her name's Carmen, I think.

				ACE AND THE OTHERS
		Carmen ! Ooh la la, Carmencita !

				KATRINA
		Hi, Carmen !

	Johnny heads for the door.

				ACE AND THE OTHERS
		Hey, where you going ? Come back...! He's
		getting awy... Grab him...!

	The picture goes all screwy, comes up again on:

59	EXT	BARRACKS - NIGHT - INTO CAMERA - JOHNNY

	talk quietly now outside the barracks door.

				JOHNNY
		Boot's pretty tough, and sometimes
		I think I won't make it, but then I
		imagine you're watching me, and that
		gives me someting... I try harder.
		Thanks to you, I think I might have 
		a shot at squad leader.

	The barracks lights go out. Taps plays over the public address.
	Johnny lowers his voice.

				JOHNNY
		Uh-oh, I gotta pack it in. I hope you're
		having fun, hope you're careful.
		No training accidents for you, eh ?
			(leaning into camera)
		I want to kiss you so badly. I want
		to feel you next to me, I-

	Behind him , someone begins to sing , badly.

				ACE
		I love you truly, so truly, dear...!

	Ace, the singer, and the other guys peer down from the transom 
	over the door, giggling, delighted with themselves.

							PULLBACK TO REVEAL:

60	INT	TERESHKOVA FLIGHT ACADEMY - DAY - CARMEN

	watches the end of Johnny's letter. Ace continues to sing.

				ACE
		Our love will grow, dear, year by year...

				JOHNNY
		Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !

	The letter ends. Carmen smiles. A BALD CADET PILOT smacks her on the
	arm as she runs by in a sleek blue pressure suit.

				BALD CADET
		Orbit in five, Ibanez ! First one there gets
		to fly !

	Grinning, Carmen grabs her duffel, takes off after her.

61	INT	BOARDING CORRIDOR - DAY - CARMEN

	and the bald cadet race for the hatch past other recruits.

62	INT	BOAT - DAY CYCLE-CARMEN

	gets there first, jumps into the pilot seat. The Bald Pilot takes
	second seat.


				CARMEN
		Looking it down !
		
	Two LATE CADETS duck in through the closing hatch door.

				LATE CADET
		Oh no, not Ibanez again, she's crazy !

				CARMEN
		On my mark, in three, two, one...

63	EXT	LUNAR ORBIT - THE BOAT

	straeks upward from the lunar floor past orbitting training platforms where
	CADETS in brightly colored pressure suits float against the Earth which
	hangs beyond the horizon.

				CARMEN (O.S.)
		...GO !

64	INT	BOAT - LUNAR ORBIT - CARMEN

	blasts past a DESTROYER orbiting in dock, zips between CORVETTES
	and other slower fleet traffic in the crowded space lanes of Luna.
	The two late cadets are terrified.

				BALD CADET
		Geez, I thought I liked to fly fast !

				CARMEN
		This is nothing. Today, I get to fly that !

	She points. Now visible from behind a host of smaller ships,
	STARSHIP ATHENA, of older design, but impressive.

65	INT	ATHENA - COMMAND AND CONTROL - DAY CYCLE - CARMEN

	arrives on the bridge, dark, cramped, all-business. She salutes the instructor,
	CAPTAIN DELADIER, 40s.

				CARMEN
		Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.

				DELADIER
		Take the number one chair, Ibanez.
		Follow all instructions of you supervisor.

				CARMEN
		Yes, ma'am !

	Carmen turns for her station, but stops in her tracks. Her supervisor is
	Zander Barcalow, now a 2nd Lieutenant.

				CARMEN
		Hey ! What are you doing here ?

				ZANDER
		I'm the guy who's gonna teach you to 
		fly this crate.

	Carmen logs on. The ship recognizes her as a pilot trainee.

				CARMEN
		Assistant insructor... You must be some
		kind of a hot stick.
		Should I call you "sir" ?

				ZANDER
		Only when I give you an order.

				DELADIER
		Prepare for departure.

	Carmen and Zander go to work.

				CARMEN
		It's amazing, us running into each other
		like this. Maybe it's fate.

				ZANDER
		Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl
		coming through the academy, solid math,
		a little wild on the stick, but a natural.
		When it turned out it was you, I made
		sure we'd run into each other...

				DELADIER
		Alright, take her out, Ibanez.

				CARMEN
		Yes, ma'am.

	All eyes are on carmen as she grabs the stick. The ship shudders under
	her hand. She winks at Zander.

				CARMEN
		In simulation, my supervisors could never
		keep up.

				ZANDER
		This isn't simulation anymore.
		Take'er out easy, cadet.

				CARMEN
		Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?

				ZANDER
		Twenty-five by five, roll seven.
		And don't exceed port speed.

	Carmen rocks the stick, and the view from the bridge spins smoothly
	away from the dense orbiting yards os Luna toward the outer system.

				CARMEN
		Or...?

				ZANDER
		They revoke our flight status.

				CARMEN
		Oh, I see... teamwork.

	Carmen jogs past lumbering freighters. Zander's impressed.

				DELADIER
		Steady as she goes, number one.
		Prepare for warp. Number two,
		design for Jupiter orbit.

				ZANDER
		Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three...
		two... one...

	Space appears to bend. Zander and Carmen share a smile. They 
	blur together, becoming one, then:	WHAM !

66	EXT	LUNA - STARSHIP ATHENA

	disappears in a flash of blinding light.

67	EXT	WAR GAMES COURSE - DAY - THE RECRUITS

	have been divided into two teams. RED TEAM includes Ace, Katrina,
	Breckinridge, and Djana'd. Johnny, Shujumi, Kitten Smith, and Dizzy
	are part of BLUE TEAM.

				ZIM
		The object of this exercise is to capture
		your enemy's flag before your enemy
		captures yours.

	Bronski passes out Morita SmartRifles.

				ZIM
		These weapons have been modified for
		this exercise. If your enemy hits you,
		your suit will fail. You will be unable
		to move. You will be as good as dead.

68	EXT	WAR GAMES COURSE - LATER - DJANA'D
	
	bumps the magnification of her heads up display to survey Blue Team's
	flag guarded by two recruits. She jumps down to joining other Red
	Team members on the move.

				DJANA'D
		It's right over the next ridge...
		Only two guards.

	Johnny, Kitten Smith, and Dizzy open fire from athicket as they pass.
	Djana'd and the others collapse as their suits fail, Djana'd laughing
	because playing at war seems funny.

				KITTEN SMITH
		You are now prisoners of the Blue Team.
		Tell us your plans or die !

				DJANA'D
		Oh no ! Name, rank, and mind your own
		business is all you get from me !

69	EXT	RED TEAM FLAG - DAY - RED TEAM

	opens fire as the Blue Team appears. Shujumi and other Blue Team members
	go down in an ambush led by Breckinridge. Johnny dives for cover, and finds
	himself sharing it with Dizzy.

				KITTEN SMITH
		I'm going in ! Let's go !

	Kitten Smith makes arun for the flag with a rifle team. Ace and Katrina open 
	fire from two new hidden Red Team positions, taking Kitten and his team
	down with a cross fire.

				JOHNNY
		Man, they're defended... no way in.

				DIZZY
		Flip six, three hole.

				JOHNNY
		What ?

				DIZZY
		High school... remember ? Run a flip
		six, three hole play, and you might
		score...

	Johnny looks at the course in a new way, nods.

				JOHNNY
		Cover me.

				DIZZY
		You got it.

	Johnny tumbles open ground, vaults into the air. Dizzy takes out Breckinridge
	as he rises to fire. Johnny lands, knocks out Katrina, then Ace. He picks up
	Ace's fallen Morita.

				JOHNNY
		Thanks, pal.

70	EXT	OBSERVATION TOWER - DAY - ZIM AND CORPORAL BRONSKI

	watch Johnny firing both Moritas simultanously and taking out the remaining
	Red Team defenders. He grabs the Red Team flag and hurls it into the air like spear.

				ZIM
		Kid's got some moves...

71	INT	AIRBORNE SKIMMER - DAY - THE RECRUITS

	line up in the door of a SKIMMER, the military's standard utility aircraft,
	to practice drops from altitude.

				ZIM
		Smith, GO ! McIntire, GO ! Flores, GO !
		Rico, I'm making you sqaud leader !

				JOHNNY
		Sir, thank you, sir !

				ZIM
		Don't stand there dumb... GO !

	Johnny jumps, plummeting toward the earth.

				JOHNNY
		YEEEE-Haaaaaaaaaaaaa...!

	Next in line, Ace scowls.

72	INT	BARRACKS - NIGHT - THE RECRUITS

	have some free time. Johnny makes a big show of polishing the chevrons
	that designate him as Squad Leader.

				KITTEN SMITH
		Look at him. Do you think anyone has
		ever been so pleased with himself ?

				ACE
		Zim hadda choose someone to be
		his brown nose, I guess.

				JOHNNY
		I just want you guys to know that I'll
		never do anything that I haven't asked
		you to do first.

	Johnny approaches Dizzy.

				JOHNNY
		Couldn't've done it without you, Diz.
		Friends ?

	Dizzy smiles, shakes.

				DIZZY
		Yeah, sure... friends.

	Bronski walks through with the mail.

				BRONSKI
		Levy... Shujumi... Rico.

	Johnny grabs the E-disk, pops it into his handcam. The Fleet Mail logo appears:
	APPROVED MESSAGE

				JOHNNY
		Bet it's from my girl.

	Johnny's pals gather for a look. Carmen appears, dressed down to skivvies, 
	in her quarters aboard starship Athena.

				CARMEN
		Hi, Johnny, I would've written sooner,
		but they've really got us going every 
		moment here.

				ACE
		Yeow, Rico, you don't deserve that !

				JOHNNY
		Shhhh...!

				CARMEN
		I'm glad you're doing so well. If they 
		haven't made you squad leader by now,
		I'm sure you will.

	Johnny holds up his squad leader chevrons victoriously.

				JOHNNY
		All it takes is the love of a good woman...

	The image changes abrupltly. Now Carmen's wearing a trim blue flight suit.
	She stands the camera on Athena's gunnery deck. Outside , the rings of
	Saturn sparkle in bright solar light.

				CARMEN
		Look at that. Isn't it beautiful ? I had 
		to show you. It's great to be out here on
		my own. I'm just not some little girl from
		Buenos Aires anymore. I'm gonna be a
		starship pilot, and I'm gonna see the
		universe...
			(she sighs)
		And that's also the problem because I
		don't really want to get married,
		Johnny. I don't want to have kids.
		I want a command, a ship of my own,
		and you know, I don't think that's 
		gonna leave a lot of room for you and
		me.

	Johnny is stunned. All the other recruits suddenly seem to have 
	something else to do.

				CARMEN
		I know that's not what you wanted to hear...
		but I have to follow my heart. I'm sorry.
		I'm afraid you'll hate me, and I couldn't
		stand that. Write me, alright ? Write me,
		so I'll know that we'll always be friends.

	The Fleet Mail logo appears again:	END OF MESSAGE. Johnny
	shuts the handcam off. Ace puts a hand on his shoulder.

				ACE
		Funny how they always want to be your friends
		after they kick your guts out.

				JOHNNY
		It's what I deserve.
	
				ACE
		Whad'ya talkin  about ?

				JOHNNY
		I joined up for her. I wouldn't even 
		be here if it wasn't for her.
		I'm a fool.

				ACE
		You made squad leader on your own,
		and, hey, you still got me to kick 
		around.

	Johnny smiles in spite of himself.

				JOHNNY
		Thanks, Ace.

	Johnny turns for the door, flipping the chevrons like a coin.
	Dizzy watches him leave. She'd so like to comfort him.

 73	EXT	LIVE FIRE COMBAT RANGE - DAY - THE RECRUITS

	arm their Marauder power suits. Zim and Bronski wear Command model suits
	with rank designations. Johnny checks weapons, scans the electronics on 
	each squad member's power suit.

				ZIM
		With the Marauder's visual capabilities,
		all you have to do is look at something
		to hit it, so you will exercise EXTREME
		CARE on my firing line.
		Do you get me ?

				RECRUITS
		Sir, yes, sir !

				ZIM
		The live firing combat range is the 
		closest simulation of actual combat
		we can provide. If you do not hit 
		your target, it will shoot you...

	Fifty blackened AUTOMATED TARGET DRONES fitted with pulse guns
	are presently visible along a gauntlet of low walls, gullies, and three-story
	building facades.

				ZIM
		The Marauder power suit will prevent
		serious injury, but if you are hit, you
		will be non-operational and your team 
		score will suffer accordingly. Rico,
		has each member of your squad completed
		a weapons safety check ?

				JOHNNY
		Sir, yes, sir !

	On a signal from Zim, the Live Fire Combat Range comes to life
	as the target drones take cover and disappear from view.

				ZIM
		Perfect score for this exercise is 300.
		B company came through last week
		with 285. I expect you to do better.

74	EXT	LIVE FIRE COMBAT RANGE - DAY - THE RECRUITS

	take out the target drones as they appear. Halfway through the course,
	a recruit takes a hit and goes down, immobilized. Djana'd has a clear
	shot, but Breckinridge gets in her way.

				DJANA'D
		You're in my line of fire, Breckinridge

	Before the others can react, a second drone appears.

				JOHNNY
		CROSSFIRE ! EVERYBODY DOWN !

	Everyone kisses dirt. Pulses from the two drones fly thick overhead.
	Shujumi rises to fire, a round slams him back to the ground.
	Johnny and Djana'd knock out the two drones.

				JOHNNY
		Alright, no more screw ups. Ace takes
		point. Diz, you and Kitten Smith cover
		the flanks. Djana'd, you're rear guard.
		Move out.

	The squad resumes ist advance. Breckinridge bangs on his helmet.
	There is something wrong with his "head up" display.

				JOHNNY
		What's the problem ?

				BRECKINRIDGE
		Dunno. Display's fritzed.

				DJANA'D
		Lose another rifle, we're gonna mess up
		our score...
			
				JOHNNY
		Let me see.

	Breckinridge takes off helmet, hands it to Johnny. Djana'd turns on
	Breckinridge. Her "head up" zeroes him.

				DJANA'D
		How come when something goes wrong,
		it's always you, Breckinridge ?

	That's when Djana'd trips on a loose stone. She fumbles her rifle and
	it discharges. The round tears the top of Breckinridge's head off.
	The recruits stare in horror.

				JOHNNY
		Oh, God... uh... MEDIC !

	Zim arrives with Bronski on the bounce.

				ZIM
		Rico, you are relieved of squad command.
		Levy, McIntire you will escort private Rico
		to the C.O.'s Office.

	The recruits watch Johnny leave, stare aghast at their dead comrade.
	No one looks at Djana'd, who stands alone sobbing.

	both saddened by the proceedings.

				C.O.
		Rico, did you give the recruit permission
		to remove his helmet ?

				JOHNNY
		Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a
		helmet malfunction, and I asked him
		to show it to me, sir.

				C.O.
		Are you rated to repair a Marauder
		power suit, Rico ?

				JOHNNY
		Sir, no, sir.

				C.O.
		Then why did you order your man to 
		remove his helmet during a live fire
		exercise ?

				JOHNNY
		Sir, I needed everyone in my squad
		operational, sir... I... I wanted to win,
		sir.

				C.O:
			(sigh)
		You disobeyed safety regulation 21-404.
		You may, of course, demand trial by 
		court martial.

				JOHNNY
		Sir, no, sir !

				C.O.
		Do you freely admit to the charges
		made against you ?

				JOHNNY
		Sir... I guess I do, sir.

	Zim looks out the window. Djana'd, dressed for travel, in civilian clothes,
	crying as she heads off down Washout Lane.

				C.O.
		Sergeant, we've lost two recruits
		over this incident already...
		is there any possibility of salvaging
		this man ?

				Zim
		I believe so, sir.

	leader, watches, feels bad for his pal.

		For incompetence of command, for
		failure to abide by safety regulations
		in a live fire exercise, for negligence 
		which contributed to the death of a

	Zim steps up to Johnny, offers him a red rubber mouthpiece.

				ZIM
		Bite on this. It helps. I know.

				C.O.
		... recruit trainee John Rico is sentenced
		to administrative punishment. Ten lashes.

	Johnny takes it in his mouth. His tear away shirt is torn away. Johnny
	stands at the post alone. Corporal Bronski, a big man with an unhappy
	task, unrolls his whip.

				C.O.
		You may carry out the sentence.

				BRONSKI
		One.
	
	CRACK !	Johnny's face wrenched by pain, spontanous tears, a terrible
	sound stifled by the bright red mouthpiece.

		No, I replotted the course. It's more

		Three weeks aboard a starship and you

	Zander turns his chair so they are very close, moves a finger along

		I have a feeling about us. We're good

	Carmen grabs him between his legs.

				CARMEN
		No, what do you want ?

	Zander pulls her to him and they kiss passionately. She brteaks it off,
	gets serious for amoment.

				CARMEN
		I want to be part of the best flight team 
		in the Fleet...

		Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle.

	They start to caress again when suddenly ALARMS sound. Captain

		It looks like an... asteroid.

				DELADIER
		In this part of the system ?

	Carmen and Zander see it through the front screens:		A huge

		... and it's still 86% combat effec-tive.
		But here's a tip: Aim for the nerve stem
		and put it down for good.

	Carl fires again. The bug kicks and squeals as it dies.
	Carl tosses the pulse gun aside.

				CARL
		Now while you are out killing bugs,
		we want you to be our eyes and ears.

	defensive fire.

				DELADIER
		This isn't random or light.
		Someone made amistake...!

				ZANDER
		That's it, we're empty ma'am !

	Out the front screens, a blast from below hits George Marshall amidships
	and it reels into Yamamoto. Both starships begin to burn.

				DELADIER
		Someone made a big goddam mistake !
		Get us out of here, Number 1 !

	Carmen dodges past burning ships, avoids collision with Dauntless,
	and then KA-WHAM !	they're hit. Carmen flies out of her
	station and into CAMERA hard.

	The chute pops. Across the sky, lit by outgoing bug plasma, he can see hundreds
	of cap troopers in ordered rows drifting down into the cloud layer. 
	It's quiet in the clouds, then:

108	EXT	KLENDATHU - NIGHT - FROM THE AIR - JOHNNY

	looks down as he passes out of the clouds and sees the battlefield.
	Plasma blasts exploode into the sky. THOUSANDS OF BUGS boil
	out of the ground to defend against the invader.

	on the bounce.

109	EXT	KLENDATHU - NIGHT - JOHNNY'S POV - THE FLASH PULSE

	None of it compares to the sound of his own racing HEARTBEAT.
	Lieutenant Willy shouts.

				LIEUTENANT WILLY
		Up there on the ridge ! We'll nuke those bug positions
		from theAAAAAAAA !

	A HOPPER (an airborne Arachnid warrior with powerful rear legs and "pop out"
	wings for gliding) lands on Lieutenant Willy and cracks his head like a nut.

				ACE
		KILL IT !

	Johnny and Ace open fire, backing away. Pulse rounds tear it apart, bug guts
	gushing.

				JOHNNY
		Lieutenant's bought the farm.
		Where's the Sarge...?

				ACE
		I didn't see him !

	Now comes a flood of WORKERS building ever advancing fortifications,
	and with them, hundreds of deadly ARACHNID WARRIORS.

				KITTEN SMITH
		Here they come...!

				DIZZY
		Ace, what're we doing ?

				ACE
		I uh... uh...

	Dizzy and the others open fire simultanously. The whole area goes white hot
	in the magnesium flash of so many pulse cannons. Shujumi fires wildly at 
	advancing insects.

				SHUJUMI
		You want some ? Here's some !
		C'MON !

				JOHNNY
		Don't waste your ammon on the 
		workers !

	Shujumi can't hear. A warrior finds him, rips his leg off, hurls him back
	into the waiting jaws of the oncoming bugs.

				SHUJUMI
		AAAAAAAAAAAA !

	He fights, screaming. A claw reaches for his face, ripping the top of his head off.

				KATRINA
		Let's get out of here !

	Now the ground opens behind her and a huge (6 meters) TANKER BUG 
	lumbers out of the ground, it's funnel-shaped snout extruding above
	multiple eyes.

				DIZZY
		Look out !

	The tanker bug sprays and hits Katrina. She screams, as her legs melt out
	from under her.

				KATRINA
		AAAAAAAAAAAAA !

	Warriors converge to feed on her. Ace wants to help her, but Johnny blocks him.

				JOHNNY
		C'mon, Katrina was right. We 
		gotta get out of here !

110	EXT	KLENDATHU - NIGHT - JOHNNY

	and the other survivors on the bounce. The entire surface of Klendathu seems
	to be churning with insects as more and more bugs come to the surface to
	repel the invasion.

				JOHNNY
		It's a general retreat ! The boats are
		coming down.

	They come to the rear lines where the Net Correspondent and his
	CAMERAMAN are doing live coverage of the invasion.

				NET CORRESPONDENT
		We've just landed here on what cap troopers 
		are calling the "Big K" with the 6th Mobile
		Infantery Division. It's an ugly planet, a bug
		planet, a planet hostile to life as we kow iGKKKKK !

	The Correspondent is cut in half by a warrior. Johnny blows it away.

				JOHNNY
		C'mon, let's go ! ON THE BOUNCE !

	The cap troopers move out. Kitten Smith looks up as a purple beacon
	 streaks acroos thr sky.

				KITTEN SMITH
		I can see the beacon...!

				ACE
		Retrieval !

	A hopper pounces on Kitten Smithm, and he goes down screaming.

				JOHNNY
		KITTEN !

	Johnny touches down, stares in horror as Kitten Smith's head rolls past his 
	fee. Johnny opens up with his pulse cannon. The hopper attacks, puts a claw
	right through Johnny's thigh.

				JOHNNY
		AAAAAAAAAAAAA !

	Crushing jaws close around him, crushing, cutting his flesh. Johnny brings the muzzle
	of the pulse gun under the hopper's nerve stem and SPLAT !	blows its head apart.

				DIZZY
		Johnny !	JOHNNY !	WHERE ARE YOU ?
		JOHNNY !	Johnny...!

	But Dizzy can't find Johnny, and soon she's lost in the smoke. Johnny looks
	down at the terrible hole in his leg where bright arterial blood gushes.

				JOHNNY
		Medic... MEDIC...!

	Now two more Arachnid warriors close in on him through the enveloping
	smoke. He fires his pulse rifle empty, and dropping it, crawls desperately,
	dragging his useless leg.

				JOHNNY
		Oh, God... Oh, God, help me...
		please help me...!

	A third Arachnid warrior rears up in front of him, deadly jaws slashing down
	toward him, when suddenly it is blown to pieces in the blinding blast of a
	point-blank pulse cannon.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Take my hand !

	Johnny reaches out. A STEEL HAND takes his, dragging him back as bugs
	attack. His rescuers's pulse cannon thunders overhead. Bug parts fly as 
	insects swarm in for the kill.

				ZANDER
		Give me hand, willya ?

	Carmen takes his hand. Zander kisses her.

				ZANDER
		I was thinking. Maybe we should get

		You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !

		If we're gonna be a team, why not be a

				CARMEN
		There's a war on. I want a command,

		So who's got time to get married ?

	Carmen lets his hand go and leaps through the hatch. Zander falls back 
	onto the conveyer belt, finds himself eyeball-to-eyeball with a horribly
	maimed trooper, scrambles to get off.

		No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.

				ZANDER
		Hey, bugs don't take prisoners.

	Carmen looks at the words at the Net terminal: WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW 
	MORE ? She bites her lip, enters Johnny's name. In an instant, she has the news:
	RICO, JOHN D. - KIA

				CARMEN
		Oh no.

	Tears fill her eyes.

	She rushes away. Zander looks at Johnny's name on the screen, shrugs, presses

	floats, suspended in fluid, mouth hanging open, his skin white as death.
	A low underwater KNOCKING wakes him. He opens his eyes and sees
	Ace and Dizzy outside the tank.

	Ace holds up a KIA list, pointing at Johnny's name, laughing: Rico, John V - KIA.
	Their voices are distant and garbled. Dizzy cups her hands against the side of the
	tank.

				DIZZY
		Two more days.

	Johnny's wounds are now mostly scars except for his leg where delicate robotic
	arms culture layers of new tissue. Johnny gives a weak thumbs up. The knocking
	sound continues.

	Johnny turns. A STEEL HAND taps the side of the tank. Johnny grins, astonished.
	The man wearing it is his former high school teacher, now a Lieutenant, Jean Rasczak.

		Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak
		character in Buenos Aires...

				JOHNNY
		He was our teacher...
		He was great.

				ACE
		Yeah, well, I hear he's a real
		nutbuster.

				DIZZY
		The Roughnecks killed more bugs than
		any other outfit in 2nd Brigade...
		Only took 15% casualties on Big K.

	They size up the Roughnecks. There are scars, power prosthetics, and one,
	big SUGAR WATKINS, 26, wears a bug claw on a chain around his neck.

				JOHNNY
		Seeing as how we're about all that's
		left of  1st Brigade, you'd have to call
		that an improvement.
			(to Sugar Watkins)
		You top kick ?

				SUGAR WATKINS
		Are you kidding ? They always get killed.
		You want the job ?

				JOHNNY
		I wouldn't mind.

	CORPORAL BIRDIE, 24, turns, gives Johnny the once over.

				BIRDIE
		I would. Nice earring.

	Dizzy looks her over. Not too big, but she's tough.

				DIZZY
		Where you been besides Big K ?

				BIRDIE
		Outer rings. Zegema Beach.

				JOHNNY
		I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.

				SUGAR WATKINS
		Good luck. It's not there anymore.

				ACE
		Is your Lieutenant as bad as they say ?

	Birdie belts him, and Ace goes down.

				BIRDIE
		No one talks about the Lieutenant that way.
		He saved my life !

	Ace jumps up, ready to fight, but other Roughnecks block him.

				SUGAR WATKINS
		Mine, too.

				OTHER ROUGHNECKS
		Same for me... me, too...

	Johnny and Dizzy shrug. Ace's on his own.

				ACE
		Sounds like he is quite a guy.
	
	SERGEANT GILLESPIE, 28, steps into the room.

				GILLESPIE
		Attention !

	Everyone snaps to. Rasczak enters.

				RASCZAK
		This is for you new people. I only 
		have two rules. Rule one, everyone
		fights. Rule two, no one quits.
		If you don't do your job, I'll kill you
		myself. Do you get me ?

				JOHNNY, DIZZY AND ACE
		We get you, sir !

	He points at Johnny's earring with his steel hand.

				RASCZAK
		Get rid of the jewelry. I hate it.
		Welcome to the Roughnecks.

				BIRDIE
		Rasczak's Roughnecks !

	The Roughnecks cheer. Rasczak smiles vaguely.

				RASCZAK
		Alright. There's a new Sky Marshall and
		a new plan. We're gonna clean out the
		systems outlying Klendathu one planet
		at a time. Tomorrow we hit Tango Urilla.

	A distant sound. A warrior looks up, curious. Suddenly a FORMATION OF TAC 
	FIGHTERS screams down from high orbit and a white hot nuclear firestorm burns
	consumes the landscape.

	Bugs scream as they twist and kick in the wall of flame. Heat melts the dirt into 
	dark glass. Ash turns the sky red. The out of the smoke come Rasczak and his
	Roughnecks.

				RASCZAK
		Spread out, teams of three. When you 
		locate a bug hole, secure it, gas it,
		and close it.

	streak by overhead. On the ground, Johnny, Dizzy and Ace are on the bounce.
	Ace spots a bug hole where workers and warrors have broken through the
	glassed surface.

				ACE
		There.

	Rockets take out warriors. Bug guts go flying. Dizzy sets workers on fire.
	Johnnx and Ace step over burning bug carcasses to the rim of the hole and
	fire their gas rounds.

				JOHNNY
		Fire in the hole !

	Johnny drops an H.E. round, and they're in the air when the explosion collapses
	the entrance to the bug city.

				BIRDIE (O.S.)
		You new guys over there...
		WE could use some help...

125	EXT	TANGO URILLA - MOUNTAINS - BUGS

	boil out of the ground. Birdie, Sugar Watkins and other Roughnecks are about to be

				JOHNNY
		Looks like you've got a little bug
		problem, ma'am...

				BIRDIE
		Stow it, trooper. Give it verything
		you've got !

	The cao troopers let the bugs have it, but the insects keep coming, the living
	crawling over the dead, and now, trudging up out of the ground, comes a
	TANKER BUG.

				JOHNNY
		WATCH OUT !

	The tanker bug starts to spray, creating a toxic perimeter around the hole.
	Rasczak arrives just as Birdie takes a chemical hit, falling to ground minus
	an arm, screaming.

				BIRDIE
		AAAAAAAAAAAAA !

	Johnny jumps, landing behind the tanker bug in the mouth of the hole. It turns 
	with surprising speed. Johnny flips up onto its back, cracks its armor with his
	pulse cannon.

				RASCZAK
		Sugar, in for pick up !

	Rasczak and Sugar Watkins pull Birdie to safety. Johnny fires a rocket into 
	the hole he's made in the tanker bug's back, and jumps clear. KA-WHAP !
	The big bug explodes.

				RASCZAK
		Gas that hole and close it !

	The Roughnecks fire gas rockets into the bug hole. Johnny touches down
	beside Rasczak.

				RASCZAK
		Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?

				JOHNNY
		Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you
		remember ? I was captain of the
		team.

				RASCZAK
		I'm not interested in nostalgia, Rico,
		I need a corporal. You're it until you're
		dead or I find someone better.

	Rasczak turns away, gives Birdie prosthetic thumps up as she is carried past
	to meet an arriving skimmer.

				RASCZAK
		Don't worry, Birdie, your next arm comes
		with a factory guarantee !

	Dizzy and Ace gather around Johnny, clap him on the back.

				DIZZY
		Way to go, amigo !

				JOHNNY
		I'm gonna need a squad leader.

				ACE
		No way. Big K taught me I ain't executive 
		material.

				JOHNNY
		What about it, Diz ?

				DIZZY
			(a snappy salute)
		Looks like I'm your girl, sir.

	Tac Fighters reel by over head. WOMP ! Suddenly, BUG PLASMA shoots skyward
	from the flatlands below. Several Tac Fighters are blown out of the air.
	Flaming debris rains down.

				RASCZAK
		Saddle up, Roughnecks. That's
		our trash !

	Roughnecks head out on the bounce.

126	EXT	TANGO URILLA - RIDGE - DAY - JOHNNY

	and the others look down a sheer cliff on the bug battery, a charred circular
	pit some ten meters across. Inside, something is moving.

				JOHNNY
		What kind of stinkin' bug is that ?

	Johnny jumps the magnification on his "head up". Down in the pit, a giant
	translucent PLASMA BUG rears out of one of the subterranean tunnels
	that ring the battery.

				SUGAR WATKINS
		You never seen how they do it before ?

	Johnny shakes his head. Swollen BREEDER BUGS gather around the 
	plasma bug to inject it with their catalytic jelly.

				ACE
		Agghh ! It's making me sick...!

	The plasma bug writhes in pain and begins to swell, color changing from
	yellow to blue in accordance with some violent internal chemical reaction.

				SUGAR WATKINS
		It's gonna pop !

	WOMP ! The plasma bug explodes in its cauldron. A blast of bug plasma
	streaks past them towards the heavens. Now a new plasma bug crawls into
	the pit to begin the cycle anew.

				GILLESPIE
		Sir, look !

	Sergeant Gillespie points. A hole opens near the battery and dozens of warriors
	rampage out of the ground and up the cliff face toward the Roughneck position.

				RASCZAK
		We must be right over the colony.
		Let's get some air support, eh ?

				GILLESPIE
		Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck
		patrol, over ...?

	Rasczak moves off down the line giving orders.

				RASCZAK
		Corporal, I want pulse cannons there
		and there ! Rifle teams, spread out
		along the ridge ! Sugar, bring up that
		flame thrower !

				GILLESPIE
		Fleet's pulling the battle group back
		to safe distance... They'd like us to
		knock out those batteries, sir.

				RASCZAK
		They'd rather spend our lives than
		risk their ships. Who's got the nuke ?

				DIZZY
		That'd be me, sir.

				RASCZAK
		Heat it up.

	Dizzy activates a tactical nuke. It makes a distinctive HIGHPITCHED SQUEAL.

				RASCZAK
		Roughnecks, you may fire at will.

	The Roughnecks open fire. Bugs are blown to pieces but they keep climbing. A 
	warrior breeches their line. Sugar Watkins torches it. The nuke's ready light flashes.

				DIZZY
		I'm hot, sir !

				RASCZAK
		FIRE ! BLAST SHIELDS DOWN !

	Johnny blows a warrior away from the edge. Dizzy leans over and fires. The rocket 
	streaks down toward the battery.

				RASCZAK
		HIT THE DIRT !

	An explosion in the two kiloton range turns the world black and white. When color
	returns Johnny and the others look down on the smoldering crater which was once the 
	bug battery.

				GILLESPIE
		Now comes the part I hate the most.

		What's that ?

				GILLESPIE
		We go down into the colony and make
		sure all the queens are dead.

127	INT	TUNNELS - DAY - THE ROUGHNECKS

				SUGAR WATKINS
		You knew the Lieutenant before the war...
		What was he like ?

				JOHNNY
		He was a teacher , kind of a know it all...
		Always had this little smile.
	
				SUGAR WATKINS
		Geez, I don't think I've ever seen him

				RASCZAK
		Kill the bitch.

		Yes, sir.

	Johnny signals. Dizzy's pulse cannon rips open the dying queen. Thousands of
	wriggling premature bugs come spilling out. Horrified, knee-deep Roughnecks
	set them afire.

				JOHNNY
		I said no. Want me to pull rank ?

				DIZZY
		Well, excuse me, sir...

	Dizzy heads back to the others. Johnny turns and finds Rasczak regarding him 
	with an odd, sad smile.

				RASCZAK
		Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico.
		Want some now ?

				JOHNNY
		Yes, sir...

				RASCZAK
		Never pass up a good thing, eh ?

	Gillespie appears.

	Rasczak heads away. Johnny joins Dizzy.

				JOHNNY
		Hey, Diz...

				DIZZY
		What ?

	Johnny takes her hand, bows implishly.

				JOHNNY

	Gillespie carries the communications package.

				GILLESPIE
		I don't understand it, Lieutenant.
		It's not getting anything from 4th
		Brigade...
		not even their transponder.

				RASCZAK
		Keep trying, Sergeant.

134	EXT	CANYON FLOOR - CONTINUING - DAY - THE ROUGHNECKS

	lots of them, moving from rock to rock for better position.

135	EXT	CANYON FLOOR - CONTINUING - DAY - ACE
	
	sees something out of the corner of his eye.

				JOHNNY
		BUGS...!

	The hoppers hit. Several Roughnecks go down. Everyone opens up. 
	Dive-bombing bugs are blown to bits. Roughnecks set them on fire 
	when they hit the ground.

				DIZZY
		Johnny, watch out !

	A burning bug hurls itself at Johnny. Johnny jumps out of the way as
	Dizzy fires, blowing it apart. The deadly hoppers seem to be everywhere
	above them in the rocks.

				RASCZAK
		LET'S GO ! ON THE BOUNCE !

136	EXT	FLAT LANDS - DAY - THE ROUGHNECKS

	move out into the open. In the distance they see 4th Brigade HQ, a walled 
	compound and partially constructed landing pad.

				RASCZAK
		Gillespie, put in call for retrieval.
		We're off this rock.
		Gillespie, do you read me ?

				GILLESPIE
		AAAAAAAAAAA !

	Two hoppers are pulling Gillespie up into the rocks where other bugs
	join to feast.

				RASCZAK
		Throw a rifle !

	Dizzy tosses her Morita to Rasczak. Gillespie writhes in the hopper's
	claws. Rasczak fires, killing Gillespie.

				RASCZAK
		I expext any one here to do the same
		for me... Rico, Watkins, Flores, Levy
		prepare for rear guard action. The rest
		of you make for 4th Brigade.

	Johnny and the others cover the Roughneck retreat as hoppers soar down
	on the flat lands from the canyon walls.

				RASCZAK
		FIRE...!

	Johnny and the others blast bugs out of the air.

				RASCZAK
		FALL BACK 100 METERS...!

	A second wave of hoppers come in.

				RASCZAK
		AND FIRE...!

	For now, the sky is clear.

				RASCZAK
		4TH BRIGADE HQ ! ON THE BOUNCE !

137	EXT	4TH BRIGADE HQ - DAY - THE OUTPOST

	is 50 meters by 100, standard issue pre-fab. The Roughnecks land on the
	compound wall. Inside, WORKER BUGS graze on the remains of 200
	dead cap troopers strewn over the complex.

				RASCZAK
		Jeez, Command really humped the bunk
		on this one...

	Rasczak turns away. Roughnecks engage in the sport of methodically
	killing the workers.

				RASCZAK
		Rico, you're acting Sergeant now.
		My last Sergeant lost the com pack.
		Put together a search team and find
		the radio shack.
		We need retrieval.

				JOHNNY
		Yes, sir.

138	INT	4TH BRIGADE HQ - OFFICE COMPLEX - DAY - JOHNNY

139	INT	COMMINICATIONS - DAY - RASCZAK AND JOHNNY

	enter the radio room. A DEAD MAJOR is slumped over the console with
	hole in the back of his head. Johnny checks the equipment. 
	It' dead, too.

				JOHNNY
		Diz, see what you can do.

				DIZZY
		I'm on it !

	Dizzy goes to work. Rasczak checks the wound in the back of the dead major's
	head.

				RASCZAK
		What's that look like to you, Rico ?

				JOHNNY
		Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.

				ACE (O.S.)
		Lieutenant, I think you're gonna
		wanna see this, sir.

140	INT	MESS HALL - DAY - A BUG HOLE

	in the middle of the floor is surrounded by carnage.

				ACE
		Dirty bugs came in right when they 
		were having chow !

				RASCZAK
		Gas that hole and seal it.

	Then they hear a sound. Tap tap tap. Rasczak signals for quiet. Tap tap tap tap.
	It's coming from the kitchen.

141	INT	KITCHEN - DAY - THE ROUGHNECKS

	enter cautiously. The noise is coming from a freezer. Ace stands ready to fire.
	Johnny levers open the door, jumps back as GENERAL OWEN, 60, tumbles out
	face first.

				ACE
		Officer on the deck, sir.

				RASCZAK
		Pick up the general !

	Roughnecks prop him up. General Owen tries to talk, but no words come out.
	Rasczak bends down to listen.

				GENERAL OWEN
		Get out... you gotta get me out...!

				RASCZAK
		General Owen, sir ?

	The old man grins, hugely relieved.

				GENERAL OWEN
		At ease, Lieutenant. Thank God for you,
		for all of you...this is grand...
		so where's the boat ?

142	INT	COMMUNICATIONS - HALLWAY - DAY - JOHNNY AND RASCZAK

	help the old General, now wrapped in a blanket, rambling.

				GENERAL OWEN
		I was forced to hide, of course. The security
		of the Federation in this theater of operations
		was at stake !

				JOHNNY
		Diz, what's with the uplink ?

	Dizzy lokks up from where she is working on the radio controls.

				DIZZY
		Workin on it...!

				GENERAL OWEN
		They get in your mind... they make you do
		things ! Look here... They did it to Farley...!

	He points at the hole of the dead major's head.

				RASCZAK
		The distress call... The bugs wanted us 
		to rescue you...!

				GENERAL OWEN
		Oh, you can be sure of it ! They were
		biding their time... waiting for the most
		opportune moment !

	Rasczak's lost interest in the general. He's on the com.

				RASCZAK
		To all Roughnecks, this is Rasczak.
		Prepare for attack. Repeat. We are
		going to be attacked...!

				GENERAL OWEN
		They weren't gonna do it to me.
		Oh no ! I know too many secrets !

	Rasczak looks at General Owen with contempt.

				SUGAR WATKINS (O.S.)
		Fire in the hole !

	An explosion in the mess hall closes the bug hole.

143	EXT	OFFICE COMPLEX - DAY - GENERAL OWEN

	blinks as he steps out into the light. Roughnecks snap to attention. 
	General Owen looks at the carnage that was once his command and
	begins to keen, collapsing to his knees.

				GENERAL OWEN
		Oh God...! My soldiers...! All of my
		boys and girls...!

	The Roughnecks are shocked. They've never seen a general break down before.
	Lieutenant Rasczak slaps Owen hard.

				LT. RASCZAK
		Shut up ! Your soldier's dead and
		you're not !

				GENERAL OWEN
		I know... I wish you'd shoot me...

				LT. RASCZAK
		I oughta !

	And it looks like Rasczak just might, but just then Ace touches down
	next to Johnny and Rasczak.

				ACE
		Lieutenant, we got trouble !

144	EXT	RAMPARTS - DAY - RASCZAK

	and Johnny join other stunned Roughnecks to see THOUSANDS OF BUGS on
	the march from every direction. Bug batteries open up in the distance.

				RASCZAK
		Warm it all up ! Everything you got !
		Levy, collect the big guns from the 
		towers. Watkins, put General Owen 
		with the wounded. Rico, where's my 
		communications ?

				JOHNNY
		What's going on, Diz ?

				DIZZY (O.S.)
		I got power ! Gimme a minute !

	Johnny runs for the communications room.

				JOHNNY
		We don't have a minute !

145	INT	COMMUNICATIONS - DAY - DIZZY

	has the board up. Outside the battle has begun. Nukes go WOMP ! and
	pulse guns chatter.

				DIZZY
			What frequency ?

				JOHNNY
			All bands.

				DIZZY
			Roughneck patrol to battle group...
			Roughneck patrol to battle group...

				RODGER YOUNG (O.S.)
			This is Rodger Young... What's going
			on down there ? We're taking plasma !
			We have Orion P-11 as clear !

				JOHNNY
			SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now !

				RODGER YOUNG (O.S.)
			What is your position ?

				JOHNNY
			Landing zone is extremely hostile.
			Come down on this transmission !

				RODGER YOUNG (O.S.)
			Inside 4th brigade compound ?
			That's crazy !

				JOHNNY
			Then I hope you have a crazy 
			pilot ! Keep the line open, Dizzy !

	Johnny races out the door.

146	EXT	4TH BRIGADE HQ - DAY - THE COMPOUND

	is white hot as Roughnecks on the walls unload nukes. Johnny crosses 
	the compound, lands next to Rasczak on the wall.

				JOHNNY
		Boat coming down, sir !

	The Roughnecks stop firing as they run out of nukes.

				ROUGHNECKS
		I'm empty...all nuked out... Me, too !

	Johnny scans the battlefield. Nukes have turned the surface into dark glass.
	Now, out of the smoke, come the bugs, steaming glass cracking beneath 
	millions of marching feet.

				ACE
		Jeez, we musta killed a million already...!

				JOHNNY
		Not enough, I guess.

	Sugar Watkins sees Genera Owen in the compound below,
	stumbling aimlessly among his dead soldiers.

				SUGAR WATKINS
		General ! GENERAL, stay with the wounded...
		Sir, the general...!

				RASCZAK
		Ah, the hell with him...

	Hoppers sweep into the compound. The Roughnecks open fire. General Owen
	make easy pickings for ones that get through.

				RASCZAK
		Fall back... form a circle ! If no 
		living bug comes over that wall,
		we cannot be harmed.

	Dizzy arrives on thr bounce as the Roughnecks fall back into the compound.
	Bugs pile in over the walls. The circle affords them 360 degrees of kill zone.

				RASCZAK
		Rico, Flores, Watkins, Levy ! We 
		control the sky until retrieval !

				JOHNNY ET AL
		Yes, sir !

	Rasczak, Sugar Watkins, Johnny and Dizzy stand back-to-back in the center
	of the circle, sweeping the skies with the heavy guns from the towers.
	Hoppers are blown to pieces.

				ACE
		Getting low here, sir !

				DIZZY
		300 rounds and counting, sir !

				RASCZAK
		Make every shot count !

	Johnny looks up. A RETRIEVAL BOAT hurtles down through bursts of 
	bug plasma, takes a grazing hit, rights itself with retros and lands within 
	the circle. Roughnecks cheer, saved !

				RASCZAK
		Sergeant, secure the boat !

				JOHNNY
		Yes, sir !

	Roughnecks move to protect the boat. The hatch blows open.

				RASCZAK
		Board the wounded !

	Dead bugs ring the compound walls, forming ramps for living insect
	soldiers to enter the compound in greater numbers.

				RASCZAK
		Move to retrieval on my command !
		First group, now...!

	The circle shrinks as Roughnecks fall back and board the boat.
	More and more bugs pile in over the compound walls.

				RASCZAK
		Alright, Flores ! Levy ! Rico...!

	Suddenly, the ground collapses under Rasczak. He falls in to his waist,
	vomits blood as something chews on him from below.

				RASCZAK
		AAAAAAAAAAAA !

				JOHNNY
		Cover us, Ace !

	Ace and the others fire from the boat. Johnny and Dizzy fire at the ground
	around Rasczak. Rasczak stops screaming. They try to pull him free.

				JOHNNY
		Hit your jets, sir !

				RASCZAK
		I can't My legs are gone...
		Get on the boat...

	The compund wall collapses. A wave of bugs charges in.

				RASCZAK
		Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet.
		I've never seen so many bugs upstairs at
		the same time...

				JOHNNY
		We're not leaving you here, sir !

	Weakly, Rasczak picks up his pulse gun, checks the power.

				RASCZAK
		This is my farm. Get on the boat,
		NOW ! That's an order, Sergeant.

				JOHNNY
		Give'em hell, sir !

	Johnny and Dizzy run for the boat. Rasczak opens fire, picking his shots,
	but soon the bugs are all over him.

				RASCZAK
		C'mon you sons of bitches !
		There's no bug alive can kill a
		real mAAAAAAA !

	At the boat, Dizzy turns to look back at Rasczak. A hopper swoops
	down on Dizzy, it's claws ripping into her abdomen.

				DIZZY
		AAAAAAA ! GET IT OFF ME 
		GET IT OFF GET IT OFF 
		GET IT AAAAAAAAAA !

	Johnny blows the bug off her back. Blood sprays from a deep gash in 
	her neck. Johnny picks her up, tries to stop the blood with his hand.
	The life is leaving her eyes.

				JOHNNY
		Hang on, Diz... don't die on me...

	A TANKER BUG breaches the broken wall. Ace jumps out to help his
	friends. The hatch closes just as the tanker bug sprays. The boat blasts
	off, dripping metal.

147	INT	CARGO BAY - DAY - JOHNNY

	holds Dizzy in his arms, drenched in her blood, fighting G-forces as the 
	boats heads for orbit.

				DIZZY
		I bought the farm, didn't I,
		Johnny ?

				JOHNNY
		No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !

				DIZZY
		It's alright 'cause I got to have you,
		Johnny...

	MEDICS push Johnny aside, go to work on Dizzy.

148	INT	BOAT - COCKPIT - DAY - JOHNNY

	slams into the cockpit. Out the front screen, violent bursts of BUG PLASMA
	fill the sky as they break atmosphere.

				JOHNNY
		Get on the com and tell Fleet to
		glass that rock...!

	The co-pilot turns around. It's Zander. His eyes narrow.

				ZANDER
		On whose authority, Corporal ?

				JOHNNY
		This would be mine, sir. Acting 
		Sergeant John Rico. I've assumed
		command on this mission.

	The pilot turns around. It's Carmen.

				CARMEN
		Johnny...! I thought you were dead !

				JOHNNY
		I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are.
		Glass the planet !

	Johnny leaves. Carmen punches up Fleet Command.

				CARMEN
		Rodger Young, this is inbound shuttle
		De Ruyter with an official request from
		the Mobile Infantery to bombard
		Planet P-11...

149	INT	BOAT - CARGO BAY - DAY - JOHNNY
	
	returns to Dizzy's side as the medics struggle to save her. Blood pours
	out of her mouth. Her body thrashes.

				DIZZY
		JOHNNY HEH HEH CAN'T HEH
		BREATHE GOD JOHNNY CAN'T
		HEH HEH HEH HEH...!

	Dizzy dies. A Medic slaps her. Her head lolls, mouth open, eyes blank.
	They drop her and move on to the next casualty. Johnny sits there,
	stunned. Carmen enters from the cockpit.

				CARMEN
		Negative on your request. Fleet 
		Command has the battle group 
		on standby...

		Carmen sees Dizzy lying dead on the deck.

				CARMEN
		...I'm sorry.

				JOHNNY
		We gotta choke on the mud and the
		blood and Fleet can't be bothered to
		spit.

				CARMEN
		No, I think something's up. The Sky
		Marshall's here.

	She points out for a viewing port. Johnny looks. Fifteen battle groups, 
	100 ships strong, lay off Planet P, all of them dwarfed by the Sky
	Marshall's flagship, Buenos Aires.

				CARMEN
		I thought you were KIA, Johnny...

				JOHNNY
		That was just a mix up.

				CARMEN
		You look so... I don't know, you 
		look like you've really been in it.

				JOHNNY
		What happened to your eye ?

	Carmen touches the scar over her eye.

				CARMEN
		Almost got knocked out of the sky 
		over Big K.

				JOHNNY
		I like it. It's kinda...you.

150	EXT	BATTLE GROUP - ORION SYSTEM - THE BOAT

151	INT	OFFICERS QUARTERS - DAY CYCLE - ZANDER

	enters, watches Carmen dress. She hums as she checks herself in the
	mirror, touches thr scar over her eye, smiles.

				ZANDER
		Where are you going ?

				CARMEN
		A funeral.

				ZANDER
		That girl who died on the way up
		...his girl ?

				CARMEN
		Yeah.

				ZANDER
		How do you feel about him now ?

				CARMEN
		I don't know, Zander.

				ZANDER
		I do.

152	INT	RODGER YOUNG - GUNNERY DECK - CARMEN

	enters as Johnny speaks. Dizzy is laid out in dress gray. The surviving
	Roughnecks have gathered to pay final respects.

				JOHNNY
		Dizzy bought the farm. She was my
		good friend, and friens are the best 
		luck anyone gets... But in war, we must
		go on without our friends. We take
		with us their memory, and we are left
		to wonder if there is meaning in their
		death. Let me tell you what it is:
		Dizzy bough the farm so we can keep
		on fighting.

	Several INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS march into the bay.

				JOHNNY
		Officer on deck !

	Everyone snaps to attention. Colonel Carl Jenkins strides into the room.
	His eyes are hollow, and he looks grim. He returns Johnny's salute, 
	nods to Carmen.

				CARL
		Please continue, Sergeant.

				JOHNNY
		Dizzy wouldn't want our tears. She'd
		want us to remember her... with a
		vengeance. So go out and kill a bug 
		for Dizzy. Kill as many as you can.
		You are her revenge, and every bug 
		you kill honors her death.

	Johnny nods to the GUNNERY CREW. They load Dizzy's body into a
	tube. Johnny steps back, salutes Dizzy. Everyone salutes.

				JOHNNY
		Womb to tomb, cap trooper !

				ROUGHNECKS
		Womb to tomb !

	The CREW CHIEF fires the tube. Out the viewports, A PULSE OF LIGHT 
	disperses into space. The Roughnecks file out. Carl approaches.
	Carmen takes Johnny and Carl by the hand.

				CARMEN
		Well, look at this. The three of us back
		together again.

				JOHNNY
		How are you, Carl ?

				CARL
		Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your
		unit on Planet P. That mission had
		a very low survival probability...

				JOHNNY
		Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?

				CARL
		Elegant proof of intelligence, 
		isn't it ? We thought there might
		be a brain on P.

				CARMEN
		You knew and you sent them
		anyway ?

				CARL
		A colony has to reach a certain size
		before it produces a Brain... we think
		300 generations. Woulda too expensive
		to launch an operation if there wasn't a
		Brain...

	Carl sees the way Carmen is looking at him, like he's a bug.

				CARL
		You don't approve. Well, too bad.
		We're in this for the species, boys
		and girls. It's simple numbers, they
		have more, and everyday I have to
		make decisions that send hundreds of
		people like you to their deaths.

				JOHNNY
		Didn't they tell you, Colonel ?
		That's what cap troopres are good
		for.

	Carl allows himself a tiny smile.

				CARL
		Hope you're ready for more. We're
		going back to P to capture that Brain.

				JOHNNY
		The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.

				CARL
		I hear they need a new Lieutenant...
		Want the job ?

				JOHNNY
		I'll take it... until I get killed
		or you find someone better.

	KLAXONS sound. Suddenly, everyone has someplace to go.

				CARMEN
		Hope you get your Brain Bug, Carl.

				CARL
		It's good to see you two. It reminds
		me of the way things were before...

	Carl turns abruptly and heads away. His entourage follows.

				CARMEN
		Take care, wilya Johnny ?

				JOHNNY
		See you on the bounce !

153	INT	RODGER YOUNG - COMMAND & CONTROL - CARMEN

	steps onto the bridge. There's a new NUMBER 2 sitting in Zander's chair.
	She's right out of Tereshkova, and she looks scared. 
	Carmen turns to Captain Deladier.

				CARMEN
		Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?

				DELADIER
		He requested a combat assignment.
		There's always a need for experienced
		pilots on the ground.
		I had no choice but to let him go...
		He said you'd understand.

	Carmen bites her lip, takes first chair. Deladier feels bad for her, knows
	she's made a painful decision.

154	INT	RODGER YOUNG - DROP ROOM - ROUGHNECKS

	are suiting up. Ace enters.

				ACE
		Officer on the deck !

	Roughnecks fall in. Johnny steps into the room. There are many new and
	much younger faces.

				JOHNNY
		I only have two rules. Rule one,
		everyone fights. Rule two, no one
		quits. If you don't do your job,
		I'll kill you myself.
		Do you get me ?

				ROUGHNECKS
		We get you, sir !

				JOHNNY
			(to Ace, sotto voce)
		Who're all these kids ?

				ACE
		We got reinforced. Most of'em
		just got outa boot...

				JOHNNY
		We're the old men, Ace.

155	EXT	PLANET P - 4TH BRIGADE HQ - DAY - CARGO SHIPS

	have landed. Cap troopers set fire to huge piles of dead bugs. BULLDOZERS
	push bodies into a mass grave, among them Rasczak. 
	Johnny walks past with his team.

				JOHNNY
		We'll take this high ground. Lookouts
		there and therte and up there. If the
		bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood,
		we'll be the first to know.

				ACE
		Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know
		where they can deploy the skimmers.

				JOHNNY
		Down there on the flats, eh ?
		Listen up, Roughnecks ! Our
		primary objective is to assist
		our friends from the Fleet...

	Roughnecks boo.

				JOHNNY
		Alright, cut it out. We will deploy
		from skimmers in teams of six.
		If the bugs open up a battery,
		we put it out of business.
		Any questions ?

	A HERCULES CARGO BOAT hurtles out of the sky and lands on the high
	ground Johnny has intended forb his H.Q. Johnny scowls, marches over
	to the boat and confronts a FLEET OFFICER.

				JOHNNY
		Would'ya mind moving your boat ?

				FLEET OFFICER
		Better talk to the boss.

	The cargo bays open to deploy FLEET SKIMMERS. Zander jumps down
	to oversee the operation.

				JOHNNY
		You're standing on my H.Q., 
		Lieutenant !

				ZANDER 
		This is a Fleet-driven operation, son,
		and the Fleet thinks my boat will be 
		safer on the high ground.
		You can have everything else, eh ?

				JOHNNY
		You heard the Sky Marshall...
		Move it all down -

	Suddenly, in the distance, bug batteries open fire, not one but twenty.
	Zander and Johnny share a look of concern.

				ZANDER
		Rodger Young, prepare to receice 
		outgoing fire...!
			(to his crew chief)
		I'll take the first group.

				JOHNNY
		Saddle up, boys, that's our trash !

	KA-WHAM ! The Rodger Young takes a direct hit.

		Ibanez...LET'S GO !

160	INT	RODGER YOUNG - ESCAPE CORRIDOR - CARMEN

	Captain Deladier's leg is crushed when an airlock closes on her.

				DELADIER

	Carmen hits the release, pulls her free. Deladier pushes Carmen away.

				DELADIER
		Leave me, Lieutenant ! That's an order !

				CARMEN
		No way, ma'am !

161	INT	RODGER YOUNG - LIFE POD BAY - CARMEN

	cut her trigger finger off at the knuckle.

	Johnny knows it's true, swallows bitterly, turns away. That's when he sees it. 
	Nearby, the ground shifts, a claw breaks through, a hole opens up and bugs
	boil up out of the ground.

				SUGAR WATKINS
		Here they come !

	They turn and see a second bug hole open up.

				JOHNNY
		We're outa here. Lieutenant, get
		your men into the skimmers. This
		real estate's about to go buggy.

				ZANDER
		Hey, just calm down, I'm giving
		the orders here-

	The entire area underneath the base camp collapses to form a huge new
	canyon. The Hercules boat topples, crushing Skimmers and unfortunate
	Fleet personnnel.

171	EXT	NEW CANYON - DAY - JOHNNY

	and the surviving Roughnecks pick themselves up. The are now 30 meters
	below the planet's surface. Above them, bugs line the wide rim of the
	newly formed canyon.

				JOHNNY
		Form a perimeter !

	Through the dust, exposed bug tunnels can be seen in the canyon walls and
	piling out of them by the score, deadly Arachnid warriors. Johnny throws
	Zander a pulse cannon.

				JOHNNY
		Make yourself useful, fly boy...
		PREPARE TO REPEL BUGS !

	The Roughnecks open fire at the charging bug horde. Warriors are blown to 
	pieces. Gas grenades fly and H.E. rounds close tunnels. A maimed warrior 
	gets through and heads for Zander.

				ZANDER
		AAAAAAAAAAA !

	Johnny and Ace team up to blow it away. Zander takes a deep breath,
	loos around, impressed. The Roughnecks have killed a great many bugs.

				JOHNNY
		Ace, get on the com. Tell Fleet we
		need retrieval... Sugar, salvage some
		armor and suit up Lieutenant Barcalow.

	Sugar Watkins tosses a bloody jump boot his way.

				ZANDER
		Thanks.

				ACE
		Fleet Command says retrieval's no go.
		The battle group's at safe distance...
		and we got another problem.

	Ace points out a Tanker bug that's been brough up to the rim. 
	Johnny sees another.

				JOHNNY
		Looks like they're gonna hose us down...

	Johnny chews on this.

				JOHNNY
		Alright... Listen up, Roughnecks.
		We're gonna head west down through
		bug city, pick up any Rodger Young 
		survivors we run across, and join A
		Company. Get me ?

				ROUGHNECKS
		We get you, sir !

	Zander, awkward in a power suit, confronts Johnny.

				ZANDER
		What do you think you're doing ?

				JOHNNY
		I'm gonna save Carmen.

				ZANDER
		That would mean a comlete disregard
		for the mission objective. They hang
		you for that, Rico.

				JOHNNY
		Yeah, that's right.

	Johnny and Zander stare each other down.

				ZANDER
		Let's go.
		
				JOHNNY
		Move out.

	Johnny starts for the gaping mouth of an exposed bug tunnel and
	the others fall in behind him.

				ACE
		Bug hunt !

				ROUGHNECKS
		BUG HUNT !

172	INT	TUNNEL - DAY - JOHNNY

	leads his deadly force through enemy territory. The Roughnecks kill
	everything that gets in their way. Zander lends his inexperienced hand.

				JOHNNY
		Mr. Barcalow, save power, don't
		waste it on workers...
		Ace, tell Aardvark we're on our
		way...

				ACE
		Yes, sir !

	Warriors appear in the tunnel behind them.

				JOHNNY
		Sugar, close the tunnel...!

				SUGAR
		Fire in the hole !

	Sugar Watkins fires an H.E. round and seals the tunnel.

173	INT	BUG CITY - FEEDING PIT - DAY - CARMEN

	opens her eyes. She can hear BUGS CLICKING. She's in a pit filled 
	with human dead. A nearby carcass wears a uniform from 4th Brigade
	Off in the dark she hears HUMAN MOANING.

	She crawls over rotting corpses toward the sound. The moaning turns
	to SCREAMING. It's coming from outside the pit. She pulls herself
	up to peer over the edge. 

174	INT	BUG CITY - THE ROYAL COURT - DAY - CARMEN

	sees hundred of bugs at work, WARRIORS, WORKERS and dozens of 
	small (2 meters) CHARIOT BUGS. Aworker walks pas, stepping on her,
	but pays her no attention.

	She sees the source of the screaming:	Captain Deladier is hold
	between two warriors, and she's screaming because of what she sees,

				DELADIER
		NAAAAAAAA...! OH PLEASE...

	The BRAIN BUG is huge (5 meters) and pulpy. I has vestigial legs that
	cannot support ist weight, and so it must be moved by a shifting carpet of
	chariot bugs.

				DELADIER
		...OH GOD AAAAAAAAAAAAA...!

	A thorn-like PALP unfolds out of the brain bug and strikes, driving deep into
	Deladier's head and sucks her brains out.

				DELADIER
		AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !

	Carmen watches horrified as Deladier dies. The suddenly a warrior grabs her
	from above and drags her out of the pit. She screams as its claws slice into 
	her limbs.

				CARMEN
		AAAAAAAAAAAAAA !

	Now the brain bug comes for her. She sees the palp unfold, the thorn-like
	spike coming toward her. Carmen is no longer looking for escape.
	All she wants to do is die.

	Suddenly, every bug in the chamber stops as though to listen. Carmen hears it.
	A HIGH-PITCHED SQUEAL, getting louder. 
	Johnny enters the chamber alone.

	The warriors move toward him. He holds up a NUKE, source of the high-pitched
	tone. The ready light flashes. The Brain Bug emits a series of harsh clicks.
	The warriors freeze.

				JOHNNY
		You know what this is...?

	Johnny makes an explosive sound. The Brain Bug slowly withdraws its palp.

				JOHNNY
		Sure you do... You're a big fat smart
		bug, aren't you ?

	Johnny moves toward Carmen. The Brain Bug's multiple eyes track him.
	The warriors holding Carmen threaten. Johnny turns on the brain bug, 
	his finger on the nuke's trigger. 

				JOHNNY
		I'll take you with me.

	The Brain Bug clicks. The warriors back off. Carmen collapses.
	Johnny reaches for her.

				JOHNNY
		Take my hand !

	Chariot bugs move the Brain Bug down a hole. Workers seal the hole
	behind it with amazing speed. Johnny drags Carmen back toward the 
	tunnel he entered from. The warriors charge.

				JOHNNY
		Roughnecks...NOW !

	Johnny throws himself on top of Carmen as the Roughnecks burst into
	the chamber, guns blazing. The fight is furious, point blank, deadly to
	bug and Roughneck alike. 

	Sugar Watkins screams as a warrior rips his arm off. Zander takes a
	claw through the gut.

				ZANDER
		AAAAAAAAAAAAA !

	He blows it away, sees his intestines hanging out of the wound, shoves
	them back inside and keeps on fighting. A warrior rears up over Johnny
	and Carmen.

				JOHNNY
		Weapon !

	Ace throws him a Morita. Johnny catches it, pumps three rounds into the 
	bug's nerve stem. He struggles out from under the dead warrior.
	Every bug in the chamber is dead.

				JOHNNY
		Are you hurt ?

	Carmen throws her arms around Johnny.

				CARMEN
		Johnny...!

	Zander takes this in. Carmen sees him, then his wound.

				CARMEN
		Zander...! Oh, you're hurt.

	Ace takes a look at his wound, makes a face.

				ACE
		Ah geez...

	Zander pushes him away, struggles to his feet.

				JOHNNY
		Can you walk ?

				ZANDER
			(clenched teeth)
		Not a problem.

				JOHNNY
		Let's get some armor on her, and
		the we'll get outa this stinkin 
		bug hole !

	Various components are gladly passed forward. Johnny and Ace 
	help her putting it on.

				CARMEN
		I thought I was dead. Lucky for
		me you jokers showed up, eh ?

				ZANDER
		It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the
		mission objective to rescue you...

				CARMEN
		Is it true ?

				JOHNNY
		Yeah, if I live through this, 
		they'll probably hang me.
		Now com'on, let's move out !

175	INT	BUG CITY TUNNELS - DAY - THE ROUGHNECKS

	double-time it, racing for the surface. They come to a fork.

				CARMEN
		Which way ?

				JOHNNY
		Up. We gotta be near A Company 
		by now.

	The tunnel floor drops out. FIVE ROUGHNECKS disappear into the hole.
	WARRIORS climb up into the tunnel.

				JOHNNY
		FALL BACK !

	The Roughnecks bachk up fast, shooting. Zander staggers, collapses.
	Johnny drops to his side, rolls him over.

				JOHNNY
		How bad are you, pal ?

				ZANDER
		Been better, buddy.

	Johnny sees warriors coming up into the tunnel by the score.

				JOHNNY
		Alright, we're gonna carry you...

				ZANDER
		Nah, I figureyou folks oughta get 
		upstairs before it's too late...
		Gimmee the nuke.

	Zander checks his pulse cannon's available power.

				JOHNNY
		Don't be a hero...

				ZANDER
		This is my farm. Now c'mon, give
		me what you got and get out of
		here...

	Johnny nods, hands him the nuke. Carmen sees what's happening.

				CARMEN
		Zander, what are you doing ?

				ZANDER
		Just giving you something to
		remember me by, baby.

				CARMEN
		Zander, no...!

	He grabs her and kisses her. Johnny drags Carmen away. Zander opens 
	fire as the first warriors reach his position.

176	INT	BUG CITY - INCLINED TUNNEL - DAY - JOHNNY AND CARMEN

	race desperately for the surface. They hear the chatter of Zander's pulse cannon
	and the screams of dying bugs.

				JOHNNY
		GO.GO GO GO GO...!

	Tears stream down from Carmen's face.

177	EXT	PLANET P - DAY - JOHNNY AND CARMEN

	and the surviving Roughnecks make it to the surface. 	WOMP !
	A subterrenean nuclear explosion blows a column of earth and stone
	into the air.

178	EXT	PLANET P - A COMPANY BASE CAMP - JOHNNY

	and the others enter A Company's perimeter. No one notices their arrival
	because everyone's gathered in a big circle watching the Brain Bug.

				CARMEN
		Look... they got it.

	Several of its delicate legs were apparently broken during the capture.
	Carl approaches it without fear, puts his hand on the thing.

				GENERAL
		What's it thinking, Colonel ?

	Carl smiles in a cruel way.

				CARL
		It's afraid.

	Johnny and Carmen approach the General.

				JOHNNY
		Sir, I'd like to turn myself in.
		Dereliction of duty by an officer
		during wartime.

				GENERAL
		And you freely admit to it ?

				JOHNNY
		Yes, sir.

				GENERAL
		Is what this man says true,
		Lieutenant ?

				CARMEN
		To the best of my understanding,

    from a story by James Cameron

    AUGUST 11, 1993

    --------------------------------------------------------------

    1:06 AM DEC 30, 1999

    Blackness.  We hear:

                             VOICE
              Ready?

                             SECOND VOICE (LENNY)
              Yeah.  Boot it.

    A burst of bright white static exploding across the
    darkness.  A high whine on the audio track gives way to
    street sounds and rapid breathing.

    AN IMAGE wavers and stabilizes: A nervous POV.  We're in a
    car, sitting in the backseat, and we're nervous, the view
    swinging around, showing the street rolling by outside the
    windows, then whipping back to the two guys in the front
    seat.

    Our POV looks down at a SMALL RECORDING DEVICE in "our"
    hands.  A red LED is flashing.  We slip the recorder into
    a coat pocket.

                             OUR VOICE
              Okay.  It's goin'.  I'm recording.

    The guy riding shotgun, LANE, is just pulling a pantyhose
    over his head, smearing his features into a pig-like mask.
    He turns, DIRECTLY TO THE LENS, pissed off.

                             LANE
              Good one, dickhead.  Thanks for
              waitin' till I get this fuckin thing
              on.  You tryin' ta I.D. me, or
              what?

    He tosses another pantyhose right at us and we catch it.
    Our POV looks down, into the pantyhose, which comes up
    over our field of view.

    We realize: this is not some ride-along verite video.

    WE ARE ONE OF THESE GUYS.  Real honest-to-God point of
    view, with no cuts, no music.  This is not film, it is
    human experience.

    The driver is a Hispanic guy named "SPAZ" DIAZ.  Lane is a
    white guy who looks very strung out.  Couple of
    crackheads.  The car is a mid-seventies barge, piebald
    with primer.

                             LANE
              Next alley... just pull in slow.
                      (turning to us)
              Hurry up will ya.  Here.

    He hands us a big stainless steel revolver.  The POV looks
    down as our shaky hands snap open the cylinder, check the
    rounds, snap it closed.

    Diaz pulls the barge into an alley.  The headlights
    illuminate overflowing dumpsters.  A Chicano busboy is
    making trash runs out the back door of a restaurant, which
    he has chocked open.  The busboy goes back inside.

                             LANE
              Let's go.

    Out of the car, quickly, our own breathing loud in our
    ears.  We even hear our own heartbeat, racing now.
    Through the door, after Lane, moving fast.

    Into the kitchen.  Fluorescent glare.  The busboy turning,
    surprised, Lane putting the shotgun in his face.  Freezing
    him.  Lane puts a finger to his lips: "quiet" in any
    language.

    Our hand puts the magnum in the THAI COOK's face.  We get
    them down on the greasy floor, Lane controlling them with
    the shotgun.  He looks at us, snaps his eyes toward the
    front room.

    We hear voices as we approach the swing door.  Go through.

    Whip pan left, then right.  Scoping the layout.  Low-rent
    THAI place.  Red wallpaper.  Closing time.  Middle-aged
    Thai OWNER, by the cash-register, counting money.  Young
    Thai WAITRESS, cleaning up.  They look up, stunned, as we
    put the gun on them.

                             OUR VOICE
                      (shouting, edgy)
              Don't move, don't talk, don't do
              nothing.

    Our POV is whipping around, from the front door to the
    owner to the kitchen where Lane is standing in the doorway
    covering the cook and busboy, back to the owner as he
    steps back from the cash-register.

    We scoop up the big wad of bills: seven, eight hundred
    bucks in tens and fives.

    Now yelling, herding the owner and the waitress into the
    kitchen, the owner trying to calm the girl in singsongy
    Thai, Lane shouting at him to shut up.

    Into the walk-in cooler.  The steel door closes on four
    scared pair of eyes.  POV looking around, seeing... a
    dish-rack.  Our hand pulls out a spoon, drops the spoon
    handle through the hole in the cooler door-latch.  Locking
    them in.

    Lane heading out the back door.  Laughing, as he looks at
    the wad of cash our hand is waving in front of him.
    We follow Lane to the car.  Snap a look down the alley one
    way, then the other.

    Shit!  Cop Black-and-White pulling into the far end of the
    alley.  Heartbeat goes triple time.  Scrambling into the
    car.

    Door not even closed and SPAZ has it in reverse, burning
    rubber as he launches back down the alley.
    SCRUNCH!  The car grinds along one wall as SPAZ steers
    wildly backward.  Sparks right next to us.  Then--
    KBOOM!  As we slam into a dumpster and push it right out
    into the street.

    The cop has his lights and siren on, and is roaring at us
    as SPAZ cranks the wheel and punches it down the street.
    He curses in English and Spanish as he weaves between
    cars.  We pull off the stocking to see better.

    The cop car surges onto the street behind us.

    Looking ahead.  A red light.  Cars stopped, blocking the
    way.  Cutting to the right, onto the sidewalk, around the
    cars, into the intersection.

    A near miss with cross traffic, then accelerating.
    Another red light ahead.

                             LANE
              Don't stop!

    Truck entering the intersection.  Everyone yelling.  SPAZ
    cuts the wheel but too late...

    Clipping the truck and spinning.
    The street outside smearing past like the view from a
    Tilt-a-whirl.

    Then KBLAM!  Hitting something, God-knows-what, and
    launching up and over, and--

    KRUNCH!  Crushing metal and an explosion of broken glass.

    It gets quiet and still.  Tinkling glass as Lane moves.
    Then SPAZ is screaming.  The car is upside down.

    Crawling out of the side window.  A frenzy now.
    Whip pan to see the cops pulling up.

    Then whipping back to the wreck.  The engine is burning.
    Flames spreading rapidly.  SPAZ inside, pinned, upside
    down, blood pumping across his face.

    Our hands pulling Lane out.  He comes up running.

    We run after him, sprinting toward the welcoming darkness
    of an alley.

    Panting breath and heartbeats and sirens and somebody
    yelling.
    Gunshots.  Looking back.  Cops next to their car, firing.
    Ahead, Lane running into shadow.

    Then a door opening, a man coming out of a metal firedoor.
    Lane grabbing him, throwing him out of the way, holding
    the door open as we dive through into--

    A stairwell.  Lane sprinting up, two steps at a time.
    Trying the door at the second floor landing.  Locked.
    Shit.

    Running up.  Dizzying whirl as we run, up and up.

    The POV is finally broken by a...

                                                 CUT TO:

    INT.  UNDERGROUND GARAGE

    But we don't know where we are yet.  We see a man in
    extreme close-up: just his eyes and mouth.  The eyes are
    closed, the eyeballs tracking under the lids, like he is
    watching a movie in there.  This is LENNY.

                             LENNY
              This is great... the doors are all
              locked.  Who are these losers,
              friends of yours?

                                                 CUT TO:

    BACK TO POV as we reach the fifth floor landing.  Lane is
    coming unglued as he finds this door locked.  We look
    down, see cops coming two floors below.  One cranks off a
    couple rounds at us and we snap back from the railing.
    Pounding up the last flight.  Finally!  The door is
    unlocked.

    Blasting through it, behind Lane, onto the roof.  Running
    all out past AC units and pipes, air vents.  Looking up:
    an LAPD helicopter orbiting close.  It flicks the xenon
    onto us and we are running in a vibrating circle of blue
    daylight.

    Running along the edge of the roof.  Looking down.  Car
    burning upside down in the street below.  The gas tank
    explodes, filling the street with orange light.  We don't
    slow.  We're running all out.

                             LENNY (V.O.)
              Wow... the gas tank is a nice touch.
              Oh, oh, end of the line boys.

    Ahead, in POV we see the edge of the roof coming up.
    Beyond it is another building, about ten feet lower and
    separated by a 20 foot alley.

    But Lane doesn't slow down.  He leaps across the void and
    makes it to the other building, landing in a sprawl.
    We reach the edge and look down.  Six stories.  No ladders
    or fire-escapes.  Whip to behind us.  Cops running across
    the roof.

                             LANE
              Come on!  Fucking jump man!

    The POV backs up from the edge and then runs toward it...
    Out into the void.  Moving... airborne... then...
    WHAM!  Right into the parapet wall.

    Slipping down.  Brick wall right in our face.  Bloody
    fingers grabbing for a rusty piece of pipe running along
    the edge.

    Looking down... feet dangling over a sixty foot drop.
    A cat walking through a patch of light in the alley below,
    oblivious.
    Breathing raspy.  Snapping a look up as the pipe gives
    way.
    A keening whine coming from us as we scramble to climb up
    but...
    Snapping a look down--
    Walls rushing past, sound of wind, and our own raspy
    scream--
    Ground rushing up--

    Split second impression of a cat, looking up, yowling and
    running out of the way as--
    Pavement fills frame.  A burst of violent red light.
    Sound like a gunshot... but no echo.

    Only silence.  And blackness.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE

    Lit by miles of fluorescent.  Empty and echoing.  Close on
    Lenny.  He has something on his head.  Something that
    looks like a mutated set of Walkman headphones, except
    they have little gecko fingers that fit along the temples
    and over the forehead.  PLAYBACK "TRODES".  Lenny whips
    off the trodes, gasping as if he got gutpunched.

                             LENNY
              Goddamnit!  You know I don't deal in
              snuff.  How many times I hafta tell
              you?!

    Lenny is with a guy everybody knows as "TICK", a pale-
    skinned creature of the night in T-shirt and leather
    jacket.  Tick is a bottomfeeder in the techno-underground
    of the near future.

                             TICK
              Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.

                             LENNY
              Well you could've at least warned
              me.  You know I hate the zap... when
              they die.  It just brings down your
              whole day.  Jeez, Tick.

                             TICK
              Sorry.

    LENNY NERO is low thirties.  Handsome.  Charming.  And you
    better check to see if you still have your ring after you
    shake with him.  He is wearing an expensive Italian
    jacket, and what he thinks of as a "power tie." His Rolex
    isn't real.  His greasy hair is too long and curls around
    his collar.  He needs to shave.  A little sleazy.  But he
    has energy, and heavy street smarts.

    Lenny is sitting on the hood of his '97 BMW 1035i.  Tick
    is facing him, sitting in the back of his beat-to-shit
    70's van.  There are a lot of tapes and tech stuff piled
    inside the van.  Lenny has a Haliburton case open next to
    him, like a drug dealer.  In fact the whole setup looks
    like a drug deal, but it's not.  Though it is illegal.
    The case holds Lenny's personal playback deck, his trodes,
    and a rack of the little tapes in which he deals.  They
    are about the size of DAT tapes, and hold about 30 minutes
    of sensory experience... everything a person sees, hears,
    and feels... recorded directly from the cerebral cortex at
    the moment it is happening.

                             LENNY
              How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't
              the cops put it in evidence?

                             TICK
              With all the blood I guess they
              didn't see the rig.  Guy had it
              under a wig.

                             LENNY
              Yeah, but how'd it get to you?

                             TICK
              I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.
                      (off Lenny's impatient
                       look)
              Okay, okay... I got a deal with some
              a the paramedics.  My guy pages me
              and I pick it up at the morgue.  So
              whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be
              worth at least a grand.  Right?

                             LENNY
              Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I
              don't deal this kind of product, you
              know that.  I'll give you four for
              it, cause I've gotta cut off the
              last bit.  And my customers want
              uncut.

                             TICK
              Fuck that!  The last part's the
              best.  You dry-dive six stories and
              blammo!  Jack right into the Big
              Black.

                             LENNY
              I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's
              policy.  I got ethics here.

                             TICK
              Yeah, when did that start?  Come on,
              man!  It's what people want to see,
              and you know it.

                             LENNY
              So lay it off to somebody else.

                             TICK
              Come on, Lenny.  I got expenses.  I
              got to get this rig fixed.  Look at
              it...

    Tick holds up a zip-lock bag containing the Walkman-sized
    stainless steel CORTICAL RESONANCE RECORDER, the record
    deck we saw earlier in the POV.  Also in the bag is the
    SQUID NET, a matrix of sensors designed to conform to the
    human head (this is different from playback trodes).  The
    whole works are covered with congealed blood.

                             TICK
              Give me six at least.  This's a good
              clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.

                             LENNY
              Yeah, well, the first part's okay.
              Better than the usual soaps you
              bring me.

                             TICK
              Now that is cold, Lenny.  I always
              bring you choice.

    Lenny fishes around in a cardboard box at Tick's feet,
    pulling out a tape.

                             LENNY
              Sure, like this low-grade shit here,
              some girl in a fight with her
              boyfriend... it's a test-pattern.
              Nothing happens.  I'm snorin'.

                             TICK
              Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me
              real life.  Bring me street life.
              And, like, one man's mundane and
              desperate existence is another man's
              Technicolor.'

                             LENNY
              I said that?  Look, I'll take it for
              five, and you'll make out okay,
              because in this case it's pure
              cream, you don't have to cut
              anything back to the wearer.

                             TICK
              Ha!  That's for fucking sure.

                             LENNY
              What else you got?

                                                CUT TO:

    MONTAGE/SERIES OF SHOTS

    Lenny in his BMW, driving through the LA streets.
    Streetlights and neon flare across the windshield in a
    calligraphy of light.  Lenny works the cellular, gets
    messages on his DIGITAL PAGER, weaves in and out of
    traffic -- punches the buttons on his radio, changing
    stations all the time.  Raw, nervous energy: like a kid
    who can't stay still.  It's a hard hustle in the big food
    chain.

                             LENNY
              Look, Jerr.  I'm nothing if not a
              man of my word.  I'll drop the money
              by tomorrow, next day latest.  It's
              a little crazed right now.  Yeah, on
              my mother's eyes, I swear.  Thanks,
              buddy.
                      (hangs up)
              Prick.
                      (to the car ahead
                       honking)
              What kinda move you call that?!
              Lemmings.

    Lenny turns up the radio.  SELECTED DRIVE-BY IMAGES, as
    the talk-radio provides commentary.

    Lenny's car passing under glowing Santa Clauses on the
    light-poles.  Banners proclaiming the coming "Millennium
    LA" festivities.

                             TALK-RADIO HOST
              ... it's a little after 2 am on
              December 30th, 1999... the second to
              last day of the whole darn century,
              and the phone lines are open.  Dan
              from Silverlake, you're on the air.

    Transition to a rougher section of town.  Buildings roll
    by endlessly, tagged by gangs in graphic tribal patterns.
    some are burnt-out ruins.

                             DAN FROM SILVERLAKE
              Uh, hi.

                             HOST
              So Dan, are you looking forward to
              the New Year?

    A building is burning out of control.  In the foreground,
    silhouetted, a drunk sleeps soundly on a bus-bench.

                             DAN
              Not really.  I mean what's the
              point?  Nothing changes New Years
              day.  The economy sucks, gas is over
              three bucks a gallon, fifth grade
              kids are shooting each other at
              recess... the whole thing sucks,
              right?  So what the hell are we
              celebrating?

    A shanty-camp of homeless people under a freeway overpass.
    Homes made of cardboard and carpet remnants.  Their lives
    in shopping carts.

                             HOST
              You're a glass-is-half-empty kind of
              guy, aren't you Dan?  Well I for one
              happen to think that us making it
              2000 years is worth celebrating--

    Lenny cuts him off, punching to another station, and MUSIC
    blasts.  Something fast... a rap-metal hybrid.  Anger and
    energy.

    WE CUT IN fast blitzes of images like a burst of automatic
    weapons fire: helicopters on patrol, people running in the
    streets, buildings smoldering, fists raised, shouting
    people, paramedics rushing a body into an ambulance,
    Korean store owners armed to the teeth, a body covered by
    a yellow plastic sheet, blood running down the gutter.
    Cops in riot gear, with M-16s, on patrol in a Hispanic
    neighborhood.

    BACK TO LENNY coming out of a bar with a nervous
    businessman.  We don't hear the conversation.  MUSIC OVER.
    Lenny palms a roll of bills from the guy as he slips a
    squid tape into the pocket of the businessman's suit
    jacket.  Lenny claps him on the shoulder and walks away.
    Lenny's beeper goes off and he pauses to look at the
    number.

    ON LENNY DRIVING.

    Ahead, through the windshield we see a police checkpoint.
    The cops have thrown a block across the street and are
    shinning their lights in the cars as they creep through.
    Lenny slaps his ID against the side window with one hand,
    not missing a beat in his conversation.  This is just part
    of life in LA.

                             LENNY
                      (on cellular)
              Jimbo.  I'm there, Jimmy.  Right now,
              can't you hear me knockin'?

    CUT TO LENNY working his way through a crowded club, music
    pounding.  Strobe lights.  We don't see much.  He hears
    his phone rings and pulls the tiny DIGITAL CELLULAR out of
    his breast pocket.  Sticks a finger in his other ear and
    answers.

    CUT TO LENNY, back in the BMW, on the streets.  On the
    move.

                             LENNY
              -- so you line up the talent, shoot
              the clip, get it to me by Monday.
              OK?  Client wants a guy and two
              girls, the guy wears... yeah, I
              know, thinks he's being original.
              Girls have to be young.  So don't
              use your mother like you usually do.
              Yeah, you too, pendejo.  And no big
              tits... French tits.  That's it...
              like Champagne glasses... you got
              it.  What a pro.  Page me.

    LENNY PULLS UP to the security checkpoint of a gated
    community.  The white upper-middle class hiding behind
    walls and paid security.

                             LORI
              If you read the Bible, Mark, you'd
              know that there won't be another
              thousand years.  Right now we are in
              the Last Days, as foretold in the
              book of--

                             HOST
              The Last Days?  You mean the coming
              of the Apocalypse, right?  The
              Rapture?

    Lenny fishes around in the glove compartment, flipping
    through about twenty plastic security passes for different
    parts of town, all bogus.  He finds the right one and
    flips it onto the dash.

                             LORI
              Yes, that's right.  You only have to
              look at the signs... there are wars
              and rumors of wars--

    The RENT A COP at the guardshack hits him with his light.

                             LENNY
                      (lying)
              I live here.

    The cop waves him through.  Lenny is the right color.

                             HOST
              Now just so the rest of us know how
              much time is left, when is the
              Rapture supposed to hit, exactly?
              Is it midnight New Year's Eve?

    And WE CUT to a burst of news videotape, enlarged, noisy,
    distorted... images of a great gathering in the desert,
    the faithful waiting for God's sign as the millennium
    approaches.

                             HOST
              Is that midnight LA time, or Eastern
              Standard or what?  I mean, what time
              zone is God in, anyway?

                             LORI
              I pray for you all.

    Lenny's BMW cruises past an overturned burning car.  There
    is no-one around.  He barely glances at it.  Common sight
    these days.  If it is the end of the world, Lenny's not
    going to let it break his rhythm.

                             LENNY
                      (cellular)
              I just got something in, Bobby, you
              might appreciate.  A 211 at a Thai
              joint goes south, and these three
              scuzzballs end up in a gun-and-run.
              It's a beauty, two thumbs up.
              Parental discretion advised.  I'm
              talking it's the master, not some
              stepped-on copy.  One of a kind.

    LENNY INSIDE A GLOOMY BAR.  He slides into a booth with
    NORM SKINNER, a paunchy guy with thinning hair who dresses
    too young.  A pretty, stoned-looking girl is leaning
    against Skinner.

                             LENNY
              Yo, Skinner.  The Skin Man.
                      (fingering his
                       jacket)
              Red leather.  Nice feminine touch.

                             SKINNER
                      (laughing)
              Fuck you, Nero.

                             LENNY
              Whattya got for me?

    CUT TO: POV of a woman writhing above us in ecstasy.
    Lovemaking in point-of-view.  We look down, see OUR BODY,
    a woman's body... our hands moving over the other woman's
    torso.  The image is dark, a primal impression.  Sound of
    harsh breathing, rustling sheets.

    BACK TO LENNY in the booth with Skinner.  Lenny has
    Skinner's tape running in a playback deck clipped to his
    belt, next to his pager.  He is hunched over the table,
    "sampling" the merchandise by touching a few of the trode
    pads to his temple without putting on the whole headset.
    Like a coke dealer taking a little on the fingernail.

                             LENNY
              Yeah, I can use this...
                      (to the stoned girl)
              ... but honey you gotta move your
              eyes slower next time.  It's too
              jerky.

                             SKINNER
              It was her first time, Lenny.  Cut
              her some slack.

    TIGHT SLOWMO SHOTS... ABSTRACT: SQUID tapes and money
    changing hands.  A SQUID tape sliding sensuously into a
    deck.

    TIGHT CU LENNY, through the windshield of his car.  Neon
    moving over him.

    NEWS FOOTAGE: LAPD Aerospatiales circling, their xenon
    lights turning night into day, giving the impression of a
    futuristic war zone.

    INSIDE THE COCKPIT, the infrared camera shows green-screen
    images of people in cars, in their homes... like footage
    of hyenas shot at night in total darkness.

    The impression is of a society under siege, an occupied
    nation... a watched society where the camera eye and the
    police spotlight define our reality.

                             HOST
              Go ahead, caller, you're on the air.

                             VOICE
              My name's DeWayne, and I got a New
              Year's resolution for the po-lice.
              Hey, yo Five Oh, you better get down
              with 2-K.

    CRASH Unit cops with a bunch of Salvadoran gang kids
    racked up against a storefront.  A dozen 16 year-old girls
    and guys, hands against the wall, acting bored, as the
    cops walk up and down, reading IDs.

                             HOST
              2-K?  What's that DeWayne?

    A group of cops have two black guys proned out.  Nearby a
    crowd jeers, shouting insults.  A black kid throws a beer
    bottle and one of the cops chases him into the crowd.

                             DEWAYNE
              2-K.  The big two thousand.  Comin
              tomorrow night.  Out with the old
              and in wit da new.  See for the Man,
              no new is good new, what I'm sayin.
              He like to keep it the way it is.
              But we going to take it, make it
              new, make it our own.  History gonna
              start right here, right now--

    LENNY cuts him off as his cellular call connects.

                             LENNY
              Hi, Dave, this is Lenny.
                      (pause)
              Nero.  Lenny Nero.  That's right.
              Oh, is it late?  Sorry.  It's just
              that I have something that might be
              of interest, and since I always call
              you first--
                      (pause)
              Uh, huh.  Well, what would be a good
              time?  Okay, sure.  Catch you then.

                                                CUT TO:

    A GAME ARCADE.  Light and noise as the customers drop
    quarters for synthetic thrills.  Lenny is talking to a
    nice-looking street kid in his early 20's named EDUARDO.

                             EDUARDO
              Let me get this straight... you
              gonna pay me 200 bucks to put on a
              hair net and bang some beautiful
              babe.  I don't know, I gotta think
              about this.

    Lenny smiles and pulls out a SQUID-net.  He motions
    Eduardo into the shadows.

                             LENNY
              Okay, let's get you wired up.  I
              hope this axle grease you got in
              your hair doesn't screw up the squid
              receptors.

                             EDUARDO
              What's all this squid shit?

    As Lenny works, fitting the network of sensors over
    Eduardo's head, he holds class.

                             LENNY
              Superconducting QUantum Interference
              Device.  SQUID.  Got it?  There's
              gonna be a test.

                             EDUARDO
              Hey, fuck you, man.

                             LENNY
              Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a
              sense of humor at all times.  Okay,
              the receptor rig... what I'm putting
              on your head... sends a signal to
              the recorder.
                      (Lenny holds up the
                       recorder)
              See we call it "being wired," but
              there's no wire.  You gotta keep the
              recorder close... five, six feet
              away max, like in your jacket pocket
              by the bed or wherever you're going
              to close escrow, know what I mean?

                             EDUARDO
              Yeah, right.

    Lenny fits a wig from his briefcase over Eduardo's head,
    turning him into a headbanger.  Eduardo scowls at this
    set-back to his suavete.

                             LENNY
              Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes
              around.  Don't look in the mirror or
              you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a
              half hour of tape, so give me some
              lead-in to the main event.  But
              don't wait too long, I don't want to
              be going out for popcorn.  And don't
              act natural.  Don't act at all.
              Just forget the thing is on.  Got
              it?

                             EDUARDO
              No problem.

                             LENNY
              A star is born.

    EXT.  TRAIN YARD - NIGHT

    A woman's feet moving along the steel rail of a train
    track at night.  The woman has no shoes, her feet bare.

    IRIS stumbles along the track, clutching one shoe
    pointlessly to her chest.  She is swearing and crying,
    runny mascara leaving two tragic streaks down her pale
    face.  Despite this we see that she is attractive, though
    her dress and make-up seem designed to convey overt
    sexiness.  Her white skin is complemented by a wild mane
    of curly red hair.

    She is in her early twenties, and the harshness of her
    life has just begun to harden her features.  She looks
    lost and without hope, in fear of her life.  Her breath
    comes in hitching sobs, and her eyes are wild.

    She runs between cold steel walls of freight cars, looking
    behind her frequently.  A police helicopter is circling.
    Its xenon beam plays over the train yard, sweeping over
    the cars.  She hunches into the shadows of a freight-car
    as the beam passes over.  Looking under the cars she sees
    an LAPD patrol car cruising down a street adjoining the
    yard, its searchlight sweeping toward her.  It moves on.

    She continues her run, moving away from the direction of
    the patrol car.  She reaches a chain-link fence.  Crying,
    she scrambles over it, cutting her hands and ripping her
    dress.  Another patrol car passes two blocks away.  She
    crouches in the tall grass until it rounds a corner out of
    sight.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  ALLEY AND STREET - NIGHT

    Iris sprints down an alley between buildings.  Rats
    scatter into the shadows ahead of her.  She doesn't seem
    to notice.  All she cares about are the police lights, and
    the sound of the helicopter droning, circling.

    She pauses at the mouth of the alley, scanning the well-
    lit street beyond.  There are people here: downtown low-
    life street people.  A half-block away is a brightly lit
    sign marking the entrance to a Red-Line subway station.

    She walks along the sidewalk, her eyes on the sign,
    feeling exposed as she walks openly, her heart pounding.
    She is a mess, but in this section of town people barely
    glance at her.

    LOW ANGLE on her bare feet, standing out amid the shoes
    and boots of winter.

    SHE CROSSES the street, and reaches the sidewalk just as a
    black-and-white rounds the corner at the end of the block,
    behind her.

    IN THE CRUISER are TWO COPS, who are scanning the street.
    They look intense.  Revved up.  They are BURDEN SPREG, a
    massive, barrel-chested street-lifer in his mid-forties,
    and DWAYNE ENGELMAN, an aggressive hard-on in his twenties
    with a brush cut, a Nautilus body, and a face like a
    ferret.

                             ENGELMAN
              She's a hooker, vice'll have her in
              the book.  We can pick her up later.

                             SPREG
              No.  Now.

    IRIS knows the cops are behind her.  She is terrified to
    turn.  Finally she can't stand it any more.  She breaks
    into a run.  The patrol car speeds up suddenly, roaring
    after her.

    Iris sprints along in her bare feet, all-out like a track
    runner.  The black-and-white screeches to the curb next to
    her and the cops jump out.

    Iris hits the stairs down to the subway station at a full-
    tilt boogie, knocking down some poor old guy whose
    groceries go flying.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  SUBWAY STATION AND TRAIN

    Iris trips on the landing, spins sprawling across the
    filthy tile floor, and comes up running.  Panting with
    fear and exertion she clears the turnstiles like a
    hurdler.

    The cops pound down the stairs two at a time.  Spreg draws
    his 9mm.  In his eyes we see an unaccountable craziness...
    a hunter who has as much at stake somehow as the prey.

    Street people fall back as Spreg thunders through them.
    They aren't about to get in the way of this juggernaut cop
    and his boy wonder.

    The two cops reach the platform.  No Iris in sight.

    MOVING WITH THEM as they slow to a walk, scanning.  A
    couple of low-lifes standing around, waiting for trains,
    eye them warily as Spreg gets a call on his Rover.

                             DISPATCHER (V.O.)
              Do you request back-up?

                             SPREG
              Negative.  Suspect is a black male,
              age 35 to 40.  We're handling it.

    A train pulls into the station with a whoosh of air.  A
    few people board.  There is only the sound of the cops'
    footsteps as they move along the empty platform.  With a
    pneumatic hiss the train's doors begin to close.

    Suddenly Iris breaks from behind a column up ahead at a
    full sprint.  Spreg unleashes his size 13 cop shoes,
    thundering along the platform to intercept her.  Engelman
    straight-arms his pistol.

                             ENGELMAN
              FREEZE!

    Iris clears the doors just as they hiss shut.  Her
    momentum carries her clear across the car, where she slams
    into the far wall and staggers back, almost falling.  She
    gasps for breath and looks up to see...

    ... Spreg crashing against the outside of the doors she
    just came through as the train starts to move.  He tries
    to force the doors apart... can't.  He aims his gun
    through the window.

    Thinking fast Iris dives to his side of the car and
    presses herself up against the solid wall next to the
    door, where he can't see her.

    OUTSIDE, Spreg is running next to the accelerating train.
    He swings his pistol, smashing the window with the butt.

    Iris screams as Spreg lunges through the opening next to
    her like some uniformed nightmare and grabs her.  He is
    still running alongside, pulling on her.  Trying to drag
    her right out through the window.

    She struggles.  Bites his beefy hand.  He swears and lets
    go.  Then makes one last grab.  Gets his fingers into her
    long mane of hair.  Yanks on her.  She comes half out the
    window, screaming.

    Then... RIP!  The hair pulls off her head.

    Spreg drops away, behind the speeding train, holding a
    red wig.  He looks at it stupidly, then raises his pistol
    and fires at Iris.

    She jerks back through the window and drops to the floor.
    A couple of shots hit the metal outside.  We see Iris has
    short hair, platinum white.  In it are a few of the many
    pins which held the wig securely in place.  She gasps for
    air, sobbing and hugging her knees, trembling all over.

    SPREG STANDS on the platform, watching the train
    disappear, as Engelman runs up.  Spreg looks at the wig in
    his hand, disgusted.  He turns it and looks inside, at the
    cap.

    CLOSE ON THE CAP inside the wig: there is an intricate
    network of sensors in a grid over the entire underside of
    the wig.  The sensors are connected by wires, in a pattern
    like the veins of a leaf, bundling to a small, flat metal
    box, the size of a cigarette case.  It is a SQUID NET.

    Iris was wired.  Spreg just stares at the SQUID NET, eyes
    going crazy wide.

                             ENGELMAN
              Oh shit.

    IT'S 4 AM.  Lenny trudges through a heavy security gate
    into the center court of his ratty building.  The pool
    furniture is in the pool.  Gang graffiti marks the walls.
    Bars on all the windows.  One of the doors looks like
    somebody opened it with an ax.  The pool lights give the
    place an eerie, dead glow.  Can out slick Lenny really
    live in this dump?

    Through a barred window we see Lenny approaching as we
    hear the OUTGOING MESSAGE on his answering machine in the
    F.G.

    BEEP.  And...

                             IRIS (V.O.)
              Lenny, goddamn it, you got to be
              there, you got to help me, come on,
              pick up, pick up...

    Through the window we see Lenny fishing in his pocket for
    his keys.

    Iris continues to grip the phone even after she has hung

    INT.  LENNY'S APARTMENT

    LENNY doesn't stop to play back Iris' message, or any of
    the twenty others on his machine.  He just deadbolts the
    door and locks a steel bar across the door frame, then
    carries his Haliburton...

    ... toward the bedroom.  And we see the truth of his
    reality.  Lenny's crib is a shit-box.  It is a small one-
    bedroom, barely furnished.  A couple of chairs.  Swap-meet
    couch.  Cardboard boxes full of tech gear stacked in the
    corners, unidentified electronics components piled on a
    table, cables strung everywhere.  God knows what this
    stuff is.  There is aluminum foil taped to all the
    windows.  Fast food cartons, empty Coke cans, pizza boxes
    everywhere.  The bachelor apartment from hell.  High-tech
    low-life.

    He goes into the bedroom.  Mattress on the floor.  Same
    infernal interior decoration, but this room is dominated
    by racks of tapes... Squid tapes.

    Lenny pours himself a vodka from a bedside bottle, takes
    off his clothes and hangs them over a chair.  He sits on
    the bed in his underwear, looking lonely and depressed.
    This is the private Lenny: No plans.  No dreams.  Nothing
    to look forward to but another day of the hustle.

    He puts a set of playback trodes carefully on his head,
    fishes around in a shoe box among a bunch of tapes,
    squinting at the hand-written labels: they all say
    "FAITH." Only the dates are different.

    He selects one and inserts it in the deck, makes some
    minute adjustments.  Sips his vodka.  Leans back.  Closes
    his eyes.  And hits PLAY.

    PLAY BACK SEQUENCE/ POV:

    We are moving along the Venice boardwalk, following a
    YOUNG WOMAN on Rollerblades.  By our motion, it is obvious
    that we are on Rollerblades too, and not doing so well.
    The woman is laughing, turning circles around us, cracking
    up at our discomfort.
    We hear Lenny's voice complaining a mile a minute, and we
    realize the POV is his.  The girl takes our hands, skating
    backward, towing us along the boardwalk.  It is a sunny
    afternoon, and it is the usual boardwalk freak show all
    around us.

    The woman is FAITH JUSTIN, a singer.  Lenny is desperately
    in love with her.  It's not hard to see why.  She is
    beautiful, in an alive, dynamic way.  Her hair is a wild
    dark mane, and her eyes are spectacular... intense.  She
    moves with a lithe, sinuous grace.  We are staring at her
    eyes instead of concentrating on skating.

    Whammo!  The POV spins and we are sitting, looking up at
    Faith as she circles, laughing.  She skates over to help
    us up.

    CUT TO LENNY, on his bed, smiling.  He punches Fast
    Forward.

    BACK TO POV.  A kinetic blur of digital hash, then...

    We are following Faith, now holding her skates, up the
    steps to a beach apartment.  Inside it is funky and
    comfortable.

    Music from a disk player she left on.  Bob Marley singing
    "Three Little Birds".  Faith, covered with a sheen of
    sweat, sways to the music as she goes into a bedroom.  We
    follow her.

    She comes out of the small bathroom with a towel, starts
    to dry off.  Sunlight comes in the window lighting up
    Faith like she is in a spotlight.  We move up behind her
    and take the towel away, and now we see Lenny standing
    behind Faith in the mirror over the dresser.

    He puts his arms around her and they sway together to the
    music.  He runs his fingers in lazy circles over her
    sweaty belly.  Then leans down and licks the sweat off her
    shoulder, all the while watching her in the mirror.  A
    voyeur recording his voyeurism through his own eyes, so he
    can replay and relive the moment.

    Their eyes meet in the mirror.

    They both watch as Lenny slides his hand up under her
    halter and caresses her nipples.  She moans softly,
    responding.  She turns to him, and our POV shifts directly
    to her.  She is right in front of us, in TIGHT CLOSE UP.
    The intimacy is power.

                             FAITH
                      (laughs)
              Hey, you going to watch or you going
              to do?

                             LENNY
              Watch and see.

    We lean toward her, until her eyes fill frame as they
    close in a kiss.  We (Lenny) keeps ours open.  Our hands
    pull her halter over her head.  Then she pulls up on
    Lenny's T-shirt, laughing.  We see it go over our eyes,
    blocking the view for a moment.

    Then Faith kisses Lenny's bare chest.  We are looking down
    at her, looking down across our body, Lenny's body, as
    Faith kisses lower, kneeling in front of us, unbuckling
    our belt and we--

    CUT TO LENNY in the here and now.  Lost in playback memory
    bliss.  He inhales sharply behind a wave of electronically
    recorded pleasure.

    BACK TO POV.  Lenny pulls Faith up to his face, kissing
    her, then pushing her gently to the bed, where we lie down
    together in a pool of sunlight slashing across the tangled
    sheets.  She looks up, right at us...

                             FAITH
              I love your eyes, Lenny.
                      (she touches our
                       eyelids)
              I love the way they see.

    CUT TO LENNY, lost in the swirl of sensation.  He touches
    his tongue to his fingertip.

    IN POV we look down at Faith as we enter her.  She gasps
    and closes her eyes, grabbing the headboard with both
    hands.  There is only the sound of gasping breaths, the
    creaking bed frame.  She rocks with the rhythm of our
    thrusts, borne away by the intensity until she cries out.

    CUT TO LENNY, reliving the past, under the electrodes.  He
    reacts to the past orgasm.  The tape ends, Lenny slowly
    takes off the trodes.  There is a tiny tear at the corner
    of his eye.

    INT.  LENNY'S APARTMENT/SERIES OF SHOTS

    2:14 PM, DECEMBER 30

    Lenny cracks an eye as the Sony 35" blinks on in alarm
    mode: news flashes of the day before New Year's Eve...
    police preparations for the epic Millennium L.A. shebang
    downtown, the National Guard doing riot prep, etc.

    Sunlight comes like lasers through holes in the aluminum
    foil over the windows.  Lenny goes to the kitchen in his
    underwear, searches for breakfast in the fridge, which is
    empty except for a red-white-and-blue 2-stick popsicle.
    Good morning.

    The TV screen shows a murder scene with cops milling
    around, yellow plastic over three crumpled forms on the
    ground.  It cuts to a file photo of a severe-featured
    black man.

                             ANCHORWOMAN
              ... bodies of two men found early
              this morning under the Hollywood
              freeway have been identified as rap
              star Jeriko One and bandmember James
              Polton, known to fans as "Replay".
              A third body, that of a woman, has
              not yet been identified.  With his
              band, the Prophets of Rage, Jeriko
              One's outspoken political stance
              and violent lyrics have stirred
              nationwide controversy...

    CUT TO: A little later.  Lenny sucks on the popsicle while
    he puts the night's wardrobe together.  This is a ceremony
    he observes carefully.  Suit laid out on the bed, shirt
    beneath the jacket.  Lenny matches a tie to the ensemble
    -- well, maybe -- tries another -- that's the one.

                                                CUT TO:

    Lenny, behind the wheel of the BMW.  He is revved up, his
    look dialed-in.  He's on the move.  Seizing the day.

                      (on cellular)
              You know I can get you anything you
              want, anytime you want it, just not
              right now.  We'll hook up at the
              club later.  Around eleven.  Yeah.

    Lenny wheels into a parking lot, finds a space, grabs his
    Haliburton and steps out, heading for the front door of
    the Coral Lounge.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  CORAL LOUNGE

    The decor is sort of Polynesian.  Goofy tropical motif
    murals on the walls.  The place has a mixed bag of
    customers, including upwardly mobile low-lifes who have
    graduated from the streets and use it as a kind of office.
    It is a crossroads for druggies, upscale hookers, junior
    entertainment suits slumming after a day in the pressure
    cooker.

    Lenny cruises through like he owns the place, greeting a
    number of the early regulars.  We get the impression he
    knows everybody, all the time, everywhere he goes.  He
    leans on the bar.

                             BARTENDER
              Hey, Lenny.

                             LENNY
              Anything without an umbrella.

    He gets backslapped by a guy in a satin racing jacket:
    Fabrizio.

                             FABRIZIO
              Lenny my man, I think you want to
              meet a friend of mine.

    Lenny follows Fabrizio's look to a guy, dressed LA power-
    casual, sitting at a booth across the room.

                             LENNY
              Looks like money to me.

    Lenny grabs his drink off the bar and follows Fabrizio
    across the room.

                             FABRIZIO
              Don't forget your friends.

                             LENNY
              10 percent, Fabri, like always.

    They slide into the booth with KEITH.

                             FABRI
              Keith, this is Lenny.  Guy I was
              telling you about.  He can get you
              anything you--

                             LENNY
                      (cutting him off)
              Just a second.  Not to be rude,
              Keith, but I got to ask, are you a
              cop?

                             KEITH
              I understand.  No, I'm not.

                             LENNY
              You understand?  Attorney!  Right?
              Am I right?

                             KEITH
              That's right.

    Lenny sizes the guy up, looks around the edge of the
    table.

                             LENNY
              Tassel shoes.  Entertainment law,
              would be my guess.
                      (off the guy's scowl)
              Relax.  I just like to guess, is
              all.  It's my job to know people and
              what they want... what's behind
              their eyes.

                             FABRIZIO
              Lenny gives people their heart's
              desire.  Ain't that right, Lenny?

                             LENNY
              That's right.  My second question I
              gotta ask, so we get our bearings
              here... have you ever jacket in?
              Have you ever wiretripped?

                             KEITH
              No.

                             LENNY
                      (a winning grin)
              A virgin brain!  Well we're going to
              start you off right.  So what do you
              know about this?  Save us some
              time...

                             KEITH
                      (shrugs)
              Just what I've read.  That the
              technology was developed for the
              Feds, to replace the body wire.  And
              now it's gone black market.  So, uh,
              do I get the deck from you?

                             LENNY
              I'll set you up, get you a deck at
              my cost... since my thing is the
              software.

                             KEITH
              Clips.

                             LENNY
              That's right.  Clips.
                      (Lenny leans in,
                       working the guy)
              Look, I want you to know what we're
              talking about here.  This isn't like
              TV only better.  This is life.  It's
              a piece of somebody's life.  Pure
              and uncut, straight from the
              cerebral cortex.  You're there.
              You're doing it, seeing it, hearing
              it... feeling it.

                             KEITH
              What kind of things exactly?

                             LENNY
              Exactly anything.  Whatever you
              want.  Whoever you want to be.
                      (handing Fabrizio a
                       twenty)
              Fabri, get us another round, would
              you.

    Fabrizio gets the hint and heads for the bar.

                             LENNY
              You want to go skiing without
              leaving your den, you can.  But I'm
              assuming a guy like you, you wanna
              go skiing you fly to Aspen.  That's
              not what you're interested in here.
              It's about the stuff you can't
              have... right?  The forbidden
              fruit.

    Keith nods, mesmerized by Lenny.

                             LENNY
              Like running into a liquor store
              with a .357 magnum in your hand,
              feeling the adrenalin pumping
              through your veins.  Or...
                      (pointing discreetly)
              ... see that guy, with the drop-dead
              Philipino girl friend?
                      (Keith looks)
              Wouldn't you like to be that guy for
              twenty minutes?  The right twenty
              minutes.  I can make it happen.  And
              you won't even tarnish your wedding
              ring.

    Keith touches his ring self-consciously, then grins.

                             KEITH
                      (hooked like a carp)
              Sounds good.

                             LENNY
              I can get you what you want.  You
              just have to talk to me.  I'm your
              priest, your shrink, your main
              connection to the switchboard of
              souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa
              Claus of the Subconscious.  You say
              it, you even think it, you can have
              it.  You want a girl, you want two
              girls?  I don't know what your thing
              is or what you're curious about...
              you want a guy?  You want to be a
              girl... see what that feels like?
              You want a nun to tie you up?  It's
              all doable.

                             KEITH
                      (flushed, sweating,
                       ready)
              Talk to me about costs, here.

                             LENNY
              Listen, before we get into numbers,
              I want you to try a taste.  I got a
              deck with me.

                             KEITH
              What?  Right Here?

                             LENNY
                      (grinning)
              Step into my office.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  CORAL LOUNGE/MEN'S ROOM

    Close on Keith's face, as he sits on the sink counter
    reacting to a Squid tape.  He jerks... his mouth drops
    open... he gasps.  His hands start to move over his body,
    feeling it wonderingly.  He gasps again, tilts his head
    down, moans... and Lenny hits Pause on the Playback.
    Keith opens his eyes to a grinning Lenny.

                             LENNY
              You were just an eighteen year old
              girl taking a shower.  Are you
              beginning to see the possibilities
              here?

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  PARKING LOT/CORAL LOUNGE

    A figure moves stealthily from the shadows and approached
    Lenny's car: Iris, hair dyed black now, wearing jeans and
    a coat but still showing scars from last night's pursuit.
    She tries the door of the car: locked.  She looks toward
    the Coral Lounge, debates whether to go look for Lenny.
    Better not.

    She takes a Squid tape from her pocket, and scribbles a
    note on the label: "HELP ME.  IRIS." She drops the tape
    through a 2-inch gap in Lenny's sun roof... and it bounces
    off the seat, onto the floor.

    She looks through the windshield, totally distraught,
    trying to see where the tape landed... and sees the
    reflection of cop cruiser lights coming down the street.
    She crouches next to the BMW, trying to blot herself out.
    And when the cruiser passes, she slumps to the ground,
    crying, afraid to move.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  CORAL LOUNGE

    A man in his late 30s: longish hair, no shave since the
    weekend, army jacket bulking over a massive frame.  A
    daunting figure as he approaches the bartender.

                             MAN (MAX)
              Where is he?

    Bobby, the bartender, cocks his eye toward the restrooms.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  CORRIDOR/CORAL LOUNGE

    Lenny unlocks the men's room door and walks down the dingy
    corridor with her new customer, Keith.

                             KEITH
              Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get
              someplace a little less public?

                             LENNY
                      (grinning)
              You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops
              have more to worry about in this
              city than the squid-trade, believe
              me--

    Behind them, the door of the women's bathroom whips open
    and the guy in the army jacket grabs Lenny from behind and
    SLAMS him face-first into the wall, jamming a .45 against
    his skull.

                             MAN (MAX)
              Don't move!  That's it, assume the
              position you miserable techno-perv
              puke.

    Cop style, the man in the army jacket kicks Lenny's feet
    apart.  Starts to cuff him.

                             MAN
                      (to Keith)
              Beat it fuckwad.

    Ash-white, Keith lays a smoke trail down the hall.  On the
    main floor of the club, Fabrizio sees him splitting and
    hurries after him.

    Back in the corridor, Lenny spins around and shoves his
    attacker against the opposite wall.  The guy offers no
    resistance.  In fact, he's too weak from laughing.

                             MAN (MAX)
              Gotcha.

                             LENNY
              Damnit, Max, I was with a client!
              You think that's funny?  To mess
              with a man's livelihood?  It's not
              funny!

                             MAX
              You see the look on that preppy
              puke's face?  Fuckin' pissed in his
              Topsiders.

                             LENNY
                      (laughing a little)
              Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me
              money.

                             MAX
              Come on, amigo, the world's full of
              marks.  And nobody knows how to work
              'em like you do, pal.  You could
              sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a
              wedding ring!  Let me buy you a
              drink.

                             LENNY
              Least you can do.

    Max Peltier, which he mispronounces "Pelcher", slings his
    arm fraternally over Lenny's shoulder.  They cross to the
    bar.  Max roars greetings to several regulars, pushing
    between strangers like an out of control tractor.

                             REGULAR
              Yo, Pelcher!  Mad Max!

                             MAX
              Fuckin' A right I'm mad!  I might
              kill every man in here.  But first
              I'm buyin' my buddy here a drink.
                      (seeing another
                       regular)
              Hey O'Neal!  You were right, your
              wife does give good head.

    Max lurches onto a barstool and hunches there like a
    misanthropic bear, pounding the bartop.

                             MAX
              Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor!
              Double shots.  Make it Tres
              Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the
              best for my good friend Lenny, the
              finest cop that ever got thrown off
              the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie.

                             LENNY
              Thanks, Max.

                             MAX
              D'you always have to dress like a
              fuckin' pimp?

                             LENNY
              This tie cost more than your entire
              wardrobe.

                             MAX
              That's not sayin' much.

                             LENNY
              It's the one thing that stands
              between me and the jungle.

    Max raises his double shooter.

                             MAX
              To the jungle!  Where outa the blue
              some shitbird can cap you in the
              back of the head and ruin your whole
              day.

    He downs it in two fierce gulps.

                             LENNY
              You were lucky, Max.

                             MAX
              Yup.  So darn lucky.  I wake up with
              a .22-short floating in my brainpan,
              and a cop pension I can't live off
              of.  Good thing I wasn't any
              luckier.  Bobby!  Another shooter
              right here!

    Bobby pours for Max.

                             MAX
              You seen Faith lately?

    Lenny reacts visibly to the name, his whole demeanor
    sagging.

                             LENNY
              Naw.  She won't call me.

                             MAX
              Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get
              past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by
              far the most outstanding woman a guy
              like you could ever hope to get, I
              mean it's completely and deeply
              humiliating that she's gone, but
              it's over, campadre.

                             LENNY
              Thanks, Max.  I'm touched by your
              concern.

    CUT TO: Iris, working her way from the front door, staying
    on the fringe of the crowd, wary, moving toward Max and
    Lenny at the bar.

                             MAX
              I just hate to see you pining away.
              It makes me want to vomit, frankly.
                      (philosophically)
              Broken hearts are for assholes.

                             LENNY
                      (seeing Iris)
              Hey, Iris, you okay?

                             IRIS
              Lenny, I got to talk to you, it's
              serious...

                             MAX
                      (looking at her face)
              What happened, honey, some john get
              rough on you?

                             IRIS
                      (to Lenny)
              I mean talk private.  Please, I'm in
              trouble, and so is Faith.

                             MAX
                      (as Lenny reacts to
                       the name)
              There it is, the magic fuckin' word.

    Lenny takes Iris by the arm and pulls her away from the
    bar.

                             IRIS
              Can we go to your car?  There's
              something you have to see right
              away.

    He nods and steers her toward the front door of the Coral
    Lounge.

                             LENNY
              What's going on?

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  CORAL LOUNGE/PARKING LOT - NIGHT

    Lenny and Iris come out the front door.

                             IRIS
              It's a bad situation... if they get
              me I know they're going to -- OH
              SHIT!

    She bridles like a startled horse.  Lenny looks at what
    she sees: a red beam, sweeping the parking lot.  Must be
    the cops.  He turns back...

    She's gone.  What the hell?

    He looks back at the red light... and edges around the
    corner to see what the cops are up to...

    It's not a cop car.  It's a tow-truck, with Lenny's BMW on
    the hook.  Lenny runs to the TOW DRIVER, who looks like a
    biker only meaner.

                             LENNY
              Hang on, that's my car--

                             TOW DRIVER
              Not anymore.  Belongs to the bank.

                             LENNY
              Hey wait a second...

    Ignoring him, the driver has started the hydraulic lift,
    and Lenny makes the mistake of grabbing his beefy arm.
    The guy whips around, putting the muzzle of a .38 in
    Lenny's face.

                             LENNY
              Oh, yeah, that's the answer!  Two
              million years of human evolution and
              that's the best idea you can come up
              with?
                      (driver continues
                       with the hoist)
              Okay.  Look, whattya get to repo a
              car?  Two hundred?  Two fifty?  I'll
              pay you three fifty, right now.  All
              you gotta do is drop it off the hook
              and say you came by, your mark
              wasn't here.  Simple.  Make a few
              bucks.  Do a good deed.  Huh?

                             DRIVER
              You got the cash on you?

                             LENNY
              I was going to write you a check, if
              that's--

    The guy is getting into his truck.

                             LENNY
              Okay, okay, I totally respect that
              call.  I would want cash.  They'll
              take my check inside... I can see
              you're pressed for time, just give
              me two minutes... here keep my watch
              for collateral.

    He hands the guy his watch.

                             LENNY
              It's a Rolex.  Be right back.  Two
              minutes.

    Lenny gets to the front door of the Coral Lounge, turns
    just in time to see the tow-truck pulling out.  Lenny runs
    after his car, yelling, watching it recede.

                             LENNY
              Son of a bitch!

    Lenny walks back to the bar.  He sets his Haliburton up on
    the truck of a car and pops it open.  He takes out a tiny
    digital cellular phone and dials a number.  While it's
    ringing he takes another, identical Rolex knock-off out of
    the briefcase and slips it on.

    LORNETTE "MACE" MASON.  Late twenties.  Striking features.
    Hair pulled back tight to her skull.  She is driving, but
    we don't see the car, or anything but her face.

                             MACE
              Hello?  Hey Lenny, whatup?
                      (listens a beat;
                       then)
              Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Sure.  So what
              happened to your car this time?

    A black limo pulls into the lot.  It is a Continental
    armored stretch, downsized from today's standards.  The
    door opens and Mace gets out.  She is compactly built,
    dressed in black slacks, a conservative black jacket,
    heavy rubber-soled shoes.  She glances around as she heads
    for the Coral Lounge entrance, the unconscious sweeping
    gaze of a security professional.

    ON Max and Lenny at the bar.

              See, if you packed your piece you
              could've made the guy see sense.

                             LENNY
              Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the
              line of a fine jacket.

                             MAX
              An ex-cop that doesn't carry.  It's
              embarrassing.  I oughta not be seen
              with you.
                      (as she slips up
                       behind them)
              Hey, Mace.  What's goin' on?

    She plants herself between Max and Lenny and takes a
    generous handful of their nachos.

                             MACE
              Greetings, gents.
                      (to Lenny)
              So let's hear this week's sad story.

                             LENNY
              They jerked my wheels, d'you believe
              it?  I mean it's outrageous, the
              computer errors the banks are making
              lately.  Have you noticed?

    Mace and Max exchange a weary look.

                             MACE
              No.  I haven't noticed because I
              make my payments.  So, Max Pelcher,
              how's the P.I. business?

                             MAX
              Sucks.
                      (attention caught by
                       TV)
              Hey, Bobby, turn that up.

    The Bartender obeys: it's more news about the Jeriko One
    killing.  There's file footage of Jeriko and his band, the
    Prophets of Rage; interview with a lot of furious fans,
    mostly black inner city kids; and a news clip of Jeriko at
    an outdoor rally, exhorting the crowd with near religious
    fervor:

                             JERIKO ONE (ON T.V.)
              The LAPD is a military force turned
              against its own people.  We live in
              a police state!  The mayor and the
              city council sit up in their offices
              with their social programs that
              don't work... they're rearranging
              deck chairs on the Titanic.  But the
              new day is coming!  Two-K is coming!
              The day of reckoning is upon us.
              History ends and begins again right
              here!  Right now!

    Max raises a glass in salute to the TV screen.

                             MAX
              To the end of all things!
                      (slugs down the shot)
              You know how I know it's the end of
              the world?  Because everything's
              been done, every kind of music's
              been tried, every government's been
              tried, every fuckin' hairstyle.
              How you gonna make it another
              thousand years, for Chrissake?

    On the TV, clip of Jeriko's speech has been replaced by an
    interview with Jeriko One's manager.  TRAN VO.  Tran is
    Vietnamese, and around Lenny's age.  He's angular, suave,
    cool as an early frost.  Dialed in.  Lenny sees his face
    on the screen like a personal nightmare.

                             MAX
              I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used
              it all up--

                             LENNY
                      (riveted to the TV)
              Shutup a second!

                             MACE
              Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?

                             MAX
              Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.
                      (to screen)
              Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden
              goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer
              guy.

                             MACE
              But I mean isn't he Faith's new--
                      (she mouths the word
                       "boyfriend")

                             MAX
              Sssssh!  Not in front of Lenny.  You
              may trigger a maudlin display which
              will force us to tranquilize him.

    ON THE SCREEN, Tran is being jostled as he walks,
    answering the reporters questions in a glare of minicam
    lights.

                             REPORTER
              The LAPD have said they believe
              this is a gang-related incident.
              Can you comment on that, Mr. Vo?

                             TRAN
              We have no facts yet.  All we know
              for sure is that we have lost a
              great artist, that a great voice for
              change is now silent...

    Lenny, scowling, pushes away from the bar.  Mace goes with
    him.

                             LENNY
              Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just
              have a few stops, mostly on the west
              side--

                             MACE
              Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd
              drop you home, but I'm not taking
              you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've
              already pulled twelve hours today.

                             LENNY
                      (upbeat again)
              Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a
              big night.  Can't you feel it?  The
              energy in the air?  There's money to
              be made, dreams to sell.

                             MACE
              Sleaze to peddle.

                             LENNY
              Just a couple of hours.  It'll be
              fun--

                             MACE
              Excuse me.  What part of NO don't
              you understand?

                             LENNY
              Mace, you're my friend.  I need you.
              Plus I'll give you 25% of what I
              make tonight.

                             MACE
              Lenny, this may be a hard concept
              for you, but friends don't have to
              pay their friends.

    Lenny starts to whine like a puppy.  Mace gives up.

                             MACE
              Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got
              a pickup at the St. James.  I'll
              take you there, you can get a cab.

                             LENNY
                      (an arm around her
                       like a buddy)

    Haliburton.

              So, what's up with you?  Another

              No, wrong... I sell experiences.
              Sex is only part of it.

              Way I look at it, I actually perform
              a humanitarian service.  I save
              lives.

                             MACE
              Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.

                             LENNY
              Okay, take some executive... bored
              with his life, bored with his
              wife... he picks up a hooker or some
              girl at a bar.  Then he goes around
              for months, torn up worrying that
              he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his
              wife.  And maybe he really does
              catch something--

              Price he pays for being a

                             LENNY
              Everybody needs to take a walk to
              the dark end of the street sometime,
              it's what we are.  But now the risks
              are outa line.  The streets are a
              war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So
              you slip on the trodes, you get what
              you need and it keeps you from
              jumping your tracks.

              Lenny, this shit's illegal.

              Mr. Fumitsu, good evening sir,
              Leonard Nero, Security Express.
              Lornette Mason here is just

              up front and take some notes, if you
              don't mind.

    Fumitsu nods politely and Lenny opens the car door for
    him.  Lenny jogs around behind the car to the front
    passenger door.

    out of the car and starts into the party with Mr. Fumitsu.
    They are laughing uproariously and getting along like old

    the money, networking.  No dialogue.  A pantomime of Lenny
    working his prime turf.  She stares at him for a while,
    then looks at her watch.  Sighs.

              over there.

    Lenny waves.  Fumitsu waves back from across the room.

                             STRICKLAND
              I don't like disappointments, Nero.
              And do you know what disappoints me
              very much?

                             LENNY
              Your sex life?

                             STRICKLAND
              Your existence.

    EXT.  HANCOCK PARK HOUSE - NIGHT

    Mace sits in her limo, talking on the cellular.

                             MACE
              Now listen to me... you have to get
              to bed young man.  I mean it.  No
              watching "Tales from the Crypt".  I
              don't care what Cecile says.  I'll
              see you in the morning, baby.
              Night, night.

    As she hangs up, she glances out the window in time to
    see...

    Lenny flying over a hedge.  He lands on the sidewalk, then
    scrambles up and brushes himself off as TWO SECURITY TYPES
    loom toward him.  He adjusts his wardrobe and walks with
    dignity (but quickly) toward the car.

                             MACE
              Are we having a bad night?

                             LENNY
                      (glancing back)
              Let's talk in the car.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT./ EXT.  MACE'S LIMO - NIGHT

    As Mace pulls out, Lenny starts fitting a pair of playback
    trodes to his head.  Mace glances at him in disgust.  He
    hits his playback button.

    Lenny's POV as he talks to Faith.  Back when things were
    good.  He's wiring her.  They are playful, like a couple
    of kids.

                             FAITH
              I feel like you're turning me into a
              VCR.

                             LENNY
              I just want to see what we're like
              together through your eyes.

    He turns OFF the record button.  STATIC.  Then TAPE
    RESTARTS.  We see the two of them standing together,
    reflected in a mirror.

    We are Faith now.

                             FAITH
              I don't feel anything.  Is it on?

                             LENNY
              Forget it's there.

                             FAITH
              Make me forget it, baby.

    He turns her to him.  They begin to make love.  Faith's
    face fills our field of view, eyes closed in dreamy
    passion.

    A sudden FLASH OF LIGHT.  Lenny opens his eyes to see...
    Mace's glowing countenance.

    She has stopped the car, torn the trodes from Lenny's head
    and tossed them out the window.  Now she's yanking him out
    of the car by his lapels.

                             LENNY
              Hey, careful on the jacket.  This is
              Armani.
                      (he looks at her)
              You angry?

                             MACE
              I've had enough of this shit.
                      (getting back into
                       the car)
              You're on foot, Lenny.

                             LENNY
              In LA?  Are you crazy?

    Mace starts to peel out, but Lenny leaps and plasters
    himself on the hood.  Mace pretends she doesn't see him.

                             LENNY
                      (as they drive along)
              Can I come in please?  I'm having a
              hard time hearing the stereo.

    Mace jams on the brakes and Lenny slides off in front of
    the car.  Now she starts to move forward...

                             LENNY
              I need my case.  It's still in the
              back.

                             MACE
              Get it.

    He quickly moves around the car and climbs in the back
    door.  Lenny grabs his Haliburton but instead of getting
    out, he leans through the divider window, next to Mace.

                             LENNY
              Listen, can we talk a little bit
              here, like two rational adults?

    Mace hits a button on the dash.  The privacy divider rises
    suddenly, pinning Lenny to the ceiling.

                             LENNY
              That would be no.

                             MACE
              I've had it.  No more wirehead shit
              in my car.  You understand?  You
              want to poach your lobes, do it
              somewhere else.

                             LENNY
              Okay, you got my attention, but this
              is cutting off the circulation to my
              head, here.  D'you mind?

    She lowers the divider, releasing him.  Lenny straightens
    his jacket and tie.  Runs a hand through his greasy hair.

                             LENNY
              I thought we were friends.

                             MACE
              No, see a friend is more than one
              person constantly doing favors for
              another.  You just suck people along
              with your schemes and your scams and
              your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I
              got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex-
              husband someplace who doesn't send
              me a dime of support... I'm just
              trying to hold on here.

                             LENNY
              So am I.  Just trying to get by.

                             MACE
              No, you're just trying to get off.

                             LENNY
              Macey... I've never seen you like
              this.

                             MACE
              Lenny, you're turning into some
              kinda squid-head low-life.  You're
              always broke, you just go from one
              score to the next.  And you're
              getting strung out... you don't even
              see it.  Getting high on your own
              supply like some crack dealer.

                             LENNY
              I know you wouldn't be saying all
              this if you didn't care about me.
              Thanks, Mace.  Really.

                             MACE
              Look, I gotta get some sleep.

                             LENNY
              You still like me, don't you?  We're
              still buddies?

    She hates it that she can't resist his pathetic charm.

                             MACE
                      (a tiny smile)
              Yeah.  I don't see a way out of it.

                             LENNY
              Macey, I know you're tired, but can
              you drop me at the Retinal Fetish?
              It's on your way.

                             MACE
              Jesus, Lenny.

                             LENNY
              Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic
              behavior at all?  Will that help?
              Faith's there tonight, and I've got
              to talk to her.

                             MACE
              Sure, Lenny.
                      (she puts the car in
                       gear)
              The only thing worse than a junkie
              is someone in love.

    EXT.  RETINAL FETISH - NIGHT

    As Mace pulls to a stop in the parking lot and Lenny opens
    the door.

                             LENNY
              Come on, let me buy you a drink.
              Let's drink and make up.
                      (Mace shakes her
                       head)
              Alright, I'm going to see Faith.
              That means you can watch me suffer.
              I'll be in agony, you'll feel so
              much better.  Total and thorough
              payback, whatdya say?

    Mace smiles, shaking her head in wonder at this madman.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  RETINAL FETISH

    Mace accompanies Lenny into the pounding din of the
    Retinal Fetish.  The place is a fringe hangout, a
    converted schmata factory transformed into a warren of
    dark rooms and corridors off the main dance floor.  A
    thundering labyrinth.  Steel cage-like partitions of
    chain-link give the place a harsh, concentration-camp
    atmosphere.  The music is a bass tech-thump, and the
    clientele are young and on the rough side.  Cybergrunge.

    There are many large video screens running a continuous
    montage of wild graphics and images... a flurry of
    disturbing videos: MTV baptized by William Burroughs.

    The Fetish is a street-tech hangout, a meeting place for a
    lot of digital-underground types that Lenny knows.  You
    can buy and sell what you want here: illicit hardware and
    software, as well as chemicals for the wetware (brain).

    Lenny and Mace are greeted inside by two suited guys with
    metal detectors.  They barely notice as they are scanned:
    it's routine there days.  Mace shows her gun, a Sig Saur
    9mm, and her state carry-permit.  The security guys check
    her pistol like a coat, giving her a claim check.

    Through the crowd in the lounge Lenny's eyes go
    immediately to one table.  It seems to be in a pool of
    light all it's own; or maybe this is just in Lenny's mind.
    SLOW MOTION: Lenny watches a man at the table holding
    court, with a beautiful young woman sitting next to him.

    It is TRAN VO.  He's a mover and shaker in the record
    business: he produces, he manages, he tries to keep
    everyone in his orbit.

    The woman is FAITH JUSTIN.  We recognize her from playback
    as Lenny's ex-girlfriend.  But now her hair has been dyed
    jet black and frames her face in a wild tangle.  She is
    wearing as expensive custom leather jacket over a sheer
    silk top.  She has on too much make-up, which gives her
    features a feral-doll quality.  Faith looks like what she
    is, a rock star wannabe.  But the look is red-hot.

    Tran looks around the room.  His eyes miss nothing.  And
    show nothing.  His hand -- unhurried, graceful, remarkable
    -- brushes past Faith's cheek, barely touching her.  His
    fingers pick up a strand of hair, tuck it like a treasure
    behind her ear... fingers touching her head now... a
    moment of suspended time.

    ... and she trembles.  Just a little.  For a second.

    Tran and Faith are flanked on either side by an entourage
    consisting of music types, various hangers on, and Tran's
    personal security force of four: JOEY CORTO, a whippet-
    thin skinhead; DUNCAN, a none-too-bright armbreaker in the
    classic mold; a massively built ex-jock type called WADE
    BEEMER; and a sixteen year old Asian stone fox, CINDY
    MINH, aka 'VITA', possibly the most lethal of the four.

                             LENNY
              Who's the new side of beef in Tran's
              posse?

                             MACE
              Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a
              running back for the Rams in '96 and
              '97.

                             LENNY
              Rams... that's football, right?

    He can't take his eyes off Faith.  Mace scowls at the
    tableau and pulls Lenny toward the bar.

                             MACE
              Forget her.

                             LENNY
              She still loves me.

                             MACE
              She thinks you're a bucket of dog
              vomit.  Trust me on this.

                             LENNY
              She's my destiny.

                             MACE
              Destiny?  You living in a perfume
              commercial?  She's a hard-climber
              that dropped you like a used tampon
              when she got a better ride.

                             LENNY
              You'll see.

    Mace gives up, shakes her head and Lenny plunges into the
    crowd... toward Faith.  Several patrons greet him, just as
    in the Coral Lounge, but uncharacteristically, Lenny
    virtually ignores them.

    Approaching the main table now.  Ringside.  Tran sees him;
    no reaction.  Now Faith sees him: her reaction's a little
    tougher to read.  Pissed off, maybe, or just tense.

    Tran's security force has seen Lenny coming.  But they
    stay casual.

    Lenny doesn't break stride.  It's like a game of chicken
    without cars.  Beemer stands, covering Lenny with his
    shadow.  Vita looks up at Lenny with cobra eyes.  Tran
    gives him a glance; royalty amused by Lenny's presumption.

                             TRAN
              You come to peddle me some tapes,
              Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a
              couple bucks for the holidays?

                             LENNY
              You're not a client anymore, Tran.
              I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a
              dead dog's balls.

                             TRAN
                      (glancing at Faith,
                       back at Lenny)
              I already got everything I need from
              you.

                             FAITH
              Cut it out, Tran.

                             LENNY
              Too bad about your guy Jeriko.
              Tough break.

                             TRAN
              Show a little respect, Nero.  The
              man was an important artist.

                             LENNY
              Yeah, important for your label.
              Which no doubt is why you're in
              mourning.  Don't worry, his
              records'll sell out now he's dead.
              You'll make out.

                             TRAN
              I always do.

                             LENNY
              Faith, can I talk to you a second?

                             FAITH
              I don't think that's a good idea,
              Lenny.

                             LENNY
              I just got to talk to you for one
              second.

                             TRAN
              About what?

                             LENNY
              That would be between me and Faith,
              wouldn't it?

    Tran takes one of his beautiful hands and passes it slowly
    in the general area between his table and Lenny.

                             TRAN
              I don't feel anything between you.
              See, your trouble is you assume too
              much, Lenny.  You assume there's
              something where there's nothing.
              You assume you have a life.  But
              you're only hustling pieces of other
              lives on tape, and broken parts of
              your own.

    Faith glances at Tran, then cuts her eyes to Lenny.

                             FAITH
                      (icy)
              We have nothing to talk about,
              Lenny.

                             TRAN
              Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely
              to his car.

    Joey smirks, glances at Beemer who rises like a wall.

                             LENNY
              Faith, call me, okay?

                             FAITH
              No, Lenny.

    Wade gets Lenny in a wrist-grip come along hold and starts
    him moving.  She looks at him -- slowly, gaze unwavering.
    As Beemer ushers Lenny through the crowd, Tick greets him
    coming the other way.

                             LENNY
              Tick, listen, I can't stop right
              now.  but I'll call you tomorrow
              about that thing we were talking
              about.

    He's working the room even as he's getting dragged
    outside.

                             TRAN
              Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of
              stolen dreams.

                             FAITH
              Leave him alone, Tran.

                             TRAN
              He's no concern of mine, as long as
              you don't talk to him.  Don't talk
              to anybody.  You understand?  Not
              with everything that's going on
              right now.

                             FAITH
              You're too goddamned paranoid.

                             TRAN
              Paranoia's only reality on a finer
              scale.

    EXT.  RETINAL FETISH

    Beemer deposits Lenny on the curb and goes back inside.

    A SMALL CROWD of people enters the club.  Lenny brushes
    off his jacket, falls into step at the rear of the
    entering crowd.

    INT.  RETINAL FETISH

    Lenny climbs to a landing overlooking the dance floor.
    Through chain link he sees a swirl of activity below.  And
    one face, looking up at him.  Kind of casual.  Lenny
    clocks the guy: cop instincts coming out.  Decides he
    doesn't know him.  But we do.  It's Spreg.  Lenny walks
    on, crosses to a door, and enters...

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  VJ BOOTH/RETINAL FETISH

    A tiny room overlooking the dance floor.  Crammed with
    electronic gear, at the center of which is Tex Arcana,
    whipping from one deck to another, hands flying.  He's in
    a wheelchair, which pivots nimbly, managing to high-five
    Lenny as he walks in.

                             LENNY
              So, those rascals still haven't
              grown back yet, huh?

                             TEX
                      (peering under the
                       blanket on his lap)
              Nope.  Guess not.  Any day now,
              though.

                             LENNY
                      (handing Tex a Squid)
              Present.  Something I had made.  Let
              me know what you think.

                             TEX
              Hey, alright.  Got something here
              for you, too.
                      (passes him an
                       envelope)
              It just showed up tonight, don't
              know who left it.

                             LENNY
              Fan mail from some flounder?

    Lenny looks at the envelope, which has "Nero" hand-printed
    in block letters.  Tex takes a pull from a flask as he
    takes a squid-deck out of a drawer and sticks the tape in.
    He puts on the headset and pushes PLAY.

    IN POV we are on a beach.  Early morning.  We are running
    flat out, with the wind.  Looking down... we are barefoot
    on the wet sand.  Foaming water races up the sand and
    breaks around our strong male legs.  Looking up again, to
    see our running companion... a beautiful lithe woman in
    shorts and T-shirt.  She laughs and we speed up.  An
    exquisite moment of pure life force.

    TIGHT ON TEX'S FACE... as a tear leaks from the corner of
    his eye.  He is smiling like he is listening to beautiful
    music.  We see the quiet magnificence of Lenny's gift.

    Tex opens his eyes.  Looks for Lenny to say thanks: but
    Lenny's gone.  Not a guy to hang around for thanks-yous.

    INT.  RETINAL FETISH

    As Lenny comes down the stairs from the VJ booth, tearing
    open the envelope.  An unmarked Squid tape falls into his
    hand.

    The HOUSE LIGHTS dim and the STAGE LIGHTS come up.  And
    Faith is standing there.  Like she beamed in.  She is
    wearing a revealing leather outfit, showing a lot of her
    milk-white skin.  Her black hair frames her eyes, giving
    her an intense feral look.  Faith starts to sing.
    Beautiful, unearthly, clear notes.

    SUDDENLY the band kicks down with a wall of thundering
    sound.  Faith explodes into motion.  Her body convulses
    like a 440 volt mainline is hooked up to her.  Her voice
    becomes a scream, an inchoate wail, a police siren.  The
    pain and rage of an entire, hell-bent tormented planet on
    its eve of judgment.

    Lost in the song, Faith has found herself.  She wheels
    across the stage, slashing her head up and down so that
    her hair bursts in the strobe-flashes like flak.

    A techno-erotic pagan.  A force of nature.

    Lenny is mesmerized.  He has seen this before, many times.
    But it always has the same effect on him.  He is
    transported into another world by her, a world in which
    there is only the two of them.

    TIGHT ON MACE, eyes on the stage... a big piece of the
    puzzle suddenly fits.  She's never seen Faith perform
    before.  Holy shit.

    Faith doesn't play to the audience, or engage them in any
    way.  She is merely taking what's in her head and letting
    it out.  She doesn't care if they are there or not.  Now
    shrieking into the silence after a climatic downbeat, and
    holding the note... holding it longer than you believe she
    possibly could.  Then nothing.

    When it is over she just drops the microphone and walk
    away.  Fuck you.

    INT.  RETINAL FETISH/BACKSTAGE & DRESSING ROOM

    At BACKSTAGE, Lenny wends his way through the warren of
    corridors... past dim rooms full of wire junkies and
    playback freaks, all trapped into Squid nirvana: post-
    modern opium dens.  Sinister and scary.  He glimpses
    Faith, going into her dressing room.  He hurries...

    ... but she doesn't even look around when his reflection
    appears in the cracked mirror above the crummy vanity
    table.  She is drenched with sweat.  Spent.  Chugging a
    beer.  This is the first time they have been alone
    together in real-time for months.  Pain and the memory of
    joy.

                             LENNY
              Hi, baby.  I've missed you.

                             FAITH
              I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you
              talking to me he'll hurt you.

                             LENNY
              I'm already hurting.

    She doesn't turn.  Just watches him in the mirror.  Most
    of the scene plays this way.  It is a cold parody of their
    love-making playbacks.

                             FAITH
              You have to go.  I mean it.

                             LENNY
              Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just
              answer one question.  Is anything
              wrong?  Iris said you might be in
              trouble.

                             FAITH
                      (startled, turning
                       to him)
              You talked to Iris?  When?

                             LENNY
              Tonight.

                             FAITH
              Well I haven't seen her in months.
              Who knows what's going on in her
              head.  You're really running out of
              excuses to come around, aren't you?

                             LENNY
              I know you Faith.  You're afraid of
              something.  What's going on?

                             FAITH
              Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take
              care of itself.

                             LENNY
              It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is
              poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's
              got you walled in on all sides.  And
              he uses the wire too much, he gets
              off on tape, not on you.

                             FAITH
              That's a good one, coming from you.

                             LENNY
              Why don't you just split?  You don't
              love him, anybody can see that.  And
              to him you're just some kinda
              possession, like a Ferrari,
              something to show the other guys.

                             FAITH
              He has his uses too.

                             LENNY
              What?  He gonna record you on his
              label?

                             FAITH
              Maybe.

                             LENNY
              Come on, Faith!  He's just toying
              with you.  And when he gets bored,
              you'll be yesterday's papers.

    Lenny is right behind her now.  He puts his hands on her
    shoulders, tenderly.

                             LENNY
              Look, baby, I've watched you create
              yourself out of nothing.  You're
              like a goddamn cruise missile,
              targeted on making it.  And you
              will.

                             FAITH
              Damn right.

                             LENNY
              It's you up on that stage, not him.
              You don't need him.

    She shrugs away from his touch.  Cold again.

                             FAITH
              You have to get out of here.  If
              Tran catches you he'll... he's
              acting crazy.  He's doing way too
              much playback and he's getting
              completely paranoid.  He's such a
              control freak, he's even paying Max
              to follow me around.

                             LENNY
              Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?

                             FAITH
              Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny,
              just stay away from Tran, okay?  And
              stay away from me.  Stop trying to
              rescue me.  Those days are over.
              I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to
              save me, okay, because I don't need
              saving... Just... give up on me.

                             LENNY
              Can't do it.

                             FAITH
              You know one of the ways movies
              still have Squid beat?  Because they
              always say "The End." You always
              know when it's over.  It's over!
              Now please leave.  I have to go on
              again in a couple of minutes.

    She looks at him and, after a moment, he nods and leaves.
    As the door closes behind him, Faith tosses her towel on
    the table.  She looks frightened and alone.

                             FAITH
              Hell.

    INT.  RETINAL FETISH/CORRIDOR AND MAIN FLOOR

    Turning a corner from the dressing room into the CORRIDOR,
    Lenny runs into Max.

                             LENNY
              Shoulda told me about your new gig,
              buddy.

                             MAX
              I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just
              a job.  I feel like shit about it.

                             LENNY
              You should feel like shit.

                             MAX
              I figured, what the hell, I could
              take the prick's money and make sure
              Faith was OK at the same time.  Do
              us both good.  Right?

                             LENNY
              Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for
              you.
                      (already over it)
              Hey, at least you got a job!
                      (slaps him on the
                       back)
              Watch her for me.  Stay on her.

                             MAX
              I'm on her.

    Lenny climbs the stairs to the MAIN FLOOR, pushing his way
    through the crowd.

    Vita, watching the backstage area leans over to Tran,
    whispers in his ear.  Tran makes a sign to Beemer, and he
    stands to go after Lenny.

    Mace, at the bar, sees the Tran-Vita-Beemer action, looks
    around for Lenny.  Can't find him.  But figures there's
    got to be only one reason Beemer's on the prowl: he's
    looking for Lenny.  She whips out her cellular.

    CUT TO: Beemer, grabbing Lenny in a painful come-along
    hold and hustling him toward the back of the club.

    Lenny's cellular rings.

                             LENNY
              Can I get that?

    He reaches for his cellular, connects with...

    MACE, over by the bar.

                             MACE
              Hey Lenny, where the hell are you, I
              think Tran's got Beemer looking for
              you.

    BACK TO: Lenny, as he's hustled out the rear door.

                             LENNY
              Thanks for the tip.

              I recognize you.  You're Wade
              Beemer.  Running back for the Rams,
              am I right?

    Beemer, who was about to go to work on Lenny, pauses.

                             BEEMER
              Yeah, that's right.

                             LENNY
              I saw you play, man.  You were good.
              Like a fucking freight train I
              remember saying.  So what happened,
              injuries or what?

                             BEEMER
              Bullshit politics.

                             LENNY
              It's always politics.  Like this
              thing we're in here, he's paying you
              to tune me up, right?  But I could
              pay you more not to.  See what I
              mean?  I could write you a check
              right now--

              Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's
              everything I have on me, what do you
              say?  How about a Rolex?

                             BEEMER

                       it)
              I already got a real one.  Come on,
              it won't be too bad.  It's not
              personal.

              You're some piece of work, you know
              that.  Just calmly backstroking
              around in the big toilet bowl, and
              somehow you never let it touch you.
              I mean, between Vice and this so-
              called occupation you're in now, you
              must've seen it all.

                             LENNY
              I have crawled through the gutter...
              through every wrinkle in the human
              brain.

              What I'm saying.  But you still come
              out this goofball romantic.

                             LENNY
              It is my sword and my shield, Macey.

    Lenny finds the anonymous tape in his pocket.  He looks a
    it, puzzled.

                             MACE
              What's that?  Present from Faith?

                             LENNY
              No idea.

    He opens his briefcase, pops the tape into the deck, puts
    the Squid rig on and closes his eyes.  Maybe he can forget
    about Faith a minute.  He punches PLAY.

    POV SEQUENCE: the first thing we notice is that the POV is
    distorted visually.  The colors are de-saturated.  Almost
    black and white.  Yet the detail is crisp and clear,
    almost hyper-real.

    WE ARE WALKING down a windowless hallway at a large hotel.
    An apparently endless row of doors.  The Wearer's glance
    goes to the numbers on the doors from time to time.

    We come to a particular door.  There is a DO NOT DISTURB
    sign on the door.  The Wearer moves to the room next door.
    Looks both ways.  The corridor is empty.

                             LENNY
              It's a test pattern so far.

    "Our" hands appear, quickly pulling on latex surgical
    gloves.  They look like male hands.  The snapping of the
    rubber is the only sound in the corridor.  The POV hunches
    down to the lock and we see the hands go to work with
    lock-picking tools.  Several seconds and the lock is very
    professionally picked.

                             LENNY
              Alright, a little B&E action.

    We enter the dark room, which is vacant.  The drapes are
    open and we see city lights.  It is night.  One gloved
    hand picks up the guest directory and looks at it in the
    moonlight coming in the window: the SUNSET SHERATON.

    The Wearer drops the directory and the hands reappear
    holding... a black ski-mask.  He pulls it on, leaving the
    subsequent POV seen through the eye-holes of the mask.

    The Wearer now looks into a mirror on the dresser.  He has
    avoided his reflection up until now.  We see a man,
    dressed in a jogging suit and black fanny-pack, and of
    course the ski-mask.  Totally anonymous.

                             LENNY
              Hey, getting good.  Solid suspense
              build.

    The Wearer crosses to the balcony door.  Opens it quietly
    and goes outside, moving to the wall dividing this room's
    balcony from the one next door.

    The Wearer climbs the railing and, six stories above the
    pavement, slips around the wall, stepping down onto the
    other balcony.  We hug the wall, looking furtively into
    the room.  It is a suite.  In the living room we see a
    woman making herself a drink at the mini-bar.  She
    turns...

    It is Iris.  She is wearing a T-shirt and panties.
    Probably ready for bed.  She looks like she can't sleep.
    Pours the Scotch shakily.

    CUT TO LENNY, the streetlight washing across his face.  He
    gets suddenly serious with a flash of premonitory dread.

    IN POV we see Iris go into the bedroom, out of sight.  We
    can hear the television on in there.  Using a steel jimmy
    the Wearer slips the latch on the balcony slider and
    silently opens it, slipping inside.

    We stalk quietly to the bedroom door, listening to her
    movements.  Water running in the bathroom.  We come around
    the door frame.  Bedroom dark, bathed in TV glow.  Iris in
    the bathroom, washing her face with cold water.

    We move toward her.  Crossing the room as she reaches for
    a towel.  We are now only a couple of feet away.  She
    comes out of the bathroom, walking right past us, drying
    her face.  She lowers the towel, turning away... her eyes
    whip back.  Widening in terror.

    She reacts with surprising speed, diving across the bed.
    We go after her.

    Her hand goes under the pillow and comes out with a small
    automatic.  She whips it around toward us but we grab it
    and twist it away before she can fire.  She smashes the
    palm of her hand into our face and rolls off the bed,
    lightning-fast.

    We follow her as she scrambles up, running through the
    bedroom door.  Across the living room and down the short
    hall to the front door.  Closing rapidly on her as she
    somehow gets the chain off the door and gets out into the
    hall.

    Slam!  We tackle her against the far wall of the corridor.
    Our right hand comes into view holding a small electric
    stunner.  ZAP!  We nail her right in the back between the
    shoulder blades.

    She sags to the floor, gasping.  We zap her again.  The
    Wearer's glance does a 180 both ways down the corridor...
    nobody in sight.  We clamp our hand over Iris' mouth and
    drag her back into her room, locking the door.

    ON LENNY, reacting.  Going white.

                             MACE
              What is it?

                             LENNY
              Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT
              NOW!  Just go!  GO!

    Lenny goes back under the wire, seeing...

    WE ARE DRAGGING a semiconscious Iris into the bathroom...
    propping her up with her back against the white tile
    wall... grabbing her hands and handcuffing them one by one
    to the steel towel rack above her.  She is moaning.  And
    crying.

                             IRIS
                      (voice distorted)
              I haven't seen your face... I
              haven't heard your voice... you can
              still let me go...

    ZAP!  The Wearer hits her with the stunner again.  She
    jerks and gasps for breath.  We see our latex-gloved
    finger come up in front of us and hear SSSHHH.

    Moving quickly now.  Our hands unbuckle the fanny pack.
    Pull out something... a set of playback trodes.  Our hands
    place them on her head.  She stares uncomprehending.
    What?  We catch a glimpse of some electronics stuff inside
    the pack... a record deck, some wires, a small metal box.

                             LENNY
              Holy shit.  He's jacking her in to
              his own output.  She's seeing what
              he's seeing.  She's seeing herself.

    Iris can now see herself as the Wearer sees her... wide-
    eyed with terror, white-lipped, weeping.  Helpless.  And
    she can feel what he feels.

    The Wearer's hand goes back into the fanny-pack and pulls
    out something else.  A black athletic headband.  We slip
    it over her head, down over her eyes.  A blindfold.  Now
    she can only see what the wearer sees.

    And also from the bag we pull... a yellow plastic object.
    With our thumb we extend the five inch blade of the razor
    knife, the type with tips that can be broken off by
    segments when they get dull.  It extends with an ominous
    clicking sound.

    We lower it toward her and cut up the middle of her T-
    shirt, laying it open.  Exposing her torso.  We then look
    down and slide the knife under the side band of her
    panties, slicing them off.  We put the knife up to her
    throat, and she whimpers, afraid to cry out, and then we
    draw the flat side of the blade across her body as if to
    tease her with the prospect of her death.

    MACE LOOKS AT LENNY'S EXPRESSION of dawning horror and
    pulls the car to the curb about a half-block from the
    Sunset Sheraton.  Lenny is hyperventilating, shifting in
    his seat as if ants are crawling over him.  He is
    experiencing the stalker's exhilaration.

    IN POV we see the Wearer pull his jogging pants down below
    his knees (R-rated please) and reach for Iris.  Kneeling
    in front of her, he pushes her legs apart and pulls her
    hips forward onto him, pushing into her.

    Iris is feeling and seeing what he sees and feels... She
    feels her own pain and humiliation swirling with the
    killer's exhilaration.

    ON LENNY, sweating and barely able to breath.  Mace stops
    the tape... concerned by Lenny's reaction.  He opens his
    eyes... Mace see the fear there, of what the tape may
    reveal.  But he shakes his head.  He has to know.  He
    pushes her hand away and punches PLAY.

    IT FLOODS INTO HIS HEAD AGAIN.  The sweaty, grunting
    horror.  The stalker picks up her slit T-shirt and quickly
    wraps it around her neck.  He knots it tight and twists
    one powerful hand into the knot.  The muscles in his
    forearm look like cables as he turns the knot tighter.

    The stalker viciously twists the knot a full turn and the
    T-shirt fabric almost disappears into the skin under her
    jaw.

    Via her trodes, Iris watches herself die.  Her death comes
    at the moment of his orgasm which is fed to her...
    blasting off the planet on total overload... terror, pain,
    death merging with ecstasy and exultation at the same
    instant.

    ON LENNY, crying out and grabbing for the trodes, but he
    just holds onto them, as if they are sucking his brains
    out of his skull.

                             LENNY
                      (like a mantra)
              On my God.  Oh my God.

    BACK TO POV, a glimpse of the Wearer's hand relaxing the
    knot.  Iris' head lolls.  Her mouth is slack and open.  We
    remove her blindfold.  Her eyes are half-lidded.  Very
    dead looking.  Our fingers gently push them wide open.

    BACK TO LENNY, looking like he has been gut kicked.  He
    gasps for breath.

    TO POV, as the killer's hand calmly moves Iris' head from
    side to side... studying her dead face.  Her staring eyes.
    He leans very close to her and stares into one dead eye,
    the pupil wide, seeing nothing.

    A burst of static.  End of tape.

    Lenny opens his eyes.  He fumbles open the car door and
    practically rolls out onto the sidewalk.  The trodes pull
    off his head as he lurches up, reeling across the sidewalk
    to a darkened storefront where he leans for support.  He
    doubles over and heaves up the contents of his stomach.

    Mace circles around the car and catches him as he sags to
    his knees.  She holds his shoulders while he throws up
    again.

                             MACE
              My God, Lenny.  What is it?

                             LENNY
              Black.  Jack.

                             MACE
              Blackjack?  I don't understand--

                             LENNY
              Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said
              she needed my help and I... aw
              Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker
              killed her.

                             MACE
              Are you sure it's real?

    Lenny looks up, in the direction of the hotel.  Mace
    follows his glance.  They notice for the first time: cop
    lights; cop cars; ambulance; coroner's wagon.

    CLOSE on Iris' body, in a bag, being loaded into the
    coroner's van.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  PARKING LOT/DIM SUM JOINT/LITTLE TOKYO - NIGHT

    Neon reflections on the roof of Mace's limo as it pulls
    into the lot and slides up to Max's car.  Max is sitting
    in the open door, feet on the pavement, eating dumplings
    from a take-out carton.  He looks up as Lenny and Mace get
    out of the limo.  Sees their expressions.

                             MAX
              Ohhhh shit.

    TIME CUT: Lenny, sitting on the hood of Mace's Lincoln,
    has his head propped in his hands.  His eyes are
    distant... replaying.  Still shocked to his soul.  Mace
    paces nearby.

    Max sits in the open door of his car ten feet away, trodes
    on, playing back the tape.  His face is transformed into
    an ashen mask lit by neon... mouth open in shock.  With
    shaky hands he stops the deck.

    Opens his eyes.  Long beat.  He glances down at the dim-
    sum carton in his hands.

                             MAX
              Well... I've lost my appetite.
                      (lofts it into a
                       nearby dumpster)
              For about a year.

    He gets to his feet, offering the deck and trodes to Mace.

                             MACE
              No way.

    Max pulls a hip-flask full of tequila from his army jacket
    and takes an eye-watering pull.  Offers it to Lenny, who
    follows suit.

                             MAX
              You alright?  Y'okay?

                             LENNY
              Yeah.  No, not really.

                             MAX
              Let's work it.

                             LENNY
              Not now... I don't want to think
              about it--

                             MAX
              Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good
              at this stuff.  Play it down.
              What's the perp doing?

                             LENNY
              He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then
              he does her...

                             MAX
              And he records it.  Thrill kill.
              Wants to see it again.  And again.

                             LENNY
              He records himself raping and
              killing her--

                             MAX
              But at the same time he's sending
              the signal to her--

                             LENNY
              So she feels... what he feels...
              while he's in her.  The thrill while
              he's killing her... is sent to her,
              heightening her fear... which in
              turn heightens the turn on for him.
                      (turns to him)
              I've seen a lot, Max.

                             MAX
              So've I.  Too much.

                             LENNY
              But this is a bad one.

                             MAX
              Top ten.

                             LENNY
              He makes her see her own death,
              feeds off the reaction... killer and
              victim merging... orgasm and agony
              merging.  And he records it all.

                             MACE
              And gives it to you.

                             LENNY
              Wants to share.

                             MAX
              That's right.  He wants to share.
              Needs an audience.  This is one sick
              puppy.

                             LENNY
              Why me?

    Mace is hugging herself.  Edgy and tense.

                             MACE
              Cause you're the man, right?  The
              Magic Man.  If it's got something to
              do with the wire, sooner or later it
              washes up on your beach.

                             LENNY
              I've never dealt in black-jacks.
              Never.  Everybody knows that.

                             MAX
              He's skull-fucking you, bud.  Trying
              to get a reaction.  Maybe pushing
              you to do something.

                             MACE
              Maybe he just figures Lenny will
              appreciate what he's created.  It's
              the dark end of the street, Lenny.
              How do you like it now?

                             LENNY
              Jesus, Mace.  Back off.

                             MACE
              This guy is someone you know, one of
              your squid-head contacts.

                             MAX
              Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.

                             MACE
              Take the tape to the cops.

                             LENNY
              Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.

                             MACE
              So some psycho wire-freak gets to
              keep running around--

                             MAX
              Naw, he's right.  They'll figure
              Lenny's the perp, or go through his
              client list, ruin his life... such
              as it is.  Look, I'll call the guys
              in Homicide... tell them she was a
              friend of mine and they'll keep me
              in the loop.  Get me the forensics
              and all that.
                      (he opens his car
                       door)
              Get some sleep.  I'll call you when
              I get something.
                      (he starts his car)
              And Lenny... I'd keep moving if I
              were you.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  ELEVATOR AND TRAN'S LOFT

    The elevator is huge -- big enough for a truck -- and
    Lenny seems small in the huge space, while shadows crawl
    across his body as the old machinery pulls him up
    toward...

    FAITH, in the loft above.  She looks into the vast
    bedroom...

    ... at Tran sitting in a chair, tranced out under playback
    trodes, his eyes closed.  She softly closes the sliding
    door and walks across the cavernous main room.  The place
    is lit by the flickering reflections from a series of huge
    television screens along both walls.  Otherwise there is
    little light.  The cavernous loft is sparsely but very
    expensively furnished.  Haute-tech design.  Total contrast
    to Lenny's ratty digs.

    LENNY'S POV through the cage-door of the elevator as it
    reaches the loft and Faith is revealed, waiting for him in
    the shadows.  He slides open the cage-door and she moves
    quickly to him.

                             FAITH
                      (whispering, furtive)
              You're crazier than I thought,
              Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just
              in there.

                             LENNY
              Iris is dead.  She was murdered.

    Faith stiffens.  We see the fear, now, exposed.

                             FAITH
              Who did it?

                             LENNY
              Don't know.  But this guy's real
              damaged goods.  Iris knew someone
              was after her... and she said you
              were in danger too.
                      (he grabs her
                       shoulders)
              Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever
              you're hiding, whatever's going on,
              you have to get out of here now.
              Come with me right now.  Don't even
              think about it.

                             FAITH
              Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You
              going to protect me?  Big tough guy.
              You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't
              even have a gun.

                             LENNY
                      (hurt)
              I have a gun.  It's under my bed.

                             FAITH
              You don't know what you're fucking
              with here.

                             LENNY
              Tell me.

    A VOICE from the shadows, like the whisper of a blade in
    the air.

                             TRAN
              Go ahead, Faith.  Tell him.

    Tran steps forward, totally at ease with the situation.
    Out of the shadows behind him step Joey Corto, Duncan and
    Vita Minh.

                             FAITH
              Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to
              give me some bad news.  An old
              friend of mine has been murdered.
              You remember Iris?

                             TRAN
              A tragic story, no doubt.
                      (to Lenny)
              How'd you get up here?

                             LENNY
              Charm.

                             TRAN
                      (looks at Faith)
              Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you
              an offer.
                      (he grabs Faith by
                       the arm, steps
                       closer)
              Take her.  Right now.  If she wants
              to go, if she's unhappy here, she
              can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith
              always knows what she wants.
                      (he turns her loose)
              Hands off.  See?

    Lenny glances at the open elevator right behind him.  So
    close.  She just has to take one step to him... and they
    will be out of there.  Together.

                             LENNY
              It's alright.  He means it.

                             TRAN
                      (to Faith)
              I do mean it.
                      (to Lenny)
              And I mean this... if Faith stays
              you go away and never come back.
              You scuttle back into your cockroach
              hole and never cross my vision
              again.  You understand?

    She glares at them both for a long moment.  Emotions play
    across her face, complex and unreadable.  She steps back,
    taking her place at Tran's side.

                             FAITH
              I made my choice, Lenny.

                             TRAN
                      (to Lenny, nodding
                       toward the elevator)
              You're going down.

    Joey Corto and Duncan shove Lenny roughly backward into
    the elevator.  Corto slams the gate shut and slaps a
    button to lower the lift.  The last thing Lenny sees as he
    descends is Faith's face, above him.

                             FAITH
              I don't love you, Lenny.  Give up.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  BEDROOM AREA/TRAN'S LOFT

    Faith is crying as Tran comes up behind her.

                             FAITH
              You said you were going to get her
              out of this.

                             TRAN
              Maybe now you appreciate the danger
              we're in.
                      (he moves very close)
              It was touching the way you stood by
              me in there.  "Stand by your man".
              I was moved.  You were very good.  I
              don't think he even understands that
              you did it for him.

                             FAITH
              He doesn't know what's going on.
              Leave him alone.

                             TRAN
              I'd love to.  But he keeps showing
              up.  And you keep talking to him.  I
              can't have that--

    And he slaps her.  Really hard.  Decks her.  He's
    trembling with rage... and something else.  Fear.

                             TRAN
              The only time a whore should open
              her mouth is when she's giving head.

                             FAITH
              Fuck you.

                             TRAN
                      (walking away)
              Maybe later.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  ELEVATOR/TRAN'S LOFT

    The huge elevator, with Lenny its sole occupant, descends
    through the shadows toward the first floor.  Lenny watches
    the shadow patterns on the wall through the iron grillwork
    door.  He's still thinking about Faith...

    ... even when the elevator reaches the first floor and
    Mace comes into view.  She's waiting for him.  He steps
    forward.  But he can't open the grillwork door.  And the
    elevator doesn't stop.  It keeps going down.  Lenny,
    spooked, works the door hard... as Mace disappears from
    view above him...

    ... and the elevator bumps to a stop in the basement.
    With Vita and the beef squad waiting for Lenny, stoney-
    faced.  Last stop.  All out.

    Lenny tries to keep the door shut, but Duncan wrenches it
    open.  Vita grabs Lenny and twists his arm painfully
    behind him in one fluid move.  They hustle him toward a
    dank basement room near the elevator.

                             LENNY
                      (speed-rap)
              Listen, can we be smart here?  I
              could make it really worth your
              while... I could cut you a check for
              500 each... hell, make it an even
              grand... I'm not saying you don't
              land a couple shots, just go light
              is all I'm saying... here, take my
              Rolex.

                             CORTO
              Lemme see.

    A glimmer of hope in Lenny's eye as he whips it off his
    wrist.  Corto doesn't even look at it.  Gets it over his
    hand about mid-way, then -- using the watch like a pair of
    brass knuckles -- clobbers Lenny in the face.  Watch parts
    go flying as Corto steps away and Duncan slams Lenny up
    against a column.

    Vita weighs in... gut-punching Lenny savagely.  She works
    him expertly, with a series of painful jabs.

    He sags to his knees.  Not only is this painful.  It's
    goddamn humiliating.  And Duncan and Corto enjoy every
    second of it.

                             CORTO
              We tried to find a smaller girl, to
              beat the shit out of you, Lenny...
              but it was short notice.

    Vita grabs Lenny by his hair and pulls him up with one
    rock-hard arm.  She is cocking back the other arm for a
    pile-driver punch when...

    Suddenly a dark shape materializes behind her.  Mace
    drives Vita head first into the steel column.

    Duncan lunges in and grabs for Mace.  This is a mistake.
    Mace doesn't fight fancy.  And she doesn't fight fair.
    She fights to win.  And she is awesomely fast.  Her moves
    are street moves, coupled with arm-locks and come-alongs
    she has been trained to use as a security driver.

    Lenny recovers enough to size up Vita, who is still a
    little stunned.  She has blood dripping in her eyes and
    can't see too well.

    But she charges him.  And -- being the gent that he is --
    he busts her over the head with a dusty old folding chair.

    Mace drops Duncan about the time Vita is hitting the
    ground, leaving...

    CORTO, who fumbles out a Beretta 9mm and sticks it in
    Mace's face.  He sniggers, loving the upper hand.

                             MACE
              Safety's on.

    And like a jerk, he looks.

    She snaps sideways in a headfake and closes blindingly
    fast, twisting the gun out of his hand.  She continues to
    twist his wrist brutally and Corto goes down to one knee,
    groaning.  She takes his Beretta and backhands the barrel
    hard across his face.  Mace releases his wrist and he
    crumples in a heap.

    She and Lenny back out the door.  Then Lenny runs back in
    and kicks Corto in the ribs.

                             MACE
              Lenny!

    Mace grabs him and pulls him out of the room, then slams
    the metal firedoor behind them, locking it with a piece of
    junk wedged behind the release bar.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

    Mace and Lenny hotfoot it toward the parked limo.  Mace is
    disassembling the Beretta without looking at it.  She
    chucks pieces over a chain-link fence as they go.  Lenny
    brushes himself off, checking his jacket for damage.  He
    is high from winning the fight.

                             LENNY
              Is this great fabric or what?

                             MACE
              You ever wonder why you get beat up
              a lot?

                             LENNY
              Never really thought about it.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  LENNY'S APARTMENT

    Squid POV: the killer enters the vacant hotel room,
    passing the mirror on the dresser.

                             LENNY (V.O.)
              Come on... look in the mirror.  You
              know it's there, you're keeping your
              eyes off it, you bastard... SHIT!
              Who are you?

    CUT TO: Lenny, yanking the wire off his head, Mace near
    him.

                             LENNY
              He knows what he's doing.  He's worn
              before... a lot.

                             MACE
              So that gives you something.

                             LENNY
              It gives me... I don't know... maybe
              two hundred people who I know wear.

    As he talks Lenny fiddles with some custom electronics
    gear.  The back is off the deck, and he has a ribbon wire
    connecting it to some kind of amplifier black-box which he
    is using to boost the gain.

                             MACE
              Don't crank the gain any more.
              You're gonna fry yourself.

                             LENNY
              I need to see more... get more
              detail.  Something.  I feel his
              presence, so strong...

    Mace watches, concerned, as Lenny puts the trodes back on
    and hits playback.

    Squid POVs: strobe-like images of Iris' rape and death,
    separated by burst of static...

    ... as Lenny keeps hitting the forward and rewind buttons,
    searching the tape for clues, reacting to the feelings on
    the tape, trying to manage his revulsion...

    ... until Mace yanks the trodes off and Lenny sags back on
    the couch.  He rubs his eyes.  He is seeing ghosts,
    afterimages burned into his visual cortex.  The room is
    alive with them, shimmering.

                             MACE
              No more, Lenny.

                             LENNY
              Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.

    Lenny see Iris' terrified face.  Literally.  It floats
    iridescent on his living room wall, fading slowly.

                             LENNY
              She came to me for help.  I should
              have read it better... I just
              figured, y'know... another strung-
              out hooker having a bad night.

                             MACE
              It's not your fault.

    Lenny gets up, staggering to the kitchen.  She goes with
    him.

                             LENNY
              Sex killers act alone.  So there's
              no information on the street, which
              is how cases get made.  Cops know
              they'll never nail this guy the
              second they look at the scene.

    Lenny sucks down four Tylenol with a long pull from a
    bottle of vodka.

                             LENNY
              And anyway, nobody gives a shit
              about a dead hooker.  They're
              roadkill.

    Requiem for Iris.  Mace watches Lenny rubbing his eyes,
    waiting for the Tylenols to hit.

                             LENNY
              See, it's all about what they see
              walking in.  A dead hooker,
              handcuffs, penetration... they'll
              see a trick gone wrong.  Random
              kill.  The kind you never solve.

                             MACE
              But that doesn't add, does it.

                             LENNY
              No it doesn't.

                             MACE
              Because Iris knew somebody was after
              her.

    Lenny, wound up like a Swiss movement, starts pacing.

                             LENNY
              She said "If they get me".  They.
              Which means the whole sex-killer
              thing is a cover, which means
              somebody whacked her for a reason.

                             MACE
              So the guy's not a sicko.

                             LENNY
              If he could do what's on that tape,
              he's a sicko.

                             MACE
              Okay, so he's a freak who thinks
              he's sane pretending to be a freak.
              The point is, he was a hitter.
              Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But
              why not just put a little lead in
              her ear?

                             LENNY
              Because it had to look random.  Not
              connected to anything or anyone.
                      (he seems to run out
                       of energy)
              But then why give the rape to me?

                             MACE
              That's where it gets a little
              strange.

                             LENNY
              And what about the guy that was
              following me?

                             MACE
              Now you're really getting paranoid.

    Lenny collapses on the couch, rubbing his temples.

                             LENNY
              The question is not whether I am
              paranoid, but whether I am paranoid
              enough.  You want to rub my neck?

                             MACE
              Sure.

    Mace sits next to him and starts to work.  Strong, knowing
    fingers.  Lenny starts to relax a little.

                             LENNY
              How's Zander?

                             MACE
              OK.  He asks about you all the time.
              It's been weeks since you've seen
              him.

    Lenny sort of keels over.  His head slumps in her lap.

                             MACE
              I'm sorry about getting on your case
              earlier.  I just see you getting
              sucked in deeper and deeper, and I
              -- anyway.  I'm sorry.

                             LENNY
                      (drifting off,
                       joking)
              S'okay.  I know you still love me.

    She looks down at him, gently brushes his hair off his
    sweaty forehead in an unconsciously maternal gesture.  He
    is out cold.

    Mace gazes at Lenny's sleeping face in a way we haven't
    seen before: unguarded.  Caring.  Loving.

    And we get it: she does love him.  It makes no sense, and
    it is a great burden to her that he doesn't see her... but
    there it is.

    She shakes it off: she doesn't want to deal with it now.
    Maybe not ever.  She leans her head back against the ratty
    top of the couch, sighs.  And keeps her hand moving
    soothingly on his head.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT./ INT.  MACE'S HOUSE/INGLEWOOD - DAY

    Mace pulls the limo into the driveway of a modest stucco
    house in Inglewood.  It's dawn.  A neighbor is walking the
    dog.  Mace heads into the house, picking up a couple of
    toys left scattered in the front yard.

    Inside, ZANDER, age 6, is watching TV in his pajamas and
    eating a bowl of cereal.  Behind him, on the couch, is
    Mace's younger sister CECILE, zee'd-out.  Zander frowns at
    her and looks at a red-plastic (toy) watch.

                             ZANDER
              Where were you Mom?  Did you meet a
              guy?

                             MACE
              Just Lenny.

                             ZANDER
              Right.  That explains it.

                             MACE
              Are you going to make me beg?

    Zander scrambles over to his mom, throws his arms around
    her.  Big hug.

                             MACE
                      (looking at weird
                       stuff in cereal)
              What is that?

                             ZANDER
              Cheerios and wieners.  I made it
              myself.  It's good.

                             MACE
              Well give me some then... I'm
              starving.

    INT.  LENNY'S APARTMENT

    2:20  P.M.  DEC 31

    Lenny wakes up to the sound of the phone ringing.  He is
    on the couch, still clothed.  He hears Max's voice on the
    answer machine and groggily grabs the receiver.

                             MAX (V.O.)
              Hey, the last day of the world and
              you spend it in bed.

                             LENNY
              W'sup, Max?

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  A.M.E. CHURCH AND STREET/SOUTH CENTRAL - DAY

    Max, on the cellular, across the street from a church
    where mourners stream out of a memorial for Jeriko One.
    The sidewalk and street are clogged with fans, and further
    off -- a cordon of very anxious-looking crowd control
    cops.

                             MAX
              Not a whole hell of a lot.  They've
              just been saying words over Jeriko.
              Tensions running pretty high down
              here.  I'm telling you.

    WHAT MAX SEES across the street... SLOWMO as Tran comes
    out of the church with Faith next to him.  Corto, Vita,
    Duncan and Beemer form a loose protective shell around
    them as the press bears down, shouting out questions.
    Tran ushers Faith into a waiting limo and climbs in after
    her.  The rest of the muscle keeps the press away from the
    car as it pulls away.

    CUT TO: Max, still on the phone to Lenny.

                             LENNY (V.O.)
              Faith OK?

                             MAX
              Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I
              got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris
              checked into the Sheraton last night
              under a false name.  Paid cash.

                             LENNY
              Looks like she was holding out.

                             MAX
              Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in
              on Tran last night.  Another slick
              Lenny move.

                             LENNY (V.O.)
              He's in this somehow... I don't know
              how.  Just stay close to Faith.

                             MAX
              I'm on her, amigo.  No worries.
              Gotta jam.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  LENNY'S APARTMENT

    As Lenny is hanging up he notices something.  A MANILA
    ENVELOPE stuck between the steel bars and the glass of his
    front window, next to the door.  "NERO" is printed on the
    envelope.

    Oh shit.  He opens the door, looking both ways.  No-one is
    around.  He fishes out the envelope from behind the bars
    and takes it inside.  Of course it contains a tape.  He
    stares at it with dread.

    Lenny sits down and put the tape in his playback deck.  He
    picks up the trodes and places them on his head.  He
    notices his hands are shaking.  He takes a deep breath and
    punches PLAY.

    POV SEQUENCE: DAY.  As expected we see the de-saturated
    signature look of the killer's vision.  The Wearer is
    walking through the courtyard of Lenny's apartment
    building.  We recognize it by the unkempt pool, the sunken
    deck furniture.  We walk through a breezeway to an ally-
    like courtyard behind the building.  We approach a door...
    the back door to Lenny's apartment.

    The killer picks the lock on the back door.  Opens the
    door and enters.  The apartment is dark, blacked out.  We
    are in the kitchen.  We stop and listen.  Water dripping
    in the sink.  Soft snoring from the living room.

    Moving to the other room.  Slowly, silently.  Furtively
    looking around the door frame to the living room.  There
    is Lenny, crashed out on the couch.

    Now moving stealthily toward him.  Kneeling down beside
    him.  Lenny, burned out from the night before, is deep
    under.  Our hand comes into view, holding the yellow
    plastic razor knife.  With his thumb, the killer extends
    the blade... click, click, click, click.

    The blade flashes in a beam of sunlight as it moves toward
    Lenny.  The killer lays it gently against Lenny's throat.
    Draws it slowly across... not leaving a mark.

    The POV backs away and -- static as the tape ends.

    LENNY, IN THE PRESENT, whips off the trodes, freaking.  He
    feels around his throat with one hand... can't feel
    anything.

    Crossing quickly to a mirror near the front door, he
    inspects his neck minutely.  There is a hair-line red line
    over his carotid.  He looks around the room wildly, his
    heart hammering.  Slowly, he gets his breathing under
    control.

    Then... he hears something in the kitchen.  A tiny click.

    His eyes go wide.  Hyperventilating, Lenny moves silently
    into the bedroom.  He fishes around under the bed and
    pulls out a GLOCK 22 .45 auto pistol.  He stalks silently
    toward the kitchen.

    Then he looks at the butt of the pistol-grip: no magazine.
    He un-stalks back to the bed and finds a loaded magazine
    under a bunch of dirty socks.  He inserts it quietly,
    wincing as he chambers a round.

    Heart thudding, he works his way to the kitchen door.  He
    edges around the frame, pie-ing the room.  Cop reflexes
    intact.

    Mace is sitting at the kitchen table, giving him a funny
    look.  She is drinking a cup of coffee, made from the
    bottle of instant on the counter.  She is dressed
    casually, in bicycle pants, work boots and oversized nylon
    jacket over a tank-top.

                             MACE
              Whatup Lenny?

                             LENNY
                      (hands shaking)
              Jesus, Mace!

    INT.  LENNY'S APARTMENT

    A little later.  As Lenny tosses stuff into a folding bag:
    clothes, a playback deck, a box of .45 hollow points.  He
    grabs his grimy old Second Chance body armor from the LAPD
    and stuffs it into his Haliburton.  When Mace sees him do
    that, she knows things are freaky.

                             MACE
              Where we going?

                             LENNY
              Anywhere.
                      (finger to his lips)
              We'll talk about it in the car.

    Mace glances around... unnerved by the possibility of
    audio surveillance.

                             LENNY
              Hand me that box of tapes, will you?

    He's pointing to a shoe box full of "Faith" tapes.  Mace
    hands them over with obvious distaste.  He throws them in
    the bag, starts to zip it...

    ... then sees his reflection in the bedroom mirror:
    something's the matter.

                             MACE
              What is it?

                             LENNY
              This tie doesn't go with blue!

    He yanks off the tie and grabs another.

    INT./ EXT.  MACE'S LIMO AND STREET - DAY

    Mace and Lenny drive through the streets of LA on the last
    day of this millennium.  There are cops in body armor and
    helmets on some street corners, holding automatic rifles.
    Helicopters orbit endlessly.  And a National Guard tank
    rumbles down the street.  State of siege.  The car radio
    is on, with KROQ's poor Man hyping the impending
    Millennium LA party.

                             POOR MAN
              ... the New Years Eve mega-bash of
              the century.  Ten square blocks of
              madness, with live music, fireworks
              and the actual rich and famous of LA
              hobnobbing with us peons.  Also
              yours truly the Poor Man will be
              there at the KROQ bandshell, giving
              away "Millennium LA" and "KROQ 2-K"
              T-shirts by the truckload--

    Lenny is keyed up and tense.  He keeps looking out the
    back window.

                             MACE
              Will you relax.  There's nobody back
              there.

                             LENNY
              Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my
              throat.  In my living room.
              Relaxing might be right out, okay?!

                             MACE
              You better keep a low profile for a
              while.

                             LENNY
              No shit.  You got someplace in mind?

    EXT.  BACKYARD/MACE'S HOUSE - DAY

    On Zander, face lighting up, giving Lenny a high five.
    Lenny drops his bag, shakes, does a little silly hand
    choreography -- a goof on a bro grip -- that makes Zander
    laugh.  Mace watches this ritual and smiles herself.
    Zander can call out a part of Lenny that Mace would like
    to see more of.

    Cecile is there, hanging out with her boyfriend CURTIS,
    and Curtis' friend VEJ.  These two guys are about 18,
    dressed in gangsta garb.  They are listening to "The
    Prophets of Rage" on a CD player, and watch Lenny with a
    dispassion that flirts with distaste.

                             ZANDER
              What do you got?

                             LENNY
                      (pulls a tape out of
                       his pocket)
              Today I have...

                             MACE
                      (seeing the tape)
              Lenny, have you lost it completely?

                             LENNY
              Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is
              audio only.
                      (hands tape to
                       Zander)
              John Coltrane.  "A Love Supreme."
              Give it a listen, let me know what
              you think, maybe you won't go for it
              now, but it'll get in your head and
              grow like a seed into something
              really beautiful.

                             ZANDER
              Let's play it now!

                             LENNY
              Later.  Your mom'n I are heading
              right back out.

    Groans of outrage and protestations of unfairness from
    Cecile, Vej and Curtis follow this bad news.  Cecile even
    musters the gumption to speak up.

                             CECILE
              Hey, come on, I been baby-sitting a
              full 24 hours, I have to get ready
              for the party tonight...

                             MACE
              Cecile.

    Mace frosts her with a look.  You don't mess with Mace.

                             MACE
                      (to a disappointed
                       Zander)
              You're not the only little boy I
              have to look out for, honey.

    Zander nods: OK.  Lenny gives him the grip.  Zander's hand
    outmaneuvers his, and the boy smiles in triumph.

    INT.  UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE

    POV: squid tape of Iris' death.  Quick barrages of the
    savage imagery interspersed with bursts of static...

    ... until Tick slips off the trodes.  He's been totaled by
    what he's seen.

                             TICK
              Whoa.  That is one unbelievable
              piece of eyefuck.

                             LENNY
              Skip the art criticism, Tick, what
              can you tell me about the wearer.

                             TICK
              Well... the guy's fucked up.

                             MACE
              We know that, Tick.

                             TICK
              No, I mean the killer's got some
              kind of distortion in his visual
              cortex.  The color and gray-scale
              values are all messed up, like color
              blindness.

    He gives the tape a fast run through his processing
    equipment.

                             TICK
              Lookit, you see the peak period
              ratios there?  Could be some kind of
              tumor or brain lesion or something.
              Some kind of trauma
                      (shaking his head)
              This is not good.  I don't like this

              Yeah, she came by last night.
              Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to
              make a copy of some clip.

                             LENNY
              What clip?  What was it?

              I don't know, man, she wouldn't let

              see it.  She said she was going to
              give it to you to hold for her.
              Like insurance or somethin'

                             LENNY
              She never gave me a tape.

                             MACE
              Something in your car...

    Lenny and Mace swap a look: oh shit.

    EXT.  SAN PEDRO IMPOUND YARD - DUSK

    6:05  P.M.

    The last night of this millennium is falling.  Mace's limo
    pulls to the curb.  The yard is located in the vast no-
    man's land of storage lots, cranes and warehouses near
    harbor piers.  The impound office is locked.  Closed for
    New Years Eve.

    CUT TO Lenny and Mace cutting the chain off the gate with
    the long-handled bolt-cutters.  They enter the yard.  Mace
    is carrying a blunt object that looks like a ray-gun.  A
    TAZER.

    Right on cue a huge Rottweiller bounds out of the shadows
    at them, growling, its head low on an attack run.  Mace
    fires and the tazer lights up the with 120,000 volts (low
    amperage, not lethal).  It whines and flips over twice,
    then runs off behind some parked cars.

                             LENNY
              That's a handy little attitude
              adjuster.
                      (sees his car)
              Damn.  I'm boxed in.

    Lenny and Mace approach his BMW, blocked in by ten other
    cars, so he's not getting it back this trip.  He unlocks
    the door and looks inside with a tiny Mag-Lite while Mace
    covers them with the tazer.  A puppy-like whine comes
    occasionally from behind some cars nearby.  We catch a
    glimpse of the puzzled, snuffling Rottweiller eyeing them
    warily.

    Lenny finds the tape on the floormat, passenger side,
    still wrapped in the note.  He reads the note: "HELP ME.
    IRIS."

                             MACE
              What's it say?

    He crumples the note.

                             LENNY
              Nothing.  Let's go play this back.

    CUT TO LENNY AND MACE returning to the limo.  As they
    reach the car they are hit by two flashlight beams.  It is
    the two cops, SPREG AND ENGELMAN, out of uniform, but
    looking very serious with their pistols aimed at Lenny and
    Mace.  They have been following Lenny, knowing sooner or
    later he would lead them to the tape.

                             SPREG
              Give me the tape.  Right now.

                             LENNY
              What tape?  I'm just trying to get
              my car back but the place is
              closed--

                             SPREG
              Shut the fuck up Nero.

    Engelman grabs a fist-full of hair at the top of Mace's
    head and jams his 9mm into the back of her skull.

                             MACE
                      (cool and even)
              Lenny, give them the tape.

                             LENNY
              It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going
              to open my case...

                             ENGELMAN
              Facing us, where we can see it.

    Lenny slowly opens the Haliburton.  He takes out the tape
    and holds it out toward Spreg.

                             LENNY
              Take it and turn her loose.  Okay?

                             SPREG
              Absolutely.

    And you see in his eyes that it isn't going to go that
    way.  Spreg edges forward and takes the tape.  Then he
    points his pistol at Lenny's head, about to fire--

    Which is when the pissed-off Rottweiller shoots through
    the open gate like a black torpedo and tears into
    Engelman's leg.  Engelman screams in pain.  Mace twists
    out of his grip.  Engelman shoots the dog.

    Lenny swings up his Haliburton, using it as a shield, and
    dives for the car.  The case takes three rounds from
    Spreg's 9mm before Lenny gets behind cover.

    Mace just seems to vanish.  She reappears over the trunk
    of the limo and puts two rounds squarely into Spreg's
    chest, knocking him down.  Lenny and Mace scramble into
    the car, starting it up.

    Spreg sits up, pulling up his shirt to make sure his body
    armor stopped the slugs.  No blood.  He comes up firing.
    He and Engelman empty their magazines at the limo as it
    pulls away.  No damage.  They realize the limo is a bullet
    proof security model and run to their pickup truck, parked
    nearby, to give chase.

    Spreg's face is a mask of rage.  He slams the truck in
    gear and accelerates after the limo before Engelman even
    has the door closed.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT./ EXT.  LIMO AND SAN PEDRO STREET - NIGHT

    Mace has the big car floored.  She looks in the rear-view
    as the truck gains on them.  Mace is doing her thing...
    what she's trained for.  Security driving.  She whips some
    moves in the big car, but the truck is closing on them.

                             LENNY
                      (holding on)
              Oh no, we're not being followed,
              Lenny, Don't be so paranoid, Lenny.

    They hear rounds hitting the car, and look back.  The
    truck is right behind them.

                             LENNY
              Shit!

                             MACE
              Take it easy.  The glass is bullet
              resistant.

                             LENNY
              Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened
              to bullet proof?

                             MACE
              Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I
              do.

    THE LIMO slides broadly through a turn, side slamming a
    parked van.  Mace accelerates.  The truck stays with them.

    Engelman is leaning out the passenger side window with an
    AK-47 assault rifle.  He rips off several burst which
    riddle the limo, cracking the glass in starburst patterns.
    The Lexan-laminated windows are cracked to hell, but the
    rounds don't come all the way through.

    Spreg's truck comes alongside, ramming them.  The impact
    drives them sideways.  Mace swerves to miss a light-
    standard and finds herself roaring between warehouse
    buildings which front the harbor.

    The truck stays right with them.  Engelman fires bursts at
    the tires, shredding them off the rims.  The limo thunders
    along on steel rims, throwing rooster-tails of orange
    sparks.

    Mace finds herself boxed in by the buildings.  No way to
    turn.  Ahead is a short concrete pier.  She hits the
    brakes and the limo skids on its rims out onto the pier,
    stopping before it reaches the end.

    They are trapped.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  SAN PEDRO PIER - NIGHT

    Engelman and Spreg jump out of the truck, taking cover
    behind it.  They rake the limo with bursts from their AK-
    47s.

    INSIDE THE CAR.  Lenny and Mace keep their heads down
    below the door frame.  It sounds like they are inside a
    steel drum in some psychotic Calypso band.  But the
    armored body panels hold.

    Lenny is punching his cellular.

                             LENNY
              Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!

                             MACE
              It's okay, Lenny
                      (he looks at her
                       hopefully)
              They'd never get here in time
              anyway.

    Mace has reloaded her Sig and is trying to open the door
    on her side (away from the bad guys).  It is jammed from
    the sideswiping.

    Spreg reaches into the bed of the truck and pulls out a
    gallon gas can.  He uncaps it and throws it across the
    pavement.  It slides under the limo, glugging its contents
    onto the ground.  Spreg grabs a road-flare from under the
    seat of the truck and strikes the cap, lighting it.

    He tosses the flare under the limo...

    KA-WHOOMPH!!  The gas can explodes in a fireball.  The
    Continental is engulfed in flames.  From the inside all
    Lenny and Mace can see is fire.  All the windows are
    covered in roaring flames.

                             MACE
                      (matter-of-fact)
              This is bad.

                             LENNY
              The gas tank's going to go any
              second!

    Mace slams the car into gear and floors it.  The powerful
    Lincoln thunders forward.  It crashes through a chain-link
    fence and launches right off the end of the pier.  A
    fireball plunging in a meteoric arc into the oily black
    water.

    Inside, they are slammed forward by the impact.  The car
    sinks.

    UNDERWATER: The car hits bottom, twenty feet down, sitting
    there amid the junk.  Shafts of light play down from the
    big streetlights at the end of the pier.

    INSIDE, Lenny and Mace are in a flooding black tomb.

                             LENNY
              Are you out of your fucking mind?!

                             MACE
              Fire's out, isn't it?

    She scrambles into the back seat.  She wrenches at the
    rear seatback, pulls it free... and crawls half-into the
    huge trunk.  Water is up around their legs.  She grabs her
    shotgun: a sawed-off ten-gauge.

                             MACE
              Get in here.  Come on Lenny, move
              it.  MOVE!!

    Mace yanks him toward her and he tumbles in.

                             MACE
              Get ready to hold your breath.

    She aims the ten-gauge at the trunk latch mechanism.

                             MACE
              Lenny, kick out hard, then just
              follow me. Okay?

    He nods.  BLAM!!  She blows the trunk latch into shrapnel.
    The trunk lid belches open in a whoosh of bubbles.  Lenny
    and Mace kick out, heading toward the lights of the pier.

    ON THE SURFACE: Mace breaks the surface slowly alongside
    the slimy concrete wall.  Lenny comes up beside her,
    spluttering.  Her hand goes over his mouth.  They are in
    the inky shadows under a massive bumper made of rail-road
    ties.

    Engelman and Spreg are standing above them, scanning the
    black water over the barrels of their AKs.

                             SPREG
              Let's get out of here.

    They run back to the truck and high-tail it out of there.

    Down below, Lenny and Mace are clinging to the pier,
    chest-deep in the water.  They hear the truck pulling
    away.  They let out a big exhalations of relief.

    CUT TO LENNY AND MACE walking on the pier, shoes
    squishing.  They leave a shiny trail behind them.

                             MACE
              I can't believe we had to give them
              the damn tape.

                             LENNY
              Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my
              favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot
              tub on my birthday.  I'm going to
              really miss it.

    He feels around in his jacket pocket.  He pulls out the
    MYSTERY TAPE... nice and dry in its plastic case.  He
    holds it up to show a grinning Mace.

                             LENNY
              Are we impressed yet?

                                                CUT TO:

    INT./ EXT.  FREEWAY AND CURTIS' CAR - NIGHT

    7:45  P.M.

    Lenny and Mace, still wet, riding in the back seat of
    Curtis' car.

                             CURTIS
                      (pissed)
              I got better things to do on New
              Year's Eve than be some kinda damn
              chauffeur...

                             MACE
              Hey Curtis?  Just drive.

    Curtis swears.  But he shuts up and drives.

                             LENNY
              Those two guys were cops.

                             MACE
              You sure?

                             LENNY
              It's the walk.  Something.  Anyway,
              they'll run your plates and get your
              address.  We gotta keep moving.

    Mace takes it in.  She nods.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  MACE'S HOUSE

    Mace comes in the front door and walks straight to the TV,
    switching it off.  Zander and Cecile are shocked.

                             CECILE
              Lornette, girl... what's going on?

    Lenny goes past them and starts grabbing his stuff...
    wardrobe bag, playback gear.

                             MACE
                      (to Zander)
              We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey.
              We're going to watch fireworks from
              there.  Let's go.  Chop chop.

                             ZANDER
              Aw, Mom!

                             LENNY
              Come on Zander.  You can ride on my
              shoulders.  Here you go.

    Lenny hoists him overhead and goes out the door.  Cecile
    catches up to Mace in the hall, just as she is opening a
    locked cabinet and pulling out a little .380 auto, holster
    and ammo.

                             MACE
              Cecile, get in the car.  Now.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT./ EXT.  STREET AND CIVIC - NIGHT

    Sirens pierce the night.  Two pillars of fire are visible
    blocks away.  There are dark crowds of people everywhere.
    People on the sidewalks, lighting fireworks.  There are
    flashes and explosions.  It could be a celebration, or a
    war zone.  Maybe both.  Or one about to turn into the
    other.

    Mace is driving, scanning the streets.  She has her .380
    auto in her hand, resting in her lap.  Lenny is riding
    shotgun, while Curtis, Cecile and Zander are in the back
    seat.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  CECILE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

    It is gang territory pure and simple.  Blacks and
    Hispanics.  Graffiti everywhere.  Burned-out buildings.
    Lenny sees abject poverty, here.  Even so, people are
    partying.

    They pull up to the front of Cecile's apartment building
    and get out.

    There are some homeboys chillin' on the front steps who
    give Mace the local hand-sign.  She returns the sign
    automatically as she carries Zander past them.

                             ONE OF THE BOYS
              Yo, Mace.  Whatup wit you, homegirl?
              You never come roun' here no more.

    Lenny follows with his wardrobe bag.  The homeboys give
    Lenny the eye as he brushes past them.  Mace chills them
    with a glare.

                             MACE
              He's with me.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  CECILE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

    A small and dingy place.  Cecile has done her best to make
    it a home.

    Mace and Lenny go into the kitchen and shut the door.

    He quickly sets up his playback deck on the table.  He
    puts on the trodes and pulls the tape out of his pocket.
    Then he pauses, looking at it apprehensively... knowing
    that it contains the answer to all this madness.

    He puts it into the deck.  The deck closes.  He punches
    PLAY.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  APARTMENT/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

    Mace watches Zander lighting bottle rockets with Curtis on
    the balcony of the apartment... visible through the
    window.  Staccato fireworks nearby sound like automatic
    weapons, making her flinch.  She goes back into the...

    KITCHEN.  Where she sees Lenny sitting at the table,
    trodes in his hands.  Stunned.  Face the color of old
    cement.  Hands shaking.

                             MACE
              Tell me.

                             LENNY
              I can't tell you.  You've got to
              see.

                             MACE
              Uh unh.  I won't do it.

                             LENNY
              Mace.  I know what you think about
              the wire.  But I'm asking you to do
              this.  It's that important.

    Mace sees how serious he is.  She nods: OK.  He puts the
    trodes on her.

                             LENNY
              Sorry this has to be your first
              playback.

    He hits play and Mace reacts as the sensory input hits
    her.  She opens her eyes...

                             LENNY
              Keep your eyes closed, or you'll see
              double.

    She bites her lip as the sensation of being another person
    floods through her.

    POV SEQUENCE: We are Iris.  Riding in a car.  Fixing our
    makeup in a mirror on the passenger side sun visor.  Iris
    flips the sun visor back up, revealing the moving street.
    It is night.

    We look down, and recognize the dress Iris was wearing
    when we first saw her, two nights ago.  She puts her
    lipstick into a purse which is belted to her waist.  Iris
    turns her head and we see the driver.

    It is JERIKO ONE.  He is laughing, talking to someone in
    the back seat.  Iris looks and we see REPLAY, Jeriko's
    sideman, and another woman, DIAMANDA.  They are amorously
    entwined.  Then they are all laughing and passing around a
    bottle of Jim Beam.  The car stereo is thumping loudly.

    Iris' POV swings around and looks down, seeing Jeriko's
    hand caressing her thigh.  She puts her hand on his chest
    and leans close to him.  Jeriko grins, then looks up and
    swears at a wash of red/blue cop flash.

                             JERIKO
              Shit.  Fuckin' Five-O

    Our POV swings to the rear-view mirror and we see an LAPD
    car behind us, with the gumball machine on.  A spotlight
    hits us and we hear a single whoop on the siren.  Jeriko
    pulls over, but they are on an overpass... no shoulder.

                             COP VOICE
                      (on bullhorn)
              Go to the bottom of the ramp.

    Jeriko and Replay are both swearing.  He pulls the car
    down the ramp, stopping on a deserted street in a
    warehouse district.  Our POV looks around nervously.
    Black shadows and concrete pillars.  No-one around.  Cars
    whoosh by on the bridge above but they might as well be on
    Mars.  The car is stopped next to a train yard.  We hear
    the rumble of diesels nearby, the clank of freightcars.

    We see the outlines of TWO COPS advancing through the beam
    of the spotlight, their guns drawn.

                             JERIKO
                      (jumping out of the
                       car)
              Goddamn, now what you pull me over
              for?  If I was going any slower I'd
              be parked--

                             COP VOICE 1
              Get down on your knees and put your
              hands on your head.  Now!

                             COP VOICE 2
              Everyone else, out of the car and
              down on the ground.

    Our POV comes up and out of the car.  Jeriko is
    righteously pissed off.  He's not following orders.

                             COP VOICE 1
              Put your hands behind your head
              right now!

    He goes along, madder than ever.  The cops get Replay down
    on his knees as well, in the wet gutter next to the curb.

    The cops are closer now.  We see that they are SPREG and
    ENGELMAN.

                             ENGELMAN
                      (to us)
              Put your hands on the hood of the
              car and don't move.

    We exchange a look with Diamanda.  Fucking cops.  But
    Jeriko is winding them up.  Not giving them the pleasure
    of the humiliation.  You can see it escalating.

                             JERIKO
              I suppose you stopped us cause you
              had suspects fitting our description
              in the area, what you're gonna tell
              me.  What was the description?  Two
              black males in a car?  Yeah, right,
              I heard that one before...

    As Engelman pulls out Jeriko's wallet, looks at his ID,
    Jeriko checks name tags.

                             JERIKO
              Well you stopped the wrong black
              male tonight officer... what is it?
              Spreg.  Officer Spreg.  Cause I'm
              the 800 pound gorilla in your mist,
              fucker.  I make more in a day than
              you make in a year, and my lawyers
              love to spend my money dragging
              sorry-ass Aryan robocops like you
              into court.  Get a man down on the
              ground with no probable cause.  Fuck
              you!

                             SPREG
              Shut the fuck up!

    He kicks Jeriko down on his face.  Jeriko hits the ground
    hard.

                             DIAMANDA
                      (yelling)
              Leave the fuck off of us, we weren't
              doing anything...

                             SPREG
              Shut up!  Don't make me walk over
              there.

    Engelman shows the ID to Spreg, saying something we can't
    hear.

                             SPREG
              You're that rap puke?  Jeriko One?
              You're the one getting all the
              gangbangers to form citizens groups
              and go downtown... trying to rake
              the LAPD over a cheese grater?

                             JERIKO
              That's right.  And you're gonna be
              in my next song, motherfucker, it's
              called Robo-Spreg.

    Replay starts laughing.  Diamanda stifles a giggle.  Spreg
    is white-lipped with rage.  Years of frustration coming to
    a head.  Too many disciplinary actions, too many
    suspensions, too little appreciation of the tough job they
    do.

                             JERIKO
              It's a song about a cop who meets
              his worst nightmare, a nigger with
              enough political juice to crush his
              ass like a stink bug.  You're gonna
              be famous.

    Spreg looks around the empty street.  Looks at Engelman.
    Down at Jeriko, proned out on the pavement.  Replay's
    laughter in his ears.

                             SPREG
              I don't think so.

    And shoots him BLAM!  BLAM!  Twice in the back of the
    head.  Just like that.

    Diamanda screams.  Replay tries to roll to his feet.
    Spreg shoots him twice in the stomach.  Replay is
    screaming.  Rolling around, holding his guts.

                             SPREG
                      (shouting)
              Hey... I don't hear you laughing!

    Engelman's yelling something at him we can't hear.  Spreg
    turns, eyes wide with adrenaline.

                             SPREG
              Get the bitches.

    Engelman hesitates and then spins toward us.  Diamanda is
    screaming, backing away from Engelman.  Spreg shoots
    Replay four more times.

    We spin one-eighty and start to run.  Hear shots... BLAM!
    BLAM!  BLAM!  Spin back... to see Diamanda dropping to her
    knees.  Engelman shoots her again.  Then raises his gun
    toward us.

    We spin away.  The world becomes a kinetic blur.  The
    sound of shots.  We see puffs of dust on the ground in
    front of us.  Missed shots.  We tumble over a guardrail
    and roll down an embankment... get up and keep running.

    Train tracks ahead.  Looking back... here come Spreg and
    Engelman down the embankment, overtaking us.  We hear the
    thunder of a train... spinning again to look forward.
    Freight-train doing fifty on the nearest track.  Almost to
    us.

    We leap forward.  Over the track.  The diesel roars past
    behind us.  Looking back... a black wall of moving steel.
    Backing away from it.

    We see Engelman and Spreg crouching down... trying to aim
    through the wheels.  Hear the impotent pop of their guns
    over the roar of the train.

    Turning to run again.  We see a tiny hole appear in a sign
    right in front of us with a metallic SPANG.  Running and
    running.

    Looking back.  No pursuit.  Train still rolling by.  Can't
    see the cops.  Running, running.  Heart pounding and lungs
    heaving.  Sobbing sounds coming from somewhere, seeming to
    fill the night.

    Looking down... one shoe on, one shoe off.  Iris' hand
    takes off the remaining shoe, clutches it to her chest.
    We move forward into the dark train-yard as--

    THE TAPE ENDS.

    And Mace sits stone still.  Shakes.  For a beat.  And
    another.  Then she tears the trodes off and throws them
    across the room, near where Lenny is on the cellular.

                             LENNY
                      (into phone)
              Hang on.  Hang on, Max.
                      (looks at Mace)
              You see?

                             MACE
              I see.
                      (trembling)
              I see the earth opening up and
              swallowing us all.

                             LENNY
              Yeah I know.
                      (into cellular)
              So what do we do?

                                                CUT TO:

    INT./ EXT.  MAX'S CAR - NIGHT

    As Max drives along a crowded downtown street.

                             MAX
                      (into phone)
              Don't talk to anybody.  Anybody.
              You're invisible.  Okay?  Just meet
              me at Tick's in a half hour.  And
              Lenny... don't get pulled over.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  CECILE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

    Lenny pushes "End" on his cellular and looks at Mace.  The
    first-time impact of the Squid experience, and the killing
    of Jeriko, still haunts her.  We've never seen Mace
    scared.  But she looks scared now.

                             LENNY
              We got to make another copy of this.
              Little life insurance.

                             MACE
              You know what this tape could do if it
              gets out.

                             LENNY
                      (tucking Glock in
                       his waistband)
              I've got a good idea, yeah.

                             MACE
              People finding out... seeing... that
              the LAPD just flat out executed
              Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they
              ought to see.

                             LENNY
              Maybe.  But tonight is probably not
              the best night.  Come on, we're
              rollin'.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  CECILE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

    Cecile catches them on the steps as they are leaving.

                             CECILE
              Lornette, when you gonna stop laying
              off everything on me?  We had plans
              tonight--

                             MACE
                      (steely)
              Listen to me, little sister.
              There's something going on, and it's
              very big.  Now you've got to take
              care of Zander.  And stay off the
              streets tonight... you hear me on
              this?

    Cecile gets the message.  She nods.

                             MACE
              Curtis.  What about you?  Do we
              understand each other?  You stay
              put.

                             CURTIS
              Yeah.  I'm wit it.

    Mace and Lenny go on down the steps to the car.

                             CURTIS
                      (to Cecile)
              Damn!  She worse than you.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT./ EXT.  CIVIC AND STREET - NIGHT

    Lenny and Mace see helicopters circling as they maneuver
    the dark streets.  Xenon searchlights crisscross the
    rooftops nearby.  They see patrol cars passing on cross-
    streets, lights flashing.  It feels like the entire LAPD
    is looking for them.

    Everywhere in the street there are small crowds, street
    parties in progress.  People drinking and firing bottle
    rockets.  The police watch everything.

                             LENNY
              So, let's see, I've got Tran's
              goons, some squidhead psycho and the
              LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy
              new year, Lenny.

                             MACE
              Well, look at the plus side.

                             LENNY
              There's a plus side?

                             MACE
              Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape
              to save me.  That's real progress
              for you.

                             LENNY
              It was a tough call.

                             MACE
              I still can't square the psycho
              smarts of whoever did Iris with
              those two cops.

                             LENNY
              I don't think those cops did Iris.
              I think whoever Iris was wearing for
              killed her.

                             MACE
              Why?

                             LENNY
              To break the trail.  If those cops
              had gotten hold of her, they would
              have beat it out of her who she was
              wearing for, and then gone after
              them too.  Our killer is running as
              scared as we are.  Which makes him
              really dangerous.  Judging by how
              scared I am.

    They pull up to the checkpoint; Lenny squirrels into the
    seat, hiding in the shadows, as Mace flashes her security
    pass and the cop waves them on.

    Lenny lets his breath out slowly.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  UNDERGROUND GARAGE/TICK'S VAN

    Lenny and Mace pull in with a SQUEAL of brakes and park
    the car.  Sound of rock music -- some kind of refried
    psychedelia -- coming from Tick's van down the ramp.

    Mace and Lenny get out, approaching the van.  Hearing
    tires squeal, they turn to see Max pull up.  He gets out
    wearing an ill-fitting rental tux.  Music louder, echoing
    in the empty garage, even though the van is shut tight.

                             MAX
              Sounds like Tick's already
              celebrating.

                             LENNY
              You may be a little overdressed for
              this party.
                      (Lenny pounds on the
                       van door)
              Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!

    Mace slips out her .380, on alert.

                             LENNY
                      (knocks again, then opens
                       rear van door)
              Tick, I got to talk to you, man...
              oh shit.

    Tick's slumped in the back of the van with playback trodes
    on his head.  He's breathing, but otherwise he's still.
    Near lifeless.  A cyborg after a power outage.  All the
    equipment in the van is trashed.

                             LENNY
                      (as he starts to
                       examine Tick)
              He's been cooked-off

                             MAX
              Is he dead?

                             LENNY
              No.  But his frontal lobes are like
              two runny eggs.  They put an
              amplifier in-line to boost the
              signal till it french-fried his
              brain.

    Mace hits "Off" on the built-in CD player.  The sudden
    silence is creepy.  Lenny gets right in front of Tick's
    eyes, shouting at him, at the top of his lungs.

    TICK'S POV: We see a roaring blizzard of inchoate static.
    Somewhere in the middle of it is a suggestion of Lenny's
    face, almost invisible.  We hear the tiniest ghost of his
    voice, like a radio playing two blocks away.

                             LENNY
              He's totally cut off from the outer
              world.

                             MACE
              How long does it last?
                      (off Lenny's look)
              Oh.

                             MAX
              Those two psycho cops are on a
              slash-and-burn to find the tape and
              cover their tracks.

                             MACE
              This seems a little sophisticated
              for them.  These are not subtle
              guys.

                             MAX
              There's more to this whole thing
              than you think.

                             LENNY
              Whattya mean?

                             MAX
              All I'm saying... you don't know how
              high up the food chain this thing
              goes.  I've heard stuff.

                             LENNY
              What stuff?

                             MAX
              Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff
              about a death squad.  A group a guys
              loyal to the hardline school.  Guys
              that've had too many years of city
              hall and the review boards and the
              goddamn media pissing down their
              necks, suspending cops right and
              left, tying their hands... while
              outa the other side a their mouths
              these same people're squealing save
              us, save us, do something you
              fucking morons, crime is totally out
              of control.

    Lenny takes this in.  All the fight goes out of him.  This
    is just too overwhelming.

                             LENNY
              Jesus.

                             MAX
              Yeah.  So don't walk near me in
              public, alright.

                             LENNY
              Thanks, buddy.  See... things
              weren't bad enough.  They weren't
              fucking bad enough!

                             MACE
              The only card we have to play is the
              tape.  You know, we get it to the
              media somehow...

                             LENNY
              Yeah, right, blow it open.

                             MAX
                      (interrupting)
              Mace... no disrespect... but you run
              this on the 11 o'clock news, by
              midnight you got the biggest riot in
              history.  They'll see the fucking
              smoke from Canada.

                             LENNY
              Okay... what about Strickland?

                             MAX
              No.  Bad idea.

                             MACE
              Who's Strickland?

                             LENNY
              Deputy Commissioner Palmer
              Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick
              who busted me out.  His ass is so
              tight when he farts only dogs can
              hear it.  I know this guy.  If
              there's one cop who's not dirty
              it's him.

                             MAX
              Listen to me, Lenny... stay away
              from cops.  All cops.  You have no
              way of knowing who you can trust.

    Mace looks from one to the other with a growing expression
    of outrage.

                             MACE
              So you're saying we just pretend is
              didn't happen?  It happened!  The
              LAPD executed one of the most
              important black men in America!  Who
              the fuck are you to bury this?!

                             MAX
              Fine.  Do you want blood running
              waist deep in the storm drains?  The
              gangbangers'll spread like a wave
              through this city and burn it to the
              ground.  And when the fires start
              the street cops'll be capping off at
              anything that moves.  It'll be all-
              out war and you know it.

                             MACE
              Yeah, well maybe it's time for a
              war!

                             MAX
              You really want that on your head?

                             LENNY
              Hey, Max, Mace... whoa... time out.

                             MAX/MACE
                      (together/annoyed)
              What!?

                             LENNY
              Whoever killed Iris did Tick.  It's
              the same sick wirehead shit.  Same
              reason... to burn the trail.  If
              Faith knows anything about this, and
              I think she does, then she's on the
              list.  So... who's driving?

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  RETINAL FETISH/ALLEY - NIGHT

    Roadies are loading out gear through the back doors of the
    club into a van in the alley.  Lenny and Mace ENTER FRAME
    and we follow them between the roadies, going through the
    doors into...


    INT.  RETINAL FETISH

    A grungy black corridor.  The thunder of music gets louder
    with each step as Lenny and Mace walk down the corridor
    with purposeful strides.

    Through chainlink partitions and banks of dark equipment,
    Lenny catches glimpses of the stage.  He can see Faith in
    a blue-white spotlight.  She is a whirling dervish,
    convulsing with the divine madness of her music.  Beyond
    her, beyond the lights, in the gloom... Lenny can just see
    Tran and his entourage.  Dressed in tuxes, they look out
    of place... clearly on their way somewhere else as the
    evening progresses.

    Faith whirls to a stop as the band crashes in a final
    downbeat.  The spotlight goes out and the set is over.

    ON TRAN, clapping.  Watching.

    NEARBY, Max arrives through the crowd, scanning for
    Tran... spotting him.

    BACKSTAGE... FAITH, bathed in sweat, walking along a dark
    corridor backstage.  WE TRACK WITH HER, as she walks
    through the shadows, like a fighter returning from the
    ring, soaked and breathing hard.

    A HAND shoots from a black doorway and covers her mouth,
    pulling her into the shadows.  Terrified for a split
    second... before she recognizes that it is Lenny.  He
    pulls her into the room and closes the door.  It is Tex
    Arcana's VJ control room, full of monitors and constantly
    changing graphic images.  Tex is not there.

                             FAITH
              Lenny!  Jesus!  You scared the Hell
              out of me.

    Faith sees that Mace is standing there, in the shadows,
    waiting.  She turns back to Lenny with a frown.

                             FAITH
              What's going on?

                             LENNY
              Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris
              made me a copy of the tape.

                             FAITH
              Oh God, Lenny.  I was trying to keep
              you out of this.

    But she seems relieved now that he knows, now that there
    is someone to talk to.

                             LENNY
              How did it happen?  What was Iris
              doing riding around with Jeriko
              wearing a wire?

                             FAITH
              We should talk alone.

                             LENNY
              No.  Mace is in this.

                             MACE
              Tell us.

                             FAITH
              Tran's gotten obsesses with
              playback, a total wiretrip junkie.
              And he's such a control freak, he's
              been having people followed,
              videotaped... recording his business
              partners' calls.  Wiring up people
              left and right.

    INT.  CLUB/MAIN FLOOR

    Tran looks at his watch and gets up from the table,
    impatient.

                             TRAN
              Let's go get her.  We're late.

    Max shows up suddenly, right in front of him.  Stopping
    him.

                             MAX
              Tran, listen.  I was wondering how
              you want me to work it tonight, down
              at the Bonaventure.  You want me
              downstairs at the party or upstairs
              at the suite?  Where you going to
              be, mostly?

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  TEX'S ROOM

    While Max stalls, Faith talks.

                             FAITH
              Tran and Jeriko weren't getting
              along.  He was afraid Jeriko was
              getting ready to dump him, but he
              wasn't sure, so he started with the
              surveillance.  A couple nights ago
              he wires up Iris and sends her and
              the other girl, Diamanda, over to
              Jeriko's table.

    CUT TO: TWO NIGHTS AGO, Iris, wearing a wig, leaves Tran's
    table with Diamanda and moves toward... a booth in the
    Retinal Fetish where Jeriko One sits with Replay.  Iris
    stands over Jeriko for just a moment.  Then he nods,
    smiles a little, and moves over to make room for her in
    the booth right next to him.

                             FAITH
              That night Iris calls up, freaking.
              She comes over and Tran watches the
              tape.  He just loses it.  He can't
              believe the disaster she's gotten
              him into.  He's terrified the cops
              will beat it out of her who she was
              working for, and come looking for
              him.

    CUT TO: TRAN'S LOFT as a tear-streaked and frantic Iris is
    telling Tran about how the cops tried to kill her (we
    don't hear).  Tran backhands her furiously, his face thin-
    lipped with rage.  She crumples to the floor, sobbing.
    Tran keeps looking at the squid tape in his hand like it's
    poison.

                             LENNY
              Kinda guy you can count on in a
              pinch.

                             MACE
              Why didn't he just go public with
              the tape?  Save himself that way.

    CUT TO: An image of Tran burning the squid tape.  It
    blazes in his hand and he hurls it into the fireplace like
    a venomous snake.

                             FAITH
              The scandal would wipe him out.  If
              it got out that he had his own
              artists under surveillance... he'd
              lose all his other acts.  He'd be
              over.

    Now we see Tran, more composed, comforting Iris.  He wipes
    at her tear-streaked face.  Hands her a wad of bills.

                             FAITH
              So finally he gives Iris some cash
              and tells her to check into the
              hotel under a wrong name till he
              figures out what to do.

                             LENNY
              Yeah... he figured out what to do
              all right.

                             FAITH
              You think Tran killed her?

                             LENNY
              The killer knew right where she was.
              Because he put her there.

                             FAITH
              What a nightmare.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  MAIN FLOOR

    Tran impatiently gestures to Corto.

                             TRAN
              Go get her, Joey.  Stupid bitch.
                      (to Max)
              We'll talk about this later.

    INT.  TEX'S ROOM

    Mace is getting the sixth sense feeling that seconds
    count.

                             MACE
              Come on.  We're out of here.

    Lenny gets close to Faith, taking her face in his hands.

                             LENNY
              Leave here with me, right now.

    Mace sighs heavily, rolls her eyes toward the ceiling.
    Faith considers her options.  Then she smiles at him.

                             FAITH
              Okay, Lenny.  My guardian angel.

    Faith hugs him, and he clutches her.  Mace locks her jaw
    and looks away.  This is hard for her.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  CORRIDOR

    Mace leads the way, with Lenny following, gripping Faith's
    hand like Orpheus leading Eurydice out of Hell.  They push
    through shapes of people in the thundering dark corridor.
    Half-lit, in alcoves, far-gone wireheads loll in semi-
    consciousness.  Faith looks back and sees:

    TRAN'S POSSE rounding a corner... spotting them.  They
    start shoving through the crowd like juggernauts, knocking
    protesting people out of the way.

    Mace, Lenny and Faith break into a run, pounding down the
    corridor.

    Behind them, Duncan leads the charge.  Suddenly TEX ARCANA
    shoots into the hallway, intentionally blocking their path
    with his wheelchair.  Duncan crashes over him, toppling
    the chair, and they both sprawl to the floor.  Vita,
    Beemer and Corto go around the sprawl.

    Tex, like many legless men, has incredibly strong arms.
    Lenny looks back to see him pounding Duncan's head against
    the floor...

                             TEX
              Teach you...
                      (pound)
              to mess with...
                      (pound)
              a helpless cripple!

    Lenny et al reach the main floor of the club where they
    shove through the buffeting crowd amid strobe-flashes and
    a wall of sound.

    Behind them we see Corto and Beemer hurling partiers
    aside, cutting a swath, while Vita moves like a mongoose
    through tall grass.  Mace drops back, going tail-end-
    Charlie... her bodyguard mode kicking in.

    ON LENNY AND FAITH, charging through the jostling crowd,
    Lenny is looking back, then he looks ahead and...

    TRAN is right in front of him.  In the whirling shapes and
    colors of the crowd, he is an island of composure in a
    white tux.  He holds a glass of champagne in one hand, the
    bottle in the other.  In one lightning-fast move he
    uppercuts with the bottle, clipping Lenny under the jaw.
    Faith screams as Lenny staggers.  Tran swings again,
    smashing the bottle over the back of Lenny's head.  Lenny
    sprawls on the floor amid champagne foam and glass.

    Lenny, blood flowing in his eyes, rises blearily to see
    Faith being pulled away by Tran, who has her arm twisted
    viciously behind her back.  They go around a chain-link
    divider and double back, heading for the exit.  Lenny
    staggers to the chainlink, sagging to his knees again as
    Faith passes within a few inches of him.  He slips down
    the chainlink, into unconsciousness, as her image is lost
    in the pounding darkness.

    Mace gets to him through the crowd, and then whirls like a
    cat as the Posse arrives.  She stands guard over him like
    a rabid dog, her .380 auto straightarmed and covering them
    expertly.  Corto eyes her with hatred.  The stitches on
    his nose and the bruised swelling are a reminder of his
    last run-in with her.  He backs off.

                             CORTO
                      (to the others)
              Not here.  Lets go.

    They back off, fading into the crowd... catching up with
    Tran at the exit.

    Mace watches them recede.  Then she bends to Lenny.  Max
    arrives a moment later and they lift him to his feet.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  RETINAL FETISH/ALLEY - NIGHT

    Max and Mace support a semi-conscious Lenny, hustling him
    to the car.  As they are putting him in the car, TWO LAPD
    OFFICERS come through the crowd, eyeing the bleeding
    Lenny.

                             MAX
              Everything's cool.  Too much to
              drink.

    Lenny picks this moment to slump sideways, falling half
    out of the car.  The squid tape of the Jeriko kill falls
    out of his jacket pocket and clatters to the pavement.
    Mace's eyes go wide.  The boot of one of the cops is
    inches from it.

                             MACE
              Yeah, uh... he slipped on the
              stairs.  We're taking him to
              emergency.
                      (to the nearest cop)
              Excuse me.

    The cop steps back, giving Mace room to push Lenny back up
    in the seat.  She surreptitiously kicks the tape under the
    car, over to the driver's side.

                             COP
              Go to Cedars.  It's closest.

    Mace nods and goes around the car.  Max starts asking them
    questions and the cops turn away, distracted.  She picks
    up the tape and gets in.  Closes the door.  Let's out a
    big breath.

    INT.  PARKING GARAGE/BONAVENTURE HOTEL - NIGHT

    A line of expensive cars waiting to valet park.  Tran's
    limo jumps the line and swoops up parallel to the elevator
    doors.  The posse get out, scowling at the valet who
    swallows his protest.  Tran emerges, helping Faith out
    with a firm grip on her arm which he does not release as
    they head for the elevators.

    They push through a group waiting for an elevator... men
    in tuxes, women in gowns and diamonds.  The elevator opens
    and Tran's entourage sweeps inside.  Beemer and Duncan
    block any civilians from entering.


    INT.  ELEVATOR

    They ride in silence a moment.  Faith is pale, her jaw
    clenching.  Tran has her arm in a tight grip.  There is a
    march-to-the-gallows feel about the moment.

                             FAITH
              Well, I'm certainly in the mood for
              a party.

                             TRAN
                      (to Wade)
              Take her up to the suite.
                      (to Faith)
              Have a glass of champagne... or
              six... I'll be up in a while to help
              you ring in the New Year.

                             FAITH
              I live for the moment.

    The elevator doors open, revealing...


    INT.  FOYER AND BALLROOM

    The heart of the MILLENNIUM L.A. New Year's ball.  A
    glitterati event in full swing.  Red carpet, minicam
    lights and paparazzi.  Limos pulling up outside four deep.
    Movie stars rubbing elbows with politicos, music movers
    and shakers chatting with city hall types.  This is a
    party to celebrate the millennium, sure, but its main
    function is to celebrate the celebrants: if you're here,
    there's no need to be anywhere else.  There is a heavy
    police presence, as well as lots of private security.

    Tran exits the elevator with Vita Minh, Joey Corto and
    Duncan.  They wedge through the crowd, Tran smiling.
    Nodding to people he knows.

    INT.  CECILE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

    Lenny is in a chair in the kitchen, listening to Max on
    the cellular.  He is holding a dish-towel full of ice
    cubes on his scalp.  It is soaked with blood and his
    Armani jacket and silk shirt are spattered.  Mace lifts
    the ice pack to check that the bleeding has stopped.

                             MACE
              You are a pussy-whipped sorry-ass
              motherfucker, you know that?

    She slaps the ice pack back down.

              Owww!!  Take it easy.

    shoulder, around the column.

    MAX'S POV: through a dense throng of glitterati we see
    Tran and his entourage seated at a table, holding court
    with music types and politicos.

                             MAX
              He's got her up in the room, under
              guard.  And he's still working the
              party... acting smooth like nothin's
              nothin'.  So buddy... I say we work
              a trade.

                             MAX
              Give him the tape.  See?  It's
              fucking brilliant!  The tape for
              Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I
              can set it up.

              2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her.

                             MAX (V.O.)
              I intend to.

    Lenny punches END.  Mace looks at the number written in
    blood on the white formica.  Her eyes ratchet up, boring
    into Lenny.  Not noticing, he gets up, still woozy, and
    staggers to his wardrobe bag across the room.

                             LENNY
              Okay, we gotta get over there.
                      (opens the bag)
              Can you borrow a dress from Cecile
              or something--

                             MACE
              I'm not going.

                             LENNY
              Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's
              gonna do her right there unless--

                             MACE
              Lenny... shutup.  Just park your
              mouth and listen.  It's a set-up.
              Think about it!  Why's he been
              sending you tapes?  To freak you,
              get you to rush in without thinking.
              Then they put one in you, put one in
              her, put the gun in your hand...
              crime of passion.  This guy's bent
              enough to think of that.

    Lenny nods, hearing what she is saying.

                             LENNY
              That sounds right.
                      (but it changes
                       nothing)
              I'm going.

    He reaches into his wardrobe bag... pulling out the box of
    "Faith" tapes and setting it aside, then pulling out the
    suit.  Mace's frustration explodes as anger.

    She grabs his shoebox full of tapes.  Holds them up to
    him.

                             MACE
              You gonna get yourself killed for
              this?  This toxic-waste bitch!

    She dumps the box of tapes on the floor.  She starts
    stomping on them with one heel, crunching several into
    junk.

                             LENNY
              What the fuck are you doing?!

    Lenny freaks out and scrambles to pick them up, trying to
    stop her, push her away.  They struggle for a pathetic,
    tragic moment.

    Mace snaps.  She grabs him by the lapels and swings him
    around, slamming him back against a wall.

                             MACE
              Lenny!  This is your life, Lenny!
              Right here.  Right now.  This is
              realtime... not playback.  Real...
              time.  Time to get real.  Understand
              what I'm saying... she doesn't love
              you.  Maybe she did once, I don't
              know, but she doesn't now.  These
              are used emotions.  It's time to
              trade them in.

    Mace's tone becomes more gentle.  We see that her outburst
    is, beneath it all, coming from a place of compassion.

                             MACE
              Lenny, memories were meant to fade.
              They're designed that way for a
              reason.

    Lenny seems to crumple.  He knows he has to let go.  But
    it is so painful.

                             LENNY
              Have you ever been in love with
              somebody who didn't return that
              love?

    Mace gives him a look like, jeez Lenny, are you dumb
    sometimes.

                             MACE
              Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.

                             LENNY
              It didn't stop you from loving them.
              Right?  Or understanding them, or
              being able to forgive them...

                             MACE
              I guess.

                             LENNY
              And it didn't stop you from wanting
              to protect them.  Did it?

                             MACE
              No.  It didn't.

    Lenny's eyes are brimming with tears.  He makes no attempt
    to hide it... doesn't brush them away.

                             LENNY
              I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent
              Crimes... and I saw every known
              depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In
              outer darkness.  Then I busted this
              strung-out little teeny-hooker.
              When I met Faith she was just
              another runaway giving twenty dollar
              blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost
              soul.

                             MACE
              You never told me.

                             LENNY
              But she was different.  There was a
              light in her eyes... and she had
              this voice.  It was scary, all that
              pain coming out of that little body.
              Like she could take all the hurt and
              rage of the entire world and lift it
              up to heaven in one voice.  I helped
              her.  And I promised her that I'd
              always be there... to protect her.
                      (long pause)
              See?  It's not about what's in her
              head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't
              let go of the promise.  It's...
              like... it's all I have left.

                             MACE
              No, it's not.

    Mace takes his face in her hands.  She kisses him lightly
    on the cheek, where the tear-track is.

                             MACE
              Come on, Lenny.  Let's go to a
              party.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  STREET AND BONAVENTURE HOTEL - NIGHT

    11:07  P.M.

    IT IS THE MOTHER OF ALL PARTIES.  IN AN AERIAL SHOT we see
    there must be 100,000 people jamming the closed streets of
    downtown L.A.  Arc lights sweep the sky.  There are two
    outdoor bandstands, with live music pounding.  There are
    lasers, strobe-lights.  People are literally dancing in
    the streets... if they can move at all.  Huge projection
    video screens are set up all over the place.

    LA is connected to other cities all over the world by
    satellite, sharing in the celebration in different time
    zones.  The excitement has been building all evening as
    midnight sweeps across the country toward the West Coast.
    It looks like a U2 concert 10 blocks long: a multimedia
    blow-out.

    Madness in the streets.  And Lenny and Mace are stuck in
    it.  The Civic can't move in the middle of this millennial
    Mardi Gras.  People swarm around, pounding on the Civic as
    they go by, or press their faces against the glass.  It
    may be the party of the century, but it looks like the
    middle of a third world revolution.

                             MACE
              That's it.  Let's bail.

    And she's out of the car, leaving the keys, ignoring the
    protesting horns behind her.  And we see that she's
    wearing a short black cocktail dress.  Lenny comes around
    the car, through the wild crowd.  He's in his other suit.
    Snappy.

    Mace unselfconsciously hikes up her dress and slips her
    .380 auto into a holster velcroed to her leg.  She pulls
    the dress down and you can't see the gun, hidden between
    her upper thighs.

    In fact, it looks like she couldn't be concealing a
    quarter anywhere on her body.  The dress is cut low at the
    top and high at the bottom, showing plenty of muscular
    legs.  High heels doing great things for her calves.  Her
    braids now loose and full, like a mane.

    Lenny glances at Mace and does a double take.  He is
    caught by a sudden realization:

                             LENNY
              Mace... you're a girl.

                             MACE
              Good, Lenny.  I can see why the
              detective gig didn't work out.  Come
              on.

    They push their way through the swirling mass of humanity.
    Mace moving like a wedge, security training coming to the
    fore.  The whole street is vacuum-packed with people.
    Filled with cars deserted in the general euphoria, an
    unparted Red Sea of man and machine.

    They will move through the various strata of society as
    they work their way in to the party's inner sanctum.  It
    is like all of LA, from poorest to richest, compressed
    into a few square blocks.  There are cops everywhere.
    Cops on motorcycles, cops in cars, cops in riot gear.

    Lenny scopes out the security at the front entrance...
    metal detectors, cops... plus you have to have a 500
    dollar-a-plate ticket.

                             LENNY
              Got your ticket?

                             MACE
              No.  They must have sent it to my
              beach house by mistake.

    Lenny motions toward the back of the hotel and Mace
    follows.  They pass a uniformed cop who is standing thirty
    feet away, his back to them.

    REVERSE ANGLE: It is SPREG.  His black eyes scan the
    crowd.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  HOTEL KITCHEN

    ON LENNY AND MACE moving with purpose through the vast
    steaming factory of the kitchen where a thousand dinners
    are being prepared.  They are ignored by the bustling
    staff.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  HOTEL BALLROOM

    Lenny and Mace emerge from a service door into the
    glitterati crowd, heading into the ballroom.

    They scan the room.

                             LENNY
              You see Tran?

                             MACE
              Uh unh.

    Lenny whips out his cellular and recalls Max's number.  He
    hears the phone connect.  It starts to ring.

    LENNY'S POV... as the crowd parts for a moment.  He sees
    PALMER STRICKLAND talking to a city-hall type.  Lenny
    turns away before Strickland sees him.

                             LENNY
                      (to the ringing
                       phone)
              Come on, Max.  Come on, buddy...
                      (two more rings)
              Damnit.

    He looks around now.  Starting to feel the creeping edge
    of panic.  No Tran.  No Max.

                             LENNY
              Alright.  We're going up.

                             MACE
              And do what?  Take on his whole
              posse?

                             LENNY
              I still got one ace to play.  Tran's
              got what I want... and I've got what
              he wants...

    Lenny pulls the Jeriko tape out of his breast-pocket and
    holds it up.  Mace just stares at him completely outraged.

                             MACE
              That's the original.  There are no
              copies.

                             LENNY
                      (not getting it)
              Exactly.  That's why it's a make-
              able deal.

    Mace gets very, very close to Lenny, and her voice drops
    to an odd, cold... lethal-sounding... growl.

                             MACE
              Look.  That tape is a lightning bolt
              from God.  It's worth more than you,
              more than me, more than Faith.  You
              understand?  It can change things.
              Things that need changing before we
              all go off the end of the road.  And
              you do not have the right to use it
              for currency.
                      (Lenny's eyes are
                       wide)
              You go... you go alone.  This is
              where I draw the line.  I care about
              you Lenny... a lot more than you
              know... which makes us both pretty
              stupid.  But you pawn that tape, you
              mean nothing to me.

    Lenny doesn't know what to say.  Tough choice.  He
    clenches his jaw...

    And turns away.  He strides into the crowd, heading for
    the lobby and the elevators.

    ON MACE, watching him go.  Wanting to run and stop him.
    But she's said what there is to say.  She turns away,
    desolate and churning with emotion.  The moment lengthens
    as she wrestles with it.  You see her fury, her sadness...
    and her protective instincts.  Her resolve fails her.
    Ultimately, she must protect him if she can.

                             MACE
              Ah, hell.  Lenny--

    She turns, running toward the lobby.  And...
    BOOM.  Slams into him.  He came back.

    Lenny takes her hand and puts the tape in her palm.
    Closes her fingers on it.

                             LENNY
              See that guy?
                      (pointing)
              The one with the ramrod up his ass.
              That's Strickland.

    Mace follows his look to Strickland, across the room.

                             LENNY
              Take it to him.

                             MACE
              A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!

                             LENNY
              No.  Trust me.

    He unclips his playback deck from his belt and hands it to
    her.

                             MACE
                      (nodding slowly)
              Oh boy.
                      (she takes a deep
                       breath)
              What if you're wrong?

                             LENNY
              Then we'll be right where we are
              now.

                             MACE
              Yeah, right.  Fucked.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  BONAVENTURE ELEVATOR

    It is a glass-cage scenic elevator, running up the outside
    of the building.  10th floor.  The last passengers step
    out.  When the doors whoosh closed and Lenny's left alone
    there's only the sound of Muzak Christmas carols.  The
    elevator rises, the lights of LA spread out below.  He is
    hyperventilating.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  HOTEL BALLROOM

    Mace threads her way past tables circling a dance floor
    full of dancers and makes her way through celebs air-
    kissing each other.

    But as she gets near Strickland's table, he stands up and
    excuses himself.  He starts toward the men's room.  And
    Mace follows him.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  MEN'S ROOM/HOTEL

    A few guys in tuxes tending to themselves.  Strickland
    enters, crossing to a urinal.  He unzips.

    Mace steps up beside him.  Guys behind her looking on,
    slack-jawed.  Mace pays no attention to them.  Strickland,
    stern and flinty-eyed, raises one eyebrow.

                             STRICKLAND
              Yes?

    She puts the playback deck on top of Strickland's urinal.
    He scowls.

                             MACE
              There's a tape in there you need to
              see.  I mean right now.

    While see is looking at Strickland, a young LAPD OFFICER
    comes out of a stall, and goes to the sink.  He glances in
    the mirror at Mace.

                             STRICKLAND
              If it wasn't New Year's Eve, I'd
              arrest you for possession of illegal
              equipment--

                             MACE
                      (interrupting)
              Just look at the tape!  You want to
              know who killed Jeriko One?  Go in
              the stall right now and hit Play.

    The young cop steps up behind her.

                             YOUNG COP
              Sir, is there a problem here?

    Mace turns.  Oh shit.  She backs away from them.

                             MACE
              Damn!  I knew it--

    Strickland motions with his eyes and the cop grabs for
    her.  Mace twists viciously out of his grip, knocks him
    down and vanishes out the door.

    STRICKLAND hefts the recorder, pondering it.  His
    expression is opaque.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  HALLWAY/BONAVENTURE HOTEL

    Lenny comes out of the elevator.  Standing at the corner,
    where he can watch the elevators and the corridor, is Wade
    Beemer.  Lenny doesn't break stride.  Just walks toward
    Beemer.  He's not afraid anymore.  He's pissed off.
    Beemer moves toward him.

                             LENNY
              Now, Wade, can we talk here, like
              two human beings--

    We think he's starting the usual negotiation.  But when he
    gets in range he lets fly with a line-drive right,
    straight into Beemer's face.  We're talking a John Wayne
    haymaker punch.  He staggers back, surprised and dazed,
    and Lenny knees him right in the gut as hard as he can.

    He drops to his knees, sucking wind.  Lenny draws his
    Glock and puts it behind Beemer's ear, pulling a pair of
    handcuffs off his belt.  Okay, we're starting to believe
    he might have been a cop once.

                             LENNY
              It's not personal.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  BALLROOM

    Mace, moving fast as she can through the crowd and past
    the tables when...

    ... she's grabbed by DUNCAN.  He gets her in a good tight
    come-along.  Like any good security person, the hold is
    not so obvious that the party around them is disrupted.
    VITA MINH steps up next to her, closing ranks.

    MACE IS WALKED around behind the bandstand.  Joey Corto
    walks up to her, looking mean and smug.

    Mace twists one hand free and snaps it out in a blur.  Her
    open palm breaks Corto's nose with an audible crunch.
    Corto screams and grabs his face.

                             CORTO
              Aw, not the fucking nose!!

    She slams her foot down on Duncan's instep and snaps her
    head back simultaneously in a reverse head-butt.  He keeps
    the hold.  Mace drives her free hand back into the
    approximate position of his nuts.  Even though Duncan
    looks like he bench-presses Buicks, this has the desired
    effect.

    Mace jerks away from him, shoving him back through a
    buffet table.  Vita draws a knife in a lightning move
    but...

    Suddenly Mace is standing there with her dress hiked up
    and her pistol straight-armed, with the muzzle right in
    her face.  Vita says the smartest line of the night.

                             VITA
              Hey, enjoy the party.

    Mace spins and sprints through dumbfounded glitterati, her
    gun innocuously tight to her side.  She spots a red "Exit"
    sign above a fire door and goes through.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  STAIRWELL AND PENTHOUSE/BONAVENTURE

    Lenny closes the stairwell door, giving us a quick glimpse
    of Beemer handcuffed to the steel railing.  Lenny moves
    down the empty corridor.

    He approaches suite 2203.  The door is ajar.  Always a bad
    sign.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

    Mace finds herself back in the millennium madness, among
    the street crowd who don't even notice her.  She holsters
    the gun and moves away from possible pursuit.  The sky
    explodes with purple light as huge fireworks go off
    overhead.  A crack like thunder follows.  Then more
    flashes.

    The countdown to midnight has begun.  The party is
    building to a crescendo.  It seems to have a surreal,
    nightmarish quality.  She passes a MIME in a clock suit,
    who keeps adjusting the hands closer to midnight.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  SUITE 2203

    As Lenny enters the suite.  It is very quiet.  Dark.

    Lenny's heart is pounding.  He moves through the luxurious
    suite, gun in the low-ready position.

    Lenny can barely breathe from the tension.  He notices
    that one balcony door is open.  The roar of the crowd
    comes in like the sound of surf from far below.  Fireworks
    explode across the sky, and the cheers sound like distant
    screams of slaughter.

    His feet crunch on broken glass... a shattered champagne
    bottle.  A lamp is knocked over.  He reaches the door to
    the bedroom and looks in.  The room is empty.  The bed is
    unmade, the bedspread and sheet pulled off.  This isn't
    right.  None of this is right.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  STREET PARTY/HOTEL

    Mace is scanning warily as she circles the hotel, looking
    for a way back in.  She turns and sees ENGELMAN in the
    crowd, not twenty feet from her.  He is looking right at
    her.  Not recognizing her for a moment.  Then... he
    realizes who she is.

    He starts toward her and Mace pushes people out of the
    way, breaking into a run.  Engelman charges after her,
    pulling out his rover to call Spreg.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  PENTHOUSE/BONAVENTURE

    Lenny looks back at the living room.  Suddenly he notices
    something on the coffee table.  It is an envelope, with
    NERO hand-printed on it.  He is drawn to it, hypnotically.
    He opens it...

    ... and with a nightmarish sense of destiny a SQUID TAPE
    falls out into his hand.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

    Now both Spreg and Engelman are stalking Mace through the
    crowd.  Spreg catches a glimpse of her running and he
    charges after her, like a bull, with his gun drawn.  He
    hammers through anybody that gets in his way.

    Mace kicks off her high heels and goes flat out, an Indian
    runner.

    Sprinting through the crowd, she sees an apparition ahead
    of her... a guy wearing Death's Head make-up and a black
    shroud, carrying a huge cardboard scythe in one hand and a
    doll (New Year's Baby) in the other.  Death watches her
    pass.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  PENTHOUSE/BONAVENTURE

    LENNY, moving as if he's in a trance, puts the trodes on
    his head.  TIGHT ON THE PLAY BUTTON as his finger punches
    down.

    IN POV we approach room 2203.  It is the familiar
    monochromatic vision of the killer.  Our hands open the
    door quietly with a keycard.  We enter the suite.

    Some of the lights are on.  We see Faith out on the
    balcony.  Watching the sea of madness below.  She comes
    back in, carrying an empty champagne glass.  She grabs a
    bottle off an end-table and up-ends it.  Empty.  She hurls
    it across the room, and it shatters against the wall.

    We approach her, standing with her back to us.  Closer.
    Only a few feet now.  She whips around, startled.  Gasping
    loudly.  But then... she recognizes the wearer.

                             FAITH
              Oh.  I didn't hear you come in.

    THE RECORDING STOPS, in a blast of static.  Lenny jerks at
    the discontinuity in the input, he is so keyed up.

    THE RECORDING RESTARTS: A new image resolves out of
    static.  Faith is pushed roughly down on the bed.  We
    climb onto the bed, straddling her, and she gasps.  We
    turn her onto her back.

    She has been blindfolded.  The Wearer goes SSSHHH.  A
    warning.  Like the hiss of a snake.  Our hands seize her
    wrists and handcuff them one by one to the iron frame at
    the head of the bed.

    The hands go out of sight and then reappear holding a set
    of trodes.  They are placed on her head... the spidery
    gecko-hand device almost disappearing in her black hair.

    LENNY'S guts have turned to water.  He is shaking his head
    in horror...

                             LENNY
              No, no, no...

    IN POV we see one of our hands come up holding the yellow
    plastic razor knife.  The blade clicks out to its full
    length.

    Our hands reach down and slowly slit her dress open,
    starting between her breasts and going down out of sight.
    She groans, squirming away from the cold knife.  The
    killer's hands open the material, exposing her white body,
    which in his peculiar vision is pure ivory.  The knife
    deftly cuts off her panties.

    We unbuckle our pants and reach for her, grasping her
    hips, pulling her to us.

    ON LENNY, gagging.  Overcome by revulsion and horror,
    mixing obscenely with the pleasure flooding into him from
    the tape.

    BACK TO POV as we pull our belt out of the belt loops of
    our pants and wrap it around Faith's neck.  Faith begins
    to pant in tiny rapid breaths.  We tighten the belt
    slowly.

    LENNY tears the trodes from his head.  He clutches his
    stomach, gasping for breath.  Carrying the playback deck,
    he staggers into the bedroom... to the bed.  He stares
    wildly around the room.

    One whole wall of the bedroom is mirrored.  In the mirror
    he spots a shape, on the floor beyond the bed.  It is
    covered in the bed sheet, but it is clearly a human form,
    propped up against the wall on the far side of the night
    stand.  He missed it in his earlier look from the bedroom
    door.

    Lenny moves around the bed and reaches down to the foot of
    the figure, grasping the edge of the sheet with a
    trembling hand.  With horrified apprehension he pulls on
    the sheet.

    It reveals the head and upper body of... Tran Vo.

    The last thing he expected.  Lenny leans close and sees
    that Tran is breathing shallowly, but his eyes are vacant.
    He looks like Tick did.

    Lenny sits on the bed and puts the trodes back on.  The
    fireworks and screaming outside sound like some
    nightmarish war, like the sound of the world coming to an
    end.  But all Lenny cares about is what's on the tape.  He
    hits PLAY.

    THE POV CONTINUES where it left off.  Faith's body lurches
    with the Wearer's thrusts.  His hand tightens the belt.

    Lenny feels the climax building.

    Faith's body shakes as the killer comes... she cries out
    herself, in pain... or is it?  The killers hand releases
    the belt.  We see Faith gasping for breath and moaning.

    Suddenly the POV whips sideways to the mirrored closet
    doors along one wall.  In the mirror is a reflection of
    the bed and on it Faith.  And on her...

    ... MAX.

    Pants down, her legs pulled up around him.  They are both
    gasping for breath, spent, following their shattering
    orgasms.  He runs his hands over her sweat-slick belly.

    LENNY is stunned beyond his power to imagine.  He does not
    have the strength or the will to stop the tape.

    IN POV Max's hands remove her blindfold.  She looks right
    at us, still gasping with the aftershocks of her pleasure.
    Max's hands undo the handcuffs, freeing her.  She reaches
    for us, her eyes glittering with sated lust.  We slump
    forward onto her, and her face fills the POV.

                             FAITH
              I love you.

    Lenny is reeling with these revelations.  His best friend
    is the killer.  And the woman he loved loves him.  But the
    tape is not over...

    THE POV CONTINUES as Max's eyes whip around in response to
    a sound behind them.  The bedroom door is opening.  Tran
    is standing there, stunned.  Maybe the first time he's
    ever been surprised in his life.  What a way to start.

    Like lightning we are off the bed snatching our .45 from
    the night stand and whipping around... putting the muzzle
    right in Tran's face.  We pull him roughly across the
    room, too stunned to resist.

                             TRAN
              You're going to die, you're both
              going to fucking die.

    We slam him back against the mirror wall and jam the
    muzzle of the gun right in his mouth: a deadly gag.  Using
    the gun we push him down until he is sitting on the floor
    with his back to the mirror.

    Our eyes whip to Faith.  She is freaking out.  We see
    Max's reflection in the mirror as he talks to her, talking
    fast.

                             MAX
              This piece of puke hired me to kill
              you, baby.  Do you believe that?
              Isn't that right, Tran?  You
              pinhead.

                             FAITH
              Oh my God.  I don't believe this is
              happening.

                             MAX
              Believe it.  Now bring me the
              trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.

                             FAITH
              What're you going to do?

    Still in a kind of stupor, she hands him the trodes.  Max
    puts the trodes on Tran's head, then pulls something out
    of his pocket.  It is a booster box.  He plugs it into the
    deck.  He takes the gain control and cranks it all the way
    up.  He's setting up a cook-off.  Tran's eyes go wide when
    he figures that out, starts to splutter.

                             FAITH
              You can't just... kill him.

                             MAX
              I'm not.  Just a little poach job.

                             FAITH
              Jesus.

                             MAX
              Hey, he was going to kill you.  And
              this ratfuck paid to have Iris
              killed, to save his own sorry ass.

    Tran freaks at that point but Max jams the gun deep into
    his throat, up to the trigger guard, choking off his
    words.

                             MAX
              You shut the fuck up, right now,
              I'm gonna pull this fuckin' trigger!

    K-BANG!  Faith shrieks, thinking Max shot him.  But it's
    just the start of the fireworks outside (remember all this
    has already happened relative to Lenny entering the
    suite).

                             MAX
              Look, baby, it's now of never... the
              guy is a known input junkie, so a
              little OD won't surprise anybody.
              It's the only way we can be
              together.  You know it's true.

                             FAITH
              My God.

    We don't know if her reaction is to the horror of what is
    about to happen, or to the realization that she has the
    capacity to let it happen.

                             MAX
              Here's how much I love you, baby.

    She stares, transfixed, as Max reaches for the deck.  He
    punches PLAY.  Max puts his hand over Tran's mouth to
    muffle his screams as the input hits his brain like a
    screaming chainsaw of static from Hell.  The screaming
    outside, the pandemonium, give the moment a special
    madness.

    The POV turns, looking out the window... staring fixedly
    at burst after burst of brilliant fireworks.  Like the
    fireworks inside Tran's head.

    THE TAPE ENDS.

    Lenny takes off the trodes.  He is wrung out, drenched
    with sweat.  We see that there is a figure standing in the
    doorway behind him.  Lenny turns, not surprised to see Max
    there with his .45 aimed at Lenny's chest.  Max's surgical
    gloves look incongruous with his tux.

                             MAX
              Don't make any assumptions about our
              friendship, Lenny.

    Lenny stands up, slowly.

                             LENNY
              No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know
              you were colorblind, Max.

                             MAX
              Only way I could stand your ties.

    Max moves up to him cautiously, and takes the Glock out of
    Lenny's waistband.

                             MAX
              I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.

                             LENNY
              Where's Faith?

                             MAX
              I sent her to the party.  I figured
              I'd wait up here until you killed
              Tran.

                             LENNY
              What makes you think I'm gonna kill
              Tran?

    Max looks out the window at the fireworks.  Waits for a
    flash, knowing that the bang will follow.  Keeping his own
    .45 on Lenny, he aims Lenny's Glock at the catatonic Tran.
    BLAM!  One right into Tran's forehead.  The crack of
    thunder from the fireworks masks the sound.

                             MAX
              You just did.

                             LENNY
              Jesus!

                             MAX
              You know, statistically that's the
              second most common word people say
              right before they die.  Shit being
              number one.

    Max sticks Lenny's Glock in his waistband, keeping his own
    .45 trained on Lenny.  Lenny knows the next bullet is for
    him.  He does what he does best... talk.

                             LENNY
              So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran
              in, being on his payroll, and shot
              me.

                             MAX
              That's pretty much the way it
              happened.

    CUT TO FAITH in the living room, moving silently up to the
    edge of the door frame.  She looks through the crack
    between the door and the jam.  Her POV: Max with the gun
    on Lenny.

                             LENNY
              Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering.
              I killed Iris too, didn't I?

                             MAX
              That's right.  They'll find the
              original of her snuff clip in your
              apartment.  The one I left for you
              at the club was a copy.

                             LENNY
              Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do
              Tick too?

                             MAX
              You bet.  Did you like it?

    Lenny drops the cutesy role.

                             LENNY
              So why Max... why d'ya have to do
              Iris?  She never hurt anybody.

    CU FAITH, reacting to this.

                             MAX
              Picture it... I feel like I gotta
              share this with somebody.  It's too
              perfect.

                             LENNY
              I won't say anything.

                             MAX
              I know.  So, I'm working for this
              puke, right?  And he says he'll pay
              me quite large to do the hooker.
              But also I gotta do his bitch
              girlfriend cause she knows the whole
              score and she's totally out of
              control.

    Lenny nods.  Starting to see it.

                             MAX
              Only he doesn't know about me and
              Faith.  So I say to myself, if I
              turn the job down, he just gets
              somebody else.  And I lose Faith...
              to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I
              do the skank.  I still gotta do
              something about Tran... I figure
              it's him or me... but I can't cap
              him without a chump to take the
              fall.  And who better than his
              girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a
              known criminal... who has been seen
              hassling them in public numerous
              times.

                             LENNY
              And who was, regrettably, also your
              best fucking friend.

                             MAX
              No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey,
              cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten
              minutes anyway.

                             LENNY
              You must be so pleased, I followed
              your jellybean trail right here,
              like a good little chump.

                             MAX
              You got froggy on me a couple times.

    CUT TO: The Underground Garage, where Tick has been
    cooked-off.  We see Max running his number on Mace and
    Lenny.  Lenny buying it.

                             MAX (V.O.)
              I thought that riff about the Death
              Squad was pretty good.  I hadda keep
              you from bringing the cops into it.

    AND BACK again to REAL TIME.

                             LENNY
              So there never was a death squad.

                             MAX
              Naawww.

                             LENNY
              Just those two loose-cannon cops
              running around covering their butts.

                             MAX
              Yeah.  Pretty zany, huh?  All this
              shit caused by a random traffic
              stop.  Hey... nothing means nothing.
              You know that.  Look around... the
              whole planet's in total chaos.  You
              gotta take what you can, while you
              can.  Cause some shitbird can come
              up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back
              a your head any second.

    CUT TO: A brief, violent flash from the Jeriko tape: Spreg
    shoots Jeriko.

                             LENNY
              How did you hook up with Faith?

                             MAX
              This dink hires me a month ago to
              eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows
              me from you, right, so she comes up
              to me and says, 'Hey Max why you
              following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you
              a drink and explain.' And she says...

                             FAITH
              'So, do you enjoy watching me?'

    Max turns and sees her in the doorway.

                             MAX
              You were supposed to go downstairs,
              baby.

                             FAITH
              I know.  I don't always do exactly
              what I'm told.
                      (she walks slowly
                       toward them)
              So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching
              me?'  And you said -- come on Max.

                             MAX
              I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for
              free.'

                             FAITH
              Uh huh.  And I said, 'That's good,
              because I like the feeling of
              someone watching me.  I acquired
              the taste from Lenny.'

    Lenny looks between Faith and Max, feeling like the
    asshole of the western world.  Faith moves up close to
    Max.  She puts her hands lightly on his shoulders,
    caressing them.  Max grins, realizing she is 100% with
    him.

                             MAX
                      (to Lenny)
              And then she said, 'Since we're
              going to be spending so much time
              together--'

                             FAITH
              'We might as well make the best of
              it.'

                             LENNY
                      (crushed)
              Jesus, Faith.

    Faith runs her hands appreciatively over Max's shoulders
    and arms.  Then, in an eyeblink, she grabs his forearm in
    both hands and deflects the gun.

                             FAITH
              Lenny!!

    Lenny jumps in, wrestling Max for the gun.  Faith pulls
    the Glock out of Max's waistband and throws it across the
    room.

                             MAX
              Fucking bitch!!

    BLAM!  BLAM!  Max fires wildly, trying to hit Lenny, who
    is just barely keeping the muzzle out of his face.  Faith
    grabs Max's hair, trying to pull him away...

    His "hair" comes off in her hands.  A prosthetic wig,
    containing the squid-net array.  Max's head is shaved to a
    Sinead O'Connor stubble.  He looks demonic, grimacing with
    effort as he struggles with Lenny.

    He continues firing.  The shots hit the mirrors.  ANGLES
    of the reflected images of them shattering.  Faith,
    screaming, reflected, her face fragmenting into shards.
    The crystal chandelier shatters, reigning glassy snow on
    them from above.

    Max is stronger and heavier than Lenny, but Lenny has one
    advantage: Max has managed to make him really angry.
    Lenny gives a guttural cry and drives Max backward into
    the doorframe.  They tumble together into the living room,
    falling together over the couch.  Lenny pounds Max's hand
    against the glass coffee table, shattering it.  He forces
    Max's hand along a glass edge, cutting it, and Max drops
    the gun.  Lenny reaches for it, but Max kicks it away a
    split-second before his hand touches it.  It skitters
    under the couch, out of play.

    Max punches Lenny brutally in the face, then in the gut,
    and grabs him with both hands.  He hurls him against the
    wall.  Lenny staggers off the wall into several vicious
    punches from Max.  We feel the tide turning.  Lenny goes
    down to one knee.

    Max pulls out his knife and flicks it open.  Lenny throws
    a lamp.  Max ducks and charges through.  Lenny spins away
    from the downthrust.

    The knife embeds itself in his shoulder blade, sunk into
    the bone.  Lenny punches Max in the throat and jerks away,
    pulling the knife handle out of Max's hand.  Max tackles
    him and they crash together through a sliding glass door
    onto the balcony.  Explosion of flying glass.

    Max pulls a dazed Lenny to his feet and rushes him
    backward toward the railing.  At the last instant, Lenny
    twists with all his strength and spins Max into the
    railing, using his weight against him.  He pushes hard and
    Max topples.

    As he is going over, Max grabs Lenny's tie, pulling him
    over.  Max is dangling 12 stories above the oblivious
    crowd, his entire weight hanging from Lenny's tie.  Lenny
    has one arm and one foot hooked around the railing, and he
    is being strangled by the tie.

    Lenny is starting to black out.  In agony he gropes with
    his free hand to his own shoulder blade, finding the
    handle of the knife.  He jerks it out of himself.  Max
    sees it coming a split second before it happens.

    Lenny slashes the knife across the tie, just above Max's
    hands.

    Max takes the express elevator to Hell.  He hits 12
    stories down, on top of a video truck.

    Lenny stands there panting, bleeding down the back of his
    jacket.  Faith runs to the railing and looks down.  All
    the strength goes out of her legs.  She sags to the floor.
    Fireworks continue to boom across the sky.

    Lenny looks down at her, gazing at the object of his
    quest.  She looks up at him, her wet eyes seemingly at the
    bottom of a deep well from which he cannot save her.

    He turns and walks away.  It's hard.  But he keeps
    walking.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

    DOWN BELOW, in the madness of the crowd, we move with
    Spreg as he searches for Mace.  He sees her from behind,
    walking near one of the stages.  He moves up behind her,
    aiming his pistol at the back of her head.  She turns
    and...

    ... it isn't Mace.  Another girl in a similar dress.
    Spreg curses and looks around.

    Engelman catches a glimpse of Mace running.  He points to
    her position and Spreg charges after her.  He has his
    baton laid back along his forearm and is clubbing people
    out of the way as he runs.

    Mace sprints barefoot through the crowd, pushing people
    out of her way.  Strobe-lights from the stage and flashes
    from the fireworks give the crowd a nightmarish look.

    Spreg fires at her.  People drop, their screams drowned
    out by the pandemonium.  The gunshots don't register above
    the concussions from the fireworks.  No one notices the
    shootings.  Spreg continues to fire, missing her as people
    block his shots.  Mace won't fire back in the crowd.

    ON SPREG, coming to a stop at the base of a lighting
    tower.  He has lost sight of her.  He starts to reload his
    pistol.  Mace comes up to him silently from behind the
    tower and hammer punches him behind the ear with the butt
    of her pistol.

    Spreg comes around with a roar, slamming the baton across
    her forearm.  Her .380 clatters to the ground.  Mace
    bodyslams him back against the steel tower, smashing her
    palm up under his chin.  His head raps off the metal.
    Mace is like a she-panther.  She rips the baton out of his
    hands and cracks him once across the windpipe.  He drops
    to his knees, gagging and unable to breathe.

    A shot hits the metal space-frame next to her head.  She
    spins to see Engelman, charging toward her.  Before he can
    fire again she drops behind the kneeling, gasping Spreg,
    using him as a human wall.  She clamps an arm around his
    neck, controlling him, and pulls his tazer from his belt.

    She shoots Engelman in the chest from 8 feet.  He
    convulses and drops instantly to the pavement, flopping
    like a fish.  She holds the current on him while she goes
    over and kicks his gun away.

    She takes Engelman's cuffs from his belt.  Spreg glares at
    her through the blood running into his eyes.  She raises
    the baton.

                             MACE
              All the way down!  RIGHT NOW!!

    He slowly drops to the pavement, face down.  Now that
    she's got them both proned out, she quickly handcuffs one
    of Spreg's hands to one of Engelman's.

    The crowd of partiers stares.  Can't believe what they're
    seeing.  Mace takes Spreg's cuffs and attaches his other
    wrist to the base of the tower.  That's when THREE LAPD
    COPS in riot gear burst through the surrounding crowd and
    see a black girl crouching over two of LA's finest with a
    police baton.  The cops advance toward her.

                             MACE
              Wait.  Let me tell you what's going
              on here--

    The nearest shoots her with a tazer.  She spasms and goes
    to her hands and knees.  One of the cops kicks her down.
    She cries out, trying to explain, but she can't get the
    breath as the batons start to fall.  The crowd around them
    watches fascinated, gasping.

    Mace sees another cop arrive and start to uncuff Spreg.

                             MACE
              NO!!  NO!!!

    They crack her with their batons, telling her to stay
    down.  Another one kicks her in the stomach.

    A BLACK KID in the crowd leaps onto one of the kicking
    cops.

    And then they come out of the crowd... one, then three,
    then half a dozen.  Just normal people... black, white,
    Latino people... that can't watch this happen any more.
    They jump the cops, swarming them, wrestling them down.
    It becomes a brawl.

    Then cops are running in from everywhere.  We see the
    trigger point of a full-scale riot.  Cops in full riot-
    gear, with Lexan shields, push the crowd back, clearing a
    space.  A helicopter XENON comes straight down from above,
    like the divine light of God.

    Mace hugs herself, at the center of it, unable to get up.
    Within seconds there are twenty cops there, and more on
    the way, forming a human wall.  They get the crowd settled
    down.

    Through the phalanx of riot cops comes Palmer Strickland
    and several ranking officers.  He surveys the scene.
    Strickland looks down at Mace and then at Spreg and
    Engelman, who are getting to their knees, though still
    handcuffed to each other and the steel tower.  The beat
    extends... Strickland unreadable, face stern as Moses.
    Then...

    He points at the two prone cops.

                             STRICKLAND
                      (to the nearest
                       officers)
              These two are under arrest for
              murder.

    Strickland looks Spreg in the eye and holds up Lenny's
    squid tape.  Spreg and Engelman react, knowing they are
    over.  The helicopter Xenon gives the whole moment an
    otherworldly quality.  Like they are in some celestial
    court of judgment.

                             STRICKLAND
              Get some medical attention for this
              woman.

    Lenny pushes through from behind Strickland.  He runs to
    Mace and kneels next to her.

                             LENNY
              Are you okay?

    A trickle of blood runs down her face.  She nods weakly
    and reaches for him.  They hug, then they both wince in
    pain.  Mace sees the cops running in to arrest Spreg and
    Engelman.  One of them unhooks Spreg from the tower.

                             MACE
              I got 'em, Lenny.

    ENGELMAN LUNGES, grabbing a gun from the holster of the
    closest cop.  He waves them back with it.  Then puts it in
    his mouth and fires.

    He topples against Spreg, spraying him with his spurting
    blood.  Spreg clutches him, lowering him to the ground,
    bathing in his blood.  You see him going insane, right at
    that moment.  His face is suddenly demonic.

    SPREG, the street-monster cop, RISES IN SLOW MOTION.  His
    glare is fixed on Lenny and Mace.  He has Engelman's gun
    in one blood-drenched hand.

    Lifting the dead weight of Engelman by the handcuff, he
    begins to drag the body, lurching toward Mace.  He keeps
    the pistol down along his side.  Spreg exists at the
    center of a circle of cops who don't know what to do.  He
    has a gun so they can't rush him.  But he's a cop, so they
    can't shoot him.  Several officers shout at him to drop
    the weapon.  You barely hear them over the pandemonium of
    the crowd, the helicopter, the fireworks.

                             LENNY
              SHOOT!

    Like a scene from a nightmare the blood-drenched Spreg,
    completely unhinged, lurches toward them.  Engelman's body
    slides over the ground, leaving a snail-track of blood a
    foot wide.

                             SPREG
              YOU FUCKING NIGGER BITCH!!

    He raises Engelman's pistol, points it at her and...

    Lenny throws himself across her, turning his back to take
    the fire, and...

    POW POW POW!  The LAPD executes Spreg in a hail of fire.
    He drops like a sack of cement.

    The smoke clears.  Lenny blinks... realizing he is alive.

    He faints.  Mace shakes him, thinking he is shot.  He
    opens his eyes.

                             LENNY
              Yeah, what?

    CUT TO SEVERAL MINUTES LATER.  Mace and Lenny are being
    escorted through the crowd by Strickland and a number of
    cops who part the rowdy mob before them.

    Lenny and Mace are both limping, bruised, cut up.  Lenny's
    arm is drenched with blood from his shoulder wound.  They
    support each other like two soldiers after a battle.

    Mace sees Faith... FAITH, escorted by a couple of cops,
    passing near them.  She is in handcuffs and her eyes are
    dull.  Mace turns back to Lenny...

                             MACE
              Are we under arrest?

                             LENNY
              Naw.  They just have to ask us a
              few questions... for about six
              hours.

    They pass DEATH, with the (plastic) BABY still in his
    arms.  Life out of Death in the endless continuum.  Lenny
    pushes the scythe out of the way so they can get past.

    They reach a row of police cars and an ambulance.  The EMT
    guys run to Lenny, helping him painfully out of his suit
    jacket.  Strickland motions Mace toward a waiting squad
    car.  Lenny sees...

    The CLOCK MIME, who smiles at him and puts his hands at
    midnight.  We hear a roar passing through the crowd.  A
    huge chanting and cheering, that becomes thunderous as
    everyone begins to shout the countdown to midnight.

                             CROWD
              TEN!  NINE!  EIGHT!...

    Lenny and Mace look around... the wonder of it sinking in.

                             CROWD
              SEVEN!  SIX!  FIVE!...

    Mace and Lenny let it wash over them... the deliverance
    from darkness.

                             CROWD
              FOUR!  THREE!  TWO!  ONE!  HAPPY NEW
              YEAR!

    The exultation of the moment flows through them as the
    people lift their voices in a great cheer.  Balloons are
    released, confetti and streamers fly in a blizzard.
    Couples grab each other and kiss passionately.

                             MACE
                      (grinning)
              Hey, Lenny.  We made it.

                             LENNY
              Yeah.  We did.

    She hugs him.  Then pulls back.  Friends... yes.  And
    always.  But there's that line that she can't cross.  Only
    he can do that.

                             MACE
              Well...
                      (she shrugs)
              Get going.  You're still bleeding.

                             LENNY
              See you downtown.

                             MACE
              Yeah.  See you there.

    TRACKING WITH LENNY as he walks toward the ambulance.
    They open the back door for him.  The walk is
    hallucinatory... with confetti falling like snow, and the
    hysteria of the crowd.  He looks back at Mace as the
    paramedics help him up into the ambulance.  The back doors
    close.

    ON MACE, watching him go.  A cop gently takes her arm,
    opening the squad car door for her.  She turns away, her
    face sad amid the exultation of the crowd.  She gets into
    the back seat.  The door slams.  Strickland gets in next
    to her.  The driver starts the car.  They start to move,
    and...

    There is pounding on the glass, startling her, and...
    The door is wrenched open...
    A hand comes in, grabbing her arm, pulling her out...

    Lenny.  His eyes are full of emotion.
    He grabs her in his arms, fiercely, and kisses her... like
    there's no tomorrow.  She grabs his head and won't let him
    break, even if he wanted to, which he doesn't.

    Strickland, in the car, rolls his eyes and looks at his
    watch.  Reflex.  Because if there's one time you don't
    need a watch, it's...

    12:01  A.M.  JANUARY 1, 2000

    PULL BACK AND UP as Lenny and Mace stay locked together,
    while the cops wait for them, and the world begins again.

                             THE END

                                               FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT
                                                   December 16, 2010


                         
          OVER BLACK WE HEAR THE DULL SOUNDS OF INDUSTRY; A MUFFLED
          MASS OF MACHINES, GEARS, STEAM. FADE IN ON:
                         
          A SIGN. Twelve feet across. Painted decades earlier, grim-
          covered black, white and red. It reads in large 40's era,
          hand-painted type, "SAFETY IS OUR PRIMARY CONCERN!" Then:
          "DAYS SINCE LAST ACCIDENT" and below that, NUMBERS, painted
          on hanging metal cards. Four possible digits can hang here,
          but there are currently three: "784."
                         
          SLOWLY PUSH IN on this sign as a MAN APPEARS, rising on a
          forklift, in a greasy, monochromatic work jumpsuit. Removes
          the "4" from its hooks. Then removes the "8." Then the "7."
                         
          Finally, he hangs up a number. "1."
                         
          The man LOWERS out of frame as we creep even closer to the
          hanging single digit, wondering about the accident... and how
          bad it was and the FACTORY SOUNDS GROW DEAFENING -- AND AS IT
          BUILDS TO A CRESCENDO, WE CUT TO SILENT BLACKNESS.

          Shiny black loafers. Black pants, three inches too long. We
          BOOM UP, stopping at a boy's hand reaching into the black
          suit jacket pocket. Pulls out a WOMAN'S GOLD NECKLACE with a
          LOCKET. He holds the locket. Rubs it gently with his thumb.
          CONTINUE TO BOOM UP. We now SEE THE BOY'S FACE.
                         
          This is JOE LAMB, 14. On the precarious edge of adulthood. He
          looks out at the horizon with stricken eyes.
                         
          He moves forward and we PAN, so we're BEHIND HIM NOW. In the
          frosty distance, past countless leafless trees and modest
          homes, is a STEEL MILL. Smokestacks and structures. The
          lifeblood of this late 70's town.

          Close on CHARLES' MOTHER AND FATHER, funeral attire. She
          looks out of the window sadly; heartsick and concerned.
          Behind her, he picks at his plate of food.
                         
                          CHARLES' MOTHER
           I'm so worried for that boy.

                          CHARLES' MOTHER
           But he was never really a
           father...I don't think he
           ever...understood Joe.
                         
                          CHARLES' FATHER

                          HIMSELF)

          CUT WIDE TO REVEAL that we are in a modest Ohio house in the
          year 1979. At a wake. Forty-odd friends and neighbors, darkly

          EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          A WIDE SHOT. A grey, snow-covered, early February day here in
          LILLIAN, OHIO. Many cars are parked outside the house,
          notably a SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SQUAD CAR in the driveway.
          Joe, a vision of black on white in his too-big black suit,
          now sits on a small swing set he hasn't used in years.
                         
          He solemnly looks down at the LOCKET he still holds. No doubt
          trying to reconcile the fact that it no longer hangs around
          his mother's neck. Then a SOUND. Joe looks up. A CAR has
          arrived -- a distinct 1968 BUICK GSX -- a YELLOW MUSCLE CAR
          with a BLACK RACING STRIPE down its center. Joe watches as
          the car sits there for a moment. Then a MAN gets out. Someone
          Joe has seen before, but doesn't know personally. A man in
          his early 40's, in jeans and a work shirt. He's not exactly
          sloppy, but if you look closely, you could tell he's been
          drinking. This is LOUIS DAINARD.
                         
          Joe watches Louis carefully as he moves to the house, to the
          porch and inside the house. Joe's eyes glued on the house for
          a while. Then he looks back to the locket. He OPENS IT, and
          stares at the picture inside (which we do not see). And as he
          stares, TEARS come to his eyes.
                         
          A moment broken by the SOUND OF RAISED VOICES -- Joe turns
          toward the house. After a beat, the SOUND of something
          BREAKING -- something glass. Then the house BACK DOOR bursts
          open -- Joe cranes his neck -- and what he sees he'll never
          forget: his father, Jack, leading an in-pain and HAND-CUFFED
          Louis Dainard from the house and into the rear of the squad
          car. When he slams the back door, he sees Joe. Sort of
          freezes as their eyes lock. But Jack's more uncomfortable
                         THAN COMFORTING:
                         
                          JACK
           I'll be home soon.
                         
          And Jack gets into the car and drives away. Joe watches them
          drive off. And after a beat, he looks down at the locket
          again. Mom's just gone. Finally he CLOSES IT -- and we hear
          an oddly LOUD SNAP and our SCREEN GOES BLACK.
                         
          Over darkness: APPLAUSE -- then a LONE VOICE: "I want you...
          to want me!" DRUMS kick in, CHEAP TRICK BLASTS. CUT TO:
           5.

          Hundreds of KIDS eagerly leave their last day of school for
          the year, winter a memory. GIRLS emphatically embrace each
          other good-bye. BOYS run off, just happy to be out. Lots of
          "Have a great summer!"
                         
          DOLLY WITH Joe, who walks through the crowd alone, backpack
          on shoulder.
                         
          Suddenly Charles is there, red-faced -- he hands Joe PAGES:

                          JOE
           I don't think that's what it is--
                         
                          CHARLES
           I've been working on this movie for
           months. I'm just trying to make it
           good.
                         
                          CARY
           (reading, disapproving)
           Hathaway's married now? Really?
                         
          Charles swipes the pages from critic Cary.
                         
                          JOE
           What was she reading?
                         
                          CHARLES
           ... what?
                         
                          JOE
           In the silent reading section, what
           was Alice reading?
                         
                          CHARLES
           Who gives a rat's ass what she was
           reading-- the festival deadline's
           in one week -- my movie's gotta be
           great!

          CHARLES' SUPER 8 MOVIE BEING PROJECTED ON A MOVIE SCREEN.
          SLOWLY PUSH IN ON THE SCREEN: kids earnestly playing adults:
                         
                         
          INT. BUILDING 47 - DAY (SUPER 8)
                         
          DARKNESS. Then a DOOR OPENS. It's DETECTIVE HATHAWAY (played
          by MARTIN), in silhouette. He enters. It's an old WAREHOUSE,
          dirty, cobwebbed, crowded with CRATES, old MACHINERY,
          CHEMICAL BARRELS and JUNK. The Detective turns on his
          FLASHLIGHT -- aims it -- sweeps it across the space -- the
          light HITTING THE LENS for a moment.
                         
          The Detective walks through the spooky, dark space. A low,
          growling industrial DRONE makes the whole place oddly creepy.
          Then: A SOUND -- quick but strange -- slithering -- and the
          Detective aims his flashlight -- tense. He watches. Waits. We
          see where he's aiming the light, which cuts through THICK
          DUST in the air. It's an old office door, ajar.
                         
          Hathaway is still. Nervous. Watching the door -- waiting for
          it to open... and then -- from the darkness BEHIND HIM -- a
          terrifying open-mouthed ZOMBIE APPEARS -- ATTACKS -- and the
          Detective TURNS -- his flashlight KNOCKED TO THE GROUND --
          and Hathaway falls too -- the wild-eyed gaping-mouthed Zombie
          DROOLING as it tries to bite Hathaway's flesh -- we recognize
          that the Zombie is CARY. Actually, not a bad performance. The
          Detective pulls out his GUN -- but the Zombie grabs his wrist
          -- they wrestle with the gun -- the Zombie wanting to rip
          into Hathaway's neck -- but Hathaway sees three SHARP-TIPPED
          NAILS sticking out of an old piece of WOODEN CRATE -- and
          after a significant struggle, Hathaway PUSHES THE ZOMBIE BACK
          so his head is IMPALED BY THE NAILS -- which we see ENTER HIS
          SKULL!!! The Zombie (stuck to the crate via the nails)
          SCREAMS AND DIES and just at Hathaway catches his breath THE
          IMAGE DIMS AND FREEZES; the projector has just been STOPPED.
          We are in:
                         
                         
          INT. CHARLES' ROOM - DAY
                         
          Board games, books, records, a stereo, toys, and magic. Super
          8 film equipment and paraphernalia. Movie ONE SHEETS hang:
          CARRIE, HALLOWEEN, EARTHQUAKE and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.
          No sports memorabilia. Charles turns on the lights, looks
          anxiously at Joe:
                         
                          JACK
           That was a good zombie murder.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Yeah, but it's not a st-- thank you
           for that-- it's not a story yet.

                          CHARLES (CONT'D)
           Older kids enter this film festival
           -- I'm competing with fifteen- and
           sixteen-year-olds, who have better
           stories and cars and production
           value, I've got nothing!
                         
           CHARLES' MOTHER (O.S.)
           Charles! Dinner!
                         
          As he tosses Joe a SUPER 8 FILMMAKER MAGAZINE:
                         
                          CHARLES
           I'm coming!
                          (TO JOE)
           There's a whole article in there
           about stories, you should read it,
           it explains everything.
                         
                          JOE
           (looks at magazine)
           I don't understand how the wife
           makes it a story--
                         
           CHARLES CHARLES' MOTHER (O.S.)
          Jesus, that's what I've been
          explaining: in the scene
          we're filming tonight, the
          wife telling the detecting
          she's scared for him, that
          she loves him-- Charles!
          -- I'M COMING!!!
          -- so when he investigates
          the zombie stuff you'll be
          scares -- you'll feel
          something -- because you
          don't want him to die because
          they love each other! Does
          that make sense?
                         
                          JOE (CONT'D)
           I just can't believe you talked to
           Alice Dainard.
                         
                          CHARLES
           You're impossible.
                         
           CHARLES' MOTHER (O.S.)
           CHARLES!
                         
                          CHARLES
           GOD, MOM! I'M COMING!
           (opens the door, whispers)
           Midnight. Okay? Don't forget.
           10.
                         
                         
                          JOE
           I won't forget.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Read this.
                         
          Joe just nods and looks at the magazine.
                         
                         
          INT. CHARLES' KITCHEN - DUSK
                         
          A hectic FAMILY: Charles' mother cooks. JEN, his smoking hot
          17-year-old sister, ANGRILY sets the table where his father
          pays bills. Pale 15-year-old sister PEG does a PUZZLE. Twin 9-
          YEAR-OLD BOYS bicker over an action figure. TV in the living
          room plays a MATCH GAME. Joe and Charles enter.
                         
                          JEN
           Mom, it's not fair that I can't go
           to Wendy's. Every single person is
           going except me!
                         
                          CHARLES' MOTHER
           Then every single person can tell
           you how it was --
                         
                          CHARLES' FATHER
           Move the puzzle, get the napkins.
                         
                          JEN
                          MOM---
                         
                          CHARLES' MOTHER
           It's your turn to babysit.
                         
                          JEN
           So...
                         
                          PEG
           Get off that thing.
                         
                          JEN
           Mom, why can't I switch with
           Charles?
                         
                          CHARLES
           Because you crushed Charles' top
           hat, you ever think of that?
                         
          Disgusted, Jen LOUDLY sets Charles' place as --
                         
                          JEN
           Oh, really, guess what? We're
           switching.
           11.
                         
                         
          Charles grabs a roll.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Guess what, no we're not.
                         
                          CHARLES' MOTHER
           Charles take these to the table!
           Benji, it's time for dinner. Hey,
                          JOE--
                         
                          JOE
           Goodnight, Mrs. Kaznyk--
                         
                          CHARLES' MOTHER
           Grab a seat, we have lots of food.
                         
                          JOE
           Oh no thanks, Ma'am, I'm okay.
           (to Charles, loaded)
           "See you tomorrow."
                         
                          CHARLES
           Later days.
                         
                          CHARLES' FATHER
           There's always a place for you
           here, you know that--
                         
                          JOE
           Oh, yessir. Thank you.
                         
          Joe leaves; Charles' parents share a look of pity for Joe.
                         
                         
          EXT. CHARLES' HOUSE - DUSK
                         
          An anomalous moment in this small steel town: the sun sets
          through the distant trees and it's beautiful, despite the
          distant belching SMOKESTACKS. Joe leaves Charles' house and
          CROSSES THE STREET to his own. SQUAD CAR in the driveway.
                         
                         
          INT. JOE'S HOUSE - DUSK
                         
          Joe comes into the kitchen through the BACK DOOR. Lucy the
          dog greets him. A TV is head somewhere. NIGHTLY NEWS reports
          on the ONGOING CLEAN-UP OF THREE MILE ISLAND. A half-empty
          BEER BOTTLE on the table. Joe peeks into the living room --
          but no one's there.
                         
          Joe looks around for his father. Heads down the hallway.
          Stops when he sees something off camera. We HOLD on Joe's
          face, sort of quietly stunned.
           12.
                         
                         
          And we se his POV: Jack, Joe's father, in uniform pants and T-
          shirt, sits on the edge of the bathtub, head in his hands,
          quietly CRYING.
                         
          Joe is stunned, staring at his dad. But he can't look away.
          And when he finally starts to head off, Jack looks up. Joe's
          mind scrambles for something to say, but Jack sniffles, gets
          it together, quick. Puts on a strong face.
                         
                          JACK
           Hey -- I'll be out in a minute--
                         
          Joe nods as Jack forces a smile and closes the bathroom door.
          HOLD ON JOE. Stunned and heartsick.
                         
                         
          INT. CAROL'S DINER - NIGHT
                         
          Commodores quietly sing "EASY" on the PA. Joe and his father,
          in civvies, sit beside each other at the counter. Jack eats a
          beef stew and reviews office paperwork, not looking at his
          son. Joe eats a grilled cheese, deeply lonely and not even
          knowing it.
                         
          Jack pulls out a PAMPHLET, and places it on the table:
                         
                          JACK
           It's a six-week program, hands-on
           training with college coaches.
                          (BEAT)
           You'll like it. I know I did.
                         
          Joe looks at the pamphlet for HEWITT SPORTS CAMP. Images of
          happy, smiling, healthy ATHLETIC KIDS. Not his thing.
                         
                          JOE
           I thought I was going to have the
           summer for myself--
                         
                          JACK
           Things have obviously changed for
           us. And it'd be good for you to
           spend some time with kids who don't
           run around with-- cameras and
                          MONSTER MAKE-UP--
                         
                          JOE
           I gotta help Charles finish his
           movie.
                         
                          JACK
           I have nothing against your
           friends. I like your friends.
                          (MORE)
           13.
                          JACK (CONT'D)
           Except Cary, who can't stop
           lighting things on fire. You'll
           like it there.
                          (FINALLY)
           It's what we both need.
                         
          Joe looks back at the pamphlet -- his other hand coming up
          from under the table -- and Jack sees that Joe is HOLDING HIS
          MOTHER'S LOCKET. Jack wants to cry again. He wants to throw
          that locket away, out of sight. But he just turns away.
                         
          Joe stares at the pamphlet. PUSH IN on the photo of beaming
          15-year-old KIDS. Then CUT TO THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME:
                         
                         
          INT. JOE'S ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          TIGHT ON QUASIMODO; a plastic, painted AURORA model. RACK
          FOCUS to the paintbrush that comes into frame -- FOLLOW IT TO
          JOE, holding the brush, at his desk, making a model. A boy's
          room recently devoid of a mother's oversight; a mess. COMIC
          BOOKS and other PLASTIC MODELS, all built and painted by Joe.
          CARS and CREATURES and a TRAIN. His bedside CLOCK RADIO
          (11:56 PM) quietly plays "BAKER STREET." Then a RADIO SQUAWK -
          - Joe grabs a KID'S WALKIE-TALKIE:
                         
           CHARLES (V.O.)
           Okay, it's time -- don't get
           caught, over.
                         
                          JOE
           I won't. Over.
                         
          Joe turns off the walkie -- and he grabs a small plastic
          FISHERMAN'S TACKLE BOX as we HEAR:
                         
           CHARLES (V.O.)
           Wanna hear something gross?
                         
           CARY (V.O.)
           I do.
                         
           MARTIN (V.O.)
           No please, if you're really asking.
                         
                         
          EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Midnight. Sitting on the curb with their GEAR and talking
          quietly, are Joe, Charles, Martin, Preston and Cary. Martin
          dressed in his detecting SUIT. Joe eats from a bag of
          Twizzlers.

           I sneezed so hard yesterday I shit
           my pants.
                          (THEY MOAN)
           I debated telling you.
                         
                          JOE
           Thanks.
                         
                          PRESTON
           That's called a "sharteeze" by the
           way.
                         
                          CHARLES CARY
          Well then I totally
          sharteezed in my pants. That's exactly what I'm
           talking about: the world is
           crazy, there's a name for
           everything...
                         
                          CHARLES
           Twizzler me.
                         
          Joe passes him a Twizzler.
                         
                          MARTIN
           So... people are turning into
           zombies because of the chemical

                          CHARLES
           Martin? I don't see how the guy
           playing Detective Hathaway can ask
           where the zombies are coming from.

           I told you, I don't like it when
           you call me that.

          All the boys look. Their faces BRIGHTEN. Headlights. The boys
          stand as the car STOPS beside them -- IT'S THE YELLOW BUICK
          WITH THE BLACK RACING STRIPE THAT PULLED UP TO JOE'S HOUSE
          DURING THE WAKE. But now, sitting in the driver's seat is 14-
          year-old ALICE DAINARD. She sees Joe.
                         
                          ALICE
           Joe Lamb?!
                         
                          JOE
           -- yeah?
                         
                          ALICE
           What the hell's he doing here?
                         
                          CHARLES
           Make-up, sound and special effects.
                         
                          ALICE
           He's the deputy's kid!
                         
                          CHARLES JOE
          -- what? (touch flattered)
           -- you knew that?
                         
                          ALICE (CONT'D)
           Charles, I don't have a license. I
           can't drive with him!
                         
                          CHARLES
           You want Joe to-- stay back? I--?
                         
                          ALICE
           It's too late! He's seeing me in
           this car right now.
                         
                          JOE
           You can trust me. My dad'll never
           know. I won't tell him anything.
                         
          Looking away, she's pissed. All the boys in silent wait. She
          considers, annoyed. Shakes her head. Finally:
                         
                          ALICE
           Get in.
                         
          The boys EXCITEDLY SCRAMBLE into the car.

          The Buick crosses the nighttime horizon, leaving the small
          town, driving through a rural landscape.

           You're driving very well. I'm
           impressed.
                         
                         
          INT. BUICK - NIGHT
                         
          Alice drives. The boys shoved in the back with the gear -- in
          front Charles struggles with his backpack and camera bags as
          he pulls out PAGES, arranging them. With her driving, there's
          an unusual, electric energy in the air. Joe eats his
          Twizzlers in the back, trying not to stare at Alice.
                         
                          CHARLES
           So I wrote a couple new lines, can
           I show you?

           What?
                         
                          MARTIN
           New lines? Charles-- what, I have
           new lines?
                         
                          CHARLES
           Shut up. There aren't a lot--
                         
                          ALICE
           I'm sorta trying to drive--
                         
                          CHARLES
           What would be great is: could you
           cry during the scene? Can you do
           that?

           ... no...?!
                         
          Cary messes with the radio. Alice moves his hand away.
                         
                          ALICE (CONT'D)
           Stop.

                          JOE
           (offering to Alice)
           Want one?
                         
          Alice looks at him in the rear view. Their eyes hold a beat.

                          MARTIN
           So I don't have any new lines,
           right? Because I just learned
           these.

           I have never been a passenger in a

           I'm unresolved as to how I feel

          The Buick WOOSHES PAST a solitary KELVIN GAS STATION. The car
          dips into the darkness, beneath a blanket of stars.

          The Buick pulls up to this small, EMPTY TRAIN STATION in the
          middle of, essentially, nowhere. A series of HANGING LIGHTS
          illuminates the TRAIN PLATFORM. There's a small office,
          currently closed. No one around.
                         
          The kids get out of the car.

           No. But you can pick up some stuff.
                         
          The boys carry many bags and the tripod.

           Get the lights and camera on that
           end, we'll shoot this direction
           first, like we talked about! Joe,
           get the mike plugged in-- make sure
           the new batteries are in the camera
           before you do the make-up!

           Okay.
                         
          Joe walks past Alive, who watches him. It strikes her that
          Joe is Charles' lackey.

                          CHARLES
           Martin, I have a new line for you.
                         
          He gets up to reveal Joe putting make-up on Alice. He walks
          over to Martin, Cary and Preston. Charles and Martin AD LIB.
                         
          TIGHT ON JOE'S TACKLE BOX, which opens. Inside is an
          assortment of MAKE-UPS, sponges, cotton balls, brushes, derma
          wax, spirit gum, and a large jar of FAKE BLOOD. Joe is
          preparing to make up Alice, who sits in front of him,
          watching carefully as Joe prepares BASE MAKE-UP on a sponge.
          He looks to her. A beat.
                         
                          JOE
           You mind?
                         
          Alice shakes her head: nope. Joe starts stippling the make-up
          onto her face. He is now, via sponge, touching the face of a
          girl he's admired for some time. After a beat:
                         
                          ALICE
           My dad works at the mill.
                         
          And she looks at him. Almost as if she were looking for
          something. Joe stops stippling. The tension is almost too
          much for him to bear.
                         
                          JOE
           Close you eyes. Please.
                         
          He indicates the sponge: it's for the make-up. She does. Joe
          starts applying the make-up to her eyelids. There's something
          provocative for Joe, being so close to Alice, with her eyes
          closed. Then, PRE-LAP:

          The lights (plugged into the car cigarette lighter) and
          camera (a EUMIG) are set. Alice has been made up, wears a
          coat with purse. Martin, in his tie, faces her. They both
          look over their script pages as Charles adjusts the camera.
           20.
                         
                         
          Joe, observing, holds the boom mike (a condenser mike taped
          to a broom handle), Preston wears an overcoat.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Alice: Mrs. Hathaway really doesn't
           want her husband to keep investiga--
                         
                          ALICE
           I know, we read it, we get it.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Okay, I'm just directing. Martin
           get on your mark. Martin, you're
           going to have to reassure her. Do
           you know what "reassure her" means?
                         
                          MARTIN
           Yeah, I think so.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Okay-- we're starting on Alice's
           side first-- Preston: a couple
           seconds after "action" walk to the
           pay phone, make it look like this
           place is busy--
                         
                          PRESTON
           I know what that looks like.
                         
          POP! Everyone JUMPS -- Charles turns -- Cary, laughing, has
          just exploded a firecracker:
                         
                          CHARLES
           Asshole, could you stop blowing
           shit up for two seconds and deal
           with the camera?
                         
                          CARY
           Sorry man.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Let's rehearse this -- save your
           real performances for when we're
           filming, though.
                         
          Martin and Alice put away their pages -- Cary gets behind the
          camera. Charles stands near the camera, kneeling to camera-
          height. Joe wears headphones and holds the boom over the
          actors' heads. Preston holds a suitcase, ready to walk.
                         
                          CHARLES (CONT'D)
           Ready? Here we go... action!
           21.
                         
                         
          Martin and Alice now perform as their characters, DETECTIVE
          JOHN HATHAWAY and MRS. REBECCA HATHAWAY:
                         
                          DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
           I'm going to stay here and
           investigate. I think it would be
           safer if you leave town.
                         
           MRS. HATHAWAY
           John. I don't like it. This case.
           These murders.
                         
                          DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
           What am I supposed to do, go to
           Michigan with you?
                         
          Preston walks past them, acting in the background.
                         
           MRS. HATHAWAY
           Mackinac Island's beautiful this
           time of year.
                         
          We're TIGHT ON JOE NOW, watching Alice. Slowly amazed at the
          unexpected depth and truth she brings to this role --
                         
                          DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
           Sweetheart. This is my job.
                         
           MRS. HATHAWAY
           The dead, coming back to life...? I
           think you're in danger--
                         
                          DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
           I have no choice--
                         
           MRS. HATHAWAY
           You do have a choice. We all do...
                         
          And holy shit, Alice actually starts to cry as she performs
          her lines. Not overdone, not hammy. Just fucking real.
                         
           MRS. HATHAWAY (CONT'D)
           John, I've never asked you to stop.
           I've never asked you to give up or
           walk away.
                         
          Charles watches -- in awe -- he's suddenly, giddily
          transported. But it's JOE who, as he stares, becomes
          galvanized; any vague interest in Alice has just set:
                         
           MRS. HATHAWAY (CONT'D)
           But I'm asking you now-- please.
           For me. Don't go back. Don't leave
           me.
                          (MORE)
           22.
           MRS. HATHAWAY (CONT'D)
           I need to know this isn't the last
           time I'll see you.
                          (BEAT)
           I just love you so much.
                         
          Martin is thrown by the passion and heart of her performance.
                         
                          DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
           ... I... I love you too...
                         
          And in the heat of it, Alice looks at Charles, unsure:
                         
                          ALICE
           Was that okay? Or... not really?
                         
          Charles is stunned -- almost crying -- can't talk -- and as
          he searches, behind him, a LIGHT --
                         
                          CHARLES
           -- uh, that was... I'm... that--
           yeah, good. Just like that.
                         
          Then a distant AIRHORN -- Charles looks: AN ONCOMING TRAIN.
          PUSH IN ON CHARLES, TIGHT. He turns to them all:
                         
                          CHARLES (CONT'D)
           PRODUCTION VALUE!!! Is there film
           in the camera?!
                         
                          CARY
           -- I didn't put it in--
                         
                          CHARLES
           PUT IT IN!!! PUT IT IN!!! Joe, get
           the mike ready. Go, go, Preston,
           get in position. Costume, costume.
           Martin, get that tripod set up.
           Joe, help her with her costume.
           Hurry, hurry! Go! I hope we don't
           miss the train. Preston, get in
           position! Martin, you know you
           lines, right?! IS THE FILM IN THE
           CAMERA YET?!
                         
          As Charles runs to Alice, takes her script pages.
                         
                          ALICE
           I love how calm he is.
                         
                          JOE
           Yeah, he's a very relaxed guy.
           23.
                         
                         
          Joe laughs a little as he goes -- Cary RIPS OPEN a YELLOW
          SUPER 8 box -- Joe grabs the mike -- Cary INSERTS the film:
          CLICK! Joe plugs in the mike, Charles grabs the camera:
                         
                          CHARLES
           Everyone ready...?! Be extra loud
           when the train passes by! Oh God, I
           hope it stops! You ready?!
                         
          They're set to film toward Alice, the approaching train in
          her background -- Charles puts on the headphones --
                         
                          CHARLES (CONT'D)
           And... ACTION!
                         
          And they're shooting:
                         
                          DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
           I'm going to stay here and
           investigate. I think it would be
           safer if you left town for a couple
           of days.
                         
           MRS. HATHAWAY
           John. I don't like it. This case.
           These murders.
                         
                          DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
           What am I supposed to do, go to
           Michigan with you?
                         
           MRS. HATHAWAY
           Mackinac Island's beautiful this
           time of year.
                         
                          DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
           Sweetheart. This is my job.
                         
          Charles watches, beaming with excitement. Joe holds the boom,
          looks to Charles to make sure it sounds okay; this is when he
          notices something in the distance. HEADLIGHTS. A quarter mile
          away, a vehicle drives along the horizon. A beat. But the
          train is APPROACHING -- GETTING LOUDER -- which makes Joe
          turn back toward the train -- the thing almost upon them --
          LOUDER AND LOUDER, so the actors begin to YELL over the
                         GROWING DIN:
                         
           MRS. HATHAWAY
           THE DEAD, COMING BACK TO LIFE?! I
           THINK YOU'RE IN DANGER!
                         
                          DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
           I HAVE NO CHOICE!!!
           24.
                         
                         
           MRS. HATHAWAY
           YOU DO HAVE A CHOICE! WE ALL DO!!!
           John, I've never asked you to stop.
           I've never asked you to give up or
           walk away.
                         
          Joe looks back at the headlights -- and sees something very
          odd: the distant vehicle TURNS ONTO THE TRACKS. PUSH IN ON
          JOE, unsettled -- as the train CROSSES THEM NOW -- Joe looks
          back toward Alice -- a BLAST OF AIR, shockingly LOUD!
                         
           MRS. HATHAWAY (CONT'D)
           But I'm asking you now-- please.
           For me. Don't go back. Don't leave
           me. I need to know this isn't the
           last time I'll see you.
                          (BEAT)
           I just love you so much.
                         
          Alice and Martin continue to yell their lines -- Charles is
          almost LAUGHING at how good this looks -- but Joe LOOKS
          DESPERATELY BACK toward the headlights -- the train LIGHTING
          UP THE OLD PICK-UP THAT IS ABOUT TO CRASH INTO THE TRAIN!
                         
                          DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
           I love you too!!
                         
          And Joe finally swings the mike down and YELLS:
                         
                          JOE CHARLES
          GUYS, WATCH OUT!!! Joe what the hell are y--?!
                         
          -- just then BA-BA-BA-BAM!!! THE TRAIN ENGINE, HUNDREDS OF
          YARDS AWAY, SLAMS INTO THE TRUCK -- THE KIDS GASP -- REACT --
          AS THE TRAIN ENGINE DERAILS!
                         
                          JOE
           Run!
                         
          THE TRAIN BEGINS TO CRASH -- ACCORDION -- THE KIDS SCREAM --
          RUN -- ENTIRE 50-TON CARS JACKNIFE AND CRASH UPWARD -- FLYING
          VERTICAL -- CHARLES' SUPER 8 CAMERA AND TRIPOD SLAM ONTO THE
          PLATFORM, LANDING SIDEWAYS, STILL FILMING as the CRASH WAVE
          APPROACHES AND PASSES THEM!
                         
          THE KIDS SCATTER, PRESTON AND MARTIN RUN ONE WAY. CHARLES,
          CARY AND JOE RUN ANOTHER. JOE STOPS AS ALICE RUNS AROUND THE
          BUILDING.
                         
                          JOE (CONT'D)
           Alice!
                         
                          CHARLES
           Joe, we have to go.
           25.
                         
                         
          They run off.
                         
                          CHARLES (CONT'D)
           I DON'T WANT TO DIE!!!
                         
          AS NEARBY CARS RIP OFF TRACKS, TUMBLE -- CARS FROM FATHER
          BACK JETTISON TOWARD THEM, SLAMMING INTO THE DEPOT,
          SHATTERING IT -- THE ENTIRE AREA IS DECIMATED IN AN INSTANT!
          And then --
                         
          IT'S OVER. Just the odd, dying CHUGS and SCREECH-SCREECH-
          SCREECH of TRAIN WHEELS running out of momentum, HISSES of
          STEAM, the unnatural bending of steel.
                         
          In the DUST, JOE lies frightened on the ground, eyes tightly
          shut. His mind races, his heart pounds -- and then: A LOUD
          METAL BANG! Joe stands up fast, faces a MOUNTAIN of twisted
          STEEL -- UPSIDE-DOWN TRAIN CARS PILED FRIGHTENINGLY around
          him. Just another few feet and he would've been crushed. But
          what was that sound? Something metal? Then again: SLAM! Joe
          BACKS UP, afraid -- it was almost a LABORED GROAN --
          MECHANICAL or ANIMAL?! A crazy SCREECH, another BANG, then
          AGAIN and AGAIN!!!
                         
          We see Joe TIGHTLY GRIPPING HIS NECKLACE LOCKET IN HIS HAND --
          THEN: CRASH! -- AWFUL-LOUD -- and a TWISTED TEN-FOOT SQUARE
          SHEET OF METAL EXPLODES FROM BEHIND THE OVERTURNED TRAIN CARS
          -- Joe covers his head as the metal STABS THE GROUND, twenty
          feet away: a TRAIN SLIDING DOOR. Joe turns to see it --
          stunned -- then back to the direction of the NOISE -- but it
          is GONE. Nothing.
                         
          TIGHT ON CHARLES' CAMERA -- on its side, FINISHING UP A
          CARTRIDGE OF FILM.
                         
           JOE (O.S.)
           Guys?!
                         
          Joe finds MARTIN, on his knees, THROWING UP -- Martin keeps
          throwing up, but pumps a THUMBS UP.
                         
                          JOE (CONT'D)
           Martin, are you okay?! Preston, is
           that you?
                         
                          PRESTON
           I'm okay! Though I think I'm having
           a heart attack! And I have a
           scrape!
                         
          Joe MOVES FORWARD -- up to camera -- behind him, Cary
          appears, smiling. This kid enjoyed the crash:
           26.

           Guys, did you see those explosions?
           That was awesome.
                         
                          JOE
           Has anyone seen Alice?!
                         
           CHARLES (O.S.)
           I'm alive! Is anyone dead?
                         
          Through the debris, steel and dust. Joe moves forward --
          Charles, shaken, eyes wide, appears through the thick dust --
                         
          Joe moves forward, looking at, under a train WHEEL
          ASSEMBLY... BLOOD. A PUDDLE OF BLOOD and Joe's heart sinks as
          he moves toward it -- another woman he loves, crushed?!
          Charles and Preston and Cary see the blood --
                         
           CHARLES (CONT'D) PRESTON
          -- oh God-- -- no -- nonono...
                         
          Martin, still sick, calls out:
                         
                          MARTIN CARY
          -- what? Guys, what is it? ... shit...
                         
          Joe moves closer to the blood -- heartsick -- on the verge of
          DEEP, REAL TEARS -- everything stops -- but then:
                         
           ALICE (O.S.)
           -- what's all that blood?
                         
          Joe WHIPS AROUND -- standing in the dusty mess is ALICE --
          shaken, but absolutely alive. Joe just BEAMS.
                         
                          ALICE (CONT'D)
           What's the blood? -- did someone
           get hurt--?
                         
          But JOE SUDDENLY KNOWS -- he moves to the blood -- reaches
          below the wheels -- the others watch, freaked out --
                         
           KIDS (AD LIB)
           Joe, wait -- maybe you shouldn't
           touch -- what are you-- careful!
                         
          Joe pulls out his CRUSHED MAKE-UP KIT. He brightens:
                         
                          JOE
           It's my fake blood. It's fake!
                         
                          CHARLES
           What is this stuff?
           27.
                         
                         
          ALICE NOTICES THAT HE'S HOLDING THE NECKLACE. Joe notices
          this and POCKETS IT self-consciously. PRESTON calls out:
                         
                          PRESTON
           Guys, what are these things?
                         
          Joe looks -- they all move to Preston (except Cary, who heads
          off): CRATES have spilled from a nearby split car; many
          shattered, revealing THOUSANDS OF SMALL WHITE-METAL CUBES
          which now litter the ground. Joe kneels, picks one up:
                         
                          MARTIN
           Hey, don't touch it, what are you
           doing?
                         
                          CHARLES
           They look like white Rubik's cubes
           or something. They're heavy like
           metal or something. There's like a
           billion of them.
                         
          It's just a few inches per side, an UNUSUAL DESIGN. Behind
          them, having walked up the ANGLED SIDES of overturned train
          cars, Cary calls out:
                         
                          CARY
           Guys, get up here. You can see
           everything from up here.
                         
          They move up the mass of metal, revealing a VAST VIEW OF THE
          WRECK. It seems to stretch on forever. It is SOBERING.
                         
                          CHARLES CARY
          Oh my God. ... Look at that...
                         
                          PRESTON
           According to my Uncle Seth, an
           accident like this is exceptionally
           rare.
                         
                          JOE
           It wasn't an accident.
           (turns away, eyes on the
                          FIELD)
           There was a truck. On the tracks.
                         
                          CHARLES
           What? Driving on the tracks?
                         
          Joe's seen it. He points. Chilled.
                         
                          JOE
           There.
           28.
                         
                         
          Thrown fifty yards from the main wreckage is THE PICK-UP
          TRUCK. SHEARED IN HALF UPON IMPACT and lying in the overgrown
          grass.
                         
                          MARTIN
           How can a pick-up truck derail a
           train? That's impossible.
                         
                          PRESTON
           Obviously it isn't.
                         
          BOOM UP from behind the SHATTERED PICK-UP as the kids
          approach from the wreckage. PUSH IN ON THEM as they arrive at
          the truck and STOP; what they see makes Joe's heart pound --
          they're stunned -- all of them. They just stop. Finally:

           ... holy shit...

          WE SEE NOW: it's DR. WOODWARD -- 75, seat-belted, bloody and
          unconscious, stuck inside the crushed wreckage. Alice moves
          closer -- scared and sad for him --
                         
                          ALICE

           your Electronic Football?

                          PRESTON
           That trailer Woodward keeps in the
           school parking lot.
                         
          Joe moves next to Alice, who reaches out and gently NUDGES
          him -- you keep expecting him to suddenly grab her --
                         
                          ALICE
           ... Dr. Woodward?
                         
          But he's apparently dead; when she nudges him, he LEANS, his
          arm drops limp from the steering wheel, where he was HOLDING
          A PAPER, that has now fallen onto the ground. Joe picks it
          up. UNFOLDS IT: it's an OLD MAP -- thin, off-white paper.
          They hold it up, the map now backlit and obscuring Woodward.
          We see MARKER WRITING ON IT -- a BLACK LINE, from Nevada to
          Dayton -- and NUMBERS written along the way.

           It's a schedule for the train.
                         
          But a SHADOW has appeared: A TREMBLING HAND -- before they
          can react, it RIPS THE MAP AWAY -- THEY ALL SCREAM AS OLD DR.
          WOODWARD IS REVEALED, BLOODY EYES OPEN, in a DAZE:
                         
           DR. WOODWARD
           -- who-- who are you?
           30.
                         
                         
          They're all speechless for a moment. Finally, too loudly:
                         
                          CHARLES
           Dr. Woodward! It's Charles Kaznyk!
           From fourth period! You've been in
           an accident!
                         
          BUT WOODWARD HAS REACHED INTO HIS JACKET AND PULLED OUT A GUN
          -- THE KIDS JUMP BACK, STUNNED --
                         
           DR. WOODWARD
           They will kill you. Do not speak of
           this -- or you -- and your parents -
           - will die.
                         
          We're on Joe's stunned face -- but DISTANT VOICES make him
          turn his head: hundreds of yards away, through the wreck,
          FIGURES WITH FLASHLIGHTS APPROACH FAST --
                         
                          JOE

          Now they're SPRINTING -- FLASHLIGHT MEN getting closer.
                         
          Charles arrives on the platform, grabs his camera.
                         
          Alice hurries past, hunting for her keys in that big purse --
          she eyes the FLASHLIGHT MEN getting closer:
                         
                          ALICE
           MOVE YOUR ASS, WE GOTTA GO!!!
                         
          Joe grabs his make-up kit -- another duffel -- runs for the
          car, past a whining Charles.
                         
                          JOE

          As the FLASHLIGHT MEN APPROACH, Joe runs and gets in the
          front seat, the other boys in back -- Alice SLAMS the car
          into REVERSE, SCREECH-BACKS UP, narrowly avoids debris, then
          RIDES OFF -- the FLASHLIGHT MEN arrive -- SOLDIERS -- their
          adrenaline pumping. One man who WALKS UP TO THE CAMERA,
          eyeing the vanishing car with intense suspicion: COLONEL
          NELEC. He then looks to the ground in front of him.
                         
          CLOSE ON A FRESH, EMPTY YELLOW SUPER 8 FILM BOX. Nelec steps
          to it, picks it up. Looks at it. Then back up at the

           "You'll die, your parents will
           die," guys, that is not good
           information.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Great, the focus ring just fell
           off!
                         
                          CARY
           No one cares about your CAMERA!
                         
                          MARTIN
           Am I the only one shaking?! I'm
           also crying --
                         
                          ALICE
           We can't tell anyone we were there -
           - we can't say a thing about it --
           my dad cannot find out I took his
           car, do you guys hear me?!
                         
                          JOE
           It's okay-- no one's saying
           anything. None of us.
           (to his friends)
           Guys -- we're not gonna say
           anything -- are we?!
                         
          The boys all muster, "no's." Joe turns sweetly to Alice.
                         
                          JOE (CONT'D)
           See? No one's gonna know.
                         
          Alice nods; if not quite relieved, at least grateful for Joe.
          But they all stare off for a long beat... haunted.
                         
                         
          EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
                         
          The Buick SPEEDS AWAY...
           33.
                         
                         
          EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          CRANE DOWN as the Buick pulls up. The dusty boys pile out.
          They all kind of look at each other. What a night. Charles,
          who looks at Joe for a beat, holds up his defunct camera on
          the tripod. Joe nods.
                         
          Alice finds something on the passenger seat and holds it out.
                         
                          ALICE
           Joe, this is yours.
                         
          Joe goes to the window. Alice holds it out: THE CUBE. He
          takes it with:
                         
                          JOE
           -- oh, thanks,
                         
                          ALICE
           I should never have done this.
                         
          She just drives away. Left there are Joe, Charles, Preston,
          Cary and Martin. They all kind of look at Alice go.
                         
                         
          INT. JOE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Joe in the bath. The quiet SWISH of water as Joe holds the
          CUBIC OBJECT. He relives the night: he mouths explosions.
          Remembers the fear... then he smiles.
                         
                         
          INT. JOE'S BEDROOM - MORNING
                         
          Joe is STARTLED AWAKE as if from a nightmare; Jack has awoken
          him, quickly bucking his holster, urgent:
                         
                          JACK JOE
          Gotta head in early -- -- okay--
          Make sure you let Lucy out. -- I will --
                         
          Pull back WIDE to see Joe's room -- while in the FOREGROUND
          is his desk, crowded with stuff. In focus, however, is the
          CUBED OBJECT he took from the crash site. As the shot
          progresses, you may notice that THE CUBE HAS CHANGED SHAPE;
          THE VOLUME IS THE SAME, BUT THE CORNERS HAVE EXTENDED.
                         
                          JACK JOE
          You gonna -- what, you with
          Charles today? Yeah, I'll be with Charles--
          Make sure you get the yard. -- okay, I will.
                         
          Jack heads off.

          Joe hurries across the street.
                         
                         
          INT. CHARLES' HOUSE - MORNING
                         
          Typical Kaznyk bustle: Father busily packs sack lunches. Hot
          Jen eats cereal, reads a magazine. One Twin plays HANDBALL
          loudly against a wall. Peg keeps walking through the scene
          with clothes. Mother cooks, says to the other twin (in grimy
                         SHORTS):
                         
                          JEN
           Mom, come on!
                         
                          CHARLES' MOTHER
           No. You're not wearing that. No one
           in this house is wearing that.
                         
                          JEN
           Compared to Debbie's these are
           long.
                         
                          CHARLES' FATHER
           Just listen to your mother.
                         
                          JEN
           I can't wear these or go to Wendy's
           party? This is not fair.
                         
                          CHARLES' MOTHER
           Jennifer Anne, not fair is Africa.
                         
                          JEN
           Mom's racist.
                         
                          PEG
           Are there anymore English muffins?
                         
                          CHARLES' MOTHER
           I don't know, go check.
                         
                          CHARLES' FATHER
           Peg, tell the twins to stop.
                         
                          PEG
           They don't listen to me.

                          CHARLES' FATHER
           Hi, Joe.
                         
          It all continues as Joe has entered from the front door.
                         
                          JOE
           Morning, Mr. Kaznyk--
                         
                          CHARLES' MOTHER
           Hi, Joe. Did you hear about the
           train accident?
                         
                          JOE
           Uh... no.
                         
                          CHARLES' MOTHER
           It's on the news.
                         
          Joe is moving toward the living room, where Charles sits on
          the sofa, eyes glued to the TV, A TRAIN CRASH BEING REPORTED
          ON THE LOCAL NEWS; HELICOPTER SHOT of the wreck. The CHYRON
          READS, "TRAIN DERAILED - AIR FORCE AIDS CLEAN UP." Joe sits
          beside Charles. They both watch, stunned, as a PHOTO OF DR.
          WOODWARD appears on the TV, with the heading "DRIVER OF TRUCK
          CRITICALLY INJURED, BEING TREATED." WHISPERED:
                         
                          CHARLES
           Can you believe this?
                         
                          JOE
           No.
                         
                          CHARLES
           It's on the news. That means it's
           real.
                         
           NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)
           Meanwhile, local science teacher
           Thomas Woodward is still being
           treated by Air Force medical
           personnel after last night's train
           derailment. Woodward apparently
           fell asleep at the wheel of his
           pick-up truck, which was hit by the
           speeding train at approximately one
           AM. Eighty-two train cars were
           thrown from the tracks in the
           derailment, the largest such
           accident in Ohio's history. The
           condition of Woodward, who has
           taught at Lillian Middle School for
           the past six years, remains
           unknown.
           36.
                         
                         
          Both stare at the train crash, stunned. Finally, quietly:
                         
                          JOE
           ... Looks like a disaster movie,
           doesn't it...?
                         
          And we PUSH IN ON CHARLES, going from depressed and lost to
                         INSPIRED:
                         
                          CHARLES
                          (WHISPERS)
           ... oh my God, Joe... that's
                          AWESOME--
                         
                          JOE
           -- what?
                         
                          CHARLES
           We can use this -- we can film it --
                         
                          JOE
           (starts to smile)
           -- you wanna go back?!
                         
                          CHARLES JOE
           (turns to him) --okay--
          Holy shit, that's mint.
          You're a total brain--! We
          gotta get the camera fixed
          and the film developed from
          last night-- I gotta go steal
          some more money from my mom!
                         
                         
          EXT. LILLIAN, OHIO - BRIDGE - MORNING
                         
          Joe and Charles ride their bikes into town, across a BRIDGE,
          the massive STEEL MILL in the background --
                         
                          CHARLES
           If any of the footage from last
           night is usable, that means we need
           Alice to play the wife again.
                         
                          JOE
           Yeah, I thought she was good.
                         
                          CHARLES
           She was mint, but she's never gonna
           do it.
                         
                          JOE
           I think she will.
           37.
                         
                         
                          CHARLES
           There's no way. You heard what she
           said.
                         
                          JOE
           But that was before the new pages,
           right?
                         
                          CHARLES
           You honestly think she cares about
           the scenes?

          TILT DOWN from the town's WATER TOWER -- Joe and Charles ride
          their bikes underneath it, crossing Main Street -- two large
          MILITARY TRUCKS drive past, we may note the Airman in the
          passenger seat SCANS THE AREA with a handheld device.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Man, did you hear what she said
           last night? "I never should have
           done this!" Dude, she was totally
           wigged!
                         
                          JOE
           Yes, she was, we all were.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Did you see her face?
                         
                          JOE
           Yeah, I saw her face.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Man, what's wrong with you?
                         
                          JOE
           Nothing. I think she's going to do
           it.
                         
          They park their bikes outside OLSEN CAMERA AND HI-FI.

           Alice-- hi, it's Joe. Lamb.
                         
          As Charles opens the camera, pulls out the film:
                         
           ALICE (V.O.)
           Hi...
                         
                          JOE
           So we have some new scenes. For the
           movie. We were hoping you'd be in
           `em.
                         
           ALICE (V.O.)
           Oh-- no. No, I'm done with that.
                         
          Joe twirls a hanging Kodak "RELIVE THE MEMORIES" SUPER 8 film
          PROMOTIONAL SIGN, speaking in a soft voice:
                         
                          JOE
           Really? `Cause these are really
           good scenes.
                         
          Charles hands the film cartridge to Donny.
                         
                          CHARLES
           We need this developed as soon as
           possible -- can you do overnight?
           39.
                         
                         
                          DONNY
           Asshole, no one can do overnight.
           You wanna buy some pot?
                         
          Charles reacts; he's never smoked anything.
                         
                          CHARLES
           ... no, thank you.
                         
                          DONNY
           You guys are weak.
                         
           ALICE (V.O.)
           I'm watching the crash on the news.
                         
                          JOE
           Yeah, I know, I saw it.
                          (CONCERNED)
           Are you okay?
                         
                          CHARLES
           Well, what's the fastest you can
           do?
                         
                          DONNY
           I can make it a rush, you get the
           film back in three days-- what's
           your sister up to? The hot one, not
           the other one.
                         
                          CHARLES
           I don't know.
                         
           ALICE (V.O.)
           I should go.
                         
           JOE ALICE (V.O.)
          -- wait, hold on -- lemme
          come over and show you the
          pages, okay? I'll be right
          there. No, d--
                         
                         
          EXT. ALICE'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Lower-lower-middle class house, set against woods. Joe with
          Alice at her front door. She seems unnerved:
                         
                          ALICE
           I don't care what Charles wants-- I
           said no on the phone.
           40.
                         
                         
                          JOE
           You totally did, that's true, I
           know, but--
                         
                          ALICE
           And now you're at my house.
                         
                          JOE
           I am, which-- under normal
           conditions I would nev--
                         
                          ALICE
           It's too weird after last night-- I
           don't understand how you guys can
           keep working on your stupid movie,
           I really don't.
                         
                          JOE
           We have to-- while the crash is
           still there.
           (waits, anxious, then,
                          VERY SOFTLY:)
           ... please...?
                         
                          ALICE
           (she considers, then:)
           No.
                         
          But Alice's eyes have flicked to the Buick, pulling up.
                         
                          ALICE (CONT'D)
           You should go.
                         
          Joe watches Louis get out of the car -- the man who got
          arrested at his mother's wake -- carrying a small grocery
          bag. He sees Joe and darkens as he approaches:
                         
                          LOUIS
           What's this?
                         
                          ALICE
           He was just inviting me to a party.
                         
          Joe steps back as Louis arrives; Louis seems to hate Joe, but
          at the same time, can barely look at him:
                         
                          LOUIS
           She's not going to your party.
                         
                          JOE
           Yessir.
                         
          Louis throws Alice a dark, resentful glare.
           41.
                         
                         
                          LOUIS
           You know better than this.
                         
          She nods, uncomfortable. Louis turns to Joe:
                         
                          LOUIS (CONT'D)
           You get outta her. You go home and
           don't come back, I don't wanna see
           you.
                         
          Louis goes back inside. Alice follows, turns to Joe. As
          awkward moment between them. Then, quietly, conflicted:
                         
                          ALIE
           I'll do it.
                         
                          JOE
           -- what?
                         
          She closes the door. Alone, despite it all, Joe is happy. Off
          his smile, we HEAR LOUD POPS: BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM!
                         
                         
          EXT. HILLTOP - DAY
                         
          Martin -- as Detective Hathaway -- FIRES A GUN -- shooting
          CARY, dressed in a dirty suit, as a man TURNING INTO A ZOMBIE
          -- his eyes WIDE AND GLOSSY WHITE -- and as he is HIT BY THE
          BULLETS, he SLAMS HIS HAND ONTO HIS CHEST -- BLOOD BURSTS ALL
          OVER HIM and he FALLS PAINFULLY TO THE GROUND. We then find
          CHARLES, behind his camera, yelling out:
                         
                          CHARLES
           CUT! That was mint! So good! And it
           looked huge with the train! Wow!
           Joe: go reload the cap gun!
                         
                          JOE
                          OKAY --
                         
          WIDE SHOT, rising PAST SIX BICYCLES, thrown to the ground in
          a typical kid jumble. Charles, Joe and Preston, with Joe's
          dad's KODAK CAMERA on tripod, have been filming, their gear
          scattered. KEEP MOVING OVER THEM, to Martin and Alice, who
          were on camera. Beyond them, in the valley, the TRAIN CRASH
          seems to go forever. MILITARY TRUCKS, TENTS and SOLDIERS.
          HELICOPTERS buzz in the distant sky. Joe moves over to Alice,
          who looks out at the crash. During all this:
                         
                          CHARLES
           We'll get the other direction next -
           - Alice, that was mint-- Martin, go
           a little faster next time.
           42.
                         
                         
                          MARTIN
           I'll try, but I'm still crying
           about last night, I feel like I'm
           crazy.
                         
          Cary sits, pulls off the CUT-OUT PING PONG BALLS that were
          covering his closed eyes.
                         
                          CARY
           Did it really look good? My death?
                         
          CLOSE ON JOE as he arrives beside Alice, who looks out at the
          train, haunted. Quiet:
                         
                          ALICE
           ... what do you think happened...?
                         
          Joe stops reloading the gun, looks out, gets lost as well.
                         
                          JOE
           You mean why he crashed the train?
                         
                          ALICE
           I just got a horrible feeling.
                         
          Martin has arrives there too. Preston too:
                         
                          MARTIN
           Anyone else still shaking from the
           crash?
                         
                          PRESTON
           I got in my parents' bed last
           night. Haven't done that since I
           was eleven.
                         
          Joe suddenly WALKS AWAY FROM THEM, back toward the camera.
                         
                          PRESTON (CONT'D)
           ... did I just insult him?
                         
          Joe grabs the camera, near Charles:
                         
                          CHARLES
           -- dude, what are you doing?
                         
          Joe moves the camera back to Alice -- he looks through the
          lens -- uses the ZOOM -- and WE SEE JOE'S POV -- the CRASH,
          ZOOMED IN -- he PANS from ONE CAR TO ANOTHER.
                         
          Alice watches Joe, who peers into the camera for a long beat,
          finally standing up, looking out at the crash:
           43.
                         
                         
                          JOE
           That whole thing's an Air Force
           train.
                         
                          ALICE
           -- what?
                         
                         
          INT. DINER - DAY
                         
          The kids sit at a table at the window. The CAR LOT is across
          the street. They're talking excitedly but quietly:
                         
                          JOE
           I make models-- plastic ones-- you
           know, glue `em, paint `em--
                         
                          PRESTON
           And he's not embarrassed by that.

           Looks who's talking, Math Camp.
                         
          A WAITRESS is there, delivering more FOOD --
                         
                          CHARLES
           Thanks, could I have a coffee,

          EXT. CRASH SITE - DAY
                         
          The massive train wreck that goes on for a mile. Hundreds of
          MILITARY work to clean up fast. A truck DRIVES PAST CAMERA,
          taking us to Jack and Nelec, who WALK together amid the
          debris. Choppers land and take off in the background:
                         
                          NELEC
           Yes, I understand, this crash has

           out just what happened here as well
           as how to help you out.
                         
                          NELEC
           It's under control. It'll be a very
           fast clean-up.

           our cargo.

          Jack is with Sheriff Pruitt, who stands, distracted, picking
          up reports from his desk, on his way out.
                         
                          JACK
           They gave me the run around for two
           hours before I was allowed to talk
           to anyone.
                         
                          PRUITT
           I'd say they have their hands full,

                          JACK
           Nelec -- the Colonel -- refused to
           show me their manifest, said they
           were carrying mostly airplane parts-
                         
                          PRUITT
           It's Air Force, Jack. Airplane
           parts sorta make sense.
                         
                          JACK
           Sheriff, I'm telling you, there's
           something else going on -- they're
           taking molds of tire tracks -- now
           why would they be doing that? Who
           are they looking for? And they're
           packing these weird little cubes
           into crates and they're--

           Weird little cubes?
                         
                          JACK
           --yeah, into these red trucks,
           dozens of these trucks -- and I'm

           get the hell outta there--

           Sheriff, I think you need to go
           check it out.

          INT. KELVIN GAS STATION - NIGHT
                         
          FINGERS TAPPING -- they're fingers on a COUNTER, a WALKMAN
          sitting beside them. BOOM UP to 23-year-old BREEN, who digs
          the BLONDIE he's listening to. He is alone in the station
          store. Behind him, 60-year-old SHERIFF PRUITT enters.
                         
                          SHERIFF PRUITT
           Hey Breen, I'm not sure Edie's
           paying you to listen to the radio.
                         
          Breen doesn't respond. The sheriff throws a candy bar at him.

           Breen.

           Hey, Sheriff.
                         
                          SHERIFF PRUITT
           What's that?
                         
                          BREEN
           Walkman. It's like a stereo, play
           your own cassette tapes.
                          (OFFERS HEADPHONES)
           You wanna try it?
                         
                          SHERIFF PRUITT
           (pays for the candy bars)
           I don't think so. Kids walking
           around with their own stereos. Just
           what we need. It's a slippery
           slope.
                         
          He exits the store.

          We see we're at the lonely gas station the kids drove past
          earlier. Pruitt's SQUAD CAR filling up, the only car here.
          High overhead, a yellow KELVIN sign TURNS atop a tall pole
          near the road. Pruitt crosses to his car. Peels the candy
          bar. Hearing something, he turns -- a PACK OF DOGS RUN BY. A
          DISTANT SHOT AS THE LIGHTS ALL MOMENTARILY DIM AND FLICKER.
          CLOSE UP of the PUMP'S SPINNING white NUMBER on black; the
          gallons and dollar amount blurring higher -- then A BIZARRE
          REFLECTION -- Pruitt sees it, turns -- and what he sees is
          TALL AND TERRIFYING -- he DROPS THE CANDY -- GOES FOR HIS
          GUN, BUT --

          Breen, eyes closed, blasts his Walkman (we only hear TINNY
          MUSIC) as, through the window behind him, the rear of the
          squad car SUDDENLY SPRINGS UPWARD VIOLENTLY as if the FRONT
          SECTION WAS SUDDENLY CRUSHED! PRUITT SCREAMS, MUFFLED, as the
          CAR SLAMS back to the pavement -- LIGHTS FLICKER --

          PRUITT'S SCREAMS END as Breen OPENS HIS EYES AND RIPS off the
          headphones: the hell was that? He looks outside -- sees the
          car -- shattered windows. Confused, he heads out --
                         
                         
          EXT. KELVIN GAS STATION - NIGHT
                         
          Breen moves tentatively toward the CRUSHED CAR -- quickly
          glances for Pruitt, who's missing. He gets close to the car,
          confounded by what he sees -- hands shaking, he rights the
          pump and replaces it. His heart pounds as he starts for the
          building -- but SLIPS ON THE GAS -- falls hard -- looks up --
          sees whatever's coming for him -- SCREAMS as he gets to his
          feet and RUNS LIKE A MOTHERFUCKER --
                         
                         
          INT. KELVIN GAS STATION - NIGHT

          WE LOOK DOWN UPON THE STATION FROM UP HIGH -- where the
          turning, lit KELVIN SIGN BLOCKS OUR VIEW FOR THE MOMENT -- we
          can only HEAR THE HORROR happening inside the station until
          FINALLY the sign REVEALS THE STATION -- everything inside
          looks like it's in a BLENDER -- THERE'S A SUPER-HUMAN
          UPHEAVAL HAPPENING IN THERE -- and Breen's SCREAMS CONTINUE
          as the turning Kelvin sign BLOCKS OUR VIEW AGAIN -- as the
          SOUND GETS UNBEARABLE, A SUDDEN CUT TO:
                         
          A FACE. A MAKE-UP BRUSH APPLYING MAKE-UP. It's ALICE, and
          she's becoming a ZOMBIE. We are:

          Joe makes her up -- a not half-bad, simple ZOMBIE MAKE-UP.
          Pale skin, sunken eyes and cheekbones. In the background, the
          other kids prepare to film.
                         
          He hands her a mirror, she gazes into it, sort of amazed.
                         
                          ALICE
           Where'd you learn how to do this?

          She nods. Whatever. Charles is suddenly there, with Cary:
                         
                          CHARLES
           Hey! So I'm gonna need more shots
           of the train crash, obviously-- you
           know that train model you made? Can
           we blow it up and film it?
                         
          Joe doesn't want to do this at all. AT ALL. But...

           train? My train model? The train I
           made?
                         
          The LIGHTS IN THE HOUSE DIM -- BROWN OUT -- then back on.
                         
                          CHARLES MARTIN
          That's like the third time Dude. Bitchen.
          that's happened.
                         
                          ALICE
           So how am I supposed to be a
           zombie?
                         
                          JOE
           Oh. Just be a lifeless ghoul.
           Someone with no soul, dead eyes.
           Scary. D'you ever have Mrs. Mullin?
                         
                          ALICE
           For English? Yeah--
                         
                          JOE
           -- like her. But hungry, like
           hungry for human flesh. To make
           them turn into zombies, because
           that's what zombies do.
                         
          Alice considers this -- then, after a beat, starts doing her
          best zombie. Joe smiles, `cause it's pretty good.
                         
                          JOE (CONT'D)
           Oh my God. That's really good...
                         
          And Alice slowly leans in toward him -- is this performance?
          Or is this something else--? And she PUTS HER MOUTH ON HIS
          NECK IN A FAKE BITE, which makes Joe go still -- a shiver
          down his spine -- he's never felt anything like this in his
          life. And when she pulls back, her performance over, she's
          smiling. He doesn't know what to say, tries to stay cool.
                         
                          JOE (CONT'D)
           ... not bad.
                         
                         
          EXT. KELVIN GAS STATION - DAY
                         
          We're NEAR THE GAS PUMPS, LOW TO THE GROUND -- DOLLY as Jack,
          EDIE and MR. BLAKELY come out here. We pass SMALL SHATTERED
          PIECES OF RED AND BLUE PLASTIC and STOP AND RACK to the GUN
          Sheriff Pruitt dropped.
           52.
                         
                         
                          EDIE
           -- Careful, there was a gas spill.
           I don't even know how much fuel
           I've lost.
                         
           MR. BLAKELY
           -- You don't seem to be asking a
           lot of questions.
                         
                          EDIE
           -- Give this man some time, Mr.
           Blakely.
                         
           MR. BLAKELY
           He's just the Deputy, he's not the
           Sheriff...
                         
          Jack kneels by the Smith and Wesson Model 19. Jack pulls out
          a handkerchief, lifts the fun -- PUSH IN ON the engraved
          initials "H.P." JACK IS ROCKED BY THIS. He opens the cylinder
          to check if it had been fired.
                         
          CUT BACK WIDE. No squad car here. Jack checks out the broken
          BLUE AND RED PLASTIC as he makes a walkie call:
                         
           MR. BLAKELY (CONT'D)
           I think this is most likely a bear
           attack.
                         
                          EDIE
           Remember when I said you talk too
           much? Well, this is the time.
                         
                          JACK
           Vicky, ya heard from Sheriff Pruitt
           this morning?
                         
           VOICE (V.O.)
           Negative, still no word.
                         
                          JACK
           Vicky, I need you to have Dayton
           send a CS unit out to Edie's. You
           put out an APB on the Sheriff and
           Breen Haskell -- send units to
           their houses immediately. You copy
           all of that?
                         
           VOICE (V.O.)
           ... copy. And Jack, we're getting a
           lot of unusual calls.
                         
                          JACK
           ... what kind of unusual calls...?
           53.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAR LOT - DAY
                         
          Angry IZZY, 65, OPENS A NEW CAR HOOD: PIECES OF THE ENGINE
          RIPPED AWAY, MESSY -- DOLLY WITH HIM, Jack follows:
                         
                          IZZY
           Never seen this kinda thing before.
                         
          Izzy opens ANOTHER CAR HOOD: PIECES MISSING.
                         
                          IZZY (CONT'D)
           What the hell am I supposed to do?
           Insurance company thought I was
           joking with him. Look at my
           Bonneville here-- look at this. I
           got a call about this car
           yesterday. What am I going to tell
           the customer?
                         
          ANOTHER HOOD -- PIECES MISSING.
                         
                          JACK
           Having trouble with anyone lately,
           Izzy?
                         
                          IZZY
           I was thinking, you should talk to
           Louis Dainard. I didn't help him
           out with financing last year,
           wouldn't be surprised if this was--
           some sorta sick retribution.
                         
          As Jack heads back to his car, THREE RESIDENTS move to him,
          walk with him, AD LIB:
                         
                          RESIDENTS JACK
          -- Some strange shit has been -- d'you call the station
          going on. My antenna's gone-- yet. You need to call the
          our dog is gone, he hasn't station. And file a report,
          come home this morning -- before anything can be done
          Jack, my lights keep going on about it. And then we can
          and off. Counting on you, take care of these things. If
          Jack. you do that for me, I promise
           you, I'll handle it myself.
                         
          He seems to have appeased them -- but as he turns, we see how
          stressed he is. He stops, noticing FOUR MILITARY TRUCKS
          DRIVING PAST, SLOWLY, ANTENNAS atop the trucks, and the men
          inside seemingly scanning the area. Jack is disturbed by
          this.
           54.
                         
                         
          EXT. HILL TOP
                         
          Joe rides along a hillside. Parks his bike. Walks toward the
          edge.
                         
                          JOE
           Lucy. Lucy. Lucy!
                         
          He stops to reveal the town of Lillian.
                         
                         
          EXT. LILLIAN STREET - DUSK
                         
          Joe rides the street, calling out:
                         
                          JOE
           Lucy! ... Lucy!
                         
          WIDE SHOT as he DIPS down a neighborhood hill, sun LOW.
                         
                         
          EXT. LILLIAN, OHIO - MAIN STREET - DUSK
                         
          A community CORKBOARD. Joe posts up a piece of paper; we SEE
          IT NOW IN CLOSE-UP. It's a MISSING DOG SIGN FOR LUCY. We're
          on Joe's face as he finishes pinning it up -- when something
          he sees makes him stop. He slowly takes a step back. Then
          another... his eyes glued to the board.
                         
          Then we see the REVERSE -- SLOWLY PULLING BACK -- REVEALING
          THAT THERE ARE DOZENS AND DOZENS OF BRAND NEW "DOG MISSING"
          SIGNS POSTED ON THE BOARD. It's COVERED in them. Joe is so
          stunned, he doesn't notice the MILITARY TRUCKS that pass in
          the background behind him.
                         
                         
          INT. JOE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
                         
          KA-BAM: back door opens, Joe enters. EMPTY PIZZA BOX on the
          table. Jack and four POLICE OFFICERS in the living room,
          smoking, reviewing POLICE REPORTS, marking MAPS, taking notes
          -- WORKING ON THE PROBLEMS THEY'RE HAVING --
                         
                          OFFICER MIKE
           We need more help around here.
                         
                          OFFICER GORDON
           We've got four men on the Pruitt
           case alone. We've called into
           Dayton, they'll be out in the
                          MORNING----
           55.
                         
                         
                          JACK
           That's not enough. People don't
           feel safe here -- and you know why?
           `Cause they're not--
                         
          The officers agree. Joe moves into the doorway where his dad
          and other convene.
                         
                          JACK (CONT'D)
           -- the Air Force isn't answering a
           damn question: they've got trucks
           at Woodward's house, looking for
                          SOMETHING --
                         
                          OFFICER
           They've got trucks all over town.
                         
                          OFFICER JAY
           I saw a guy riding shotgun in one
           of those trucks -- had some kind of
           scanner in his hand --
                         
                          DEPUTY TALLY
           --like a Geiger counter or
                          SOMETHING--
                         
                          JACK
           I know. They're saying it's just
           clean-up at the train crash, but
           they're taking molds of tire
           tracks. Which means they're looking
           for someone-- now what's that
           about?
                         
          Joe has heard this and DROPPED HIS FLASHLIGHT -- the men all
          turn, silent. Joe, on the spot:
                         
                          JOE
           -- have you... seen Lucy?
                         
                          JACK
           I'm sure she's around. I put a
           couple of slices in the fridge for
           you there.
                         
                          DEPUTY TALLY
           -- oh-- I ate those. Sorry, Kid--
                         
                          JOE
           That's... okay, I'll find a--
                         
          Then the POWER GOES OUT -- the men react -- it FLICKERS ON
          AND OFF -- Jack grabs his radio a the POWER RETURNS:
           56.
                         
                         
                          JACK
           Vicky, you got power at the

           DISPATCH (V.O.)
           On and off. Brook County's in the

                          JACK
           Get water and power out there now.

                          JOE
           So the Air Force is looking for a
           car -- Alice's dad's car -- they're
           taking tire prints from the crash
           site. Over.
                         
                          CHARLES
           I don't wanna hear about it. They
           could be monitoring us right now!
           Jesus, shut up. Over!
                         
                          JOE
                          (VERY CONCERNED)
           And the military's at Woodward's
           house. Looking for his research.
           Whatever that means?
                         
                          CHARLES
           Joe -- YOU CAN NOT FLAKE OUT ON ME
           AND BE A DICK! Are you gonna come
           help me tomorrow or not? I need you
           to make Alice a zombie again.
                         
          And Joe tries to snap himself out of it. But is disturbed.
                         
                          JOE
           Okay... I'll do the make-up. Over.

           No power, no comm cables. Stand by.
                         
          He DRIVES AGAIN -- we see a WIDE SHOT OF THE LANDSCAPE --
          HALF A DOZEN UTILITY POLES -- ALL BARE -- NOT ONE WIRE.
                         
                         
          EXT. SALVAGE YARD ROAD - NIGHT
                         
          The truck comes to a stop, roadside. Tall trees and a SALVAGE
          YARD behind them. PUSH IN ON ROONEY who calls in:
                         
                          ROONEY
           We got over a half mile of copper
           missing.
                         
           VOICE (V.O.)
           -- that-- doesn't sound possible.
                         
                          ROONEY
           Lines are back up at M-38.
                         
          In the cherry picker bucket, Rooney works the controls. He
          begins LIFTING; a WIDE SHOT shows him rising to the bare
          utility pole STEPDOWN TRANSFORMER. When Rooney finally gets
          to the top, with gloves hands, he inspects the transformer.
          After a moment, though, he stops. HEARS something else, past
          the sound of electricity. He looks over toward the SALVAGE
          YARD. Except it's mostly hidden by the trees. From here,
          Rooney can only see the tops of the JUNK PILES. A small
          METALLIC CRASH. Then ANOTHER.
           58.
                         
                         
          Rooney cranes his neck to get a view. Another METALLIC CRASH,
          this time GLASS BREAKING, too. Then, in the distance, at the
          middle of the salvage yard, SOMETHING FLIES INTO THE AIR,
          FALLING AND LANDING WITH A CLANG-THUNK.
                         
          Rooney strains his eyes to see -- what the hell was that? A
          tin can? A piece of a fender? Hard to tell from here.
                         
          Then, thrown into the air: A CAR TIRE. It lands with a THUD.
          Rooney then uses the bucket controls -- MOVES BACKWARD AND UP
          -- a touch higher toward the transformer -- not exactly
          watching how close he is getting. He stops. Watches.
                         
          An ENTIRE JUNKED MOTORCYCLE flies into the air, discarded,
          twirling, and CRASH LANDS, out of sight.
                         
          Rooney is stunned. As the METALLIC RUMMAGING SOUNDS CONTINUE,
          Rooney moves the bucket EVEN HIGHER -- when suddenly his
          bucket BEEP-BEEPS LOUDLY -- a warning he's too high -- and he
          suddenly stops it and the BEEPING STOPS --
                         
          But so do the rummaging sounds. SILENCE, save for the eerie
          HUM OF POWER. He waits. Nothing. Wants a better view, so he
          begins to LOWER THE BUCKET.
                         
          We're in a WIDE SHOT, seeing his DESCEND, PAINFULLY SLOWLY.
                         
          Then we're in a LONG LENS CLOSE UP of Rooney as he SLOWLY
          DROPS -- TIGHT ON HIM as he's looking over toward the salvage
          yard -- and it takes us a minute to realize there's fucking
          SOMETHING BEHIND HIM -- SO BIG WE DIDN'T SEE IT -- COMING OUT
          OF THE SHADOWS -- IT'S GOT MUSCLE AND FLESH AND IT MAKES AN
          UNGODLY SOUND AND IT INSTANTLY GRABS HIM -- THE TRUCK ROCKS
          AS WE CUT INSIDE THE CAB OF THE TRUCK, LOOKING OUT THE
          WINDSHIELD -- KEEEEEEESH!!! IT SPIDERS AS ROONEY'S LEGS
          IMPACT THE GLASS AND SUDDENLY WE'RE IN A WIDE SHOT OF THE
          CHERRY PICKER, ROCKING BACK AND FORTH IN INCREASINGLY SMALLER
          MOVEMENTS, UNTIL THE TRUCK IS MOTIONLESS. Empty. Alone.
                         
          Then: NOISE -- and an AMPLIFIED VOICE:
                         
           MRS. BABBIT (V.O.)
           I wanna know who took `em.
                         
                         
          INT. TOWN HALL - DAY
                         
          A LOUD TOWN MEETING. Two-hundred frustrated CITIZENS crowd
          the auditorium. Jack at the podium, TOWN OFFICIALS, including
          the local MAYOR sit on stage as well. Currently, MRS. BABBIT,
          52, speaks into the microphone on the floor:
           59.
                         
                         
           MRS. BABBIT
           Twenty microwave ovens: gone from
           my inventory. Brook County's
           without power -- this feels to me
           like a Russian invasion.
                         
          The town ROARS its approval -- Jack, impotent, tries:
                         
                          JACK
           Mrs. Babbit, I don't believe the
           Russians have anything to do with
           what's happening in town-- but I'm
           calling the curfew because w--
                         
           MRS. BABBIT
           Until you can tell me who's messing
           with us, I say it's the Soviets and
           we're at war. I like you, Jack, but
           we need Sheriff Pruitt back.
                         
          The town ERUPTS in agreement --
                         
                          JACK
           We have good people working on
           that. Mr. McCandless.
                         
          A short, bald man of 65, MR. MCCANDLESS speaks:
                         
           MR. MCCANDLESS
           Since Wednesday morning, my Ham
           radio's been a mess -- all sorts of
           frequencies I like to scan. Some
           kind of buzz modulation-- have you
           found that?
                         
          PUSH IN ON JACK, HEARING THIS --
                         
                          JACK
           Mr. McCandless, can I speak with
           you for a moment, privately?
                         
          The Mayor takes over as Jack has a SIDEBAR MEETING with Mr.
                         MCCANDLESS:
                         
           MR. MCCANDLESS JACK
          -- it was like having my -- that must be very annoying-
          radio hi-jacked-- - you don't know the
           frequencies off-hand, do you?
          -- sure I do: 13201 to 13710, (pulls out paper, pen)
                         15015 TO 15048--
           60.
                         
                         
          EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY
                         
          Jack hurries from the town meeting to the station --
                         
                          WOMAN
           Jack, all the tools in the garage
           are gone.
                         
                          JACK
           Patty, get in touch with Vicky.
           David, have you seen Milner?
                         
                          DAVID
           No, sir, I haven't seen him.
                         
                          MAN
           There's a sink hole in my garage.
           It almost sank a foot.
                         
                          JACK
           Hey Tom. Tom, have you seen Milner?
                         
                          TOM
           Have you tried his office?
                         
                          JACK
           Check his office.
                         
                          MAN
           The powers been out for days
                         
          Jack continues, into:
                         
                         
          INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
                         
          DOLLY FAST with an exasperated Jack as he WRITES, tailed by
          ASSISTANT DEPUTY ROSKO --
                         
                          JACK
           --Rosko, I need you to get every
           radio we have and you tune to these
           frequencies -- understand?
                         
                          ROSKO
           No. What?
                         
                          JACK
           Hey Danny, you have a radio scanner
           with a descrambler don't you?
                         
                          DANNY
           Voice inverter, yeah.
           61.
                         
                         
                          JACK
           Whatever, get it down and set it up
           for me.
                         
                          ROSKO
           What is this?
                         
                          JACK
           I think the Air Force is using
                          UNASSIGNED CHANNELS--
                         
          He heads for his office, seeing LOUIS, who is being escorted
          out by an Officer across the room.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Hey -- he was at my house yesterday
           morning, are you aware of that?
                         
                          OFFICER ROSKO
           (quiet to Jack)
           We brought him in about the car lot
           and other things -- he's clean.
                         
                          LOUIS
           I'd appreciate it if you would
           inform your son that my house if
           off-limits. And so it my daughter.
                         
          Louis heads out -- HOLD ON JACK AS he turns, ENTERS HIS
          OFFICE, and as that door opens, we CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. JOE'S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
                         
          The door opens of his messy, motherless room. Joe and Alice
          enter. He could not be more self-conscious. He moves stacks
          of comic, tosses some dirty clothes behind the bed -- pair of
          underwear and socks. He closes the closet and hangs a bath
          towel on his desk chair. She looks around sa she enters. The
          light dim, intimate.
                         
                          JOE
           Oh gawd, I didn't clean up.
                         
          Joe quickly moves a pile of papers and books from the desk to
          the floor; NOTEBOOKS AND SCHOOL WORK spill out and we get a
          GLIMPSE of some "B-MINUSES" and other "C-PLUSES" in RED.
                         
          Joe, embarrassed, hides them, then moves to his MODELS:
                         
                          ALICE
           -- you made all these?
           62.
                         
                         
                          JOE
           Yeah, that's the Hunchback of Notre
           Dame. I watched that one on TV.
                          HERE---
                         
          Alice sits on the bed. Joe takes the FIVE-CAR TRAIN MODEL.
          She moves close:
                         
                          JOE (CONT'D)
           This is the train they wanna
           destroy.
                         
          Alice hold it. Joe watches her. She really looks at it.
                         
                          ALICE
           ... it looks real.
           (beat, studies)
           It looks so old...
                         
                          JOE
           That's dry brush technique.
           (off her look)
           After you've painted the base
           color, you take something like...
           (grabs up Testors bottle)
           Euro Gray.
                         
          Her face is so close to his. Her hair touches his ear.
                         
                          ALICE
           Euro Gray...
                         
                          JOE
           There are so many different grays,
           it's crazy. And you pour a little
           onto like a paper plate. Then you
           take a dry brush and you just dip
           it in, then you brush on the paper,
           so the paint's barely on the brush.
           Then you make small brush strokes
           on the model. Little ones, like
           where the wear and tear would be.
           Around the wheels. Or where the
           doors would slide. Then you do it
           again, like with Camouflage Gray--
           or here, I used Insignia Red to
           make it look like there was another
           coat of paint on there before. Like
           they painted over it, but you could
           see it scratched off.
                         
          Lost in thought, he looks at her. Suddenly self-conscious.
           63.
                         
                         
                          ALICE
           What was that necklace?
           (off his awkward stare)
           The one you were holding at the
           train crash. Was it your mom's?
                         
          It takes him a beat. Finally:
                         
                          JOE
           My dad gave it to her the day I was
           born. She wears it all the time.
           Used to.
                          (BEAT)
           It was bad, how she-- died and
           stuff, but they got the necklace
           back. So.
                         
          Their tension INTERRUPTED BY an out of breath Charles:
                         
                          CHARLES
           Guys, what the hell?! No one knew
           where you were.
                         
                          JOE
           We're sitting right here.
                         
                          CHARLES
           You gotta be the soldier.
                         
                          JOE
           I thought you were calling Evan.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Evan blew us off, he's a pussy.
                          (TO ALICE)
           Excuse me.
                         
                          ALICE
           It's okay.
                         
                          CHARLES
           You gotta do it. You're the only
           one.

          Jack with OFFICER TALLY (24):
                         
                          JACK
           The hell do you mean you "found my
           dog in Brookville?" That's a
                          DIFFERENT COUNTY--
           64.
                         
                         
                          OFFICER TALLY
           Lucy-- that's where she is. We've
           gotten nearly thirty calls from
           people who have found local dogs.
           Thing is, the calls coming in
           aren't local.
                         
          Tally puts a MAP on his desk -- 28 DOTS in a CIRCLE, anywhere
          from a 20 to 150 MILE RADIUS, WITH LILLIAN AT THE CENTER.
                         
           OFFICER TALLY (CONT'D)
           It's like they all just... ran
           away, every direction...
                         
          Jack is stunned.
                         
                         
          INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
                         
          Officer Rosko at his desk, with a YOUNG WOMAN, a HAM RADIO at
          his desk beside a REEL-TO-REEL TAPE DECK. He takes notes:
                         
                          YOUNG WOMAN
           It's not her. She never's
           disappeared before.
                         
                          OFFICER ROSKO
           Alright. Now what does she look
           like?
                         
                          YOUNG WOMAN
           She's got dark hair, it was in
           rollers. Do you know what rollers
           are?
                         
                          OFFICER ROSKO
           Yes, I know what rollers are.
                         
                          YOUNG WOMAN
           She went to her car--
                         
          Suddenly a GARBLED ELECTRONIC SOUND from the HAM RADIO. Rosko
          quickly hits RECORD on the reel-to-reel --
                         
                          OFFICER ROSKO
                          EXCUSE ME--
                         
          He grabs speaker, turns the volume knob, puts the speaker
          close to the tape recorder, turns on recorder.
           65.

          FOUR OFFICERS gather as Jack PLAYS BACK THE REEL-TO-REEL
          through Milner's DESCRAMBLER. He WRITES DOWN AS THEY LISTEN
          TO MEN'S VOICES, creepily FILTERED and BROKEN UP:
                         
           MALE VOICE (V.O.) OFFICERS

                          ROSKO
           What's he say? Operation what?
                         
                         CLOSE ON--JACK:

          EXT. WOODWARD'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          MILITARY VEHICLES parked everywhere. Personnel removing boxes
          from the house, packing it all up. But out front, Joe is
          dressed as an Airman, performing with Martin, dressed as the
          detective.
                         
          Military trucks surround the house. Hathaway is with a
                         SOLDIER:
                         
                          DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
           I came as soon as I could, what's
           happening here?
                         
                          OFFICER JOE
           Military police investigation. It
           was a suicide.
                         
                          DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
           Suicide? Who was it?
                         
                          OFFICER JOE
           A former Air Force officer. He
           called me last night, said he had a
           secret that he couldn't keep any
           longer.
                         
          Officer Joe hands Hathaway a FILE. Hathaway looks at it.
           66.
                         
                         
                          DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
           What's this?
                         
                          OFFICER JOE
           He worked at Romero Chemical. He
           found out some things the company's
           been doing. After what you told me
           at the bar, I thought you should
           know.
                         
          Cary behind the camera, Charles beside him:
                         
                          CARY
                          (QUIETLY)
           Are we gonna get in trouble here--?
                         
                          CHARLES
                          (WHISPER-YELL)
           Shhhh! Production value! It's for
           the movie!
                         
                          DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
           This proves it. They knew, the
           company knew. Thank you so much for
           the information.
                         
                          OFFICER JOE
           We just made the discovery
           ourselves. You understand this is
           top secret.
                         
                          DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
           Of course.
                         
                          OFFICER JOE
           I would never have given you this
           information if you and I hadn't
           served together in Vietnam.
                         
          As it continues, we see Alice behind the camera, watching
          Joe, smiling. But then she sees something that disturbs her:
          Jack's CRUISER pulls up.
                         
                         
          INT. WOODWARD'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          A dozen OFFICERS go through HUNDREDS OF CARDBOARD BOXES of
          documents. Books and personal belongings are put into boxes,
          taken from the house. Overmyer enters, crosses to Nelec, who
          reviews a folder.
                         
                          OVERMYER
           Nothing so far--
           67.
                         
                         
                          NELEC
           How much more is there?
                         
                          OVERMYER
           Sixty boxes in the basement, maybe
           more.
                         
                          NELEC
           What, more tax returns?
                         
                          OVERMYER
           It's here somewhere. If we can't
           find it, Woodward'll tell us where
           it is.
                         
          But Nelec has seen something outside: THE KIDS.
                         
                          NELEC
           ... the hell's that?
                         
                          OVERMYER
           ... looks like kids making a
           movie...
                         
          Behind them, a WINDOW, showing the street, where Jack insists
          Joe get into the car. Nelec looks out -- sees Jack take Joe
          by the arm, grab the tripod and head to his squad car.
                         
                         
          EXT. WOORWARD'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          As Jack gets out, he sees the kids and isn't happy. He moves
          toward Joe and his friends:
                         
                          CHARLES
           Joe.
                          (TO JACK)
           Hey, Mr. Lamb!
                         
          Joe spins around as Jack arrives, grabs his camera from
          Charles and saying firmly, to Joe:
                         
                          JACK
           Get in the car.
                         
          Joe is stunned -- instantly humiliated in front of Alice --
          he's taken back to the squad car --
                         
                          CHARLES
           Uh-- Mr. Lamb? That's your camera,
           but technically, that's my film--
           68.
                         
                         
          Jack OPENS the car's back door -- Joe gets in -- Jack SLAMS
          it shut, then throws the camera and tripod into the passenger
          seat and SLAMS that door, heading to the house, leaving Joe
          in the back. Nelec heads outside -- Jack moves to him:
                         
                          NELEC
           I would like to help you out
           deputy. I really would. But we
           operate on a need to know basis.
                         
                          JACK
           Why are your trucks sweeping the
           town?
                         
                          NELEC
           We'll be out of your way shortly.
                         
                          JACK
           Then I'm sure you wouldn't mind me
           contacting DC. Talk to some friends
           about "Walking Distance."
                         
          This lands on Nelec.
                         
                          JACK (CONT'D)
           All right. We'll do it that way.
                         
          Jack heads off.
                         
                          NELEC
           Deputy.
                          (JACK TURNS)
           Let's talk. Just not here.
                         
          Jack stops, turns to uncomfortable Nelec.
                         
                         
          INT. SQUAD CAR - DAY
                         
          Joe, his breathing heavying, sits in the car, heart pounding,
          watching his father move over to talk to Nelec, close again.
          Then he looks over at his friends -- Charles giving him a
          "WHAT THE FUCK?!" Look. Alice watches him sympathetically.
          She mouths to him a guilty, "...is it me...?" And Joe shakes
          his head: "No." But we -- and she -- know better.
                         
                         
          EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          The squad car pulls up. Jack gets out, Joe follows -- THE
          CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL THAT WE ARE:
           69.
                         
                         
          INT. JOE'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Door opens. Jack enters, then lets Joe pass him. Joe closes
          the door hard and says, angrily, but restrained:
                         
                          JACK
           This is new. All this. For the both
           of us. Dealing with-- all this,
           just us. So I'm going to make this
           as clear and simple as I can:
           You're not friends with Alice
           Dainard. When I say no, I don't
           mean maybe. I don't mean yes. I
           mean no. I've known Louis Dainard
           for alotta years-- he's been
           nothing but trouble. Your mother
           used to say he's not a bad guy, he
           just needs a chance, he's just sad -
           - well I tried to be good to him,
           but I can't. Not anymore. I will
           not allow him or his daughter in
           this house. I will not allow you
           spending time with her, doing
           projects or whatever it is that
           you're doing. THAT'S IT. I hope
           we're clear.
                         
          Jack turns to leave -- but Joe, enraged, says:
                         
                          JOE
           We're not clear.
                         
          Jack stops -- stunned -- Joe's heart pounds --
                         
                          JACK
           What'd you say?
                         
                          JOE
           We're not clear. You and I aren't
           clear about anything. We couldn't
           be less clear.
                         
                          JACK
           Joseph Francis Lamb--
                         
                          JOE
                          (ERUPTING)
           Just `cause mom died doesn't mean
           you know anything about me!!! You
           don't. You don't know about Alice
           either -- she's kind!
           70.
                         
                         
                          JACK
           I'm not having this discussion with
           you--!
                         
                          JOE
           She's NICE to me!
                         
                          JACK
           I don't care what she is! Her
           father is a selfish, irresponsible
           son-of-a-bitch!
                         
          Jack moves CLOSE to Joe -- intimidating -- Joe steps back --
          Jack is fucking intense:
                         
                          JACK (CONT'D)
           You listen to me, I've got twelve
           thousand people in this town that
           are scared out of their minds--
           they've got one person they can
           rely on -- it used to be someone
           else, but now it's just me.
                         
          Jack suddenly stops himself, realizing what he's saying. And
          to whom he's saying it. But somehow, in this moment, he can't
          be a better father than law officer. Not yet. More upset at
          himself than Joe, he heads out.
                         
                         
          EXT. LILLIAN STREET - DUSK
                         
          Joe rides UP A HILL -- BOOM UP -- REVEAL THE TOWN CEMETERY.
                         
                         
          EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT
                         
          Joe sits, his back against his mother's grave. Holds her OPEN
          LOCKET, staring at it. He's just come here for comfort. But
          then -- a SOUND -- and Joe turns. Deep and low, in the
          distance. Joe is motionless. HEARS IT AGAIN. He stands, pulls
          out his flashlight -- aims the beam down ROWS OF GRAVES,
          toward the big CARETAKER'S SHED in the distance. Another
          INTENSE, LOW SOUND -- then a high pitch HIT, like METAL ON
          WOOD and Joe backs up, nervous. Another odd sound -- then
          ANOTHER -- which TRANSITIONS US TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. MUNICIPAL AIRPORT ENTRANCE - NIGHT
                         
          Jack's squad car arrives at the abandoned airfield.
           71.
                         
                         
          EXT. MUNICIPAL AIRPORT BUILDING - NIGHT
                         
          Jack's car pulls up. He gets out of the car. Suddenly the
          three large MILITARY TRUCKS' HEADLIGHTS COME ON -- all aimed
          at Jack -- he is blinded -- tries to see --
                         
                          JACK
           Hello--?
                         
          And now BODIES are seen of SOLDIERS, holding and aiming
          WEAPONS. Then, a VOICE over a TRUCK PA:
                         
           VOICE (V.O.)
           Drop your weapons. Put your hands
           on the car.
                         
                          JACK
           --I'm here to see Colonel Nelec. He
           told me to meet him here.
                         
           VOICE (V.O.)
           You're under military arrest. Drop
           your weapons.
                         
                          JACK
           WHERE'S NELEC?
                         
                         
          INT. MILITARY MEDICAL ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          TIGHT ON NELEC. Past an IV and medical machinery. He's
          looking at someone we don't yet see. In the background,
          Overmyer stands, watching. Nelec is quiet, simple:
                         
                          NELEC
           I don't want any more trouble. Do
           you?
                         
          Now we see who he's talking to. IT'S DR. WOODWARD. Battered
          and scraped, he lies in a medical bed, afraid, but defiant.
                         
                          NELEC (CONT'D)
           We've been going through your
           belongings, looking for evidence.
           Of what you knew, how you knew
           it... and who else might know.
                          (BEAT)
           I remember you. In the lab. And I
           recall we didn't see eye to eye,
           but that's no excuse for doing what
           you did here.
           72.
                         
                         
          Dr. Woodward swallows. Feels that his time on Earth is coming
          to an end no matter what he does here. By the door, Overmyer
          is quietly putting on his BLACK GLOVES.
                         
                          NELEC (CONT'D)
           So in the spirit of moving forward
           and avoiding more trouble, tell us
           where you put your research. I know
           you had someone document the crash
           that night. Tell me who that was
           and I'll help you, I swear to God.
           On my mother's life -- if you help
           us now, we will take care of you.
                         
           DR. WOODWARD
           I've seen what happens, Mr. Nelec,
           when you take care of people.
                         
                          NELEC
           --I'm going to bait him. I'm going
           to catch him.
                         
           DR. WOODWARD
           He's in me, you know. As I am in
           him. So when you see him next, as
           I'm sure you will... I'll be
           watching you, too.
                         
          Nelec offers a vague, searching smile. But Woodward will not -
          - not ever -- relent. So. Nelec moves to the door, he remains
          FACING CAMERA, his back to Woodward, as Overmyer moves to the
          bed. PUSH IN ON NELEC'S FACE, UNDERSTANDING HIS TRUE NATURE
          AS WE CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. JOE'S ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Joe sleeps, power still out. Then, a KNOCK. He wakes up.
          Another KNOCK. His window. He moves to it. Opens it. It's
          Alice. Joe is half asleep, but also stunned. Very quietly:
                         
                          ALIE
           -- are you-- were you sleeping?
                         
                          JOE
           Before, earlier, b-- no, you okay?
                         
                          ALICE
           Yeah.
                         
                          JOE
                          (BEAT)
           Oh, you wanna come in?
           73.
                         
                         
          And Alice climbs in. Joe sits on the floor. Alice does too.
          It's odd and silent for a moment.
                         
                          ALICE
           Power's still out.
                         
                          JOE
           Room's still messy.
                         
                          ALICE
           I was in bed, couldn't sleep.
                          (BEAT)
           Thinking. I wanted to tell you
           something, before tomorrow -- Don't
           let Charles blow up your train.
                         
          Joe stares, amazed at her.
                         
                          ALICE (CONT'D)
           I don't think it's right, do you? I
           know he's your friend, but he's so
                          BOSSY--
                         
                          JOE
           He can be sorta li-- I've known him
           since Kindergarten, though--
                         
                          ALICE
           He shouldn't always get what he
           wants. I mean, who always gets what
           they want? -- I know I don't know
           you at all. Even though... it sort
           of feels like I do.
                          (BEAT)
           Do you not... feel like that?
                         
                          JOE
           -- no, I totally do, I'm just...
           sort of in shock at this whole
                          CONVERSATION--
                         
          And the POWER RETURNS -- Joe's CLOCK LIGHT goes on behind him
          -- but more chilling, the PROJECTOR comes back on; the SILENT
          HOME MOVIE OF HIS MOTHER PLAYS. Joe crawls to the projector
          to stop it -- but:
                         
                          ALICE
           -- no, keep it-- please --
                         
          Alice moves closer to the screen. Joe sits behind her. She
          watches the film. Can't take her eyes away.
                         
                          ALICE (CONT'D)
           ... is that her?
           74.
                         
                         
                          JOE
           ... yeah...
                         
          And as Alice watches, we GENTLY PUSH IN... as tears start to
          fill her eyes. Behind her, at a near WHISPER:
                         
                          JOE (CONT'D)
           ... it's so weird watching her like
           this, like she's still here...
           (beat, lost in it)
           ... she used to look at me, this
           way... like really look. And I
           just... knew I was there. That I
           existed.
                         
          A tear drops down Alice's face, though Joe can't see that.
          Finally, quietly:
                         
                          ALICE
           He drank that morning. My dad.
                          (BEAT)
           He missed his shift.
           (beat, hard)
           Your mom took it for him. The day
           of the accident.
                         
          Watching his mother, Joe is quietly stunned. Finally, eyes
          wet, Alice turns to Joe.
                         
                          ALICE (CONT'D)
           ... I know he wishes it was him.
           Instead of her.
                          (HARD BEAT)
           ... and sometimes I wish it was,
           too.
                         
          Joe just stares at her... heartsick and speechless. Finally:
                         
                          JOE
           Don't say that.
                          (BEAT)
           He's your dad.
                         
          Just then, the SUPER 8 movie ENDS: the film FLIPFLIPFLIPS.
          Joe turns off the projector -- but a SOUND REMAINS. A sort of
          SHUDDER-HUM. Joe unplugs the projector, but the sound
          remains. Then they look: THE SHUDDERING IS COMING FROM THE
          CUBE HE TOOK FROM THE CRASH SITE, sitting on his desk.
                         
          Joe and Alice move to it. He turns on his desk lamp. The cube
          VIBRATES, almost imperceptibly.
                         
                          ALICE JOE
          -- has this--? -- no.
           75.
                         
                         
          Joe opens a drawer, grabs a paintbrush -- he touches the cube
          -- the thing SHUDDERS ON ITS OWN.
                         
          They are amazed. They get LOW -- eyes at desk level -- the
          SHUDDERING INCREASES IN PITCH AND VOLUME -- he reaches out to
          touch it with his finger, but suddenly the cube BULLETS AWAY -
          - ACROSS THE ROOM -- AND BLASTS THROUGH THE WALL, LEAVING A
          FIVE-INCH HOLE IN THE WALL! She screams -- they both fall to
          the floor, STUNNED -- PUSH IN ON Joe, his heart pounding. He
          moves to the wall -- looks through the hole: in the distance,
          trees and the TOWN WATER TOWER.
                         
                         
          INT. ALICE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Alice enters the dark house quietly. She steps carefully
          toward her room, when --
                         
           LOUIS (O.S.)
           Morning.
                         
          His voice makes her JUMP. She turns: sitting in the dark, in
          an armchair, is her father. He's awake. And drunk.
                         
                          LOUIS (CONT'D)
           You wanna tell me where you were?
           Or you want me to tell you.
                         
          A tense beat, her mind races. Breathe, Alice, just breathe.
                         
                          LOUIS (CONT'D)
           Sit down.
                         
                          ALICE
           I should go to bed.
                         
                          LOUIS
           I wanna talk to you. I said sit
           down.
                         
                          ALICE
           I don't want to sit down.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Then go. Be just like your mother
           and leave.
                         
          This kills her -- but she does: she leaves the house.
                         
                          LOUIS (CONT'D)
           GO AHEAD, GO!
           76.
                         
                         
          EXT. ALICE'S HOUSE - PRE-DAWN
                         
          Alice, crying, gets on her bike and rides off -- a DISTANT
          FIERY GLOW past the factory and over the hills. The front
          door opens -- Louis comes out and yells, miserable:
                         
                          LOUIS
           ALICE!!! WAIT!!!
                         
          But she's far gone -- Louis' mind races -- he runs to his
          BUICK -- starts it up -- PULLS OUT FAST and goes after her --
                         
                         
          EXT. LILLIAN STREET - PRE-DAWN
                         
          Alice PEDALS HARD, she wants to escape everywhere. No cars on
          the street, no people. A block behind her, SCREECH: a CAR
          turns onto the road. Her father's car -- she makes a turn --
                         
                         
          INT. BUICK - PRE-DAWN
                         
          We're with Louis as he drive -- clearly drunk --
                         
                         
          EXT. SHARP TURN ROAD - PRE-DAWN
                         
          Alice makes a daring stop -- turns back up the hill, pedals
          hard, crying and hyperventilating --
                         
                          LOUIS
           ALICE!!! I'M SORRY!!!
                         
          Louis sees her, tries to stop, but can't -- and his car SLAMS
          INTO A PARKED CAR IN A VIOLENT, SUDDEN STOP!
                         
                         
          EXT. LILLIAN STREET - PRE-DAWN
                         
          Alice GASPS -- stops pedaling -- looks back at her father's
          car, wide-eyed and terrified -- should she go back?!
                         
                         
          INT. BUICK - PRE-DAWN
                         
          Louis is bleeding. Badly hurt. He adjusts himself --
          painfully -- then looks into the CRACKED-GLASS REAR VIEW
          MIRROR -- AND HE SEES SOMETHING THAT MAKES HIS EYES GO WIDE.
           77.
                         
                         
          EXT. LILLIAN STREET - PRE-DAWN
                         
          Alive is still looking back at the car -- SO SHE DOESN'T SEE
          THE SHAPE THAT IS COMING BEHIND HER -- and just as she
          decides: I'M NOT GOING BACK, she turns to begin riding on --
          BUT SEES SOMETHING AND SCREAMS --
                         
                         
          INT. BUICK - PRE-DAWN
                         
          THROUGH THE MOSAIC OF THE SHATTERED REAR VIEW MIRROR, WE SEE
          THE CREATURE GRAB ALICE -- HER SCREAMS BECOME HER FATHER'S:
                         
                          LOUIS
           -- ALICE, NO!!!!! NO!!!!!!!
                         
          Louis tries to get out of the car -- but it's painful -- and
          his door is JAMMED SHUT -- he goes for the passenger door --
                         
                         
          EXT. LILLIAN STREET - PRE-DAWN
                         
          -- when Louis finally gets out -- he runs from his car --
          stumbling drunk and bleeding -- SCREAMING, SHREDDING HIS
          VOCAL CHORDS --
                         
                          LOUIS
           ALICE!!!
                         
          But all that's there is her bike -- and before he can even
          get that far, Louis FALLS HARD onto the pavement, crying, a
          drunken, horrified, shocked, battered MESS. In a WIDE SHOT,
          LOUIS is in the middle of the street, Alice's fallen bike on
          the sidewalk.
                         
                         
          EXT. FIELD - NIGHT
                         
          In the great distance, the WATER TOWER. We BOOM DOWN in a
          MASSIVE WIDE SHOT of a field at night. Then a LONG LENS SHOT
          of SIX SOLDIERS standing in the field. But ONE stands out
          front, wearing a FLAME THROWER. And suddenly the quiet is
          broken by the ROAR OF FLAME. A WIDE, WIDE OVERHEAD SHOT as
          the flames ARC in the tall, dry grass. Over the radio:
                         
                          VOICE
           Firelight is 0500 hours. Operation
           Walking Distance is in effect. T-

           Evacuation is T-minus four hours.

          EXT. LILLIAN, OHIO - EARLY MORNING
                         
          The distant factory, the even more distant mountains, and an
          ominous PLUME OF SMOKE -- a far-off SIREN is HEARD. Then:
                         
           JOE (V.O.)
           Why are you not reacting?
                         
                         
          INT. OLSEN CAMERA AND HI-FI - MORNING
                         
          Joe stands at the counter with Charles, who is in a bad mood.
                         
                          JOE
                          (EMPHATIC WHISPER)
           That thing went through my wall.
                         
                          CHARLES
           I told you not to pick it up in the
           first place.
                         
                          JOE
           What are you so angry about? That
           I'm not going to let you blow up my
           train?
                         
                          CHARLES
           That's part of it! Juts a part!
                         
          Donny's returned with a DEVELOPED FILM ENVELOPE. A red "RUSH"
          stamp on it. He gives Charles his change:
                         
                          DONNY
           Tall your sister Donny from Olsen's
           broke up with Karen, that shit
           ended a week ago.
                         
          Charles heads off -- Joe follows.
                         
                         
          EXT. OLSEN CAMERA AND HI-FI - DAY
                         
          As Charles rides off with the film, Joe follows -- and we
          BOOM UP along the WATER TOWER as they go --
                         
                          JOE
           What's your problem?
                         
                          CHARLES
           My whole movie's a disaster `cause
           of you!
                         
                          JOE
           I know, my dad's being a turkey.
           79.
                         
                         
                          CHARLES
           Whatever.
                         
                          JOE
           We're still gonna finish your
           movie!
                         
                          CHARLES
           It's not about the movie.
                         
                          JOE
           What are you talking about? Of
           course it is.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Just forget it.
                         
                          JOE
           Why?
                         
                          CHARLES
           There's nothing wrong--
                         
          As we CONTINUE BOOMING UP, we arrive at the top of the WATER
          TOWER, where THE CUBE HAS AFFIXED ITSELF TO THE SIDE --
          unseen from the street. In the distance, THE THREATENING FIRE
          SMOKE LOOMS --
                         
                         
          EXT. CHARLES' HOUSE - DAY
                         
          As Joe and Charles ride their bikes up to his house:
                         
                          JOE
           I'll get the camera back, I know
           where my dad put it -- We can still
           make the festival.
                         
                          CHARLES
           It's not about the movie.
                         
                          JOE
           Then what is it about?
                         
                          CHARLES
           Jesus, you don't even get it do
           you? It's obvious.
                         
                          JOE
           What's obvious?
                         
                          CHARLES
           Gawd, you're a dumb ass.
           80.
                         
                         
          Frustrated beyond belief, Charles goes inside. Joe follows.
                         
                         
          INT. CHARLES' ROOM - DAY
                         
          Charles threads the film into the projector.
                         
                          CHARLES
           That night of the crash, you
           started getting all weird.
                         
                          JOE
           -- what?
                         
                          CHARLES
           Like Mr. Attitude all of a sudden.
                         
                          JOE
           Your movie was over! That's what
           you said! You were upset. I gave
           you a camera! I helped you!
                         
                          CHARLES
           Don't pretend like you did it for
           me! You didn't do it for me and you
           know it!
                         
                          JOE
           What's your problem?
                         
          Charles ROLLS THE FILM, DIMS THE LIGHTS --
                         
                          CHARLES
           It was never about me! It was
           always about Alice!
                         
          And suddenly on the poster board pinned to the closet, there
          she is: ALICE, from the night of the train crash. The scene
          plays as they filmed it:
                         
           MRS. HATHAWAY
           John. I don't like it. This case.
           These murders.
                         
                          DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
           What am I supposed to do, go to
           Michigan with you?
                         
          THE FILMED SCENE CONTINUES as Joe and Charles argue:
                         
                          JOE
           Well, you're the one who wanted the
           wife in the movie!
           81.
                         
                         
                          CHARLES
           Not so you could fall in love with
           her!
                         
          Joe's mind spins -- how does he respond to this?!
                         
                          JOE
           What do you even care what I think
           about Alice?!
                         
                          CHARLES
           Because I like her! That's why!
           That's why I asked her in the first
           place! So I could get to know her,
           not YOU!
                         
                          JOE
           -- wait, you like Alice Dainard?
                         
                          CHARLES
           You're such an idiot.
                         
                          JOE
           (from Charles' movie)
           Guys, look out!
                         
          They watch for a moment as the TRAIN CRASH HAPPENS -- but
          it's SO SUDDEN, SO FAST, the camera picks up almost nothing.
          Within a moment, the camera is on its side, filming the
          SETTLING DEBRIS. Charles moves forward, so the film is now
          partially BEING PROJECTED ON HIM.
                         
                          CHARLES
           SHIT! Look at all that smoke! We
           can't use any of this. And you
           won't even let me blow up your
           train. Everything's bogus.
                         
                          JOE
           We can make another train and blow
           that one up.
                         
          Joe moves forward. Part of the film PROJECTED ON HIM, too.
                         
                          JOE (CONT'D)
           I do like her. Sorry about that.
                         
                          CJAR
           Shut up. It's okay.
                          (BEAT)
           That's not even what bothers me.
           (beat, finally, sad)
           It's that she likes you too. That
           really bothers me. I dunno...
           82.
                         
                         
          But Joe has seen something -- on the screen -- SOTTO:
                         
                          JOE
           ... Charles...
                         
                          CHARLES
           I know it's stupid. What would she
           ever like me? I haven't leaned out
           yet, which the doctor says is gonna
                          HAP--
                         
          But Joe has slapped Charles' arm, his eyes locked to the
          screen -- Charles looks too -- AND NOW WE SEE IT: through the
          BROKEN CAMERA LENS -- SOMETHING MOVES -- SOMETHING BIG --
          FROM THE TRAIN CAR, THROUGH THE WRECKAGE -- what the hell is
          it? TOO DAMN BIG -- MOSTLY OUT OF FRAME, ITS SHAPE AND FLESH
          TOO BIZARRE -- we only see the LEGS as it clears frame --
                         
                          CHARLES (CONT'D)
           -- Joe, what the hell--?!
                         
          PUSH IN ON THEIR FACES AS THEY SEE THE ALIEN THEY'VE CAPTURED

          WHINING THROUGH THE TOWN. The boys look at each other --

          WIDE SHOT of the neighborhood -- in the distance: MILITARY
          TRUCKS, JEEPS AND BUSES drive. NEIGHBORS coming from their
          homes in the MID-GROUND: confusion and talk, more VEHICLES.
          Finally, as we BOOM DOWN, RACK TO JOE AND CHARLES, trying to
          make sense of this -- Joe calls to a passing adult, MR.
                         HARKIN:
                         
                          JOE
           Mr. Harkin. What's going on?
                         
           MR. HARKIN
           Evacuation! The fire!

          VARIOUS SHOTS of MILITARY busses STOPPING -- SOLDIERS
          ORDERING AND ASSISTING PEOPLE ONTO VEHICLES -- carrying all
          the belongings they can. Others quickly LOAD UP CARS,
          strapping belongings to the roof. Over all this:

          Other people in a panic, running to find others who are lost.

          The evacuation BUSES drive through Main Street -- passing
          soldiers who are MOVING IN THE RED CARGO TRUCKS that we may
          recognize from the train crash site: THE CONTENTS FROM THE

          The buses drive past the guard gate into the base -- into the
          huge HANGAR that we were in earlier. Those who drove
          themselves PARK THEIR CARS -- and are ushered to the hangar.
          DONNY steps out of his 1972 PONTIAC CATALINA, carrying a
          duffel. RACK FOCUS to see we're IN THE BUS with Joe, who has
          seen Donny -- and they drive INSIDE THE HANGAR --

          ARMED Air Force and National Guard SOLDIERS direct MASSES OF
          PEOPLE, carrying luggage and belongings. Move with Joe and
          Charles, who scan for familiar faces -- suddenly Charles'
          MOTHER IS THERE -- embraces Charles:
           84.

           Charles, Charles -- sweetheart, are
           you okay? I went back to the house
           and you were gone.
                         
                          CHARLES
           They made us get on the bus.
                         
                          CHARLES' MOTHER
           Hi, Joe.
                         
                          JOE
           Hi.
                          (TO CHARLES)
           I'm gonna find my dad.
                         
                          CHARLES
           You gonna tell him about that
           thing?
                         
                          JOE
           Yeah.
                         
                          CHARLES' MOTHER
           Come back if you can't find him.
                         
          He heads off. ORDERS are being BARKED -- RESIDENTS can be
          heard, complaining and arguing. Walkie SQUAWKS and PA
          ANNOUNCEMENTS as SOLDIERS check their wrist bands. Joe passes
          an ARGUING MAN and SOLDIER:

          anywhere else, I need to go empty until we've been given

          LOUIS lies in a cot in the TRIAGE UNIT, fifty beds
          transferred from the hospital. Louis stares off, head
          bandaged, eyes open, MUTTERING TO HIMSELF, like a man as
          tired, hung over, injured and in shock as he is.
                         
          Find Joe, who is looking everywhere for his dad -- he finally
          sees Louis and hurries to him.
           85.
                         
                         
                          JOE
           Mr. Dainard, it's Joe Lamb. I know
           you don't like me sir, and I'm
           sorry about that-- but I'm looking
           for my dad--
                         
          And Louis GRABS HIS SHIRT and pulls him close. In a voice
          desperate and heartsick, he says:
                         
                          LOUIS
           It took her.
                         
                          JOE
           (long beat, sotto)
           ... what?
                         
                          LOUIS
           It took her. I saw it. It was...
           something... so... big, like
           nothing -- it was-- and no one...
           no one believes me...
                          (CRYING)
           ... no one believes me-- they just
           keep giving me pills. It took
           her... Joe, it took Alice... no one
           believes me.
                         
          Joe's mind is on fire as he absorbs this -- HE WHISPERS:
                         
                          JOE
           ... I believe you.
                         
          And Louis looks at him with hope --
                         
           JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           It took Alice.
                         
          CUT TO JOE WITH HIS FRIENDS, assembled around a set of cots.

                          PRESTON
           Wait a minute -- first of all, I

          the tarmac are a few MILITARY VEHICLES, a handful of airmen.
                         
          Jack's mind races as he approaches the bathroom at the end of
          the hall -- Jack turns:
                         
                          JACK
           So am I going in alone or are y--?
                         
          -- AND MID-SENTENCE, JACK GRABS THE GUN, PULLS THE SOLDIER
          AND SLAMS HIM HARD IN THE THROAT! THE STUNNED SOLDIER GETS
          SLAM-FLATTENED BY JACK, who KNEELS to him. PUSH IN CLOSE --
          his eyes wide, mind racing -- WHAT THE HELL NEXT? CUT TO:
           89.

          BEHIND A SOLDIER as he RUNS through the dark building -- oh
          shit -- he comes to a stop, back against the wall -- but PUSH
          IN on his face: IT'S JACK, IN AN AIR FORCE UNIFORM. He is
          fucking scared; at least he's holding a rifle. He peels
          around a corner -- through a window, the tarmac: GUARDS,
          VEHICLES. Jack's eyes shift -- he spots an AIRCRAFT FUEL
          TANK. Eyes wild -- A METALLIC CLI-CHUNK AS HE UNSAFETIES THE
                         RIFLE --

           Well, so guys, if the Air Force has
           already searches Woodward's house,
           wouldn't they've already searched

                          JOE
           Maybe the classroom, but not the

          Drops everything but the necklace. Joe reacts, panicked --
                         
                          JOE
           -- hey, no--
           95.

           Move out.
                         
          Joe's on the verge of tears as Overmyer POCKETS the necklace.
          Off the TERRIFIED BOYS as they're ushered away --
                         
                         
          EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - NIGHT
                         
          The BOYS are put onto the bus -- BOOM DOWN to DONNY'S CAR IN
          THE FOREGROUND, where we realize that WE HAVEN'T BEEN THE
          ONLY AUDIENCE TO THIS: Donny, sunk deep in his seat, hiding,
          watches wide-eyed as the bus DRIVES AWAY.
                         
                          DONNY
           ... oh shit...
                         
          His stoned mind races. Staying hidden from the remaining
          military, Donny scrambles for his CB, turns to CHANNEL 9,
          grabs the mike, speaks quietly, frantic:

           Shhhh.
                         
          Jack moves to Officer Rosko, who reacts to seeing him dressed
          this way --

          suddenly Jack is there, grabs him and pulls him up:

          PAN as Nelec moves back -- we PUSH IN on OVERMYER, who sits
          near the front, putting on his DARK GLOVES. Nelec sits, which
          takes us to a shot towards the back of the bus -- another
          Airman, HERNANDEZ, 40, sits too. PUSH PAST THEM toward our
          four BOYS, sitting cuffed and seat-belted behind the dirty,
          wired SAFETY GLASS, all looking toward us, terrified.
                         
                          CHARLES

           No. They'd never do that.

                          CARY
           I think they're gonna kill us.
                         
                          CHARLES
                          (UNCONVINCING)
           Joe. They're not gonna kill us. You
           know why?
                         
          Joe is suddenly hopeful:
                         
                          JOE
           ... why--?
                         
          But just as he's spoken, a SHAPE FROM THE DARKNESS BEHIND HIM
          SLAMS HARD INTO THE BUS, SPIDER-WEBBING THE BULLETPROOF
          GLASS! The ENTIRE BUS IS ROCKED, Charles SCREAMS, hurt --
                         
          At the front of the bus, NELEC FALLS -- HITS A BENCH, THEN
          CRASHES INTO THE SIDE WINDOW --

                          CHARLES

          EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
                         
          HIGH OVERHEAD: the bus comes to a sudden SCREECHING stop.

                          CHARLES
           Oh my God, guys --
                         
          Joe turns to see NELEC LOADING A RIFLE, straining to see out
          a driver's side window. Mayhem:
                         
                          CHARLES (CONT'D)
           What's that gun --?
                         
          Cary, behind him, actually answers him:
           99.

          Leathwood Art Scope--
                         
          Hernandez makes a radio call, Overmyer straining to see out
          the windows as Nelec locks and loads the unique ammo and
          moves to a driver's side window, tries to see --
                         
                          HERNANDEZ OVERMYER
          -- repeat, contact with

                          HERNANDEZ DRIVER
          -- send support immediately! No sir, nothing!
                         
          Despite his handcuffs, Charles desperately tries to unlatch
          his seatbelt with his shaking hands -- Cary sees this:
                         
                          CARY
           Charles, what are you doing?
                         
                          CHARLES
           I don't feel good about this --
                         
          PUSH IN on Cary, to CLOSEUP, looking PAST CAMERA, TERRIFIED --
                         
                          CARY
           -- oh God -- guys --
                         
          THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD -- THE CREATURE EMERGES FROM THE DARK
          LIKE A GHOST THROUGH BLACK VELVET -- HIT BY THE HEADLIGHTS,
          IT ROARS AT SUCH A PITCH AND VOLUME THAT THE WINDSHIELD
          SPIDERS! It's out of the light and gone again -- PUSH IN ON
          NELEC -- newly terrified, he hands his TRACKING RIFLE to
                         OVERMYER:
                         
                          NELEC
           Here. Tag it.
                         
          Overmyer is stunned for a moment, but hides it well:
                         
                          OVERMYER
           Yessir.
                         
                          NELEC
           Open the door.
                         
          Reluctant as hell, for a tense beat, the Driver pulls the
          controls: the door HISSES LOUDLY as it opens.
           100.
                         
                         
          In the back, the boys are all frozen for a moment, watching.
                         
          Overmyer moves for the door. Five feet away from the door, he
          stops, turns back to Nelec:
                         
                          OVERMYER
           Is there anywhere in particul--
                         
          KKKKRRRRRASSHHH!!!! THE THING REACHES IN -- SHATTERS THE DOOR
          -- the Driver SCREAMS -- the thing GRABS OVERMYER, who DROPS
          THE RIFLE -- IT FIRES -- the projectile HITS THE SAFETY GLASS
          IN FRONT OF THE BOYS AS OVERMYER, GRABBED, BLOOD IN HIS
          MOUTH, TRIES TO HOLD ONTO THE SEATS, REACHING FOR NELEC, WHO
          DOES NOTHING -- OVERMYER IS VIOLENTLY YANKED OUT OF THE BUS --
          Joe IN SHOCK -- Behind him, Martin VOMITS.
                         
                          NELEC
           GET US OUT OF HERE, NOW! NOW!!!
                          (TO HERNANDEZ)
           What kind of firepower do we have?
                         
          CHARLES SCRAMBLES to unlatch his seatbelt --
                         
                          JOE
           Charles! Maybe you should wait!
                         
                          CHARLES
           FOR WHAT?! ANOTHER MONSTER?!?!
                         
          BAAAM!!! The bus is SLAMMED SO HARD --
                         
                         
          EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
                         
          The BUS IS PUSHED TWENTY FEET FROM SOMETHING ON THE OTHER
          SIDE -- THEN IT TIPS OVER AND CRASHES TO THE GROUND:
                         
                         
          INT. TRANSPORT BUS - NIGHT
                         
          Windows SHATTER -- Charles and Cary -- seatbelts removed --
          LAND ON JOE AND MARTIN! The THREE SOLDIERS hit the window-
          floor painfully -- Hernandez so hard he's INSTANTLY
          UNCONSCIOUS! THE BUS IS NOW MOTIONLESS ON ITS SIDE, OPEN DOOR
          UP. Nelec rises. Scared, but pissed.
                         
          The REAR WHEELS of the bus SCREAM in rotation -- we
          COUNTERMOVE with the creature as it COMES AROUND the other
          side, CLIMBS onto the exposed side -- METAL AND WINDOW
                         CRUNCHES --
                         
          The boys gather their wits -- LIGHTS FLASHING HAUNTINGLY --
           101.
                         
                         
                          JOE
           -- you guys okay?!
                         
                          CHARLES
           -- I wanna go home so bad --
                         
          Joe moves to the locked bulletproof glass door -- tries the
          handle -- but it's never gonna open.
                         
          On the OTHER side of the glass, Nelec rights himself,
          momentarily disoriented -- breathing heavily, he moves away
          from the bus door to the locked glass separating him from the
          kids; he tries the handle, but it won't open for him either.
                         
          And there is Joe and Nelec, face-to-face -- Joe seeing the
          fear in Nelec's eyes -- his understanding that this is his
          fate. Somehow Nelec takes this moment to look into Joe's face
          -- to silently -- in a look -- repent. Instantly, Joe knows
          he's about to watch this man's life end.
                         
          SMASH! Nelec turns -- the creature is BUSTING the bus door --
          SMASHING AT IT -- to make it BIGGER. So it can get inside.
          The Driver's LEG IS CAUGHT -- he's trying to get out, but
          cannot -- is PANICKING -- as SSSSTAB!!! The creature KILLS
          HIM INSTANTLY and SMASH as again it tries to WIDEN the door.
          Nelec WINCES -- the only conscious man on this side of the
          glass; the boys COWER on their side, with each monstrous hit,
          all their eyes on Nelec -- except Joe, who only wants to get
          to Alice. He sees the SHATTERED BULLETPROOF WINDOW -- above
          them, on what has become the "roof" of the bus.
                         
                          JOE
           Up there, there's broken glass --
                         
                          MARTIN
           -- here, use me, I'm strong!
                         
                          JOE
           Lemme get on your shoulders!
                         
                          CHARLES
           I'm strong!
                         
          The boys struggle to get Joe onto Martin's shoulders as, on
          the other side of the glass, Nelec scrambles for Hernandez's
          fallen SEMI-AUTO RIFLE. He grabs it and scampers back to the
          glass as SMASH!!! Pieces of metal and glass BURST like ice
          chips as the creature violently WIDENS the bus door opening--
                         
          On Charles' shoulders, Joe can reach the shattered-but-thick
          window -- which he must HIT -- BREAK OPEN to get out --
          essentially exactly what the creature is doing, in reverse.
                         
          Using both fists, Joe POUNDS the window. No give.
           102.
                         
                         
                          MARTIN CARY
          Harder! Come on, you PUSSY!!!
                         
          With all his might, Joe hits the window again -- the
          SLIGHTEST sound of glass adjusting -- meanwhile, SLAM!!! The
          creature BUSTING the bus door -- PRYING it wider like a
          sardine can -- NELEC SITS AGAINST THE GLASS AND OPENS FIRE,
          FUTILELY, ON THE CREATURE. He makes a CALL on his walkie:
                         
                          NELEC
           This is Nelec -- use the big guns.
           Whatever happens to me, you take it
           down, you kill him --
                         
          -- and he drops the walkie and FIRES AGAIN -- the LOUD
          GUNFIRE BARELY AUDIBLE behind the glass with the boys as Joe
          hits the glass again -- BAM -- a CRINKLING of glass --
                         
                          CHARLES
           You can do it!
                         
          Joe hits again -- so does the creature -- as Nelec RUNS OUT
          OF AMMO. That was never really hope anyway. Joe hits again
          and CRASH! The window SHATTERS! Glass chunks RAIN DOWN on the
          boys -- all covering their face -- Cary seeing the CREATURE
          STARTING TO ENTER THE BUS --
                         
                          CARY
           Go! Joe, move!!!
                         
          With all the boys helping, Joe pulls himself up -- outside
          the bus, Joe peeks out -- the fucking creature -- its back to
          Joe -- just fifteen feet away, focused on the door -- and Joe
          strains to climb out here, onto the top-side of the bus.
                         
          And as the boys climb out, the creature climbs in -- first
          Joe, then Charles (AD LIB DIALOGUE WITH CARY AND MARTIN: "You
          gotta lose some weight --" "I know!!!"), Then Cary, and
          Martin last -- they all jump down to the dirt -- they hear
          SCREAMS and turn back for a moment --
                         
          Inside the bus, Nelec watches as the creature ENTERS THE
          TIGHT-FITTING BUS, SMASHING BENCHES, MAKING ITS WAY
          TERRIFYINGLY DOWN THE AISLE TOWARD HIM. And as the creature
          descends upon him, in the silence before the final lunge --
          Nelec says, eerily quietly, terrified:
                         
                          NELEC
           -- it was my turn once... to find
           you. Now... it's your t--
           103.
                         
                         
          Before he can finish, the creature fucking ATTACKS -- and it
          would be horrible and brutal, if the BLOOD DIDN'T SPRAY UPON
          THE BULLETPROOF GLASS -- WHICH OUR CAMERA IS SAFELY BEHIND --
          OBSCURING THE NIGHTMARISH VIEW.
                         
          In the field, a distance away, the boys watch the bus SHUDDER
          and SHAKE. Then... silence. They see the creature burst out
          of the bus -- then RUN OFF -- fast and stealthy, away from
          them in the overgrown grass, like a native hunter. Which, of
          course, is partly what it is. They're sort of stunned.
                         
                          CHARLES
           I just sharteezed a little.
                         
                         
          INT. GREENVILLE AIR FORCE BASE HANGAR - NIGHT
                         
          Louis stares off, lost. Two AIR FORCE SOLDIERS arrive:
                         
                          SOLDIER
           You need to come with us, we have
           some questions for you --
                         
                          LOUIS
           -- what, is she... Is she dead--?
                         
                          SOLDIER TWO
           Just come with us.
                         
          Standing is hard for heartsick Louis, his legs so hurt --
          suddenly JACK IS THERE, acting the role of Air Force:
                         
                          JACK
           Hey fellas, I've got orders from
           Colonel Nelec to personally
           transport this man to base.
                         
                          SOLDIER
           He's all yours, Staff Sergeant.
                         
          As the two Soldiers head off, Jack wraps Louis' arm over his
          shoulders, heads off in the other direction, as Louis looks
          him over, confused:
                         
                          LOUIS
           Where're we going--?
                         
                          JACK
           -- to find our kids.
                         
          On LOUIS' FACE -- a surprised glimmer of HOPE --
           104.
                         
                         
          EXT. TRANSPORT BUS - NIGHT
                         
          Moments later, TIGHT on a POCKET -- Joe pulls out his
          MOTHER'S NECKLACE. WIDEN to see that he's taken the necklace
          from Overmyer's dead body. Cary holds up his backpack.
                         
                          CARY
           Got my fireworks back!
                         
                          CHARLES
           (who gives a shit)
           Congratulations!
                         
          They turn: a car comes, fast -- PUSH IN ON JOE who studies
          the oncoming car, as behind him:
                         
                          MARTIN
           They're coming, man! I think we
           should go!
                         
                          JOE
           No--!!! No, look!
                         
          The car ARRIVES: It's DONNY. He gets out of his car, wild-
          and red-eyed, incredibly happy to see them:
                         
                          DONNY
           Ho ho!!! You dorks are alive! I
           didn't know...!
           (finally sees the bus)
           ... what the FUCK?!
                         
                          JOE
           We need to get back to town!
                         
                          DONNY
           Hop in, man! But you should know: I
           am massively stoned right now.
                         
                          JOE
           You want me to drive?
                         
          Donny looks at Joe, like it hurts to think.
                         
                         
          EXT. LILLIAN SUBURB STREET - NIGHT
                         
          The Catalina cruises fast through the deserted neighborhood --
                         
                         
          INT. DONNY'S CAR - NIGHT
                         
          Joe drives, Donny is ASLEEP. Other boys in the back.
           105.
                         
                         
                          CHARLES
           Joe, where are we going?
                         
                          JOE
           I saw something at the cemetery.
           Woodward said it's subterranean-- I
           think I know where it--
                         
                          CARY
           What's that? What are those sounds?
                         
                          MARTIN
           Guys, that sounds like guns!
                         
                          CARY
           (points to a tank)
           What the hell is that?!
                         
          SUDDENLY, BOOM!!! A DEAFENING, CONCUSSIVE GUNBLAST! They're
          LIT UP by what they see ahead: in the oncoming cross-street,
          TANKS -- TWO OF THEM -- AND A ROCKET-LAUNCHING VEHICLE FIRE
          AGAIN AND AGAIN AT SOMETHING WE CAN'T YET SEE! The boys COVER
          THEIR EARS -- Donny awakens, but only for a moment --
                         
                          CHARLES
           TURN THE CAR AROUND!
                         
          Joe quickly turns left into a driveway -- but we PUSH IN
          TIGHT ON HIM -- from the direction they just came are MORE
          TANKS AND MILITARY VEHICLES -- Joe's eyes go wide -- they're
          stuck. GUNFIRE CONTINUES!
                         
                          JOE
           We gotta go by foot--!
                         
                          CHARLES
           Where?!
                         
                          JOE
           Just follow me!
           (nudges Donny hard))
           Donny! Hey! Donny, wake up!
           (Donny half looks at him)
           We have to get out of here!
                         
                          CARY
           He's too stoned!
                         
                          MARTIN
           Drugs are so bad!
                         
          Joe and the boys get out of the car fast and RUN across the
          street, zig-zagging between the enormous MILITARY VEHICLES --
           106.
                         
                         
          EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT
                         
                          SOLDIER
           Sir, the weapons are misfiring!
           Surface to air, radar -- all of
           them! It's a mess out here, sir.
                         
          Soldier hurries off.
                         
                         
          EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT
                         
          Joe in the lead - they turn and look back -- a massive shot
          of the neighborhood under fire -- houses getting BLOWN TO
          SHIT in collateral damage.
                         
          An EXPLOSION HITS TOO CLOSE -- the boys SCREAM as they run
          BETWEEN HOUSES -- and WE TRACK WITH THEM -- four boys racing
          through a neighborhood under siege -- power GOES OUT -- and
          some explosions are much closer than others -- another BIG
          HIT and they go to a back door of a house -- and go inside --
                         
                         
          INT. NEIGHBORHOOD HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          -- they run in for cover -- they're silhouetted in this dark
          space by the EXPLOSION LIGHT emanating from the windows.
          They're all out of breath in a strange KITCHEN --
                         
                          CARY
           You guys see those explosions? They
           were huge.
                         
                          MARTIN
           -- whose house is this?
                         
                          CARY
           (he hands him a picture)
           Kathy's. I got it off the fridge.
                         
                          MARTIN
           Kathy? Oh, Kathy's cool.
                         
          Another CRAZY LOUD AND BRIGHT EXPLOSION -- the light fixtures
          sway. Charles grabs a coke on the counter.
                         
           MARTIN (CONT'D) CHARLES
          Charles-- that's not yours-- -- what?! I'm thirsty and I'm
           in a war zone!
                         
          Another fucking LOUD BLAST -- sound of GLASS BREAKING -- and
          the creature ROARING --
           107.
                         
                         
          And there it is, in silhouette, moving past the bay window --
          Joe realizes: where the creature is, so are the blasts:
                         
                          JOE
           Come on, guys, let's go. Come on!
                         
          Joe runs -- the others follow --
                         
                          CARY
           Where we going?
                         
                          JOE
           To the cemetery--
                         
          But as they get to the living room a HUGE EXPLOSION BLOWS OUT
          A WALL! They all go down -- but Martin is in agony all of a
          sudden -- his leg RIPPED by concrete. If there's good news
          here, the creature has left this area -- the explosions
          getting further away. But there's blood and Martin is in real
          pain.
                         
                          MARTIN
           What happened to my leg? It hurts.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Oh shit, Martin, you gotta bone
           sticking out of your leg!
                         
                          CARY
           There's a hole in the house!
                         
                          CHARLES
           Joe, gimme that thing on the
           curtains!
                         
          Charles wants the tie around the curtains, still hanging on
          the wall that now has a HOLE in it; MILITARY VEHICLES can be
          seen driving past outside. Joe hands Charles the thick fabric
          tie -- which Charles fashion into a tourniquet, wraps it
          around Martin's leg, tight --
                         
                          JOE
           I'm gonna go find Alice-- you have
           to stay with Martin.
                         
          Charles looks at Martin -- can't argue. Says, sincerely:
                         
                          CHARLES
           ... you gonna be okay without me?
                         
                          JOE
           (a meaningful beat)
           ... yeah.
           108.
                         
                         
          Charles nods -- Joe looks to Cary:
                         
                          CARY
           I'm not staying with the girls!
                         
                          CHARLES
           God, Cary. Shut up!
                         
                          CARY
           Calm down.
                         
                          MARTIN
           Oh, my leg hurts!
                         
                          JOE
           Come on, Cary, we gotta go.
                         
          Joe nods, determined, and he and Cary head off --
                         
                          CHARLES
           This is going to hurt.
                         
          Martin screams.
                         
                          CHARLES (CONT'D)
           I haven't even done it yet.
                         
          Joe and Cary run through the semi-demolished neighborhood,
          many houses shattered, some cars obliterated. The only lone
          figures in town.
                         
                         
          EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT
                         
          Joe and Cary stop, out of breath, at the graves.
                         
                          CARY
           So what are we doing here?
                         
                          JOE
           Just follow me.
                         
                          CARY
           I've been following you for the
           last five blocks. What are we doing
           here?
                         
          Joe and Cary run through the graveyard and over to the
          CARETAKER'S SHED.
           109.
                         
                         
          EXT./INT. CEMETERY CARETAKER'S SHED - NIGHT
                         
          They're out of breath -- they try ONE garage door, windows
          CAKED WITH DIRT. Stuck. The SECOND door. Dirt-caked windows.
          Stuck. The third is a barn door -- they try it: locked.
                         
                          JOE
           Help me!
                         
                          CARY
           Help you with what?
                         
                          JOE
           We need to get inside.
                         
                          CARY
           For what? What's in these windows?
                         
                          JOE
           Cary, help me.
                         
                          CARY
           It's dirt. Why is there dirt in
           these windows?
                         
                          JOE
           Help me, on three.
                         
                          JOE/CARY
           One, two, three.... One, two,
           three.... One, two threee.
                         
          The two begin KICKING the door together -- on three -- one --
          two -- CRASH! Again and again, until finally the door KICKS
          OPEN -- and they almost FALL INSIDE -- and thank goodness
          they didn't -- because -- and now we're looking STRAIGHT DOWN
          FROM INSIDE THE SHED -- the entire floor of the shed has been
          DUG OUT -- DROPPING FORTY FEET STRAIGHT DOWN, dirt PILED,
          caked along the sides of the structure. The boys catch their
          breath.
                         
                          CARY
           Whoa. This is scary.
                         
                          JOE
           You got any sparklers in there?
                         
                          CARY
           Are you kidding me?
                         
          Cary opens his backpack, whips out a Fourth of July SPARKLER.
          LIGHTS it with a lighter and DROPS IT IN. The thing falls far
          enough to tell them it's too far to jump.
           110.
                         
                         
          But burning on the dirt floor of the nearly-dug hole, it
          lights up a TUNNEL at the bottom.
                         
                          JOE
           -- Alice is down there.
                         
                         
          EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
                         
          A JEEP roars past.
                         
                         
          INT. JEEP - NIGHT
                         
          Jack drives fast. Louis sits beside him. It's awkward. But
          not angry. Finally, vulnerable, scared and sad:
                         
                          LOUIS
           I came to your house that day. To
           tell you that I never meant to hurt
           anyone. Swear to God.
           (beat, respectful tears)
           I'm sorry, Jack. About what
           happened to your wife.
                         
          Jack looks at him for a moment, then back to the road. A
          beat. Finally:
                         
                          JACK
           ... It was an accident. It was an
           accident.
                         
          Jack glances at him. A small nod of forgiveness and
          gratitude. Louis wants to cry again, but just accepts it.
                         
                         
          INT. SHED - NIGHT
                         
          Joe begins CLIMBING DOWN the ROPE.
                         
                         
          INT. CEMETERY SHED HOLE - NIGHT
                         
          Joe lands on the bottom. Dark as hell -- looks up -- at Cary
          climbing down into the hole -- the barn roof looming above
          him. Now Cry lands too. There are THREE POSSIBLE WAYS TO GO.
          Joe's mind races about which way to go.
                         
                          CARY
           Joe, I don't understand--
                         
          We HEAR a DISTANT RUMBLING -- like something far off, but
          MECHANICAL. Then:
           111.
                         
                         
                          JOE
           Shhh. This way.
                         
          They begin their walk into the dirt tunnel, a TALL OVAL
          TUNNEL, TWENTY FEET TALL --
                         
                         
          INT. TUNNEL #1 (W/FURNIURE) - NIGHT
                         
          We're SO FAR AWAY, that the screen is mostly black, with a
          small speck of SPARKLY LIGHT.
                         
          They come to an area LITTERED WITH THE STUFF OF A LIVING
          ROOM. They look up: ANOTHER HOLE LEADING DOWN, DUG STRAIGHT
          THROUGH A HOUSE. They continue, coming to an INTERSECTION --
          where a NEW TUNNEL branches off.
                         
                         
          INT. TUNNEL #2 - NIGHT
                         
          There's DIM LIGHT from up ahead, where the tunnel BENDS. The
          RUMBLING/MECHANICAL SOUND LOUDER now. Joe and Cary slowly
          move forward -- seeing something off-camera that scares and
          amazes them all at once.
                         
          IT'S A HUNDRED-FOOT DIAMETER, FORTY-FOOT TALL UNDERGROUND
          SPACE, FILLED WITH A MECHANICAL MARVEL -- A MASSIVE, BIZARRE
          CONTRAPTION COMBINING THOUSANDS OF MECHANICAL PIECES, FROM
          THE MISSING MICROWAVES, CAR ENGINES, ANTENNAS, AND COUNTLESS
          OTHER DEVICES -- WIRES AND CABLES HANG AND CONNECT
          EVERYWHERE, ALL LEADING TO THE DIRT CEILING, HEADING UP, TO
          SOMEWHERE ABOVE GROUND. THE THICK-WITH-FUMES SPACE CHUGS AND
          HUMS WITH A SLOWLY INCREASING PITCH, AS IT IT'S WARMING UP,
          GETTING READY TO FINALLY, ACTUALLY WORK.
                         
          They cross to the other side. Cary bumps into a HANGING
          SHERIFF PRUITT. Cary is about to scream, but Joe puts a hand
          on his mouth and leads him away from Pruitt.
                         
                          CARY
           It's Sheriff Pruitt.
                         
                          JOE
           I know. Cary look.
                         
          Makeshift HANGING BULBS provide some light; a number of other
          TUNNELS are visible from here, too. Joe and Cary look at the
          space in disbelief.
                         
                          CARY
           What is this?
                         
                          JOE
           We're under the water tower.
           112.
                         
                         
          Then Joe sees something that makes him grab at Cary's shirt.
          Cary looks: THROUGH THE MASS OF METAL AND MACHINERY AND
          DANGLING CABLES, AT THE OTHER END OF THIS UNDERGROUND
          EXPERIMENT, IS THE CREATURE. HUNCHED OVER. BACK TO THE BOYS.
          AND IT'S SAVAGELY EATING SOMETHING. IT MOVES A BIT: WE SEE
          IT'S A HUMAN LEG. Joe and Cary would SCREAM if they didn't
          need to stay quiet. In a panicked WHISPER:
                         
                          CARY
           It's eating a person.
                         
          Joe moves away from Cary to get a better view of the other
          side of the machinery -- and there he sees, in an INSET
          section of the rock-wall, THREE HUMAN BODIES, HANGING
          LIFELESS FROM THEIR FEET, WRAPPED IN SOME KIND OF THIN
          SHELLAC. TIGHT ON JOE as he sees, among them, ALICE. His
          heart POUNDS, his resolve quadruples. Cary sees her too --
                         
                          JOE
           She's here. We're going to use your
           firecrackers.
                         
                          CARY
           I don't think it's going to hurt
           it, Joe.
                         
                          JOE
           There are other tunnels.
                         
                          CARY
           So?
                         
                          JOE
           I need you to make noise. Lots of
           it, right here, in two minutes.
           Make it loud and make it last--
           gimme some sparklers.
                         
                          CARY
           (goes through his bag)
           -- why-- what are you gonna do--?
                         
                          JOE
           (takes SPARKLERS and a
           LIGHTER from Cary)
           Make sure you're gone by the time
           it blows: you can't be here, you
           gotta run.
                         
                          CARY
           Where are you going?
           113.
                         
                         
          But Joe's already gone. Stay with Cary, who opens his
          backpack, starts pulling out his amazing array of EXPLOSIVES,
          glancing up to make sure he's out of the creature's view --
                         
                         
          INT. TUNNEL #3 - NIGHT
                         
          MOVE FAST with Joe as he races, a LIT SPARKLER giving him his
          light -- the MECHANICAL RUMBLING all but gone now. Joe runs,
          looking for another way into the creature's massive space --
          he finally finds another INTERSECTION -- he turns into it --
          he disappears down the tunnel --
                         
                         
          INT. TUNNEL #2 - NIGHT
                         
          Cary's made a long, insane pile of FIRECRACKERS -- he uses an
          OPEN M-80 and begins laying a SQUIGGLY, LONG LINE OF GUN
          POWDER back, away from the firecrackers -- away from the
          entrance to the creature's CONTRAPTION space.
                         
                         
          INT. TUNNEL #4 - NIGHT
                         
          Joe races down the dirt tunnel, the SOUND OF THE MECHANICAL
          RUMBLING -- and its INCREASING PITCH -- getting LOUDER. The
          SPARKLER DIES as LIGHT BEGINS TO REVEAL JOE, who slows --
          peers around the dirt tunnel bend -- he is now on the OTHER
          SIDE of the space. He sees the creature -- then looks across
          to the lifeless body of Alice. His heart sinks.
                         
                         
          INT. TUNNEL #2 - NIGHT
                         
          Cary's done laying out the charges -- he pulls out his
          lighter -- FFFT! FFFT! The damn thing won't light --
                         
                          CARY
           -- come on-- damnit!
                         
          FFT! FFT! No go -- he keeps trying.
                         
                         
          INT. TUNNEL #4 - NIGHT
                         
          Joe watches as the creature FINISHES WITH ITS MEAL AND HEADS
          FOR THE OTHER HANGING BODIES -- PUSH IN ON JOE, DESPERATE --
                         
                          JOE
           -- Cary, come on, come on--
           114.
                         
                         
          INT. TUNNEL #2 - NIGHT
                         
          Cary frantically trying the lighter -- FFT! FFT! FFT!
                         
                          CARY
           -- damnit!!!
                         
          He looks up -- watches the creature GRAB AND PULL ALICE'S
          LIFELESS BODY DOWN FROM HER HANGING POSITION -- it moves with
          her to where he was eating the teacher -- Cary SHAKES THE
          LIGHTER, STARTING TO CRY AND HE FLICKS IT AND FFFFFTH!!! IT
          LIGHTS! HE TOUCHES IT ON THE GUN POWDER AND RUNS OFF --
                         
                         
          INT. MECHANICAL CONTRAPTION SPACE - NIGHT
                         
          The creature PULLS AWAY the fibrous covering over Alice --
          its TENTACLES SLITHER OUT.
                         
                         
          INT. TUNNEL #4 - NIGHT
                         
          Watching this is horror, Joe's about to run in just as
          BABABABABABABABAM!!! The creature JERKS UP from its almost-
          meal of Alice, looks toward the EXPLOSIVE SOUNDS, then LEAVES
          HER, quickly moving for the tunnel --
                         
                         
          INT. TUNNEL #2 - NIGHT
                         
          The creature arrives in the SMOKE-FILLED TUNNEL, as the
          FIREWORKS FILL the tunnel with BRIGHT, MULTI-COLORED LIGHTS --
                         
                         
          INT. MECHANICAL CONTRAPTION SPACE - NIGHT
                         
          Joe SPRINTS in, gets to Alice -- lightly slaps her face --
                         
                          JOE
           -- Alice, please -- please --
           (nothing -- SLAP)
           Alice, wake up!
                         
          Nothing -- so he fucking SLAPS HER FACE HARD and she suddenly
          INHALES SHARPLY, he eyes WIDE, terrified --
                         
                          JOE (CONT'D)
           Alice! You're alive! Can you hear
           me? Are you okay?!
                         
          She's CATCHING HER BREATH, nodding, looking at him, amazed --
           115.
                         
                         
                          ALICE
           What is this? What are you doing
           here?!
                         
                          JOE
           I'm just-- doing the best I can to
           save you.
                         
          She GRABS HIM AND HUGS HIM TIGHT, teary and grateful --
          during which -- quietly:
                         
                          ALICE
           How did you know?
                         
                          JOE
           Your dad. He told me. He was
           worried. And flipping out.
                         
                          ALICE
           Really?
                         
                          JOE
           -- we need to move--
                         
          But she breaks out of the hug and grabs his shirt, intense:
                         
           TINA (O.S.)
           Excuse me?
                         
          TINA, a 24-year-old , disoriented woman with curlers in her
          hair, wakes up.
                         
                          TINA (CONT'D)
           Where are we?
                         
                         
          INT. MECHANICAL CONTRAPTION SPACE - NIGHT
                         
          Joe and Alice have helped down one FAMILIAR FACE: SHERIFF
          PRUITT. They're out of breath, but their survival instinct
          has kicked in:
                         
                          TINA
           I left my bag in my car. Then I
           went to my car to get my bag--
                         
                          ALICE
           It's been experimented on for
           years. It's terrified and exhausted
           and hungry, it just wants to go
           home. When it touched me, I knew --
           116.
                         
                         
                          JOE
           Alice, help me get the sheriff
           down.
                         
                          TIME CUT:
                         
                          SHERIFF PRUITT
           Follow me. I can get us out of
           here.
                         
                          JOE
           Sheriff, we came that way.
                         
                          SHERIFF PRUITT
           Don't argue with me.
                         
                          TINA
           Come on, kids, let's go with the
           sheriff.
                         
          Joe and Alice follow. They run into a tunnel. We PUSH IN ON
          THE MECHANICAL DEVICE -- the PITCH INCREASING MORE NOW -- AS
          IF IT'S ABOUT TO "FUNCTION" -- The creature returns and sees
          that the humans are gone. He takes off.
                         
                         
          INT. TUNNEL #4 - NIGHT
                         
          Sparkler lighting the way, we're with Joe and Alice -- Pruitt
          and Tina behind them:
                         
                          JOE
           Sheriff, I really think we're going
           the wrong way.
                         
                          PRUITT
           We'll talk about it when we get up
           top.
                         
          They continue following Pruitt.
                         
           CARY (O.S.)
           Joe!
                         
                          JOE
           I told you to get out!
                         
                          CARY
           I thought this was the way out. I
           tried! Hey, Alice, welcome back--
                         
                          PRUITT
           Kids, come on, we gotta go.
           117.
                         
                         
          BUT HE'S LOOKING BACK AND HIS SPARKLER ILLUMINATES THE
          CREATURE THAT IS RIGHT UP AHEAD AND TINA SCREAMS -- THEY ALL
          DO AS PRUITT TURNS AND IS TAKEN, LIFTED HIGH, KILLED IN THE
          DARK AS THEY ALL TURN AND RUN -- PRUITT'S HORRIBLE SCREAMS
          terrifying as the foursome sprint in the opposite direction!
          After RUNNING HARD for a beat:
                         
          They haul ass, but after a long moment TINA IS GRABBED AWAY
          INTO THE DARKNESS!!! HER SCREAMS CONTINUE behind them --
                         
          They run and run and run, but then BOOM: they hit a DEAD END.
          A DIRT WALL. No more tunnels. No options. Out of breath, they
          turn -- but dare not go back toward the horrifying blackness.
          The only SOUND the sparkler, their erratic breathing and the
          DISTANT INCREASING PITCH OF THE CREATURE'S MECHANICAL DEVICE.
                         
          THE CREATURE IS THERE -- FORTY FEET FROM THEM, --
          APPROACHING! ALICE SCREAMS -- SHE AND CARY MORE BACK AGAINST
          THE WALL -- AND THE CREATURE MOVES FOR THEM, BUT JOE YELLS AS
          THE THING PASSES THE FIREWORKS:
                         
                          JOE
           GO! YOU DON'T WANNA BE HERE, GO!
                         
                          CARY
           Joe, what are you doing?
                         
          IT KEEPS COMING -- PAST THE FIREWORKS, AMAZINGLY BACKLIT AS
          IT LUMBERS TOWARD JOE, DESPERATELY TRYING TO STAND GROUND:
                         
                          JOE
           WE UNDERSTAND! WE KNOW HOW HARD
           IT'S BEEN! BUT NOT EVERYONE IS
           HORRIBLE!
                         
                          CARY
           Joe, shut up, it's gonna kill you!
                         
                          JOE
           YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY NOW!
                         
          AND IT GRABS JOE AND LIFTS HIM -- Alice and Cary SCREAM AS
          JOE IS BEING SQUEEZED -- HE LOOKS INTO THE GLOSSY BLACK EYES
          OF THIS BEAST, WHICH COULD KILL HIM AT ANY TIME -- but in
          this moment of fear comes something else. Simple truth -- he
          WHISPERS, SHAKILY:
                         
                          JOE (CONT'D)
           -- I know bad things happen-- bad
           things happen, but you can still
           live. You can still live, you can
           still live, you're gonna be okay--
           118.
                         
                         
          JUST AS WE THINK THE CREATURE'S GONNA KILL HIM: A DISTANT
          MECHANICAL TONE -- THE CREATURE TURNS, ACKNOWLEDGING THAT
          SOUND -- THEN TO JOE AGAIN. IT CONSIDERS HIM. ITS EYES'
          COVERING PEELS AWAY -- REVEALING HUGE, WET, VULNERABLE EYES.
          AND THE THING LOOKS AT HIM. REALLY LOOKS AT HIM. In a way, as
          you imagine his mother once had. And Joe feels this too. AND
          AFTER A LONG, SCARY BEAT, THE CREATURE SETS HIM DOWN. Joe
          backs up as the creature TURNS FAST AND SPEEDS AWAY. JOE IS
          STUNNED. SHOCKED RELIEF. ALICE AND CARY, TOO --
                         
                          CARY
           Okay, wait a minute, WHAT?!
                         
          Then, over the HIGH-PITCHED MECHANICAL SOUND comes RUMBLINGS -
          - like THUNDER from above -- and the three LOOK UP --
                         
                         
          EXT. LILLIAN, OHIO - MAIN STREET - NIGHT
                         
          The kids round a corner -- ON MAIN STREET, COUNTLESS METALLIC
          OBJECTS -- ANYTHING METAL AND LOOSE -- has been INVISIBLY
          DRAGGED -- FLOATING -- toward the WATER TOWER -- at different
          speeds and with different personalities, metal objects BULLET
          TO THE TOP OF THE TOWER AND STICK THERE.
                         
          Suddenly, THE DINER WINDOW SHATTERS as a STOVE RIPS THROUGH
          IT -- we PAN WITH IT as it TUMBLES TOWARD AND UP THE WATER
          TOWER! HUNDREDS OF OBJECTS move past them -- from bicycles to
          silverware and sinks! DISHWASHERS AND TVS SMASH THROUGH THE
          TOWN'S APPLIANCE STORE WINDOW -- A TV FLOATS, UNPLUGGED, PAST
          THE KIDS -- AND IT IS ON -- AND SHOWS AN EPISODE FROM THE
          TWILIGHT ZONE -- all things eventually SLAMMING into the
          WATER TOWER, the objects BEGINNING TO CRUSH TOGETHER, FORMING
          ONE DENSE METALLIC MASS!
                         
          BAM! BAMBAM! Sounds like GUN BLASTS -- the KIDS TURN: behind
          them are the RED CARGO CONTAINERS -- ONE BY ONE those cubes
          BURST THROUGH THE CONTAINERS: BAM! BAMBAMBAM! BAMBAM! And
          they SLAM INTO THE WATER TOWER -- AND THEY BEGIN TO FORM AN
          ODD, HUGE CRESCENT SHAPE ABOVE THE TOWER! Alice is cry-
          laughing at seeing it work --
                         
                          CARY
           -- what's he doing...?
                         
                          JOE
           ... he's making a model.
                         
          AGAIN and AGAIN, pieces FLY OVERHEAD, beginning to FORM WHAT
          IS CLEARLY AN ALIEN CRAFT -- LIGHTS BEGINNING TO ILLUMINATE
          FROM INSIDE as it continues -- ONE OF THE SPOTLIGHTS
          ILLUMINATING A JEEP THAT HAS JUST ARRIVED: JACK GETS OUT. HE
          SEES JOE. JOE IS SURPRISED TO SEE HIM -- ALICE CONCERNED.
           119.
                         
                         
          BUT THEN THE KIDS ARE BOTH INCREDULOUS TO SEE JACK HELP LOUIS
          OUT OF THE JEEP -- THE TWO MEN MOVE THROUGH THE DEBRIS IN THE
          STREETS, STUNNED AT THE ACTIVITY SURROUNDING THEM, BUT
          FOCUSED ON THEIR CHILDREN; A TUMBLING TYPEWRITER ALMOST TAKES
          OUT JACK, BUT HE AVOIDS IT AS IT SHOOTS UP TO THE WATER
          TOWER.
                         
          JACK GETS TO HIS SON -- HOLDS HIS SHOULDERS -- LOOKS DEEPLY
          INTO HIS EYES, TOUCHES HIS FACE AND EMBRACES HIM --
                         
                          JACK
           -- I got you. I got you.
                         
          LOUIS, CRYING, DESPERATELY SORRY -- AND SHE SEES THIS IN HIS
          SAD, WOUNDED FACE -- SHE HOLDS OUT A HAND -- HE TAKES IT AND
          PULLS HER INTO AN EMBRACE, HUGGING HIS DAUGHTER DESPERATELY.
                         
          BEHIND THEM, THE SHIP CONTINUES TO TAKE SHAPE, ALMOST FULLY-
          FORMED -- but here, as he is being hugged by his father, Joe
          LOOKS DOWN: SOMETHING IN HIS POCKET Is MOVING -- he considers
          it, confused for a moment -- but he reaches in and pulls it
          out. HIS MOTHER'S NECKLACE -- and he holds the chain, but the
          LOCKET PULLS TOWARD THE WATER TOWER -- wanting to go.
                         
          Joe knows what this means. He looks up at his father, who
          also understand. AND THIS IS WHEN WE GO INTO SLOW MOTION --
          FROM HERE UNTIL THE END. After a long beat, Joe HOLDS THE
          NECKLACE UP, toward the tower -- the thing PULLING... TEARS
          in Joe's eyes as he looks up at it -- not wanting to let go,
          but knowing he must. Jack, heartsick, watches his son, on the
          verge of letting go. Alice watches Joe, on the verge of tears
          -- except Joe just can't bring himself to do it, not now, not
          ever. But then something happens.
                         
          Pulled by the invisible force, THE LOCKET POPS OPEN. And we
          see what's inside. A PHOTOGRAPH of Joe's MOTHER. A young
          woman, HOLDING HER ONE SMALL BABY. And Joe looks at his
          mother -- and in this moment, she at him and Jack's eyes
          suddenly WELL WITH TEARS -- Alice, too, tears streaming down
          her face and finally Jack reaches out -- and puts his hand on
          his son's shoulder -- which was all Joe needed, really.
                         
          And finally... after all... JOE LETS GO. OUR SCORE SOARS AS,
          IN SLOW MOTION, the necklace SHOOTS ACROSS THE MAIN STREET UP
          TO THE WATER TOWER!
                         
          AND WHEN IT HITS, THE ENTIRE TOWER IMPLODES FROM PRESSURE --
          A FIREWORKS-LIKE EXPLOSION OF WATER BURSTS AND SHOWERS THE
          STREET AS THE MAJESTIC SHIP COMPLETES ITS FORMATION -- and
          that's when Joe sees the CREATURE, LEAVING -- CLIMBING UP THE
          WATER TOWER AND ENTERS HIS SHIP -- AND IT BEGINS TO LIFT. AS
          IT TAKES OFF, THE WEIGHT OF THE TOWER IS TOO MUCH: IT
          COLLAPSES INTO MAIN STREET.
           120.
                         
                         
          THE SHIP RISES SLOWLY INTO THE SKY -- ITS PURE WHITE
          SPOTLIGHTS FINALLY SCANNING THE GROUND BENEATH IT -- LILLIAN,
          OHIO -- EARTH -- A PLANET IT IS FINALLY LEAVING --
                         
                         
          INT./EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          And we PUSH IN on Charles and Marin, who watch, amazed, as
          the distant light RISES INTO THE SKY --
                         
                         
          EXT. DRIVEWAY - NIGHT
                         
          And we PUSH IN as DONNY SLEEPS, the REFLECTION OF THE RISING
          SHIP seen in his windshield --
                         
                         
          EXT. LILLIAN, OHIO - MAIN STREET - NIGHT
                         
          Joe and Alice, Jack, Louis and Cary watch, amazed, as the
          ship disappears into the night sky, we are TIGHT ON JOE'S
          HAND, as it takes ALICE'S.
                         
          And looking skyward, Joe smiles.
                         
          As our SCORE SWELLS, we finally...
                         
           FADE TO BLACK.
                         
                         
                          THE END

EXT. SPACE	

THE CAMERA PULLS BACK. . . 

INT. ARGO CITY

AND REVEALS THE inside of a domed city honeycombed with fantastic arches. The city is inhabited by young beautiful people in luxurious but simple costumes.

THE CAMERA ROAMS through the City, observing some people seated at a kind of cafe sipping drinks and relaxing; other people are in some kind of exercise class doing beautiful graceful movement; and finally a class of five year old children listen intently to a teacher who is demonstrating a molecular model.

					TEACHER
				And now, who can give me the electron 
				wave functions for Kryptonian covalent 
				bonding?

The five year olds eagerly raise their hands. The teacher points to one.

CHILD
				The cube root of the wavelength over the 
natural log of the integral of the speed of 
light squared.

The teacher smiles.

TEACHER
				Well, maybe that was a bit too easy...

THE CAMERA ROAMS ON through the city, following the sound of a strange, ethereally beautiful singing. The CAMERA discovers the source of the sound: an ARTIST sculpting a beautiful crystalline object with a MATTERWAND. The wand makes the singing noise as it creates matter out of energy. The Artist, whose name is ZALTAR, sometimes whistles along in counterpoint. .

A small girl is watching him with fascination. Her name is Kara, and she is seven.

Behind her, the dome, which encloses the City, marks the edge of the limbo outside.

KARA
What are you making:

	ZALTAR
It's going to be a tree, I think.




KARA 
What's a tree?

	ZALTAR
It's something they have on Earth. You know,
 where your cousin went.

	KARA 
Where is Earth?

	ZALTAR
Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in 
school?

	KARA
Yes, I know the equations---I just can't see it in 
my head.

Zaltar laughs.

					ZALTAR
				Even I have trouble with that sometimes. Earth is in 
outer space. And we're in inner space. 

	KARA
I don't understand.

	ZALTAR
Wait till you're older. Here -- watch this. 

Zaltar takes a small OMEGAHEDRON out of his pocket and holds it in his hand.

					ZALTAR.
				This is one of the four Power Sources of the City. 
I borrowed it from the Guardians. Look what I 
can do with it. 

Zaltar touches his MATTER.WAND to the OMEGAHEDRON and the wand instantly becomes charged with flickering light. He touches his wand to the tree sculpture---and the 
sculpture comes alive with dancing lights and shadows. Kara claps her hands with delight 
at the spectacle. Zaltar steps back and admires his handiwork. He carefully puts down the
OMEGAHEDRON at his feet, takes a small flask from his belt, and drinks.

				ZALTAR
			You see, a tree is a living thing.

				KARA
			Can you create life?

	
ZALTAR
				No, no, just the illusion of life. A kind of 
half-life, maybe. A pale shadow of the real 
thing. But it is lovely, the way the light plays 
over the surface. . . 

A woman's voice can be heard calling in the distance.

WOMAN'S VOICE 
Kara. Kara.

Kara calls out in reply.

					KARA 
I'm here, mother.

Kara's mother ALURA appears through the lacey architecture of the city.

ALURA
				Kara, you shouldn't be so near the Edge 
without a grown-up.

	KARA
I'm sorry, Mother.

	ZALTAR
I was keeping an eye on her.


Alura puts her arm around her daughter affectionately, showing she's not really angry. Together they watch Zaltar's latest sculpture, flickering with the play of inner light and shadow.

ALURA
				Thank you, Zaltar, but she has to obey the rules.

Zaltar takes another swig from his flask. and lowers his voice confidentially.

ZALTAR
				You and your husband have been kind to me, 
Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going 
away. Soon.

	ALURA 
But where?


Zaltar bends down to Kara and hands her his matterwand.

ZALTAR
				Put your fingers there, Kara. And press hard.

She does, and the wand makes a horrible squawk. Kara laughs with delight.

ZALTAR
				Good. Now, go make something pretty.

Kara scampers away, hardly able to believe her good fortune, and starts to make all kinds of 
surprising sounds with the wand on the plaza nearby. Zaltar speaks to Alura in a low, confidential voice.

ZALTAR
I've discovered a new way into the Phantom 
Zone.

	ALURA
But the phantom Zone is for criminals.

	ZALTAR
It's big. And empty. I'm tired of limiting myself 
to  Argo City. I want to do something new. I'm 
starting to repeat myself here with this airy, 
glittery stuff....

Zaltar waves a hand deprecatingly at the city around him.

ALURA
				But Zaltar---you founded the city! It's yours. We 
were all just refugees from Krypton when you gathered 
us together and brought us here, to the inner dimension. 
You can't abandon us now. You have a responsibility to us!

In the background, Kara has been modeling a spiky insect-like CREATURE. Now she suddenly finds the OMEGAHEDRON on the ground beside her. She doesn't stop to wonder how it got there from beside Zaltar's feet. She simply picks up the OMEGAHEDRON and touches it to the spiky creature. The creature suddenly flicks its wings and COMES TO LIFE, unnoticed by the adults. Kara drops the wand and laughs out loud with delight as the magical creature takes off from the ground and starts flying in circles around her head, glittering as if it were made of diamonds.

ZALTAR
I'm an artist, Alura. My work comes first. Other 
people come second.

	ALURA
How can you create beauty...with a selfish heart?
The spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. Her look of delight turns to fear. She tries to shoo the creature away. It flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city.

The spiky creature flies into the membrane and tears a ragged hole in it. With a giant WHOOSH all the air in the city starts to rush out the hole. Kara is swept along toward the hole by the wind. She cries out and stretches pleading hands toward her mother. THE OMEGAHEDRON is swept toward the hole as well. Kara grabs onto the ragged edge of the membrane.

ZALTAR 
Kara---the Power Source!

Kara reaches for it, but it is too far from her, and the OMEGAHEDRON is sucked out into infinity by the wind. Zaltar picks up the matterwand from where Kara dropped it and touches her with the wand. She is instantly held fast. Zaltar pulls her back inside. He gives her to her mother Alura. Then Zaltar touches his wand to the membrane and seals the hole with masterful chords like a brass choir. 

The wind dies down and all is silent, except for the quiet sobbing of Kara in her mother's arms. Zaltar kneels down beside her and strokes her golden hair  tenderly.

KARA
				I'm sorry... I didn't know.

					ZALTAR
				It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use 
the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.

	ALURA
But the Power Source, Zaltar.

	ZALTAR
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do 
with three.

	ALURA
But what will happen?

	ZALTAR 
The Guardians will be angry. They may even 
send me to the Phantom Zone. You see, I didn't 
really have permission to borrow it. I must go 
explain to them...

Zaltar hurries off nervously. THE CAMERA HOLDS ON KARA'S FACE as she senses this may be her last sight of Zaltar.

DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. A SPRINGTIME MEADOW - U.S.A. - DAY. UNDER TITLES

A beautiful blonde in jeans and a frilly blouse is walking across a field of wildflowers. Butterflies flitter and dart from flower to flower. The blonde's name is SELENA. She is our ideal image of the girl next door, who grew up into a dynamite lady.

Her current boyfriend follows along behind her, lugging a big wicker hamper from their pickup truck parked at the edge of the road. Selena finds a grassy spot under an old oak. and spreads out a red and white checked gingham cloth..

SELENA 
Over here George. It's the perfect spot. Nice view.

George sets down the wicker basket and Selena starts to unpack a scrumptious picnic of home cooked food. She unpacks fried chicken, hard-boiled eggs, potato salad, cold beer and a big rich creamy-frosted devils food cake.

					GEORGE
				You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks 
too pretty to eat.

	SELENA
Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's 
all covered with ants.

She hands him a chicken drumstick and a hard-boiled egg.

					GEORGE
				Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled 
down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle
down with than you.

SELENA
				Why George, are you proposing?

					GEORGE
Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring 
in much now, but...

SELENA
				George---I thought you'd never ask.

A shrill whistling sound from above makes them look up. With a loud plop and a spatter of icing the OMEGAHEDRON falls into the middle of the chocolate cake.

GEORGE
				What the heck is that?

They look up in the boughs of the tree overhead, and then down at the chocolate cake splashed all over the checked cloth.

SELENA
A squirrel Frisbee?

Selena reaches out and picks up the OMEGAHEDRON. It comes away from the cake without a trace of the chocolate icing sticking to its surface, as if made of some substance, which repels other kinds of matter.

Selena holds the shining Omegahedron in her hand and examines it, turning it around and around as if hypnotized. Her face takes on a new expression. Almost as if the simple, wholesome innocence of her nature had been blasted away by some profound new knowledge of the universe.

SELENA
				That's funny. I'd swear I know just what this is, 
but I've never seen it before.

She stands up and walks across the checkered cloth, in a beeline for the pickup truck.

GEORGE
				Hey, where you going?

					SELENA
				     (calling over her shoulder) 
I've got things to do.

	GEORGE 
What about my proposal?

	SELENA 
         (dismissively) 
Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.

She gets in the pickup and. drives away.

GEORGE 
Hey! My truck!

DISSOLVE TO:








 KARA' S FACE

She is ten years older now, a young lady. Almost ready to assume the long flowing gown of an adult, but still in the tunic worn by those under eighteen.

ALURA
				      (voice over)
				But Kara, you are too young to go.

ANOTHER ANGLE. ARGO CITY. DIMMED

They are in the assembly amphitheater of the city, where the kindergarten nuclear physics class was seen. Kara is in the centre of the ring, with adults seated in scattered rows around her. Her parents Zor-El and Alura are standing in front of her.

KARA
				I am almost an adult. This is what I want.

ZOR-EL
				But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to 
Earth. The journey is dangerous.

	KARA
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.

	ZOR-EL
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.

	KARA
I allowed it to escape the City.

	ALURA
Ever since we told you how your cousin Superman 
was sent there as an infant, all you have wanted to do 
was visit this place.

	KARA
Yes, I do want to go. But someone must go. Our 
scanning shows the Power Source has finally 
reached the Earth. It could destroy everything unless 
someone brings it back.

	ZOR-EL 
Superman will return it.

	KARA
Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should 
have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He 
may be dead.
ZOR-EL
But what can you, a mere girl-

	KARA
I'll have super powers there. Like him. We can't wait. 
Our lights are fading. Look around you. When I was a 
child the City was bright and shining. Look at it now.

Zor-El and Alura sigh. There is no denying that the brilliance of Argo City has been much dimmed since Kara was a little girl.

					ALURA
				What do your teachers think?

Zor-El looks around the circle. A beautiful woman speaks.

					TEACHER
				It would be sad to lose one of our finest young ones 
to the dimension barrier-- but the City cannot last much 
longer without the Power Source. It is her future she's 
fighting for, Zor-El.

	ZOR-EL
Very well, let it be done.

Alura embraces Kara emotionally, fighting back the tears. Kara too is struggling to control her own emotions.

KARA
				Don't worry, Mother, I'll be all right. I've studied 
the transmissions from Earth. I know their customs.

Kara walks out of the amphitheater with her parents.

ALURA
				But they are such strange, unstable people.

					KARA
				Then I will learn to act strange like them.

Kara holds up a small handbag. Inside we glimpse red and blue material.

					KARA
				I have made clothing and copies of their money, I 
will be fine.




Her father puts his hand on her shoulder .

					ZOR-EL
				Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.

					KARA
				As brave as my father. As wise.

They embrace, briefly. Kara then steps onto a circular platform set into the pavement of the city.

 Instantly transparent bubble forms around her.

Her parents watch as she floats away.

She passes into an air lock through the membrane that surrounds the City, and off into an infinity of space.

MONTAGE: THE JOURNEY OF KARA INSIDE "HER SPHERE FROM THE INNER DIMENSION TO OUR WORLD.

Her sphere moves from blackness, to a dark green limbo. The atmosphere thickens around her. Soon it is unmistakably water, and she is heading toward the light above. A fish darts past with a flash of silver. The sphere rushes upward faster and faster. It breaks the surface of the , water. Kara springs free of the bubble, which disappears. She is now wearing a blue and red costume like her cousin Superman.

She lands on a nearby beach.
 
EXT. EARTH.  BEACH BESIDE THE SEA. SUNRISE

She looks around her, feasting with her eyes on the details of this new exciting world.

Kara bends down and picks up a stone from the ground at her feet. To her astonishment, she 
crushes it to powder in her hand, and blows the fine dust away with a blast of superbreath.

She looks down at her feet, so firmly planted on the ground. She rises a few inches into the air, and reacts with amazement. Then she looks up into the blue sky overhead and her expression of astonishment is replaced by a look of joyous longing. With a sudden impulse she shoots straight upward.

EXT. HIGH ABOVE THE EARTH.  DAY

Kara loops and rolls, swoops and circles, laughing with sheer delight.





EXT. HIGH ABOVE MOUNTAIN MEADOWS.  HORSES.  DAY

Kara swoops down at a herd of horses. The herd parts and gallops off in all directions as she pulls out of her dive and flies away.

CUT TO:
 EXT. MOUNTAINTOP.  DAY

Kara lands on a mountaintop and admires the view. The she bends down and scoops up a handful of snow. She stares at it with awe.

INSERT. MICROSCOPIC SHOT OF SNOW CRYSTALS IN ALL THEIR INFINITE VARIETY AND BEAUTY.

BACK TO SCENE.  DAY

Kara stands up, smiling. She flies into the air again.

EXT. FOREST.  DAY

She lands and walks among the huge trunks of a primeval forest. Shafts of sunlight pierce the gloom. These trees are much more impressive than Zaltar's imitation back in Argo City. She hears a mournful sound and pulls back a spray of brambles. She sees a BABY DEER hopelessly tangled in the long canes. She shoots RAYS OF HEAT VISION from her eyes and slices through the tough stems. The fawn scrambles free, and scampers off into the forest. Kara watches it with a benevolent smile. She removes a brunette wig and some street clothing from a secret pocket in her cape.

EXT. MANSION --- GARDEN PARTY

A big impressive house somewhere in the Middle West. People mill about on the neatly manicured lawn sipping drinks and snagging hors d'oeuvres off silver trays from. passing waiters. All the quests have a name tag on, like at some kind of conference.

SELENA, the blonde who discovered the Power Source, is circulating among the quests. She has changed since we saw her last. No longer the girl next door, she now wears a fabulous designer dress dripping with jewels. She walks with the regal air of someone used to being obeyed, and graciously accepts the homage of the quests. A smile, a nod, a kind word from her leaves them all basking in the warm afterglow of her attention. But we notice odd details of the party: the decorations are all based on mystic occult symbols. At the refreshment table, there is a big ten-foot WICKER SCULPTURE OF A FEMALE GOAT covered with paper flowers. And the quests all have an indefinable air of strangeness about them. BIANCA, a tall cold-eyed brunette in black silk dress, whispers in Selena's ear .

BIANCA
				Be careful. Nigel is going to try something.



					SELENA
				Don't worry about old Nigel, I can take care of him. 
He's just a sore loser.

An ELDERLY MAN in a three-piece pin-stripe suit grabs her elbow.

ELDERLY MAN
				I don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes.

SELENA 
What do you want?

	ELDERLY MAN 
Western Europe.

	SELENA
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could 
have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.

	ELDERLY MAN
No problem. She can have it. I hate mountains.

Selena leaves him negotiating boundary lines with Bianca and strolls over to a sour-faced man in suede who has been scowling at her over his cigarette.

SELENA 
Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world.

NIGEL
				It may well be. I know how you won that election 
Selena. You can't fool me.

	SELENA
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me...
I'm going places.

					NIGEL
				You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville.
You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all 
these people have served years and years of apprenticeship.
Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. 
You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.

Selena smirks at him, self-confidently.

SELENA
				I just did. Because I have the Power.

					NIGEL
				You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow 
is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over. 

Nigel drops his cigarette, stubs it out on the lawn, and takes out his platinum cigarette case.

SELENA
Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as 
long as I don't go too far. 

	NIGEL
Cigarette?

He holds the shiny mirror-like cigarette case in front of her so she can see her reflection.

INSERT. SURFACE OF THE CIGARETTE CASE. Selena's reflection. She is still the glamorous beauty, but looming behind her...invisible to ordinary eyes...is a DARK EERIE SHAPE OF SOMETHING HIDEOUS.

BACK TO SCENE.

Quick as a cat, Selena bats the cigarette case out of his hand and sends it spinning into the shrubbery. All traces of the Shadow behind her have disappeared.

					NIGEL
				Sorry. Forgot you were trying to quit.


Nigel snags a glass of champagne off the tray of a nearby waiter and sips it insolently.

SELENA
				Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering 
back.
Nigel shakes his head.

NIGEL
				You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save 
you from a terrible fate.

	SELENA
I need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower. Now 
burn rubber.

Nigel locks eyes with her.

NIGEL
				Make me.

He takes another insolent sip of champagne...arid discovers a scorpion perched on the rim of his glass.

Nigel spits out the champagne and, drops the glass. Everyone laughs at him.


NIGEL
				Balefire on you, Selena!

					SELENA
				    (grinning)
				You Scorpios can never take a joke.

All quests have fallen silent, staring at the altercation between the two of them. 

					NIGEL
				You think you are on top now. Well there is someone 
coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.

	SELENA 
Throw him out.

Two burly waiters seize Nigel and drag him off toward the valet parking.

NIGEL
				You won't last a year, Selena. The cards don't lie!

The crowd breaks into a buzz of conversation. 

Bianca stands up on a chair. The crowd falls silent.
	
					BIANCA
				Let's not let one rotten apple spoil the party. I give you 
the first woman in eight hundred years to head 
the Circle: Selena!

Applause. Selena steps up onto a raised dais. And holds up her hands in an invocational gesture.

SELENA
				Thank you, sisters and brothers of the Craft. It is a 
great honor you have given me, and I will try to be
worthy. And when my secret plans are revealed --
you will learn that we are on the threshold of 
power and influence undreamed of when Nigel was 
our leader.

More applause. One of the cooks applauding at the refreshment table knocks over a fuel-pot under a chafing dish. The fuel-pot falls on the ground at the base of the wicker goat statue.  

					SELENA
				And now, ,I call upon the Great Mother--the spirit 
of Nature --- to bless all our endeavors in the 
coming year...

A woman in the .audience screams. Everyone looks where, she is pointing. The huge ten-foot tall wicker statue ,bursts into flames.

Panic and pandemonium. Some of the quests run for safety. Others try to throw water onto the blazing, torch-like statue, but in vain. Selena frowns at the spectacle, and, without a word, turns and stalks into her house.

INT. SELENA'S HOUSE.  LIVING ROOM

THE CAMERA FOLLOWS Selena through the French doors and into her large living room. On one wall is a huge, ornate gold-framed MIRROR, covered with a thick veil.

Selena sits down in front of a large hearth, and opens a secret compartment in the floor. She reaches inside and removes a finely wrought METAL BOX IN THE SHAPE OF A GARGOYLE and a pack of cards. She puts the gargoyle box on her lap, and begins to cast tarot cards onto the floor in mystic patterns.

The Elderly Man in the pinstripe suit enters from the garden. Outside the excited shouts and sounds of firefighting can still be heard. Someone runs by in the b.g. with a coil of garden hose. The Elderly Man walks over to Selena, timidly.

ELDERLY MAN 
Is this Nigel's doing?

SELENA
				It's a warning, that's for sure.

					ELDERLY MAN
				Maybe it was just an accident.

					SELENA
				     (mysteriously)
				There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has 
meaning, if you can read the signs.

The elderly man looks down at the pattern of tarot cards Selena has cast on the floor.

ELDERLY MAN
				Then what does it mean???




Selena shrugs and puts aside her cards.

SELENA
				Don't ask me. I can't read the signs worth spit.

EXT. MIDVALE SCHOOL. DAY

 A bus stops in front of the school. Kara, disguised in a brunette wig and unfashionable clothing gets out of the bus. (From now on we shall refer to her in human guise by the name of her secret identity LINDA LEE.) Linda walks up the driveway toward the main building. Around her the campus is full of girls all in the school uniform of skirt, blazer, and white knee socks. Many of them stare frankly at the new girl in the slightly dowdy dress, carrying a battered old suitcase.

In front of the school, LUCY LANE, one of the older girls, is batting in a softball game. She swings and hits one over the fence for a homer. Linda watches the excited, deliriously happy girls---wondering if she will ever be able to share such strong group emotions. Linda walks up the steps to the main building.

INT. MAIN BUILDING. MIDVALE SCHOOL. STAIRWAY

Linda walks up the long stairway in the entrance hall.

MYRA, the school bully, passes with her spy and toady the loathsome MUFFY. As they pass MYRA speaks in a loud voice.

MYRA
				Geeze, another barfy new student. They're really 
scraping the bottom of the barrel these days.

Linda walks on up to the next f1oor.

INT. MAIN BUILDING . MIDVALE SCHOOL. HALL

Linda walks along the deserted hall and stops at the office of the registrar, MR. Danvers. She enters.

INT. REGISTRAR'S OFFICE

MR. Danvers turns from his desk and glares at her.

 MR. DANVERS
				Don't you believe in knocking?

LINDA
Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.

She knocks on the open door. Her manner is so open and guileless that MR. Danvers, though
he gives her a strange look, does not put it down to smart-aleckyness, as he normally would.

MR. DANVERS 
What can I do for you?

	LINDA 
I'm Linda Lee.

My cousin wrote you.

MR. Danvers stares at her blankly. He's a bit absent-minded.


MR . DANVERS 
Cousin? Wrote me?

Linda looks at the metal filing cabinet behind his desk.

Two beams of X-RAY VISION are faintly visible for an instant from her eyes.

LINDA
				The letter's in your files. Under K, for Kent.

MR. Danvers opens his file and searches through it.

					LINDA
				I mean, it would probably be there, if you received it.

					MR. DANVERS
				Here it is. Oh...of course. You're the orphan. I'm so sorry 
about your parents. We'll try to make you happy here.

He rises and walks around the desk toward her. He puts his hand on her shoulder in a fatherly fashion.

CUT TO:

EXT. CAMPUS. DORM

MR. Danvers is carrying her suitcase as he shows her around the campus.

MR DANVERS
				...since your school records were lost in the fire, we'11 
start you out easy first. You'll have English, Latin, 
French, History, Art, Chemistry, Math, Biology 
and Computing. Later on, you can add some electives. 
I think we'll put you in "G" dorm.

He opens the door and ushers her into the dorm.

INT. DORM. CORRIDOR

MR. Danvers leads Linda down the corridor. 

A girl dorm monitor sees him and yells out the traditional signal.

STUDENT MONITOR
				Man on the floor!

Immediately, several of the room doors along the corridor slam shut. MR. Danvers smiles indulgently and leads Linda along to one of the rooms with an open door.

INT. DORM ROOM

LUCY LANE, still in her softball flannels, is digging mud out of her cleats with a Swiss Army Knife held over a wastebasket. MR. Danvers knocks on the open door, in the pre-entry signal of Earth. Lucy looks up.

LUCY
				Oh, MR. Danvers, come in and park it.

					MR. DANVERS
				Lucy, your roommate still home with anorexia?

LUCY
				It wasn't anorexia. It was the food.

					MR DANVERS
				Linda, this is Lucy Lane. You can room with her. 
Show her around, Lucy; I believe you know her 
cousin, MR., uh, Kent. Lucy turns into a bundle of 
enthusiasm. She grabs Linda's suitcase and leads 
her into the room chattering away excitedly.

LUCY
				Wow, you're Clark's cousin?? Fabuloso! Clark's a 
hunk. My sister Lois was a real nerd to let that one 
get away. You'll love it here, we have a great dorm, 
some really insane characters, I mean radical craziness...
 
MR. Danvers slips away, leaving the two new roommates to get acquainted.








Lucy puts Linda's suitcase on the bare mattress of the empty bed and opens the dresser drawers to help her unpack.

LINDA 
I can do that.

	LUCY
No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?

She looks down at the nearly empty suitcase.
	
LINDA 
There isn't any.

LUCY
This is all your clothes?

Lucy involuntarily glances over her shoulder at the bulging closet beside. her own bed. Lucy's bed is smothered with teddy bears, and the walls around it are covered with photos and posters of male rock singers, movie stars, and tennis players. Also a large painted poster of SUPERMAN.

LINDA
				I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a 
chance since...

	LUCY
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or 
something?

	LINDA
I'd rather not talk about it.

	LUCY
You're not...an orphan are you?

	LINDA
My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.

	LUCY
Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, 
you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.

LINDA
				Thank you. You're very kind.




LUCY
				I'm real sorry, Linda, I should've known it was 
something tragic if you show up without a 
wardrobe. Here, try on this. And this.

Lucy starts pulling clothes out of her closet and tossing to Linda.

											CUT TO:

EXT. SCHOOL PLAYING FIELDS. DAY

Girls in their adorable school gym outfits run around playing field hockey. Linda hangs back on the outskirts of the mob. She sees Myra put her stick between Lucy's legs and trip her. Linda stops to help Lucy up.

LINDA
She did that deliberately.

	LUCY
She's a beast.

The pack turns and heads back toward them, the lead. Myra slaps the puck directly at. steps in front of it to protect Lucy. The and shatters. .Play stops. The girls mill confusion, picking up the little pieces of with Myra in Lucy. Linda puck hits Linda around in puck.

					LUCY 
How'd you do that?

LINDA
				Must've been a defective puck.

INT. LOCKER ROOM. DAY

Girls pile in and start to take off their uniforms. Showers are running in the background. Linda unlaces her shoes. Lucy is unlacing beside her.

					LUCY
				Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.
				
LINDA 
But what for?

LUCY
				She just hates anybody who isn't afraid of her.





INT. SHOWER. LATER. DAY

Linda and Lucy (seen from the shoulders up) are enjoying a nice warm shower.

Linda looks through the tile wall (with her x-ray vision) and sees Myra next door, fooling with the plumbing.

INT. PLUMBING ROOM

MYRA
				      (whispering)
Are they in?

Muffy (Myra's spy) nods yes from her look-out position.

MYRA
				Listen to the screams when I shut off the cold water.

She takes a huge wrench and starts to shut off a valve. Her spy looks worriedly at the valve.

MUFFY
				But, Myra, why don't you shut off the hot water and 
give them an ice bath? If you shut off the cold it, 
could scald them.

MYRA
				So they lose a little skin. Serve 'em right.

Myra pulls on the wrench.

INT. SHOWER

Linda shoots a beam of her heat vision through the wall.

INT. PLUMBING ROOM

Myra pulls on the valve, but the wrench glows red hot in her hand. She lets go with a cry of pain. A pipe springs a leak, drenching her in her school uniform. Myra heads for the door, to get out. More pipes spring leaks. Myra is soaked, her hair all bedraggled, her uniform a mess.

CUT TO:

INT. COMPUTING CLASS

MR. Danvers is putting a fairly complicated equation on the blackboard. All the students sit at the consoles of little personal computers staring at their blank monitor screens. Except for Linda, who is staring intently at the wall on one side of the classroom.


MR DANVERS
				Now, this is the kind of problem that used to take 
weeks before the computer. It still takes a long 
time without certain algorithms.

Linda stares out through the solid wall with her X-RAY vision.

EXT. CAMPUS

A cat is stalking along a branch of a tree toward a nest of little baby birds. The nest is wedged on top of a window cornice on one of the buildings, but the tree branch passes just close enough by it for the cat to grab the baby birds when he gets there.

Slowly the cat inches along the branch. Suddenly a beam of light hits the branch. It bursts into flame, and falls down to the ground, saving the birds from any future danger. The cat turns around like a felon caught in the act, runs down the tree trunk, and scampers away.

INT. CLASS

Linda smiles to herself.

MR. DANVERS (O.S.) 
Linda? Are you with us?

She turns to look at MR. Danvers and finds everyone in class staring at her.

LINDA
				Uh, yes, MR. Danvers.

She looks at the board.

LINDA
				The answer is 5,271,009,010.

Linda smiles, proud that she got the right answer. The other girls in the class laugh at her. Even her friend Lucy snickers. Linda realizes she has made a mistake, but is not sure how serious it is. The class bell rings and the girls dash for the exit. Linda stays in her seat staring at Mr. Danvers as he goes around the room switching off the computers.

MR. DANVERS
				You may go, Linda. But try not to clown around in 
the future.

She meekly heads for the door. He turns to erase the blackboard. Something stays his hand, and he looks at the problem. Then he puts down the eraser and starts to copy the problem on a piece of paper.



EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE SCHOOL. DAY

Selena's Cadillac drives past the school. softball in front. Girls are playing softball in front.

INT. CADILLAC

Bianca is driving. Selena sits in the back brooding. Her tarot cards and the metal gargoyle box are beside her on the open counter of a  built-in bar. She suddenly calls out to Bianca.

SELENA 
Stop the car!

Bianca jams on the brakes and the car screeches to a halt.

EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE SCHOOL

The girls stop their softball game and turn to stare at the Cadillac.

INT. CADILLAC

Selena is gathering up her scattered things from the floor of the car.

SELENA
				I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall.

					BIANCA 
What is it?

		SELENA
The Coffer of Shadow. Look at it.

The metal gargoyle box is glowing with an inner radiance.

					SELENA 
What does it mean?

BIANCA
				The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .

They stare out the car window at the girls' softball game, which was resumed.

SELENA
Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a 
baseball game?

	BIANCA
Softball.

	
SELENA
				It must be the girls. One of the girls.

					BIANCA 
But which one?

SELENA
				Drive on. We have already attracted enough 
attention.

Bianca starts up the car again and drives smoothly away.

SELENA
				We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls 
just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to 
something--we'll find out.

	BIANCA
And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy!

The car swerves slightly.

SELENA
				Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at 
the wheel. OK?

	BIANCA 
Sorry, mistress.

CUT TO:

EXT. DORM. DAY

Linda is standing at the bathroom' window of her dorm room, looking outside with a melancholy expression. She slides the curtain across the window, so no one can see in.

INT. LINDA AND LUCY'S ROOM. DAY

Lucy runs in, fresh from her softball game, and sits down on the bed as usual to dig the mud out of her cleats. Lucy's bed is still a riot of stuffed animals and frilly lace pillows. Linda's bed' across the room is austere and almost monastic, with no family photos, posters, or toys.

LUCY
				Hey, Linda, you in there?

LINDA (o.s.)
				Uh-huh.

Linda answers from inside the shut bathroom door.
LUCY
				How much longer you gonna be?

LINDA (o.s.)
				Not long. I'm cutting my hair.

Lucy crosses to the bathroom door. 

LUCY
				You're a maniac! Let me do it for you. You'll look awful.

INT. BATHROOM OFF DORM ROOM. DAY

Linda is in her Supergirl costume and her blonde hair. Her brunette wig is hanging on a hook beside the mirror.

SUPERGIRL
				I can manage, thanks.

Supergirl holds out a lock of her blonde hair. She looks into the mirror and SHOOTS A BEAM OF ENERGY FROM HER EYE, which reflects off the mirror and strikes her hair, cutting off one inch of the blonde strand.

INT. DORM

LUCY
				I cut my own hair once. I looked so awful the only 
thing was to go totally punk!

Linda opens the door and steps out of the bathroom. She is wearing her brunette wig and her Linda clothing. Lucy is puzzled.

LUCY
				Your hair looks the same.

LINDA
				It was just a trim.

The student hall monitor sticks her head in the door and yells excitedly.

JODY
				Hey guys, Gloria just got a package from home.

					LUCY 
What's in it?

JODY
				A hair dryer that makes popcorn!

					LUCY 
Wow! Pig-out time. Come on Linda.

Lucy hurries to the door. Linda holds back.

LINDA
No thanks. You go on.

	LUCY
You sure?

Linda nods bravely, and Lucy dashes off down the hall toward the lounge. Linda stands alone in the room.

A beam of light from the setting sun shines through the room, and casts a pool of light on the opposite wall. Linda looks at the beam of light with nostalgia.

 INT. DORM LOUNGE

Lucy and the other girls are stuffing themselves with popcorn turned out in bowlfulls by Gloria's new hair dryer. The package it came from lies torn open on the table beside the hair-dryer. Some of the girls start a playful popcorn-throwing fight in the b.g. One of the girls is strumming her guitar, and starts to sing "There's No Place Like Home". One by one the other girls join in. It's a scene of high spirits and camaraderie, in contrast to Linda's loneliness.

INT. LINDA'S DORM ROOM

Linda, still staring at the sunbeam shining through her room, and at the tiny dust motes dancing in the beam. From down the hall comes the sound of the girls singing, in improvised six-part harmony.

GIRLS .o.s.)
"Be it ever so humble, There's no place like 
home..."

A tear of self-pity and homesickness wells up in Linda's eyes and runs down her cheek. She steps into the beam of sunlight and it shines full on her face. She suddenly hears Alura's voice in her mind.

ALURA (o.s.) 
Kara, my darling...

	LINDA
Mother! Is it you? Where are you???

	ALURA (o.s.)
In Argo City. Have you found the Power Source?


	LINDA
Mother, this world is so big. I don't know where 
to begin to look.

ALURA (o.s.)
				Kara, be careful. There is some terrible evil force coming 
near you. I can feel it. Keep to your disguise. Let no one
know who you are.

LINDA
				But why? I have super powers. Nothing can hurt me.

ALURA (o.s.)
				There are more powers in the universe than we know. 
And more than we can imagine. Be careful, Kara. And
come home safely.

The sun sets and the beam of light disappears as if a switch had been snapped off, leaving Linda alone in the warm afterglow of twilight.

The soft strains of girls harmonizing float down the hall.

GIRLS (o.s.) 
"...mid pleasures and palaces Where'ere I roam, Be 
it ever so humble, There's no place like home."

CUT TO:

EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS. BENCH. DAY

Linda sits by herself reading on a stone bench: She is wearing the school uniform now. All around her girls are running out of the dorm with overnight cases and climbing into cars driven by middle-aged couples. There is a frantic bustle of activity. 

CUT TO:

INT. OFFICE IN THE MATH DEPARTMENT

Mr. Danvers sits at his computer, which is spewing out page after page of a complicated printout. Finally the printer stops. He reads out the bottom line.

MR . DANVERS
				Five billion, two hundred and seventy-one million, 
nine thousand, and ten.

He sits back in his chair and puffs thoughtfully on his pipe.



EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS. BENCH. DAY. LATER

The campus is deserted. Linda still pretends to read, but her sense of loneliness is palpable. Suddenly Mr. Danvers is beside her, looking down.

MR. DANVERS
				No plans for the weekend, Linda?

LINDA 
No, MR. Danvers.

MR. DANVERS
				Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't 
you come home with us for dinner?

LINDA 
I'd love to.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. BACKYARD OF DANVERS'S HOUSE. DAY

Mr. & Mrs. Danvers and Linda sit outside under the trees at a table piled high with delicious home cooked food. ,The dog begs for scraps. As the scene progresses (MOS) the Danvers bring Linda out of her shyness until they all laugh together sharing food, jokes and happiness. A. dreamlike moment of nostalgia from everyone's childhood.

INT. SELENA'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. DAY

Selena, at her most glamorous, in silk hostess pajamas and scads of pearls, stands looking out the French, doors of her mansion. She is staring shamelessly at ETHAN, a handsome young landscape gardener. Bianca is standing beside Selena.

BIANCA
				Is he your entertainment for tonight?

					SELENA
				He will be. In about five minutes.

					BIANCA
				Have fun.

Bianca exits, and Selena waves to Ethan from the French doors.

EXT. SELENA'S HOUSE. GARDEN. DAY.

Ethan is sketching the house, adding new trees and shrubs in his drawing. He sees Selena waving, and walks over to her. 

INT. SELENA'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. DAY

SELENA 
Finished your estimate?

	ETHAN
Well, there's several ways to go .

SELENA
				Come in, have a drink, we'll talk.

She ushers him inside and sits him down in front of the vast hearth.

SELENA
				You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always 
see your truck parked around.

	ETHAN
I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my 
service.

	SELENA
I bet they do.

	ETHAN
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.

	SELENA
Oh, you know how parties are. Always some damage.

Ethan spreads his drawings out on his knees.

					ETHAN
				Now we could put in rhododendrons or lilacs...depending 
on how alkaline your soil is. 

Selena gives a cursory glance at the sketch, and then turns to a silver tray beside her. She picks up a frosty pitcher and pours an iced fruit drink into two tall glasses.

					SELENA 
				I just love plants and growing things. It must be 
wonderful to have green thumbs. Cheers!

Ethan looks at the drink with misgiving.

ETHAN
				Uh, no thanks, I don't drink during the day.


Selena gestures outside.
	
SELENA
				But look, it's almost sundown!

Ethan glances outside. Selena pours some poisonous looking red liquid into his glass from a tiny bottle hidden in her hand while his attention is distracted.

ETHAN
				Really, I'm not thirsty. Now I could put in some 
honeysuckle there and there...

Selena pouts exaggeratedly.

SELENA
Just take a sip or .I'll be hurt. It's an old family 
recipe, I'm famous for them.

Ethan pauses. He doesn't want to offend his rich new customer over such a trifle.

ETHAN 
What is it?

	SELENA
A passionfruit smoothee.

		ETHAN
Well, just one.

He takes his glass (with the extra ingredient) and clinks it against hers in a toast.

SELENA
				To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.

ETHAN 
I'll drink to that.

He takes a careful sip of his drink, tastes, and smiles.


ETHAN 
Hmmm. Delicious!

He tosses off the rest of it in one gulp. Selena watches him triumphantly.

ETHAN
Now, about my fee...

He suddenly clutches his throat with a gasp and collapses unconscious on the couch. She leans over him and strokes his cheek delicately with her long red-nailed fingers.

SELENA
				Sleep well. And when you wake, drown in my eyes 
and be all mine.

The DOORBELL RINGS.  Selena looks up with annoyance.

SELENA
				If that's the Jehovah's Witnesses again...

She angrily walks toward the hall, casting a fond look back at Ethan.

SELENA
				Don't go away, gorgeous. I'll be right back.

EXT. FRONT DOOR OF MANSION

Nigel in a skin-tight vinyl jumpsuit with multidirectional chrome zippers is leaning on the bell. Behind him his Porsche is parked in the driveway, and beyond at the curb is a truck with ETHAN'S NURSERY AND LANDSCAPING painted on it. Selena opens the door, sees Nigel, and tries to close it. But Nigel puts his foot in and keeps it open.

SELENA 
Nigel, get lost.

NIGEL
				I have to talk to you.

					SELENA
				You're wasting your breath.

					NIGEL
				You used to listen to me. When you asked me to 
teach you something of the Craft.

	SELENA
I could teach you a thing or two now.

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM

Ethan opens his eyes. He rises from the couch and stands there swaying deliriously.

INSERT. P.O.V. OF ETHAN

The room swirls and distorts around him in garish nightmare colours.


BACK TO SCENE

Ethan clutches his head as though it were splitting apart, and lurches out of the French doors into the terrace.

EXT. FRONT DOOR OF MANSION

Selena is listening impatiently to Nigel, and staring oddly at him.

NIGEL
				...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great 
Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me 
like that?

SELENA
				I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a 
good tannisroot ointment. Every night.

Nigel is rather vain about his smooth olive complexion, so he is completely thrown off his stride.

NIGEL
				Nothing's wrong with my skin.

					SELENA
				Such a shame. You ought to take better care of 
yourself.

Selena closes the door while he's off his guard. Nigel takes a pocket mirror out of his shoulder bag and stares with horror at his reflection. His face is erupting all over in ugly red blotches.

NIGEL 
Nasty bitch!

EXT. GROUNDS OF SELENA'S MANSION. SUNSET

Ethan staggers across the lawn, still clutching his head, obviously very ill. As he disappears through the shrubbery on the far side of the lawn, he mutters drunkenly to himself.

ETHAN 
Rhododendron.. . .honeysuckle. . .

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM

Selena enters and finds Ethan gone. She is furious. She walks to the French doors.

					SELENA 
Ethan. Come back. You'll spoil everything!
INT. THE DANVERS' LIVING ROOM. NIGHT

Linda is playing chess with MR. Danvers, while his wife knits on the sofa.

MRS. DANVERS
				I think you'd better be getting back to the dorm, Linda. 
The housemother'll expect you to sign in by eight.

Linda stands up from the chessboard.

LINDA
				Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. 
Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a 
terrific chess player MR. Danvers.

	MR. DANVERS 
What? Me?

LINDA
				Sure. Mate in five moves.

She moves the pieces chonk, chonk, chonk, chonk, chonk...

LINDA
				...and there goes my king. Got to hand it to you, I didn't 
see it coming. Well, bye.

She walks out the door into the night.

MRS . DANVERS
				What a lovely child. Such nice manners. We must 
have her back, don't you think?

MR. Danvers 'grunts absent-mindedly, bemused at his loss.

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT

Selena paces agitatedly in her living room. Finally she stops in front of the ornate mirror hanging on the wall. She puts her hand on the heavy veil covering it.

SELENA
				Show me Ethan.

She rips aside the veil. The IMAGE IN THE MIRROR SHOWS ETHAN STAGGERING DRUNKENLY THROUGH THE NIGHT COWN THE CENTRE WHITE LINE OF A HIGHWAY. CARS WHIZZ PAST HIM IN BOTH DIRECTIONS.

SELENA 
The silly fool! 
EXT. HAMBURGER HEAVEN. NIGHT

Lucy is in front of the local hamburger drive-in in her Thunderbird convertible, talking to the foxiest dude at Rindge Tech. Other teens are hanging out and listening to rock music outside the drive-in. Lucy catches sight of Linda walking along the side of the road.

LUCY 
Hey, Linda!
     (to the boy) 
It's my roommate. You'll love her. She's really off 
the wall!

Lucy jumps out of her car, runs over to Linda, and whispers urgently in her ear.

LUCY
				Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's...
his folks are away...

LINDA 
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out
for an overnight.

	LUCY
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom 
window. McCloskey's always zonked out: 
she'll never hear you.

	LINDA
It doesn't seem right.

	LUCY
Please, as a favour to me? So I won't  be the only girl?

Linda catches sight of a figure teetering down the centre, white line of the highway. Cars honk and zoom past him.

LINDA 
Look at that guy!

Lucy whirls around and looks. 

					LUCY
				What a space cadet. 
      (yelling and waving) 
Hey, you dingleberry! Get outta the street!

Ethan ignores them, and continues to teeter deliriously.


INSERT.  ETHAN'S P.O.V.

He sees the night as a fairyland of dancing, blurred lights: the neon of the hamburger stand; the garish pumps of the gas station across the street, the streaking head and taillights of the cars on either side. All sound is similarly distorted and far away.

BACK TO SCENE

LINDA	
				Why is he acting so strangely?

					LUCY
				I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT

Selena holds the metal box shaped like a gargoyle. She looks at the IMAGE OF ETHAN in 
her mirror.

SELENA
				Power of Shadows...bring him to me. 


The box in her hand glows with an inner light.

EXT. STREET OPPOSITE H]1..MBUP.GER RESTAURANT. NIGHT

There is a construction site next to the Hamburger Place.  A giant BULLDOZER suddenly ROARS TO LIFE and bursts through the chain link fence surrounding the construction site. With no one at the controls, the bulldozer drives out onto the street. Ethan sees its GAPING JAWS and runs clumsily away. They snap at him with the clash of steel. He stumbles and the bulldozer scoops him up. It wheels around and starts to carry him away, with one of his legs protruding through the teeth of its giant mouth. The onlookers are stunned and horrified.

LUCY
				Omigod, it's a runaway!

Lucy sprints out into the street, running after the driverless bulldozer.

LINDA 
Lucy; come back!

	LUCY
Somebody's gotta do something!!

Lucy dodges through the cars and alongside the bulldozer. She climbs bravely up into the driver's seat and tries to tug at the controls. They are frozen. In desperation Lucy yanks on the steering wheel. The bulldozer turns ninety degrees into the gas station.

EXT. GAS STATION. NIGHT

A TOURIST is filling his station wagon at one of the self-service pumps. His WIFE is bringing their TODDLER back from the rest rooms. The bulldozer suddenly smashes into the gas pumps and through the gas station. The tourist dives out of its path. The bulldozer circles behind the gas station toward a small motel next door, leaving in its wake a totaled station wagon, and gasoline leaking on the ground from the smashed pumps.

EXT. HAMBURGER RESTAURANT. NIGHT

Linda watches with mounting horror. And yet she remembers the warning from Alura, and stands frozen, unable to intervene.

EXT. MOTEL/GAS STATION. NIGHT

Lucy fights the wheel in vain. The bulldozer circles through the motel, smashing the individual cabins into matchsticks. The bulldozer drives under the MOTEL SIGN which HITS LUCY ON THE HEAD, KNOCKING HER UNCONSCIOUS. Finally, the bulldozer comes full circle and halts against a utility pole next to the gas station. The utility pole leans at a crazy angle. Its ELECTRIC WIRES break and dangle down, flashing blue arcs of electricity where they touch the pavement. The RIVER OF GASOLINE from the broken pump flows inexorably toward the arcing power lines. The mother kneels beside her dazed husband and looks over at her toddler running toward the arcing wires, his arms held out eagerly.

MOTHER
My baby!!!!!

Instead of helping, the onlookers turn and flee the inevitable fire.

EXT. HAMBURGER RESTAURANT. NIGHT

Linda can't take it any longer. She ducks into the deserted hamburger restaurant. An instant later, she emerges through a skylight in the roof in red and blue costume as SUPERGIRL! She stands on-the roof in front of a big illuminated advertising sign, which hides her from the fleeing crowd. Supergirl takes a deep breath and blows with her super lungs:. The toddler is blown safely 1nto his mother's arms.

MOTHER
				My baby.

She grasps the child in her arms and helps her husband hobble to safety just as the river of gasoline reaches the sparking wires and BURSTS INTO FLAMES .

The bulldozer, with Lucy Lane unconscious at the controls and Ethan imprisoned in the scoop, is surrounded by an IMPENETRABLE RING OF FIRE . 



Supergirl dashes through the ring of fire so fast that if there were any spectators who weren't running for their lives she would only be visible as a red and blue streak.

EXT. ACCIDENT SCENE/GAS STATION. NIGHT INSIDE THE RING OF FIRE.

Supergirl takes the unconscious Lucy from the driver's seat and carries her in her arms to the front of the bulldozer.

Supergirl pulls open the massive metal jaws with one hand like they were sheet rubber.

INT. SCOOP OF BULLDOZER

Ethan looks up as Supergirl slides Lucy Lane in beside him. He sees Supergirl's face backlit by the raging inferno outside.

SUPERGIRL
				Everything's going to be all right. She's just 
unconscious. No broken bones.

INSERT ETHAN'S P.O.V. LOOKING AT SUPERGIRL FROM INSIDE THE SCOOP

Ethan's swirling distorted vision suddenly focuses with , absolute clarity. A moment outside of time. The most romantic glamorous image imaginable: the blonde, backlit, looking at him with concern, her lips slightly parted.

BACK TO SCENE

There is something about Ethan's ecstasy, which holds Supergirl for a moment.

ETHAN 
God...you're beautiful.

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM

Selena watches the image of Ethan and Supergirl in her mirror. Her face is a study in jealousy and dismay.


ETHAN (in the mirror) 
God...you're beautiful.

That was meant for me!

EXT. ACCIDENT SCENE/GAS STATION. BULLDOZER. RING OF FIRE

SUPERGIRL
Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.

ETHAN
Wait...don't leave me in here...

SUPERGIRL
				It's for your own protection.

She pulls the massive steel jaws shut and tears the scoop off the bulldozer with a sound of rending metal. Immediately afterwards, the flames reach the underground storage tank and the bulldozer is enveloped in a FIERY EXPLOSION.

EXT. ACCIDENT SCENE. OUTSIDE RING OF FIRE. NIGHT

The entire gas station is a column of flame and black smoke reaching up into the night sky. A fire truck and a police car arrive on the scene, sirens screaming. The tourist family watch from a safe distance, their toddler clapping his hands excitedly at the spectacle.

EXT. IN THE SKY. HIGH ABOVE THE ACCIDENT. NIGHT

Supergirl flies out of the column of black smoke, carrying the sealed bulldozer scoop with Ethan and Lucy safely inside.

ETHAN 
       (calling from inside) 
What's happening?

	SUPERGIRL
        (shouting over the wind) 
I'm taking you to the hospital.

	ETHAN
           (within)
Let me out. I have to talk to you.

SUPERGIRL
				Later.

EXT. ACCIDENT SCENE. POST FIRE. NIGHT

The firemen have smothered the fire with a blanket of foam. The blackened bulldozer minus its front scoop stands next to the smashed station wagon. A bewildered policeman is searching for victims.

POLICEMAN
				Where's the casualties? You can't tell me there's 
no casualties.

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT

Bianca enters and sees Selena staring raptly at the mirror.
BIANCA
				I came as quickly as I could. What is the danger?

SELENA
				It's what we were warned about.

Selena points to the mirror, which shows the IMAGE OF SUPERGIRL FLYING THROUGH THE AIR CARRYING THE BULLDOZER SCOOP. Bianca can't quite make out what it is at first.

BIANCA 
A Storm Dragon?

	SELENA 
No, a super girl.

EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE. NIGHT

Supergirl lands with the bulldozer scoop in front of the emergency entrance. There is no one around. Supergirl rips open the sealed scoop with a loud noise of rending metal.

INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM. NIGHT

TWO INTERNS are chatting in the corridor near the doors. They jump at the sound of bending steel outside.

FIRST INTERN 
What was that?

	SECOND INTERN 
Maybe we better take a look.

EXT . HOSPITAL ENTRANCE. NIGHT

Supergirl has strapped Ethan and the semi-conscious Lucy onto wheeled gurneys.

					ETHAN 
Don't leave me.

	SUPERGIRL 
I have to.

	ETHAN
When can I see, you again ?

	SUPERGIRL
Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. 
Goodbye.


She gives the gurneys a shove.

INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM. NIGHT

The automatic doors open and Ethan and Lucy roll inside on the gurneys.

FIRST INTERN
				Did we use the laughing gas tonight?

					SECOND INTERN 
That was last night.

 					FIRST INTERN
				Then this is really happening.

The two interns catch the gurneys, and start examining Ethan and Lucy.

SECOND INTERN
Hey fella, can you talk???

Ethan begins to babble deliriously.

ETHAN
				The girl. Where is she? It never hit me like this 
before. I love her. My angel.

He sits up, tears brimming in his eyes, and grasps the , intern by the lapels.

ETHAN
				Where is she? I love her, don't you understand? I'll die 
if I can't have her.

The intern pulls away and points to Lucy, who is beginning to come to.

FIRST INTERN 
She's right here fella.

	ETHAN
No, not her. The blonde, the one who carried us 
through the air:. She can fly. She's an angel.

The two interns exchange a glance. One of them steps to a wall intercom.

SECOND INTERN
				This is Stenzl in Emergency. We got
				a 412. Send down the boys from psycho.


ETHAN
				No! She's real ! I saw her !

CUT TO:

 INT. SELENA' S MANSION.  NIGHT

Selena, is brooding in front of her mirror, which shows ETHAN IN THE HOSPITAL STRUGGLING WITH THE TWO INTERNS . Selena covers the mirror with its heavy veil. She speaks to Bianca standing beside her.

SELENA
				Why did she have to show up now?

BIANCA 
Eliminate her.

	SELENA
That's easy for you to say, Bianca.

	BIANCA
You can do it. You're the most powerful woman 
on Earth.

SELENA 
Am I? Still?

There is a pause as the implications reverberate.

BIANCA
				Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can 
withstand its power.

SELENA 
I've been saving it. For the right moment.

BIANCA
				That moment is now! What good is a sword unless 
it be unsheathed? Use it, and no one will dare 
oppose you again. No one.

Selena toys with the idea in her mind, turning over the various arguments. A smile creeps across her face.

SELENA 
Not even Nigel.

Selena goes to the secret compartment, opens it and takes out the metal gargoyle box. She looks at it with a dreamy, far-away expression on her face.
SELENA
				What do I do?  I don't know her name.

					BIANCA
				The Naming of Names is not necessary. Just concentrate 
on her face. Your Shadow will do the rest.

Selena holds the gargoyle box out in front of her and opens the lid. Inside is the OMEGAHEDRON power source from Argo City, spinning around a strange dark region in its centre. Selena closes her eyes and whispers to the spinning ring.

SELENA
				Power of Shadow hear me. Find her wherever she be. 
Find her and destroy her.

A BLACK CLOUD OF SHADOW bursts out of the centre of the OMEGAHEDRON, filling the room. Selena drops the gargoyle box and shrinks back with sudden misgivings at what she has unleashed. Even Bianca's face has gone white. The two women huddle together as a HUGE INVISIBLE PRESENCE fills the room with darkness. Then the unseen presence suddenly SMASHES ITS WAY OUTSIDE THROUGH THE SOLID WALL OF SELENA'S LIVING ROOM, leaving a big hole and a trail of crushed furniture behind it. Light returns to the room as the shadow departs. And from outside the sound of crackling shrubbery dies away. Selena regains her composure and looks around at the mess of her once splendid living room.

SELENA
				Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.

BIANCA
				Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.

Bianca reaches down to the floor for the gargoyle box with the OMEGAHEDRON, which is still lying right where Selena dropped it. But Selena quickly picks it up herself before Bianca can touch it.

SELENA
				I think I'd better keep it.

					BIANCA
Whatever you say.

SELENA 
Yes. Whatever I say.  From now on.

She shuts the lid of the gargoyle box, sealing the spinning OMEGAHEDRON safely inside.

INT. DANVERS ' LIVING ROOM. NIGHT

Mrs. Danvers is on the phone.

MRS. DANVERS
				The housemother still doesn't answer.

Mrs. Danvers hangs up the phone with a worried expression.

MR. DANVERS
				Probably drunk again. I'm sure Linda got back all right.
 
MRS. DANVERS
				We should have driven her.

Mr. Danvers stands up and puts on his jacket.

MR. DANVERS
				I'll just drop by the school and. make sure she's all right.

EXT. MIDVALE SCHOOL. DESERTED CAMPUS. OUTSIDE THE DORM. NIGHT

Linda drives up in Lucy's car, the one left behind at the scene of the accident outside the hamburger place. She drives past the paddle tennis court and parks in front of the dorm. Linda gets out of the car, and lets herself into the dorm with a key. Inside, she signs her name in the book. ,

INT. DORM CORRIDOR. NIGHT

Linda walks down the long dormitory corridor past room after empty room. The place is kind of spooky.

INT. LINDA'S ROOM. NIGHT

Linda enters the room she shares with Lucy. She puts Lucy's car keys on her bedside table next to the snapshots of  Lucy's family and of her half-dozen current boyfriends. Linda turns and crosses the room to her own monastic bed in its drab, undecorated corner. She lies down on her bed with a sigh, staring at the ceiling in a melancholy mood.

Suddenly, she senses that something is not right. She gets up from the bed, walks to the window, and gazes out a-t the deserted campus.

EXT. OUTSIDE DORM. TENNIS COURT. NIGHT.

The dorm is set apart from other school buildings and surrounded by tall trees. The tennis court is visible from Linda's window, and a city park adjoining the school property. The UNSEEN MONSTER is heard approaching through the park with a thud of heavy footfalls and the crack of snapping tree trunks and branches. A bolt of lightning flashes, followed by a crash of thunder. The wind howls. A storm is brewing.

Far away across the campus something huge and powerful forces itself between the two big oaks, snapping them like matchsticks. The unseen monster hauls its enormous bulk toward the dormitory, crushing everything in its path, its footsteps making the ground tremble like an earthquake.

 INT. LINDA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT

Linda watches with uncomprehending eyes the approaching swath of destruction heading straight for her. Nothing she has learned about this strange alien world has prepared" her for this. For the first time since she left Argo City, her eyes show fear. And yet there's a deeper streak of defiance in her that impels her to stand her ground and face the horrible juggernaut.

EXT. FORM. TENNIS COURT. CAMPUS. NIGHT

HUGE FOOTPRINTS sink into the damp grass of the campus. A bicycle rack full of Schwinns is flattened into the dirt with a metallic screech. The monster proceeds inexorably toward the wooden rain shelter on one side of the tennis court. The shelter is crushed to kindling wood. The monster drags its enormous unseen bulk across the smooth clay surface of the tennis court, crunching , deep cracked depressions in the clay. The net stretches and groans toward Linda as the' invisible enormity comes closer, and finally snaps with a loud twanging sound as the steel cables part. The tall cyclone fence bulges outward toward Linda and momentarily outlines the form of" the monster before it crumples and falls with the screech of twisted steel. The only thing between Linda and the monster is Lucy.' s parked car. The monster stomps the car flat with a noise like colliding express trains and heads for Linda.

INT. LINDA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT

LINDA
				Hey, that's my roommate's car!

Determination floods her face. She whips off her brunette wig and her civilian clothing to reveal the blonde hair and red blue tunic of SUPERGIRL!

EXT. OUTSIDE THE DORM. NIGHT

Supergirl flies out the dorm window and lands in front of the unseen monster. She raises her hand in challenge and calls out in a commanding voice.

SUPERGIRL
				Leave this place and do no harm.

Something picks Supergirl up and flings her against the wall of the dorm, crushing the soft drink dispenser under her and squirting cola in every direction. Lightning flashes and thunder booms overhead. Supergirl picks herself up, shaken.




She launches herself directly at the space in mid-air ten feet above the monster's footprints. She crashes into something hard and invisible with the sound of a tremendous impact. Supergirl falls to the ground, staggered by the concussion. The irresistible force has met the immovable object. Supergirl looks up, and---altering the wavelength of her X-Ray vision to a transcendental frequency---paints this beam over the monster and just for an instant makes it visible: a HUGE NIGHTMARE SHAPE LOOMING OVER HER, AND REACHING OUT TO CRUSH HER WITH MASSIVE TALONS. Then the image fades.

Supergirl is seized again and flung against the school flagpole, breaking it off at the base. Supergirl stands up and seizes the flagpole. She looks up at the flickering lightning in the sky. She flies straight upward into the storm with the bare flagpole held in front of her.

EXT. THUNDER STORM. LIGHTNING

Again and again huge bolts of lightning strike the flagpole. Supergirl's face is contorted with agony as her body absorbs enough electricity to run Las Vegas for a year. She looks down and sees through a break in the clouds the campus far below.

EXT. CAMPUS

Suddenly Supergirl dives down from the sky, glowing with accumulated electricity. She embraces the monster with a tremendous crackle of energy. The two of them are bathed in brilliant arc light. The monster is briefly made visible again by the energy. But this time it is shrinking, shriveling up into a shapeless lump. The light fades as the energy is discharged. A dark, shapeless lump detaches itself from Supergirl's grasp and flies shrieking away into the night. Supergirl stands alone and exhausted, her muscles trembling with fatigue. 

She turns and walks unsteadily back toward the dorm.

CUT TO:


EXT. CAMPUS. NIGHT

MR. Danvers drives up the long driveway toward Linda's dorm. He parks his car behind the flattened remains of Lucy's car, and gets out, staring with amazement at the destruction wrought by the titanic struggle.

He walks toward the dorm, fear and confusion on his face.

INT. DORM. ENTRY. NIGHT

Mr. Danvers pushes through the unlocked front door. He glances in the sign-out book for Linda's name. Then he knocks on the door labeled HOUSEMOTHER MRS. MCCLOSKEY. No reply. He opens that door and peeks in.




INT. HOUSEMOTHER'S ROOM. NIGHT

A slovenly, overweight woman in a housecoat is curled up on her sofa, a bottle of whiskey clutched to her breast. She snores heroically.

INT. DORM. HALLWAY.  NIGHT

Mr. Danvers walks quickly down the long line of empty rooms to Linda and Lucy's room.

INT. LINDA'S ROOM. NIGHT

Mr. Danvers pauses at the door and looks in. Supergirl, in her blonde hair and red and blue 
tunic, is lying asleep on Linda's bed.

MR. DANVERS
				A Supergirl...
				         (to her)
				Linda...is it Linda?

Supergirl looks up at him and smiles, weakly.

SUPERGIRL
				I didn't want anyone to know... but I was so 
tired...forgot...

M. Danvers sits on the side of her bed.

MR. DANVERS
				Are you all right?

SUPERGIRL
				Just need rest, that's all. Sorry about all the damage 
outside. I had to fight some terrible thing...


					MR. DANVERS
				But why?

SUPERGIRL
				An evil force. Trying to destroy me.

She sits up and looks anxiously at him.

INT. SELENA'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM 

Selena watches their image in her mirror.



SUPERGIRL

				You won't tell anybody, will you?

MR. DANVERS

Not even my wife. And, if there's anything I can do to 
help---I'd be honoured.

INT. DORM. LINDA'S ROOM

Supergirl sinks back down and closes her eyes.

SUPERGIRL
				Thank you, Mr. Danvers.

She lapses into a deep sleep. Mr. Danvers stands up, and pulls the covers up over her in a fatherly gesture. He stands beside the bed for a long time looking down at her, and then walks out of the room, closing the door shut behind him.

CUT T0:

EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE. DAY

Linda gets off a bus and enters the hospital. 

INT. HOSPITAL. DAY

Lucy Lane is sitting up in bed with a white bandage around her head. Superman's pal JIMMY OLSEN is standing awkwardly beside the bed holding a small bunch of daffodils. Lucy is talking animatedly on her bedside telephone, when Linda enters.

LUCY
				...come see me. And smuggle in a pint, they won't 
let me have anything, but make sure it's Jamocha 
Almond Fudge . . Listen, I got to run, my 
roommate just walked in. Bye.

Lucy hangs up and turns to Linda.

LUCY
				Hey, Linda-babes! I've got so much to tell you, I 
don't know where to begin! Oh -- this is Jimmy 
Olsen, he works with Clark and my sister at the 
newspaper.




					JIMMY
				Nice to meet you. Lucy's told me all about you. Your 
cousin Clark taught me everything I know about
the newspaper business.

	LINDA 
Nice to meet you.

She shakes hands shyly with Jimmy, then turns to Lucy.

LINDA
				I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.

					LUCY
				Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the 
insurance money. B.F.D. 

Jimmy keeps looking at Linda.

JIMMY
				Do you have any theories about last night?

					LINDA
				Theories?

					JIMMY
				How Lucy and that guy got to the hospital. And all 
that damage at the school. The police are calling it 
a freak tornado. I'd like to interview you for the Daily- -

LUCY 
      (overlapping) 
Oh, Jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one 
second?

JIMMY
				-- Planet. I mean, you were there. Do you think it was natural,
				 or like some people are claiming, supernatural?

					LINDA
				I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But 
I don't know what it is.

	JIMMY
Can I quote you?




Lucy hands Jimmy a stainless steel urinal.

LUCY
				Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers 
in water before they die?

JIMMY
				Oh, sure.

He steps into Lucy's bathroom with the urinal and fills it with water from her shower. Lucy grabs Linda's arm and whispers urgently in her ear.

LUCY
				Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party 
more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? 
He's private property. I've been waiting years 
for him to develop.

	LINDA 
He's nice.

LUCY
				Nice? He's cute enough to melt lead!

Jimmy emerges from the bathroom with his daffodils neatly arranged in the stainless steel jug.

JIMMY
				Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?

					LINDA
				He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.

					JIMMY
				I knew it ! He's working on a  hot scoop !

 EXT. HOSPITAL. ENTRANCE. LATE AFTERNOON

Bianca drives Selena's Cadillac up to the emergency entrance and parks in the ambulance zone. Selena get out of the back seat in a dramatic opera cape of raw silk with opal trim.

SELENA 
				      (to Bianca)
				This won't take long. Keep the motor running.



INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. LATE AFTERNOON

Selena strides down the hospital corridor almost as if she is floating an inch above the floor. Her huge silk cape billows around her, making her seem larger-than-life. Nurses, orderlies, patients scatter to get out of her way. Her presence is so formidable and she moves so fast and inexorably that no one has a chance to stop her and inquire what she's doing there. She knows exactly where she's going to. She turns a corner, and steps inside an open door and closes it behind her.

INT. ETHAN'S ROOM. DAY

He is sitting in bed, an ice bag on his head, drawing a picture of Supergirl on a piece of cardboard. He is in pajamas and robe.

Selena steps beside the bed. He looks up.

					ETHAN
				Oh no, not you again.

					SELENA
				What an adorable hat.

					ETHAN 
				They think I have a concussion.

					SELENA
				And you think you're in love.

					ETHAN 
I know it.

	SELENA
This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you 
a temporary love potion.

ETHAN
				Why should I believe you?

					SELENA 
				It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all 
about that girl.

Ethan. reaches out and grabs her cloak with a grip of such urgency that she is pulled slightly off balance.

					ETHAN
				Then I'm not the only one who saw her. You did too!

Selena pulls his hand away from her cloak.
SELENA
				Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be 
interested in that puny little girl?

	ETHAN
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.

	SELENA
Forget her, you're mine. I saw you first.

Selena sits on the side of the bed. She removes a vial of liquid from her bodice.
I saw you

SELENA 
                (continuing)
	Here. Drink this. It's an antidote to the love drug I 
gave you.

Ethan sweeps it on the floor, where it shatters. He starts frantically ringing the buzzer pinned to his bed.

ETHAN 
Nurse! Nurse!

SELENA
You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid 
you don't know who I am.

	ETHAN
Nurse!

	SELENA
Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have 
Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get 
what I want.

ETHAN 
Nurse! Help !

The door opens and a NURSE walks in.

					NURSE
				Would you stop screaming. There are sick people trying 
to sleep.

ETHAN
				Get her away from me.  She's crazy.


					NURSE 
                   (to Selena) 
Are you family? Visiting hours are over.

SELENA
				They're over for you sweetheart.

Selena removes the gargoyle-shaped box from her sleeve and opens the lid. The OMEGAHEDRON inside spins and sends out a powerful force, which slides the nurse backwards out the door and pins her to the wall of the corridor outside. The door slams shut. Selena closes the lid of the Coffer and turns to Ethan.

SELENA
				Now you see who you're dealing with.

Ethan scrambles out of the bed and away from her, backing toward the window.

ETHAN 
Leave me alone.

Selena, at the bed, discovers his sketch of Supergirl on the piece of cardboard.

					SELENA
				This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving 
you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.

	ETHAN
I don't want your help.

	SELENA
Come back to my house. My car's outside.

Selena reaches out a hand to Ethan.

					ETHAN
				No!

					SELENA
				I never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no 
different from the rest!

The door opens behind her and TWO SECURITY OFFICERS push  inside, with guns drawn.


SECURITY OFFICER
				Okay, what's going on in h--



Selena gestures with the gargoyle box at the men and their guns fly out of their hands and up to the ceiling. The men stare at the ce1ling, astonished. Ethan takes advantage of the distraction to dash out through the open door. Selena turns to look at Ethan escaping and the
guns fall to the floor and discharge. The security men run into Ethan's bathroom, slamming the door behind them.

Selena ducks out into the corridor.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

Ethan is running away down the corridor. Frightened patients peek out of their rooms. The nurse who was ejected from the room cringes in fear as Selena emerges into the corridor.

Ethan dodges past two orderlies who are pushing a HEART-LUNG MACHINE down from the surgery. Selena raises the gargoyle box and points it at the HEART-LUNG MACHINE.

SELENA
				Power of Shadow---seize him.

The HEART-LUNG MACHINE comes to life---its lights flash, its array of tubes tipped with needle probes writhe like Medusa's hair, its wheels turn around, and it chases  Ethan down the corridor. Selena laughs her deep throaty chuckle of triumph. Ethan looks behind, sees the machine chasing him and cries out with alarm. A CART OF SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS rolls out of a closet in front of him, its scalpels standing up and pointing at him, quivering eagerly, blocking his path.

Ethan dives through a swinging door to his left.

INT. OPERATING THEATRE

A team of surgeons and nurses are bent over a patient on the table. Ethan runs through in the background. The surgeons continue with their work. The heart-lung machine wheels through after him, followed by the scalpels flying through the air like a swarm of hornets.

The surgical team doesn't look up from their work.

Several cylinders of anesthetic gas tear themselves loose from the wall and trundle away out of the room after Ethan and the other apparatus. One of the nurses finally looks up.

NURSE
				Doctor, I think you' re going to have a gas 
problem.

	DOCTOR
I shouldn't have had the cabbage at lunch.




INT. X-RAY ROOM

Ethan bursts into an empty surgical X-Ray room---the pursuing apparatus visible a few yards behind. He slams the heavy lead-lined door and bolts it shut.

He hears the thud of the apparatus beating impotently against the door. He leans against the door panting, his cotton hospital gown and robe soaked with cold sweat. Suddenly, with a whir of motors, the giant multi-armed C.A.T. SCANNER behind him comes to life, its lights glowing, and reaches out its chrome steel arms toward him.

Ethan yells, runs across the room, climbs on a gurney, rips a metal grill off the wall, and dives into the air conditioning duct.

INT. DUCT

Ethan scrambles noisily along inside the metal duct as if all the fiends of hell were after him.

CUT TO:


INT. LUCY'S HOSPITAL ROOM

Lucy is showing off the controls of her bed. The door opens. Lucy, Jimmy and Linda look with amazement at what's outside in the corridor.

LUCY
				Omigod.

A DELIVERY BOY enters with A SPECTACULAR FLORAL ARRANGEMENT.

DELIVERY BOY 
Where you want this?

	LUCY
Over by the window. It must be from my sister. Give him 
a tip, Jimmy.

Jimmy is acutely aware how pathetic his daffodils look as he fumbles in his pocket for a dollar for the delivery boy. Suddenly overhead there is a loud banging and clattering from the air-conditioning duct. Everyone looks up at the ceiling with alarm. But Linda's X-RAY VISION lets her alone recognize Ethan.

					JIMMY
				Gosh, what do you suppose .that is?

					LINDA
				Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to 
meet you, Jimmy.

	LUCY
You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?

	LINDA
I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.

	LUCY
Again? You're getting real tight with them. You're gonna 
be a straight-A student---just kidding, thanks for coming.

Her phone rings and she picks it up.

LUCY
				Phillip! When are you gonna come see me?

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

Linda walks out of Lucy's room and quickly down the corridor. Jimmy hurries to catch up with her.

JIMMY
				Can I give you a lift?

LINDA 
Oh, no thanks.

	JIMMY
It's no trouble. I'd like to ask you some more questions.

Linda's heart sinks as she realises she doesn't know how to get rid of him politely.

CUT TO:

EXT. ROOF OF HOSPITAL SUNSET

Ethan batters the top off a ventilator and crawls out onto the roof. He turns and quickly replaces the aluminum top, bashing it firmly closed with his fist. He straightens up, sweat-soaked, bedraggled, haggard and exhausted, looking like an escaped lunatic with his disheveled hair and his torn hospital robe. He heaves a sigh of relief, and turns to see Selena standing behind him, her silk cape billowing in the breeze.

SELENA
				Give up?

Ethan  takes a beat to make sure he's not hallucinating, then he summons new reserves of strength and runs over to the TALL BRICK SMOKESTACK from the hospital's incinerator.

ETHAN
				Never! 

He starts to climb up the steel ladder on the side of the chimney.

					SELENA
				What goes up must come down.

EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE. SUNSET

Jimmy opens the door of his car for Linda. It's parked in the ambulance zone, right behind 
Selena's Cadillac.

JIMMY
I probably would've got a ticket without this press pass 
on the windshield. Does Clark get many tickets?

Linda pauses, looking up at the sky.

LINDA 
      (distractedly)
I wouldn't know. Look. Up in the sky.

Jimmy follows the direction of her gaze.

INSERT. THEIR P. O . V. OF THE ROOF

Ethan clings to the iron ladder on the side of the chimney, his robe fluttering in the wind.

BACK TO SCENE

JIMMY 
An escaped wacko! What a picture!

Jimmy opens the trunk of his car, takes out his camera bag, removes his Nikon, and starts fumbling around trying to change his 50mm lens for a telephoto. Linda watches Ethan with an expression of growing concern on her face.

EXT. ROOF OF HOSPITAL 

SELENA
				Come down from there, you foo1...

EXT. LADDER ON.THE SIDE OF THE CHIMNEY

Although she is forty feet below him, Ethan hears her voice as though it were inches away from his ear.

SELENA

...before you get blown off and kill yourself.

Ethan is so surprised at hearing her voice so close that he looks around with a start, misses his footing, and nearly falls off the ladder.

EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRY.  JIMMY'S CAR

Jimmy gasps with anguish, as he struggles to mount his telephoto lens, dropping lens caps, film boxes, and filters all over the place.

LINDA 
Someone's chasing him.

	JIMMY
Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the 
accident with Lucy?

LINDA
				Yes.

					JIMMY
				The scoop of the year!

He starts shooting film. His motor drive whirrs.

EXT. HOSPITAL ROOF

SELENA
				It'll be dark soon. And cold. Come down while you've 
got the chance.

EXT. TOP OF CHIMNEY

Ethan reaches the top of the chimney. He climbs over the lip of the brickwork and stands up, half hidden in the thick white smoke belching from the chimney.

ETHAN
				No. She'll come for me. Like she did the last time. 
My angel. 

He starts to cough from the smoke and nearly loses his balance.

EXT. ROOF OF HOSPITAL

SELENA
				She's not coming for you. I killed her. She's dead.

EXT. TOP OF CHIMNEY

Ethan is staggered by this news. He reacts as though he had been punched in the gut.

ETHAN
				No. I don't believe you. It's not true. She's alive 
somewhere. My angel. My love--


He falls off the chimney, and catches himself on the lip of the brickwork. He hangs there by 
one hand.

SELENA'S VOICE 
You idiot!

EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE. JIMMY'S CAR

Jimmy runs out of film. He frantically rips off the magazine and tries to load a fresh one, while Ethan dangles.

					JIMMY
				There goes my Pulitzer Prize.

Linda steps around to the other side of his car. Bianca is staring up at the chimney from the driver's seat of the Cadillac. She doesn't see Linda lift up a sewer grating with her toe and drop noiselessly and suddenly out of sight into the storm drain below.

EXT. ALLEY BEHIND HOSPITAL

A red and blue streak bursts upwards out of another storm drain. The iron cover flips off and lands with a clang as Supergirl flies skyward toward the roof.

Ethan's grip fails and he falls.

Supergirl appears, snatches Ethan in mid-air, and flies off with him into the clouds above.

EXT. ROOF OF HOSPITAL

Selena reacts with relief---then, realizing who has saved him, her face clouds with resentment.

EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRY

Jimmy Olsen's magazine pops open and film unspools out of his camera as his motor drive whirrs.

JIMMY
Darn!

He turns to Bianca, who is looking up in the sky from beside the Cadillac.

JIMMY
				Hey lady, did you see that?

Bianca gives him a glance of contempt.

BIANCA
				See what?

					JIMMY
				The girl---dressed like Superman--caught that guy in 
mid-air.

	BIANCA
Really? Maybe you should check into the hospital and 
have your head examined.

EXT. HIGH IN THE AIR ABOVE THE HOSPITAL. SUNSET

Supergirl carries Ethan beside her, her arm tight around his upper chest, his arm over her shoulders. They are above the clouds bathed in the rich warm glow of sunset. He looks at her ecstatically, his eyes drunk with love.

ETHAN
				You're alive! She didn't kill you! 

					SUPERGIRL 
Who didn't?

	ETHAN
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because 
she knows I love you.

	SUPERGIRL 
You love me?

	ETHAN
My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my 
life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking 
at you, holding you in my arms... 

	SUPERGIRL
We have to have a long talk about all this.

	ETHAN
I know just the place. Hang a left at the Amalgamated Tower.

 EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRY. TWILIGHT

Selena comes striding out 'of the hospital, scowling. Jimmy Olsen notices her, and senses her 
aura of power. He drops his useless Nikon into his camera bag and starts rummaging for another camera.

BIANCA
				Home?

					SELENA
				No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a 
				monkey out of me.

					BIANCA
				      (shrewdly)
				Is it her that's bothering you--or your gardener?

Selena looks at Bianca with wounded dignity.

					SELENA
				I use men, but I'm not addicted to them. I can quit 
whenever I want.

She gets in the back seat of the car, just as Jimmy Olsen snaps a photo of her with a Polaroid. Selena slams the car door and Bianca drives off. Jimmy examines the instant photo he just took. His eyes widen with wonder and the hair prickles on the back of his neck as he sees the image.

INSERT: THE POLAROID IN JIMMY'S HAND. THE PICTURE OF SELENA ENTERING HER CAR, BUT BEHIND HER THERE IS A HIDEOUS LOOMING SHADOW---MUCH LARGER THAN WHEN NIGEL SHOWED IT TO HER.

CUT TO:

EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK. NIGHT

The park is deserted, in darkness. One by one the lights come on, outlining a1l the structures in jewel-like, fairyland colours. It looks strangely familiar. On some deep level there is a resemblance to Argo City.

THE CAMERA PANS over to reveal Ethan standing beside the huge fairground switch boxes, turning on the lights. Supergirl stands beside him.

ETHAN
				This is my favourite place in the city.

					SUPERGIRL
				Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?

					ETHAN
				They don't care, they're tearing it down for a 
shopping centre.

He flips the last switch, which starts the Ferris wheel revolving slowly, like a great spiral galaxy in space. Soft music plays.

ETHAN
				Like it?

					SUPERGIRL
				Yes. It reminds me of home.

					ETHAN
Where Superman's from? Krypton?

	SUPERGIRL
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of 
Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.

	ETHAN
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

	SUPERGIRL
It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to 
find something and I think you can he1p me.

	ETHAN
Come on, let's ride.

They walk to the slowly revolving Ferris wheel and hop aboard one of the gondola cars.

ETHAN
				I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
				
SUPERGIRL
				Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.

					ETHAN
				Let's talk about us, not her.

					SUPERGIRL
				Tell me where I can find her.

					ETHAN
				I don't want you to go near her. She's bad news.
			


Ethan puts his arm around her shoulders, casually, no big deal.

SUPERGIRL
				But be reasonable. If I don't do something to stop her 
she'll try again. And maybe hurt you.

	ETHAN
I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of 
our lives.

	SUPERGIRL
We can't do that.

	ETHAN
Why not ?

	SUPERGIRL
We're from different worlds.

	ETHAN
Just give me a chance to show how much I love 
you. Love changes everything. Love makes 
everything possib1e.

EXT. ENTRANCE TO AMUSEMENT PARK. NIGHT

Selena gets out of her Cadillac and walks to the chained and locked gate. A big sign says KEEP OUT. CONDEMMED PROPERTY. FUTURE SITE OF FUNFAIR MALL SHOPPING PLAZA. She mutters something under her breath and the chains fall away, the locks click open, and the gate glides noiselessly ajar. Se1ena strides in imperiously.

EXT. TOP OF FERRIS WHEEL

SUPERGIRL
				All this talk about love, it's silly.

					ETHAN
				You don't like me? You hate me?

There is such a look of tragedy on Ethan's face, that Supergirl is afraid he might instantly fling himself to his death if she said yes. 

SUPERGIRL
				Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone.

ETHAN
				What do you feel about me?


					SUPERGIRL
				I...I don't know. This is all so sudden.

THE CAMERA RACKS FOCUS FOR A MOMENT TO DISCOVER :

Selena, lurking.be1ow them in the shadows of the Spine Snapper Ride.

ETHAN 
				There's one sure way to find out how you feel.

SUPERGIRL 
What's that?

	ETHAN 
Let me kiss you.

SUPERGIRL
				No.

					ETHAN
				You're not afraid are you?

					SUPERGIRL
				Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.

ETHAN
				If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead.
Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from 
years in school.

	SUPERGIRL
Well...I guess one is all right.

She closes her eyes, parts her lips, and leans forward.

SUPERGIRL 
Is this how?

	ETHAN
Terrific.

Their lips meet. Zowie.

					SELENA
				What a touching scene!

Her voice is like having a bucket of ice water dashed over you. Ethan and Supergirl pull apart. The Ferris wheel has carried them all the way around and back down again. Selena is standing beside them. Supergirl stands up and steps boldly out of the gondola to confront her.

SUPERGIRL
				Who are you ?

					SELENA
				I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both 
be sorry.

					SUPERGIRL
				I don't scare that easily.

Selena rummages down deep in her handbag and pulls out the gargoyle box.

SELENA
				All right, Miss Know-it-all. If I can't have him, 
nobody can.

She holds the gargoyle box out toward the Ferris wheel.

SELENA
				Coffer of Shadow, show your Power!

INSERT C.U. OF THE BOLTS HOLDING ETHAN'S GONDOLA TO THE FERRIS WHEEL: THE BOLTS UNSCREW AND FALL OUT.

BACK TO SCENE

Ethan yells as his gondola falls off the Ferris wheel and down onto the tent, which covers the DODGEM CARS.

INT. DODGEM CARS TENT

He falls through the tent and onto the electrified floor below. The wooden gondola shatters on impact. Ethan sits up, dazed by the fall, and sees a dodgem car painted like the face of a vicious football player heading toward him. Ethan scrambles away on his hands and knees. Another hideously painted car attacks him, and another, and another. He dodges and scuttles around desperately. Finally he manages to climb aboard one of the cars.

EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK

Supergirl reaches out to seize Selena. But Selena holds up the gargoyle box and is surrounded by an impenetrable, glowing shield of force. Supergirl tries to push through, the shield in vain.

Supergirl flies to the little fence made out of steel spikes surrounding the Haunted House. At super speed she rips up the entire line of fence posts and hurls them like javelins at Selena.



Selena dissolves her force field and tries to run away, ducking and dodging the rain of javelins. She turns too quickly and the GARGOYLE BOX slips out of her hand and rolls underneath the deck of the carousel. Selena moans with despair, and pauses, reluctant to leave without the box. This is the opportunity Supergirl needs. The fence posts bury themselves in the ground in a perfect circle around Selena---effectively imprisoning her.

SUPERGIRL
				That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.

SELENA 
A cheap trick.

	SUPERGIRL 
Cheap but effective.

INT. DODGEM CAR TENT

Ethan is holding on to his car desperately as all the other cars viciously ram into it. Suddenly his car is lifted up, carried through a hole in the tent roof, and off into the night sky.

ETHAN
Supergirl'?

He looks under the car. There she is, carrying him to safety. She smiles reassuringly.

EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK

Selena is trapped inside the ring of posts, fumbling in her bag. One by one she takes out dried herbs, feathers, dusts, and flings them at the bars while she shouts magic word. Nothing works.

SELENA
				Yookoohoo! No, that's not it. Sis-o-reb! Nope. 
Ka-ma-hoochie!

Bianca appears out of the shadows. Selena looks up, embarrassed.

					BIANCA
				Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.

					SELENA
				Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.

Bianca pauses uncertainly.

BIANCA
				Why don't you use the Coffer of Shadow?


					SELENA
                  (evasively)
I don't feel like it right now.

					BIANCA
				She didn't take it from you, did she?

					SELENA
				That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.

BIANCA
				There's no need. I learned the Craft from my 						grandmother.

Bianca takes out a bundle of twigs from her pocket and strokes the bars of the fence with it.

BIANCA 
Sycoraka f'kah s'koo...

The bars fall down like boiled spaghetti. Selena steps out of the circle of confinement with queenly dignity.

SELENA
				Good. Now bring the car. We must call a meeting of 
the seven.

Bianca bows.

BIANCA 
Yes, mistress.

Bianca hurries off toward the parking lot. Selena watches her until she turns the corner of the Haunted House. Then Selena kneels down and carefully reaches under the deck of the carousel for the GARGOYLE BOX.

					SELENA
				There you are. Come to mama.

She takes out the box, s1ips it inside her cloak, and stands up. She casts a last glance around the scene of her defeat, and strides off after Bianca.

CUT TO:







EXT. TROPICAL BEACH. DAY

Supergirl lands Ethan in his battered dodgem car on a beautiful, deserted tropical beach. Palm trees wave over a white sand beach. The blue ca1m of a lagoon mirrors huge white clouds that hang motipn1ess on the horizon like colossal snowy mountains. Gaily-coloured parrots screech in the branches of blooming hibiscus and jacaranda. Ethan gets out of his carnival ride and gazes around w1th awe at the beautiful scene.

SUPERGIRL
				I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.

					ETHAN 
It's paradise . We could be very happy here.

SUPERGIRL
				But I have to go back. I brought you here so 
you'd be safe. From her.

	ETHAN
You can't just abandon me.  Alone.

His words strike a sensitive nerve in her. She relents.

SUPERGIRL 
I'll stay for a while.

Ethan is filled with enthusiasm.

ETHAN
				Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with 
a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a 
garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes---
anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, 
and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---

	SUPERGIRL 
Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.

Ethan's face falls. He looks at her beseechingly.

SUPERGIRL
				Well, maybe a little longer than that.

She smiles and takes his hand. Together they walk along the beach.

CUT TO:



EXT. SELENA'S MANSION. NIGHT 

Rolls Royces, limos, and Maserattis parked in the driveway. It looks like a meeting of the ostentatious car club. A helicopter lands on the front lawn. The ELDERLY MAN from the garden party gets out and walks across the lawn toward the house with the aid of a cane. Behind him the helicopter takes off again. Selena opens her front door and confronts him angrily.

SELENA 
You're late.

	ELD ERL Y MAN
The President was giving a speech. I couldn't just 
walk out.

	SELENA
You're more afraid of the President than me???

	ELDERLY MAN 
No, of course not.

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM. CANDLELIT. NIGHT

Waiting for her are an extraordinary group of people, all of whom we met or glimpsed briefly at the garden party. Bianca is talking to ERICA, a red-haired female dwarf. A proud, barefoot AMERICAN INDIAN WOMAN in fringed doeskin is talking to a muscular, young BLACK MAN in a cashmere suit with lots of gold and diamond jewelry. NIGEL is sulking in the bar, his face covered with tannisroot ointment.

Selena enters with the Elderly Man in the banker pinstripe. They all form a circle in the centre of the room.

					SELENA
				Let us begin. I invoke the rule of seven.

OTHERS IN UNISON 
The Circle is complete.

	NIGEL
You better have a pretty good explanation for 
this, Selena.

	SELENA
We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth 
with powers far beyond those of anyone member of 
the Craft.

	INDIAN WOMAN
But Superman has been away.

	SELENA
It is not Superman I speak of, but his cousin Kara. She 
knows we exist..

	ELDERLY MAN
Then she must be destroyed.

	NIGEL 
How did she find out about us?

	ELDERLY MAN
That is unimportant. Now that she knows, she will 
become curious and learn more. When she learns 
we plan to restore the ancient religion of this planet 
and avenge the centuries of persecution---she will 
try to stop us.

	BIANCA
We must destroy her first.

	ERICA
But how can we destroy her?

SELENA
				By the Rite of Ultimate Power. One person must 
volunteer  to take on the combined power of us all.

Nigel stands up and points an accusing finger at Selena.

NIGEL
You! You want to take our power for yourself!

Selena reacts calmly, speaking in low, modulated tones, as if to an overstimulated child.

					SELENA
				Nige1, you know the one who takes on Ultimate 
Power must sacrifice the last sparks of her own spirit.

Selena takes hold of a golden chain hanging around her neck and draws out a little glass vial attached to it. Inside the glass vial a tiny spark glows brightly.

					SELENA
	 			      (continuing)
				Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?

					NIGEL
				You would! You revealed our existence so you could 
have all of our power.

	SELENA
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, 
Nigel?

	NIGEL
Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer 
of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.

	SELENA
Nonsense.

Nigel pulls aside the heavy veil covering her mirror.

FOR AN INSTANT SELENA SEES HER REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR. BEHIND HER LOOMS THE DARK, EVIL PRESENCE, INVISIBLE TO THE OTHERS IN THE ROOM, AND MUCH LARGER THAN WHEN SHE GLIMPSED IT AT HER GARDEN PARTY.

Then Bianca leaps to the mirror and pulls the veil back across it. Bianca stands challenging Nigel, daring him to try again. Selena looks at the gargoyle-shaped Coffer of Shadow, sitting beside her hearth. It too seems much larger than when we last saw it at the hospital. Selena wonders for a beat if maybe Nigel is right. Can the Shadow be ruling her?

BIANCA 
Enough quibbling. Let us vote.

They all draw their sacred white-handled knives out of concealment in their clothing. Nigel defiantly places his on the floor with its blade pointing inward. Then one by one, the others put down their knives with the blades pointing outward. They all look at Nigel. His shoulders sag with dejection.

 					SELENA
				I invoke the rule of seven. Do you agree?

Nigel speaks with the voice of someone pronouncing his own death sentence. 

NIGEL
I have no choice.

His knife turns by itself on the floor until its blade points outward. Everyone joins hands in the circle. A fire springs to life on the hearth. Someone starts to chant in a strange ancient tongue. Slowly the heavy, opulent living room begins to change: the carpet becomes the floor of an ancient stone temple with dark brown stains splattered across its massive granite blocks, the walls start to melt away. Outside the windows the dark night is replaced by hot, brutal sunlight pounding down on an endless desert stretching away to the horizon.



The house completely dissolves and is replaced by monumental stone ruins. The smoky fire crackles and sends its dark plumes boiling skyward. The only thing remaining of Selena's house is the hearth and the Coffer of Shadow. Selena stands up And walks out of the centre of the circle toward the Coffer. She opens the lid. She pulls the glass vial off the golden chain 
around her neck and drops it into the Coffer.

CUT TO:

EXT. TROPICAL BEACH. DAY

Ethan wanders along the beach with Supergirl, holding hands. She stops to pick up a seashell. Ethan clutches his head as if he has a sudden violent headache, moans, and collapses on the sand. Supergirl kneels beside him.

					SUPERGIRL
				Ethan, what IS wrong?

Ethan opens his eyes and looks at her. He speaks in a voice of bleak despair.

					ETHAN
				She said it wouldn't last.

SUPERGIRL
				What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?

Ethan sits up, wincing like someone with a bad hangover.

					ETHAN
				I don't love you any more.

SUPERGIRL 
Just like that?

	ETHAN
Like turning off a light.

He struggles to his feet and stands there unsteadily.
					
					ETHAN
				I feel awful. All that romantic garbage. All that 
mushy talk.

He lurches off into the undergrowth, toward the interior of the island. She plunges into the vegetation keeping pace with him.

SUPERGIRL 
Where are you going?


ETHAN 
Away. From you. 

	SUPERGIRL
But why?

ETHAN
				Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.

					SUPERGIRL
				I sort of like what you said.

					ETHAN
				That makes it worse.

					SUPERGIRL
				But I don't understand.

He stops and stares at her for a moment.

					ETHAN
				Of course you don't. We're from two different 
worlds, remember?

He stalks off into the jungle, leaving her behind, hurt and bewildered.

CUT TO:

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM/PAGAN TEMPLE. NIGHT

A barbaric ritual. Selena's companions sway and gyrate to the sound of gongs and drums. The floor is covered with a red mist. In the middle of a column of fire a figure like Selena seems to float. The ritual reaches its climax and everything pauses for a moment of sti11ness.

Selena steps forth from the column of fire. She is clothed in a shimmering garment---white with flashing highlights of rainbow iridescence. The six other members of her group fall to their knees in awe. Selena seems to glow with an inner radiance. She laughs, and the pagan temple around her changes back to the living room of her house in Midvale. In her shining gossamer gown and her new aura of majesty, she seems too large, too powerful to be contained in the familiar surroundings of her house.

SELENA
				At last. Ultimate Power.

					BIANCA
				And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!

					SELENA
				What do you mean we?

She turns on the kneeling six. They cringe from her. Selena raises her hands and the kneeling six cry out in fear.

CUT TO:

EXT. BESIDE A STREAM. TROPICAL PARADISE. DAY

Ethan is sitting beside a stream on a gravelly bank idly tossing pebbles into the water. Supergirl steps out of the jungle and watches for a moment. Then she comes and sits down beside him.

ETHAN
				Hi.

					SUPERGIRL
				Hello. Are you still mad at me?

					ETHAN
				I'm not mad at you.

					SUPERGIRL
				It seemed that way to me.

					ETHAN
				I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.

					SUPERGIRL 
Miss what?

ETHAN
				What I had before. What's not there now. It's like I 
woke up and found part of me wasn't there any more:
something that made me feel really alive and aware of 
things. It was like, for the first time in my life, everything 
fitted together perfectly---you and me and the world 
around us--like we were a wonderful song...

He falls silent, and tosses a few pebbles into the stream.

SUPERGIRL
				And now?

					ETHAN
				And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words 
don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...



	SUPERGIRL
Well...I don It know much about these things, but maybe 
if you had that feeling once...it can, come back. 

He turns to her hopefully.

					ETHAN 
You think so?

	SUPERGIRL 
I don't see why not.

	ETHAN
But what if---it wasn't real? 

SUPERGIRL
				Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours 
forever.

Ethan's face lights up. The future begins to exist for him again.

					ETHAN
				Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we 
could get together every now and then and see each 
other. And maybe something might. happen again. 
What do you think?

	SUPERGIRL
Are you asking me for a "date"?

ETHAN
				Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm---
available.

	SUPERGIRL
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?

	ETHAN
She'll forget about us eventually.

							CUT TO:

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM

In the polished surface of her mirror, Selena makes a scene appear: Ethan and Supergirl on the tropical island.



SUPERGIRL
      (image)
There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...

	ETHAN
        (image)
I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped 
like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...

CUT TO:

EXT. TROPIAL ISLAND

Supergirl becomes very excited.

					SUPERGIRL
				That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo 
City! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live? 

	ETHAN
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better 
stay away from there.

	SUPERGIRL
I can see through walls. I could surprise her. The only 
thing I can't see through is lead, that's why I didn't 
see the Power Source at the amusement park.

She stands up.

					ETHAN
				Wait. Don't leave me.

SUPERGIRL
				You'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have 
the Power Source.

He stands up and takes her hand.

ETHAN 
Before you go...

	SUPERGIRL
What?

	ETHAN 
Just one kiss. For old times' sake.


	SUPERGIRL
And you can see how you feel about me, right?

	ETHAN
Yes.

She closes her eyes and parts her lips. Slowly their lips come together and touch. Then a sudden rush of sheer desire flows through them and the simple experimental kiss become an ecstatic prelude to the heights of lovemaking. But before either one of them can go one step further, ETHAN DISAPPEARS WITH A FLASH OF BLINDING WHITE LIGHT. A cloud darkens the sun, and the trees are lashed into a frenzy by gale-force winds. Selena's laughter can be heard from somewhere far away.

					SUPERGIRL
				Ethan!

Supergirl flies into the air.

EXT. TROPICAL ISLAND. SUNSET. SKY ABOVE ISLAND. DAY

Supergirl flies around the island very fast at high speed, searching for Ethan and Selena. She hovers like an eagle for a moment, then speeds straight upwards.

EXT. ABOVE THE OCEAN. DAY

Supergirl flies back to North America, faster than she has ever flown before.

EXT. ABOVE MIDVALE. DAY

Supergirl zeros in on Selena's house like an exocet.

EXT. SELENA'S FRONT LAWN

Supergirl lands and walks cautiously up to the front door, ready for anything but what she finds: the front door is ajar. She pushes it open with a creak of its massive hinges. She walks slowly inside.

INT. SELENA'S MANSION. FRONT HALL/LIVING ROOM

Supergirl looks around. The house seems deserted and drastically neglected. Cobwebs hang over everything. The dust has the thickness of a hundred years. Moths have eaten away all the splendid tapestries. Rats cavort along the baseboards. Bats sleep in the chandeliers. In the living room Supergirl finds Bianca crouched in A Corner, gibbering mindlessly. Bianca too has changed: she is dressed in rags, and her wild staring eyes are rimmed with dark circles. When she sees Supergirl she cries with fright.

SUPERGIRL
				Hey take it easy. I won't hurt you.

BIANCA
				I thought .it was her, coming back. Spared me. 
But I thought. . . maybe changed her mind. 
Nigel warned us. Wouldn't listen to him.

	SUPERGIRL
What are you talking about? Where's Selena?

BIANCA
				No. Don't want to know. She's bad. Don't go near her.
				Hurt you.

SUPERGIRL 
I have to find her. Tell me.

Supergirl looks into Bianca's eyes with her calm, heroic gaze, and Bianca comes somewhat to her senses. Bianca points to the adjoining bar. Supergirl walks over warily and sees FIVE GOLDEN CAGES suspended among the bottles. Nigel and the four remaining members of the Circle are imprisoned in them, shrunken but alive. Nige1 is in a perpetually turning squirrel wheel. He sees her and calls out.

NIGEL
				Supergirl! She's waiting for you. On Taliesen Mountain. 
Stop her before it's too late!

Supergirl gets a look of determination on her face. She turns and flies out through the French doors and heads straight up into the air.

INT. SELENA'S NEW HOUSE (A MOUNTAIN-TOP PALACE) 

Ethan is in a dark, shadowy place, bound to a stake with stout cords. Sticks of wood are piled all around his feet. Selena stands beside him in her shining gown of power. She looks even more gorgeous and cruel than before. She offers him a glass of water to drink, but he turns his head away violently.

					ETHAN
				I'm wise to your tricks, lady.

					SELENA
				I could force you.

					ETHAN
				If that worked, you would've done it already. No, 
you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well 
let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell 
before I fall for that one again.

	SELENA
Go on,  talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten.


She puts the glass of water in a, basket at the end of an iron chain hanging down from above. There is a straw in the glass at such an angle that Ethan can just reach it with his lips if he stretches as far as possible.

SELENA
				You've been without water for a whole day. Let's 
see how thirsty you get in a week.

	ETHAN 
You vicious--

	SELENA
Careful, don't make me angry. I start fires when I'm angry.


She glances meaningfully at the faggots piled around his feet and walks away.

THE CAMERA FOLLOWS HER revealing that she has been talking to Ethan inside the mammoth fireplace of her living room. Her new house is enormous. Where before she lived in a mansion, now she dwells in a palace. The fireplace is seven feet high, the living room floor is wide as a football field, and. the French windows into the garden now tower like the windows in the North transept of Chartres Cathedral. Selena disappears out the imposing portals which lead to the wet bar and butler's pantry--each now the size of a basketball court.

Back in the fireplace, Ethan cranes his neck to make sure she has gone, then reaches out toward the glass hanging nearby. He pokes the straw with his forehead. The glass swings slightly. The glass swings close enough for him to bump it with his forehead and set up a rhythm. He gauges the swing of the glass and, at the precise moment, grabs for it with his mouth. He catches hold of the rim of the glass with his teeth and holds it there for a moment as he summons his courage to do what must be done. He bites hard on the rim of the glass with his teeth.

The glass shatters and falls to the floor with a crash, leaving Ethan with a small fragment of the rim in his mouth and a trickle of blood down his chin. He leans his head over until it is directly above his left hand tied to the stake two and a half feet below his shoulders. A droplet of blood falls into his hand. He drops the glass fragment down to his hand and catches it. He grins, and sighs with relief. Then spits to clear his mouth. Slowly he saws. at the ropes that hold him with the sliver of glass in his left hand. One by one the strands part.

Ethan strains against his bonds and the weakened rope snaps. He quickly disentangles himself from the coils and steps out of the fireplace. He looks around the mammoth room. The coast is clear. He spits a few bits of glass out of his mouth, and dashes out of the doors
to the garden.




EXT. SELENA'S HOUSE. GARDEN.  CONSERVATORY

Ethan sees a green plastic garden hose, which the gardener has left running in a trickle to irrigate the hydrangeas. Ethan remembers that he is very thirsty. He picks up the hose, rinses out his mouth hurriedly, and then takes long, desperate gulps of the water. Behind him he hears Selena's laughter. He drops the hose as if stung by an electric eel and turns to see her emerge from behind a large strangler fig.

INSERT ETHAN'S P.O.V.

The same effect as when he drank the love potion the first time. The plants of the conservatory swirl and distort in garish nightmare colours. At the centre of his vision is an area of crystal clarity surrounding Selena. She approaches him seductively, fully confident of her power. As she comes nearer, the clear area expands and drives out the visual chaos. Selena speaks, and her voice is a close-miked throaty purr.

SELENA
				I told you I'd win.

BACK TO SCENE

Ethan is held by the spell of her magic. And yet there is part of him that still resists. You can see him try to turn his head away from the vision of ideal beauty before him, and then give in as she comes closer and I touches him with her hand. A zap of energy passes between them at her touch.

SELENA
				Kiss me.
	
He embraces her roughly and crushes her lips with a kiss. He is filled with a tigerish lust that thrills her deeply. She rakes her long red fingernails across his back and moans with pleasure.

EXT. ABOVE THE MOUNTAINS. DAY

Supergirl flies over the Rockies toward Selena's house.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. TALIESEN MOUNTAIN. SELENA'S NEW HOUSE. DAY

Supergirl flies over Selena's new house. For the first time we can see the enormousness of it: 
a grotesque, towering monstrosity, that seems to brood threateningly over the landscape.

EXT. GARDEN BEHIND SELENA'S NEW HOUSE. DAY

Supergirl lands and walks toward the towering French doors of the living room. But something distracts her. She turns and enters the gigantic conservatory to her right.


INT. CONSERVATORY

Supergirl looks around and sees in the middle of the conservatory a reflecting pool surrounded by exotic plants. She walks closer and looks down into the reflecting pool. In the bottom of the shallow pool she sees Ethan securely bound. His eyes stare wildly. Dead or drowning.

SUPERGIRL
				Ethan!

She leaps into the shallow pool, and sinks over her head. A polygonal section of the surface of the reflecting pool detaches itself from the water and rises up perpendicularly. It is a door to the Phantom Zone. Supergirl is trapped behind an impenetrable force field, looking out in despair. Ethan is not there with her. His image has disappeared. 

The real flesh and blood Ethan appears with Selena from behind the strangler fig. They look in at Supergirl trapped behind the shimmering polygon that la ads to the Phantom Zone. Selena laughs at her, but Ethan stares as if at a long forgotten acquaintance whose name he is trying to recall.

Selena notices Ethan's wandering attention and she puts her arms possessively around him.

SELENA
				Enjoy your prison, Supergirl. It's forever.

Supergirl calls out to Ethan, her hands and face pressed against the transparent wall of her prison, but no sound can escape the impenetrable force field.

INT. PHANTOM ZONE DOOR

Supergirl is seen in reverse, beating on the hard crystalline surface of the prison.

SUPERGIRL
				Ethan! Don't let her do this!

Beyond the threshold of the zone, Selena in her conservatory kisses Ethan with fierce lust. He returns her , emotion, forgetting all about Supergirl.

SUPERGIRL
No. No. It isn't true.

The image of Selena and Ethan begins to recede, getting smaller and smaller, until it vanishes entirely in infinite blackness.

EXT. SPACE

The flat two-dimensional polygon that is Supergirl's prison whirls away through space. Behind the transparent surface we can see Supergirl's face stained with tears.

EXT. PHANTOM ZONE 

Another kind of reality. Unlike anything we have ever seen. The crystal prison lands on the ground of the Phantom Zone and shatters. Supergirl picks herself up from among the fragments of her prison and looks around. The landscape is utterly strange and alien, with a feel of stark, oppressive sterility. As far as the eye can see there is no sign of life. Supergirl stands up and raises her arms to fly. She hops into the air about eight inches and lands flat-footedly on the sand. With a shock she realises SHE CAN'T FLY.

She hops a few more times, with no more success.

She picks up a small rock from the ground. She tries to crush it in her hand. She can't. Angrily she hurls it from her as far as she can. Instead of disappearing into infinity it drops at her feet a few yards away. She scoops up some sand from the ground and holds it cupped in her hand. She takes a deep breath and tries to blow it away. She is barely able to disturb a few grains. She drops the sand and sits down on a rock, forlorn and dejected.

Suddenly she hears Alura's voice, very faint and coming from a long distance away.

 ALURA'S VOICE 
Kara, where are you?

	KARA
Mother? I can hardly hear you.

	ALURA. S VOICE
Kara! You're alive. We were so worried. You disappeared 
from the scanners...

KARA
				I'm lost, Mother. In some awful place. I can't fly anymore. 
And I'm weak.

	ALURA'S VOICE
Kara, you must not give up. We must retrieve the 
Power Source. The City is dying.

					KARA
				Then send someone else. I failed.

					ALURA'S VOICE
				We can't. The' dimension barrier is stronger. We no 
longer have the power to push through.

KARA
				But Mother, I'm lost. 

					ALURA' S VOICE 
You must try. . . it's cold. And dark. . .

The rest of her sentence fades out, and is lost. 

KARA 
Mother---I tried. I really tried.

Kara puts her face in her hands and starts to sob hopelessly.

CUT TO:

EXT. UNITED NATIONS, NEW YORK. DAY

Establishing shot. 

INT. GENERAL ASSEMBLY

The DELEGATE FROM URITANIA is going on (in Esperanto) denouncing the latest outrage against his peace-loving country. A few bored DELEGATES of various nationalities
are sprawled in their seats listening to the simultaneous translation over earphones. The dign1fied PRESIDENT of the General Assembly is sitting on the dais behind the ranting delegate. With a FLASH OF LIGHT and a chok1ng cloud of sulfur fumes, Selena appears beside the podium. She is in her shimmering white robe. The dozing delegates wake up with amazement. The URITANIAN delegate stares at her with his mouth open as she slides him away from the microphone. 

INT.  TRANSLATOR"S BOOTH . GENERAL ASSEMBLY

Inside the translator's booth, the entire panorama of the enormous hall is visible through the glass window. The eight TRANSLATORS stop translating and stare at the scene below.

BACK TO GENERAL ASSEMBLY

Selena is about to speak in the microphone, when two SECURITY GQUARDS attempt to step onto the podium. Selena reaches out toward them. A field of force from her hands stops them in their tracks, knocking them backwards off the steps to land on their butts. The delegates gasp at this act of magical violence.

SELENA
				Nations of the world! I bring you tidings of a new age!

The President of the General Assembly starts to shout at her and bang on the podium with his gavel. Selena looks over her shoulder with mild annoyance. Instantly the President's gavel turns into a live eel. The President drops it with horror. Selena continues her speech.

SELENA
				I bring you a return to the ancient true worship of 
Nature, our Sovereign Queen and Mother. And 
I bring you myself as her representative here 
on Earth.

The URITANIAN suddenly recovers his wits and tries to place a hand on Selena's shoulder. A whirlwind hurls him off the podium into the desks of the front row delegates. The delegates babble in consternation but keep to their seats. Selena raises her voice to be heard over the uproar.

SELENA
				From this moment forth, all science, religion and other
				unnatural beliefs are forbidden. And in their place I 
will teach the One True Way of our ancient 
grandmothers.

The President of the General Assembly has recovered enough from the surprise of the eel to 
interrupt Selena.

					PRESIDENT
				You are talking about the end of Civilisation as we 
know it.

	SELENA
And it's about time too.

	PRESIDENT
I do not know who you are, or what evil force 
you represent, but it will take more than a
few threats from you to make mankind turn back 
the clock and abandon thousands of years of progress.

Selena has listened with a mocking smile as he speaks. He finishes to a smattering of applause from some of the delegates.

SELENA
				Threats? I don't need threats to destroy civilisation. 
I have something better.

She snaps her fingers in the air. Immediately a RAIN OF MONEY BEGINS TO FALL ALL OVER THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY. PAPER MONEY AND COINS OF ALL NATIONS. Selena looks at her work with pleasure. Then she disappears in a FLASH OF LIGHT.

The delegates blink with astonishment. The only trace of her presence is the tang of sulfur in the air---and the money. One delegate forgets his dignity and starts scooping up money from his desk and stuffing it into his pockets. Suddenly all the delegates are doing the same thing. The only exception is the delegate from the United Kingdom who thinks it might be beneath his dignity, and looks about with mild disapproval.

CUT TO:



EXT. THE PHANTOM ZONE

Supergirl walks across the rolling monotony of the Phantom Zone. We have never seen her like this before: sweating, her hair unkempt, streaks of dirt and grit on her face, exhausted and full of despair. She stumbles at the crest of a low ridge and falls down to the bottom of the slope, banging her head on a rock. She sits there, a big rip in her ,uniform, rubbing her bruised forehead. It is hard to imagine her any worse off.

She hears a sound, vaguely familiar. She looks around for its source. She follows the sound, crawling slowly along the base of the ridge. The sound gets louder and as she, approaches. It is a sound of celestial, spiritual beauty: the music of the spheres.

Suddenly she comes out into a tiny valley in the Phantom Zone and sees before her the most beautiful sight she could imagine. The harsh monochromatic sterility of the Phantom Zone gives way to a riot of bright colours. A dome-like building protrudes from the ground. All around it are gorgeous singing sculptures in the style of Argo City. A sculptor. in the clothing of Argo City is modeling a glassy statue with a matterwand. He turns and catches sight of Supergirl. It is Zaltar.

SUPERGIRL
				Zaltar.

Zaltar drops his wand and comes running over to Supergirl. He kneels beside her on the sandy ground.

ZALTAR
				Kara? Is it you?

Supergirl nods. She is obviously exhausted. Zaltar takes the bulb full of liquid off his belt and offers her a drink. She drinks thirstily of the refreshing green liquid, and feels strength returning to her body.

SUPERGIRL 
What is this place?

	ZALTAR
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you 
come here from Argo City?

	SUPERGIRL 
I was on Earth...

	ZALTAR
Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?

	SUPERGIRL
Yes. I went there to find the lost Power Source...


	ZALTAR 
Shouldnt've done that.

	SUPERGIRL
...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me 
to the Phantom Zone.

	ZALTAR
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can 
unleash all sorts of terrible forces---

	SUPERGIRL
I know.

	ZALTAR
Well, nothing we can do about it. Come into my house. 
You can stay with me, until I build you your own 
place. I expect you won't want to mix with the others--
not our type of people.

He helps her to her feet and over to his house, a sort of Argonian gothic cathedral half-buried in the sand. The curves of the arches and the materials are strongly reminiscent of Zaltar's work on Argo City.

					SUPERGIRL
				Others?

					ZALTAR
				Criminals.

Zaltar gestures vaguely to the horizon on his right.

					ZALTAR
				A few hundred parasangs that way. I avoid 
them. And you should too.

Zaltar leads Supergirl past the singing sculptures. She smiles as she passes them, and remembers his "tree" in Argo City.

SUPERGIRL 
...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."

	ZALTAR 
What? Palace? Hardly.

	SUPERGIRL
Just feels, a little, like a tiny bit of Argo City...


ZALTAR
				Yes. Can't seem to get away from that style. 
Must try something new.

INT. ZALTAR'S HOUSE

He helps her down a long spiraling staircase to the floor of a high domed room. In the centre of the room is a huge round table cluttered with tools, models and unfinished projects.

SUPERGIRL 
It's lovely. . .

	ZALTAR
No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything 
just right. Nobody telling you to change this, 
move that around. Please yourself. That's 
the secret of happiness.

	SUPERGIRL
Are you happy, Zaltar?

ZALTAR
				What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do 
whatever I want. All the time.

	SUPERGIRL
But what about other people? Don't you miss them?

They have reached the ground floor. Zaltar plucks one of the liquid filled bulbs from the stem of a large plant growing in a niche in the wall. He squirts some of the green liquid in his mouth with great satisfaction.

					ZALTAR
				I look at them all the time. Every planet in the galaxy. 
It's quite boring. Here, rub some of this onto that bruise.

He carefully applies some of the green liquid to the wound on her scalp.

SUPERGIRL
				You look at them? How?

					ZALTAR
				The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you 
have the right tools.

Zaltar sweeps the clutter off the table and onto the floor.



He passes his hand over the table and instantly the table turns into a WINDOW INTO ANOTHER WORLD, showing an image of a herdboy riding on the back of a water buffalo in a rice paddy.

ZALTAR
				There you see? What could be more boring than that?

He waves his hand, and the image disappears.

SUPERGIRL
				Wait. Could...could I see the place I just came from?

Zaltar sighs with great martyrdom, and starts to fiddle with his controls.

					ZALTAR
				It'll only make you sad. 

He shows her the proper hand gestures to control the image.

					ZALTAR
				This goes closer. This moves it around. And 
this begins.

He gestures with his hand and the WINDOW OPENS again. Supergirl ZOOMS THE IMAGE IN as fast as she can, trembling with desperate urgency. The IMAGE ON THE TABLE DISSOLVES FROM HIGH ABOVE A CITY DOWN TO :

EXT. WALL STREET.  DAY

The financial district. Bank clerks are shoveling money out the windows of several large, imposing banks. Passersby ignore the bonanza, and trudge dejectedly on.

INT. STOCK EXCHANGE. DAY

Chaos and pandemonium on the floor. Not the everyday chaos and pandemonium you always see. Brokers are trying to strangle one another. Fist fights. Bloody noses. The crunch of breaking knuckles.

EXT. SUPERMARKET.  DAY

People are waiting in line with wheelbarrows full of money. The store manager shakes his head and sends them away. The only people he lets in the store are a man with a live turkey under his arm, a little old lady carrying a Rembrandt in a nice gold frame, a woman who gives him her fur coat and a man with an antique clock.





EXT. HIGH ABOVE SELENA'S NEW HOUSE. TALIESEN MOUNTAIN.  DAY

The CAMERA ZOOMS DOWN and DISSOLVES THROUGH THE ROOF TO:

INT. ANTE ROOM IN SELENA'S NEW HOUSE

A mob of dignitaries and petitioners is waiting anxiously outside the large imposing doors to Selena's reception room. Generals in uniform, diplomats wearing their medals pinned ,on their formal suits, bankers in pin stripes, and the robed ecclesiastics and holy men of various faiths. A secretary opens the door to the reception room, and the dignitaries all surge forward.

					SECRETARY
				No more audiences today. Go home. All 
of you.

Through the open door Selena can be glimpsed sitting .on her throne-like chair, with Ethan kneeling at her feet, resting his head in her lap like  a pet animal.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SELENA'S SITTING ROOM

The secretary closes the doors leaving Ethan and Selena alone. She strokes his head. Outside crowds can be heard chanting her name: "Selena! Selena!"

SELENA
				They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?

					ETHAN
				Yeah.

Selena gets up and walks over to the door leading out to her balcony.

SELENA
				Coming?

Ethan follows her sullenly.

EXT. BALCONY

They walk out onto the balcony. The crowds scream her name. She waves smiling. Ethan stands a step behind her with a moody expression on his face.

					SELENA
				Smile, lunk-head. You're not a gardener any more, 
you're Prince Ethan now.

Ethan lifts his hand and waves half-heartedly.

EXT. GROUNDS OF SELENA'S NEW HOUSE.  BENEATH THE BALCONY

The crowd is enormous, held back behind police barricades. Guards in the special livery of Selena's service hold back the surging tide of humanity: people .praying, chanting, walking on their knees, cripples on crutches, the ailing on stretchers carried by relatives. And in front a disciplined youth group in a distinctive costume perform chants and fanatic cheers. Huge banners display Selena's portrait. Images of her are everywhere.

INT. ZALTAR'S HOUSE. PHANTOM ZONE

Supergirl reels with shock at the scene 

SUPERGIRL 
That horrible woman!

	ZALTAR
Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would 
make you sad.

He starts to gesture the image away, but she puts her hand on his arm, stopping him.

SUPERGIRL
				No. I have to see this.

Zaltar shrugs.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. HAMBURGER HEAVEN. MIDVALE. DAY

The roadside complex where Lucy's traffic accident occurred. The Hamburger Place is boarded up. The area is almost deserted and no cars pass on the street. All of the huge advertising billboards along the way are now covered with pictures of Selena. The only writing is in mystic symbols. A lone figure walks furtively along the street. It is LUCY LANE, her face disguised with dark glasses. She goes to the rear of the abandoned Hamburger Place and knocks four times. The door opens quickly and she ducks inside.

INT. HAMBURGER HEAVEN. DAY

The restaurant has been converted into a clandestine print shop. A few serious teenagers are working the press and turning out seditious handbills. Freshly printed pages are hung on clothes-lines so the ink can dry. "THE TRUTH ABOUT SELENA" is the headline over JIMMY'S PHOTO of her getting into the Cadillac with her huge shadow looming behind. Lucy crosses to Jimmy Olsen, who is tying up bundles of handbills.

LUCY
				I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers 
have been arrested!

					JIMMY
				How do you know?

					LUCY
				I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.

					JIMMY 
Did anybody notice you?

	LUCY
I can't help it if men notice me.

	JIMMY
Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for  treason!

She kisses him on the nose.

LUCY 
Just kidding. Nobody saw me.

Jimmy gives her another bundle of handbills. HELMETED GUARDS in the livery of Selena's service kick down the door. and rush in, weapons drawn. They smash up the print shop and arrest everybody. Jimmy and Lucy are handcuffed and dragged away.

INT. PRISON

The Danvers and all the teenagers from the print shop are crowded into tiers of barred cells set into the walls of a dark, enormous cavern. Jimmy and Lucy huddle together for warmth in one of the tiny cells.

JIMMY
				I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't 
let any of this go on. Not for one minute.

	LUCY
I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.

JIMMY
				I heard stories.  I don't think you wanna know.

There is the clank of an iron door, and Ethan enters the prison with several of the guards in Selena's livery. He walks past the cells, glancing now and then with compassion at the poor wretches inside. Lucy calls out as he passes.

LUCY 
Hey! Ethan!

	ETHAN
Hmmm?

LUCY
				Remember me? We were in a disaster together.

					ETHAN .
				Oh yeah, the girl in the hospital, on the other stretcher.

					LUCY
				Right! Say, do you swing any weight around here?

					ETHAN
				A little.

					LUCY
				Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We 
thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.

	ETHAN
I'll mention it upstairs.

He turns to go, but Jimmy reaches out and grabs his sleeve.

					JIMMY
				The blonde girl who saved your life---where 
is she now?

Ethan pauses. Buried memories rise to the surface of his mind, bringing pain.

ETHAN
				She's gone. No one will ever see her again.

CUT TO:

INT. ZALTAR'S HOUSE IN THE ZONE

Supergirl waves her hand over the table angrily, decisively. The WINDOW of the Zone closes, and the image of Ethan disappears. She crosses to Zaltar, who is reclining on a couch in an adjoining room, getting drunk on the green liquid from the plant bladders.

SUPERGIRL 
Zaltar, please help me.

	ZALTAR
Of course, my dear. What can I do?

	SUPERGIRL
Help me to get back to Earth. Where my friends are. 
They need me.

Zaltar looks pained, and takes several deep drinks of green plant sap before he answers.

					ZALTAR
				There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. 
That's why they send the criminals here.

SUPERGIRL
				If there's a way in, there must be a way out.

					ZALTAR
				No, that's not true---there's well...no--

He suddenly has an idea, vaguely forming at the back of his drink-sodden brain. He toys with it, while Supergirl leans forward eagerly, waiting. He changes his mind several times about whether it's possible or not, each time changing his facial expression. Supergirl has the feeling she's watching a debate conducted by squints and grimaces.

ZALTAR 
There is a way.

	SUPERGIRL 
I knew it!

	ZALTAR
But it's impossible.

	SUPERGIRL
Why?

	ZALTAR
No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too---
if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity---
no, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it.

Supergirl's heart sinks. She rocks back, clutching her knees, trying not to show her sadness.

					ZALTAR
				I could do it.

She is suddenly all excitement and hopefulness again.

SUPERGIRL 
Then teach me how.

	ZALTAR
No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get 
one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a 
sip of this? It's delicious, I think.


He takes another sip of his drink.

SUPERGIRL 
Tell me how. to do it. If you could do it, I can.

He looks at her shrewdly, appraising her abilities with a suddenly lucid glance.

ZALTAR
				Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. 
Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a 
kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards 
too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have 
the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's 
out of the question.

	SUPERGIRL
Then come with me.

					ZALTAR
				Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?

					SUPERGIRL
				You could do anything. You could sculpt 
mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! 
You'd have superpowers.

	ZALTAR
 Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?

	SUPERGIRL
Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are 
in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power 
Source, Argo City will die.

He looks at her kneeling beside his couch, tears streaming down her cheeks, pleading with him.

ZALTAR
Oh, all right. Stop crying. Let's go.

He stands up, takes his matterwand, and heads for the stairs up to the surface. Supergirl can hardly believe her plea has been granted. She runs after him, up the stairs.

SUPERGIRL
				You're going to take me back?

					ZALTAR
				Going to try. Didn't say I could.

EXT. ZALTAR' S HOUSE. PHANTOM ZONE

They emerge from the circular doorway out onto the flat monotonous terrain of the zone. Zaltar pauses for a moment to get his bearings, then strikes out with long energetic strides. Supergirl hurries to keep up with him.

SUPERGIRL
				I heard my mother ask you once "how could a 
man with such a selfish heart create beauty?" 
She was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous 
heart.

	ZALTAR
Not doing this for you. Just sick of this place, 
that's all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling 
at you. Boring!

Supergirl scampers along beside him, smiling. Zaltar never looks back at his abandoned house, but keeps his gaze fixed on the horizon straight ahead.

INT. SELENA'S NEW HOUSE. HALLWAY

Ethan is walking down the hall and sees guards dragging Lucy Lane and Jimmy Olsen in chains. Lucy calls out to him.

LUCY
				Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.

ETHAN
				I did.

					LUCY
				     (bitterly)
				Well thanks a pile, fella.

Ethan watches them dragged away. He has a puzzled expression on his face.

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM. DAY

Ethan enters. Selena is staring into her magic mirror. Her face is white with fear.

ETHAN 
What's going on?

Selena snaps irritably at him.

SELENA 
Guess! Go on.

ETHAN
				I don't know. You seem afraid.

					SELENA
				You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?

					ETHAN
				     (the truth dawns on him)
				Supergirl?

Selena doesn't answer, but looks back at the mirror. Ethan moves to her side and watches with her the IMAGE OF THE PHANTOM ZONE.

INT. PHANTOM ZONE/QUANTUM VORTEX

Zaltar leads the way, firming their path with the matterwand, and then hauling himself and Supergirl forward over an upward sloping, undulating surface. Behind them luminescent waves of energy can be seen, like the ocean at the base of a steep cliff, constantly sweeping backwards and downwards, away from their goal.

INT. SELENA'S NEW LIVING ROOM

Selena looks up and realises Ethan is behind her, looking intently at the image.

SELENA
				Quit staring so hard. You'll strain your eyes.

She puts her hand on his cheek. He turns away from the image of Supergirl and looks deep in 
Selena's eyes.

					ETHAN
				You're not going to hurt her, are you?

Selena is furious. Her eyes get that dangerous look.

SELENA
				You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?

					ETHAN
				Well...I guess I can't.

					SELENA
				I'm ready for her. I'll show you.

Selena walks out the French doors followed by the dazed Ethan.



EXT. CONSERVATORY. DAY

MR. & Mrs. Danvers, Lucy Lane, and Jimmy Olsen are imprisoned in four metal cages hanging over the reflecting pool in the conservatory. The ropes that keep the cages from falling into the pool are GIGANTIC GOLDEN SERPENTS, their tails around an overhead beam, and the jaws tightly locked on the tops of the cages. A fifth cage hangs there empty. The water in the reflecting pool has changed colour to an opaque yellow. Selena shows the arrangements to Ethan.

SELENA
				Unless Supergirl agrees to go away forever, the 
serpents will drop them one by one. 

Selena puts a small silver whistle to her lips and blows a high, melodious note. The fifth serpent opens his jaws and releases the empty cage into the pool.

INSERT: REFLECTING POOL

The empty cage lands in the water and is instantly eaten up by the most powerful acid imaginable, leaving nothing but froth and acrid fumes. Ethan looks down into the cool at his reflection distorted by the spreading ripples. 

BACK TO SCENE

ETHAN
				Why the empty cage?

SELENA
That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and 
see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd 
hate to lose you, Ethan.

Selena steps beside him and puts her hand on his shoulder. Ethan cries out with terror. Selena looks down at what he sees.

INSERT: REFLECTING POOL

Behind Selena, distorted almost beyond recognition by the ripples on the surface, is a GIANT MONSTROUS SHADOW-BEING, ITS ARMS OUTSTRETCHED, ALMOST ENVELOPING HER, but invisible except in reflections.

BACK TO SCENE

Selena steps away from the pool, shaken by the sight.

ETHAN
				What...?


					SELENA
				You don't get this far without paying...a 
certain price.

She turns and walks quickly out of the conservatory, followed by Ethan.

MR. DANVERS
				If only I hadn't made that speech denouncing her.

MRS . DANVERS
I'm not afraid to die. I'm proud of you.

She stretches out her hand through the bars and clasps his bravely. Lucy turns her face away to give them some privacy in their. final moments. Jimmy is looking at her.

					JIMMY 
       (shyly)
I've been in love with you for years. Remember 
how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? 
And put your fingerprints on my lens.

LUCY
				Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're 
attention.

	JIMMY
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what...
all this time?

	LUCY 
You bet your ass.

	JIMMY
Why didn't you tell me?

	LUCY
You're supposed to guess.

She reaches out her hand through the bars and clasps his bravely, like the Danvers.

INT. THE PHANTOM ZONE/QUANTUM VORTEX

Zaltar is continuing his climb, but the way is getting steeper, and he is tired and short of breath. He pauses.

					SUPERGIRL
				Why are you stopping?


					ZALTAR
				Stopping? Was I? Silly. One thing you 
musn't do.

He continues forward, and upward, firming their path with the matterwand. The wand creates a warm circle of white light around them in contrast to the monochromatic energy field of the Phantom Zone. Because of the inherent curvature of the Phantom Zone vortex, they seem to be scrambling up a sheer vertical wall now. Supergirl is close beside Zaltar helping him along, not merely following as she had before. The throbbing sound of energy waves surging down the vortex is growing louder as they proceed. Zaltar stumbles, and drops the matterwand.

ZALTAR
				Oh dear!

The vortex starts to sweep the wand backwards, down to where they have just climbed from.  Supergirl makes a desperate lunge and retrieves the wand as it sweeps past. But now she is being swept backwards.

ZALTAR 
The wand. Use it.

Supergirl somehow finds the right grip on the controls and points the wand at the undulating surface beneath her. She stills the moving surface and stops her backwards motion.

					ZALTAR
				Good girl! That's the way!

But now Zaltar is being swept backwards toward her. She points the wand at his feet and halts his downhill slide.

					ZALTAR
				You can use the wand.

					SUPERGIRL
				Better than when I was a child.

She hands it back to him and they resume their slow upward progress.

ZALTAR
				I remember you then. Cute thing you were. Like 
your mother.

CUT TO:





INT. SELENA'S NEW LIVING ROOM

Selena stands watching the image of Zaltar and Supergirl in her mirror. Beside her on the floor is the Coffer of Shadow, now swollen to the size of a large pumpkin. It pulses and glows with inner light. The lid of the Coffer of Shadow starts to rattle as if something inside is attempting to get out.

INT. THE PHANTOM ZONE/QUANTUM VORTEX

Flaming spheres of BALL LIGHTNING begin to whizz past Zaltar and Supergirl. Zaltar is startled, and he stops his forward progress.

ZALTAR
				What's that? Never saw anything like that.

					SUPERGIRL
				Don't stop. Keep moving.

					ZALTAR 
Yes, mustn't stop.

	SUPERGIRL
       (grimly) 
 It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work.

Another flaming sphere whizzes toward them. It hits Zaltar on the shoulder and knocks him off the safe path. He starts to roll backwards down the vortex.


SUPERGIRL 
Zaltar. Use the wand!

ZALTAR
				Too late. Too late. Save yourself.

He is being swept faster and .faster away from her, receding like the image of Ethan when she was trapped in the zone. Zaltar throws the wand to her, and then is swept away, out of sight, downward to his death. He calls out after he disappears.

ZALTAR 
  				       (voice over) 
Goodbye...

	SUPERGIRL
Zaltar!

She begins to be swept backwards, but she uses the wand, and stops her slide. Gripping the wand fiercely, she starts to forge ahead. All the while she has to dodge the flaming spheres that Selena sends down the vortex.

SUPERGIRL
				You're not going to win, Selena. I won't let you.

Suddenly Supergirl enters another area of the vortex. She begins to move forward, upward, without clawing her way. She accelerates, moving faster and faster.

EXT. GRASSY MEADOW BESIDE A POND

Supergirl lands, in a deserted sunny meadow. She collapses sobbing on the grass. The matterwand lies beside her.

SUPERGIRL
				Zaltar, Zaltar. You never had a selfish heart.

She looks up at the sun shining down serenely, bathing the Earth in its life-giving rays---and returning her superpowers to her.

SUPERGIRL
				Wherever you are, Zaltar, thank 'you.  

She stands up and flexes her muscles. She no longer looks tired or disheveled. Her red and blue costume shines in the bright sunlight. She picks up the matterwand and leaps into the air, flying faster than a speeding bullet.

EXT. ABOVE SELENA'S NEW HOUSE. TALIESEN MOUNTAIN

Supergirl swoops down from the sky and dives through the roof.

INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM

Supergirl smashes through the ceiling and lands next to the French doors. Ethan and Selena are standing against the opposite wall, next to the veiled mirror.

SUPERGIRL
				You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.

					ETHAN 
She has hostages.

	SELENA
The Danvers. And two of your little friends.

	SUPERGIRL
It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.

Ethan points to the conservatory and mimes the words 'out there'. Selena blows on the silver whistle on the chain around her neck.

INSERT: THE SERPENT HOLDING JIMMY OLSEN'S CAGE OPENS ITS MOUTH AND THE CAGE DROPS AWAY.

BACK TO SCENE

Supergirl blows an enormous blast of superbreath out the French doors.

INT. CONSERVATORY

Jimmy Olsen's cage is blown away from the acid bath and he lands in a bank of ferns.

JIMMY
				Hey, what gives?

The blast of superbreath blows the cages of Lucy and the Danvers away from the pool as well. The serpents loose their grip, arid the Danvers and Lucy land beside Jimmy in the fern bank.

INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY

Selena witnesses the destruction of her hostage scheme.

SELENA
				All right, Supergirl. The game's not over till 
the last card's dealt.

Selena opens the lid of the grotesquely swollen Coffer of Shadow sitting beside her on the floor. The OMEGAHEDRON inside spins.

All the FURNITURE in the room suddenly launches itself at Supergirl. Huge oak refectory tables, alabaster thrones, marble urns, iron firegrates, shie1ds and armour, bronze statuary, and razor sharp panes of glass from the windows all shatter themselves against her invulnerable body. Ethan stands in the corner, ducking the stray fragments that come his way.

SUPERGIRL
				You've run out of things to throw, Selena.
	
					SELENA
				Not yet.

Selena points her hand at Supergirl with a gesture of attack. The COFFER OF SHADOW emits a dense black mist that darkens the room. A giant invisible hand seizes Supergirl and hurls her into the alchemical bar with a crash of bottles. Supergirl stands up with the wand held in front of her to ward off another attack.

ETHAN
				It's her shadow-self! Her dark side!

SUPERGIRL
				How do I fight it?

					ETHAN
				Turn it against her.

Supergirl raises the wand and APPLIES IT TO HER OWN BODY. THERE IS A FLASH OF BLINDING LIGHT, and Supergirl is transformed into a perfect image of Selena---as she was at the fairgrounds.

There are now two Selenas in the room---the real one beside the Coffer of shadow, and the one holding the matterwand in the alchemical bar. The Real Selena is first astonished, and then furious.

REAL SELENA
				Power of Shadow, kill her!!

The Second Selena calls out to the SHADOW-SELF in Selena's own unmistakable voice.

SECOND SELENA 
No. I am your mistress. Do not harm me.

REAL SELENA 
Don't listen to her! Kill her! She's lying.

	SECOND SELENA
You are my shadow, you must obey me.

The Real Selena is distracted by the duel of willpower with her double and doesn't notice Ethan creeping along the wall toward the Coffer of Shadow.

Ethan lunges for the shining OMEGAHEDRON inside, and snatches it out just as the heavy lid slams shut with a clang of metal. Ethan rolls over and over on the floor, away from Selena, clutching the, shining ring to him like a football in the end zone after a quarterback sneak on a fourth down trailing seven to six with three seconds on the clock.

ETHAN
				I've got it! The Power Source!

The Real Se1ena cries out with despair.

And then the SHADOW attacks her. The Real Selena cries out as she is surrounded by a black mist that starts slowly choking the life out of her.

REAL SELENA
        (terrified)
No! Stop! Please!


Ethan hands the Power Source to the Second Selena in the bar. 

					SECOND SELENA
				Thank you. I'll take this back to Argo City.

					ETHAN
				It is you, then, really?

Without a word, the Second Selena kisses him on the lips.

SECOND SELENA
				Well?

ETHAN
				It's you all right.

					SECOND SELENA
				I'll make it easy for you.

She again APPLIES THE WAND TO HER OWN BODY. There is a flash of light, and once more Supergirl stands before him, clutching both the Power Source and the wand.

					ETHAN
				I couldn't help what I did, before. She drugged me.


					SUPERGIRL
				I never doubted you for a moment.

					REAL SELENA
				Supergirl. Please! Help! I'm dying...

Supergirl steps toward the corner of the room beside the mirror where the Real Selena is imprisoned in the cloud of blackness. Supergirl touches the SHADOW with her wand. There is a cosmic musical chord, and the SHADOW is destroyed; it falls to the floor in a rain of hard, dark cinders.

The Real Selena rises from the corner of the room where she was released from the grip of the shadow. She looks at herself in the mirror. She is changed into the softer, more innocent person she was at the picnic before she found the Omegahedron. THERE IS NO MORE EVIL SHADOW LOOMING BEHIND HER IN THE MIRROR REFLECTION. She turns to Supergirl and Ethan.

SELENA
				I'm free. I can never thank you enough.

SUPERGIRL
				For what?

				
Selena points to the glittering OMEGAHEDRON Supergirl holds.

SELENA
				Ever since I found that thing I've been like 
a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have 
no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.

SUPERGIRL
				Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to 
Argo City where it won't be misused.
         (to Ethan)
You could come too. It might be safer for you.

ETHAN
				No thanks. I have friends in the resistance. They'll 
vouch for me. I figure I might get a million bucks 
for my memoirs.

					SUPERGIRL
				I'll come back as soon as I can.

					SELENA
				What about me? They'll make, hash out of me around 
here.

Supergirl and Ethan exchange a glance. Selena's innocence is the one problem they have not foreseen.

ETHAN
				She's right. They'll string her up.

SUPERGIRL
				Do you want to come to Argo City?

SELENA 
				What's it like?

SUPERGIRL
				It's the most beautiful place in the universe.

SELENA 
				Sounds O.K. to me. Let's go.

Supergirl holds out the matterwand to Selena.

SUPERGIRL
				Grab hold of this. It forms a force field for the 
journey through inner space.

Selena grasps the matterwand and the two of them fly together out the French doors.

CUT TO:

INT. PRISON. DAY

Supergirl and Selena fly through the prison. Supergirl melts open the locks with BEAMS OF HEAT VISION.

The prisoners climb out of their cells cheering and rejoicing.

EXT . HAMBURGER HEAVEN. GAS STATION. DAY

All the people of Midvale are enthusiastically chopping up the billboard portraits of Selena and throwing them into a bonfire in the middle of the street. Statues, banners, mystic symbols, giant tarot cards, old uniforms of her palace guards and youth group --every last remnant of her regime joins the blaze. People are smiling, dancing, holding hands, drinking: the atmosphere is like a block party on the first week in spring.

CUT TO:

EXT. HIGH ABOVE THE SEA.

SUNSET

Selena and Supergirl fly over the ocean toward the setting sun.

SELENA 
Where is inner space?

SUPERGIRL
				It's everywhere. But water is always 
the door.

They plunge down into the sun's reflection on the sea surface.

EXT. INNER SPACE

Supergirl and Selena fly together through the dark reaches of inner space. Supergirl is tired but triumphant. The OMEGAHEDRON glows brightly in her hand. Selena looks around her with awe and wonder.

SELENA
				Will they be angry with me for 
stealing the Power Source?



	SUPERGIRL
They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found 
it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead.

SELENA
				Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.

					SUPERGIRL 
				That's home.

P.O.V. OF SUPERGIRL AND SELENA

Argo City floats ahead, seeming to welcome them, its lights, growing brighter and brighter as they return with the lost Source

                                                 October 16, 2007

          FADE IN ON:

          EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT -- MOVING

          A DISTORTED IMAGE of downtown city streets at night.
          This is not a FISHEYE LENS, but the REFLECTION in the
          mirrored surface of a helmet visor.

          EXT. LUXURY BUILDING - NIGHT

          A near-future MOTORCYCLE stops near a dramatic HIGH-RISE
          RESIDENTIAL BUILDING. The rider, clad in black leather,
          climbs off his machine. We'll call him the ASSASSIN.
          He flips up his VISOR. His face is scarred, stubbly. He
          conceals himself in an alcove, eyes never leaving the
          building's entrance.
          A uniformed DOORMAN opens the high-rise's lobby door for
          a HANDSOME YOUNG MAN in a TUXEDO and TRENCHCOAT.
          THE ASSASSIN has been waiting for this. He removes what
          looks like a rifle scope from his jacket, aims it at

          TUXEDO.
          SCOPE POV - focusing on TUXEDO'S FACE, magnified. A
          digital readout: "SCANNING..." Then a long SERIAL
          NUMBER reads out and the name, "LIONEL ALEXANDER CANTER,"
          along with other personal information below.
          THE ASSASSIN puts away the scanner scope, satisfied. He
          reaches a hand into a pocket, withdraws a mysterious
          DEVICE. The size of a first generation cellphone, it has
          a military look, with a clear sliding panel over safety
          switches and buttons.
          The ASSASSIN hurries toward TUXEDO, but before he can

                         REACH HIM--
          A sleek, futuristic LIMOUSINE pulls up and TUXEDO gets in
          the back. They're gone in an instant.
          The ASSASSIN, frustrated, dashes for his MOTORCYCLE. He
          starts it and pursues the limousine.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.

          EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT

          THE MOTORCYCLE pursues the LIMOUSINE along the Potomac,
          D. C. LANDMARKS visible in the distance.

          EXT. KENNEDY CENTER - NIGHT

          FORMAL CROWDS, a RED CARPET, signs for an OPERA. The
          LIMOUSINE approaches.

          INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

          TUXEDO leans forward to the DRIVER, a muscular, handsome
          man in a suit named ARMANDO.

                         TUXEDO
          I'm not really in the mood for
          opera, Armando.
          ARMANDO nods knowingly pulls back into traffic.

                         ARMANDO
          F Street?

                         TUXEDO

                         (UNDOING BOWTIE)
          You read my mind. Let's not
          mention this to my Dad...
          As he speaks, he passes a few BILLS over the seat.

          EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT

          THE LIMO moves through this seemingly deserted area,
          pulls up near a STEEL DOOR with a spray-painted X.
          TUXEDO emerges sans jacket and tie, his dress-shirt open.

                         TUXEDO
          I can find my way back.
          ARMANDO nods and pulls away. TUXEDO moves toward the
          entrance, says a word into an INTERCOM with a
          SURVEILLANCE CAMERA. The door opens within moments, he
          disappears inside.
          THE ASSASSIN parks his bike, a few steps behind. Tuxedo
          has vanished through the STEEL DOOR before he can catch
          up with him.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         CONTINUED:
          The ASSASSIN takes off his helmet, tries the door. It
          won't move. He buzzes the intercom. The DOOR slides
          open a crack--
          THE BOUNCER is a huge, bald man with JET BLACK skin, RED
          EYES and TEETH that glow fluorescently. The THROBBING
          BEAT of MUSIC within. The BOUNCER narrows his eyes.

                         BOUNCER
          This is a private club.

                         ASSASSIN
          I just need to talk to--
          THE STEEL DOOR has already shut in his face.

          INT. THE PIT - NIGHT

          POUNDING MUSIC. BODIES SLAM together in a brutal mosh
          pit, MEN and WOMEN. All are young, some beautiful,
          others extremely decorated and pierced. They tear at
          each other brutally, trying to do real damage. On the
          edges of the pit, individual FISTFIGHTS go on. An
          incongruous CHANDELIER overhead, gilt-edged MIRRORS on
          the walls-- the FIGHTERS SLAM INTO and SHATTER them.
          A HARD-CORE BAND plays on an elevated stage. The
          MUSICIANS are heavily punked out, in outlandish clothes,
          with pierced faces, tattoos and body make-up.
          IN A VIP AREA, a balcony elevated above the stage,
          numerous BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE at tables. Many are making
          out, gay, straight, threesomes-- orgies happen up here.
          TUXEDO sits by himself. He raises a GLASS TUBE attached
          to a CORD, one of a few leading into an ELECTRONIC DEVICE
          on the table. As he brings the tube close to his own
          neck, an ARC of electricity jumps to his skin. His
          features go slack, a shudder goes through him. Then he
          lowers the tube with a smile. He's using a JACKER-- a
          sort of electro-shock hookah. A SHOUT over the MUSIC:

                         BLONDE
          Mind if I join you?
          A stunningly beautiful BLONDE in edgy, dramatic clothes
          stands nearby. Tuxedo, recovering from the hit, gestures
          graciously for her to sit. She picks up one of the
          cords, gives him a sly smile. She opens her mouth,
          SPARKS fly to her tongue and--

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

          EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

          RAIN pours down as TUXEDO and the BLONDE burst out the
          door, laughing. He pushes her against a brick wall, they
          grope each other hungrily, hands inside clothes, getting
          drenched in the warm downpour.
          WITH THE ASSASSIN, wearing his HELMET with the VISOR UP,
          as he approaches the entwined couple. TUXEDO hears him,

                         TURNS--

                         TUXEDO
          Get lost, meatbag.

          EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT

          ANGLE ON the alley's mouth as we hear the BLONDE'S
          SCREAM. Seconds later she staggers out, clutching her
          head, and collapses to the pavement. We hear an ENGINE
          START from the alleyway.
          THE ASSASSIN emerges on his bike, rides directly over her
          body unconcerned-- and ROARS into the night.
          CAMERA PULLS UP to--

          EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT

          --an AERIAL VIEW of the rain-swept CITY, some futuristic
          HIGH-RISES amongst the recognizeable landmarks. Also, a
          great number of SUPER-CELL TOWERS and DISHES,
          considerably larger than the ones we see today.
          CAMERA PICKS UP SPEED, moves quickly to a run-down part
          of the city, tenements and vacant lots. MOVE DOWN and
          through a third-story window of--

          INT. ABANDONED PROJECT BUILDING - NIGHT

          A dark, decaying hallway. A MAN and a WOMAN move
          stealthily up the stairs, LASER-SIGHT GUNS in hand.
          The man is THOMAS GREER, the woman JENNIFER PETERS. Both
          are about 30, handsome, athletic. Greer's spent his life
          in law enforcement. He's smart and able, wants things to
          make sense-- but as the world changes around him, he
          feels he's losing the thread. PETERS is junior to Greer,
          her attitude's professional but rigid, by the book.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

                         CONTINUED:
          GREER, in the lead, waves PETERS up. They approach a
          door at the end of the hall. We see now that their
          windbreakers read "FBI."
          GREER kicks open the door--

          INT. PSYCHO'S LAIR - NIGHT

          Lit by CANDLES and KEROSENE LANTERNS, SMOKE HANGS in the
          room. We glimpse BODIES hanging from the ceiling in
          CHAINS. GREER and PETERS train their LASERS around the
          place, disturbed by the scene. A flash of MOVEMENT in a
          bedroom and a CRASH--
          THE PSYCHO who lives here has kicked over a LANTERN, FIRE
          spills across the floor. We glimpse a surprisingly good-
          looking guy, grinning maniacally. He dashes across the

                         ROOM--
          GREER squeezes off a couple of SHOTS. The PSYCHO's too
          fast, he LEAPS through a cracked WINDOW.

          EXT. ABANDONED PROJECTS - NIGHT

          RAIN has let up. The PSYCHO FALLS thirty feet into a
          pile of soft DIRT and TRASH. He rolls to the bottom,
          gets to his feet and runs.
          GREER looks down from the broken window.

          INT. PSYCHO'S LAIR - NIGHT

          PETERS is beating at the FLAMES with a towel, sees Greer
          is preparing to jump.

                         PETERS
          Let's call for back-up.

                         GREER
          Where'.s the sport in that?

                         PETERS

                         IT'S PROTOCOL--
          GREER SNORTS and--

          EXT. ABANDONED PROJECTS - NIGHT

          --LEAPS, GREER hits the dirt hard and rolls. He reaches
          the ground and sets off after the PSYCHO at top speed.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

                         CONTINUED:
          PLAY A FRANTIC FOOT CHASE, both men scramble over chain-
          link fences, leap over trashed cars.
          GREER pursues the PSYCHO around a corner, into a
          passageway between buildings--
          --wherethePSYCHO gets the jump on him, SWINGS a length
          of pipeathis head. Greer ducks fast, the blow catches
          him inthearm, he drops his gun. The PSYCHO moves to
          pick uptheweapon, but Greer tackles him against a
          dumpster.
          Greer SLAMS the dumpster lid on the man repeatedly.

                         GREER
          You have the right to remain silent--
          But the PSYCHO has grabbed something from the trash,
          manages to SQUIRT BUG SPRAY in Greer's eyes.
          Greer's blinded temporarily, the PSYCHO squirms away,
          running from between buildings across a street--
          WHAM! He's hit full-on by a SEMI, his body FLIES through
          the air. He LANDS HARD on cement, but amazingly is still
          alive. He tries to get up, but--
          GREER plants a foot on his chest and holds him fast
          against the ground. Greer, still wiping at this eyes,
          points his weapon at the PSYCHO's head.

                         GREER (CONT'D)
          Stay with me asshole--

                         PSYCHO
          Why would I do that?
          The PSYCHO grins-- then his head lolls back, eyes empty.

          INT. PSYCHO'S LAIR - NIGHT

          PETERS is by a WOMAN'S BODY on the floor, holding a
          pocket SCANNER close to her head. This small device
          resembles an iPhone. There's tape over the woman's eyes
          and mouth, which Peters peels away as she speaks into a
          tiny cellphone earpiece.

                         PETERS
          Is this Kathy Welles...? My name
          is Jennifer Peters, with the FBI's
          surrogate crime division...

          EXT. ABANDONED PROJECTS - NIGHT

          ON GREER'S SCANNER - "NEW-U RENTAL AGENCY," with an ID
          NUMBER, but no name.
          GREER kneels beside the PSYCHO's body, pockets his
          scanner. He's angry but resigned, he was half expecting
          this.
          THE SEMI DRIVER is still behind the wheel of his rig. He
          calls out to Greer:

                         SEMI DRIVER
          Am I in trouble?

                         GREER
          (waves him off)
          Nah, go back to work.
          GREER rises as his PHONE CHIMES, he touches his earpiece.
          IN BG, the DRIVER pulls away.

                         GREER (CONT'D)

                         PETERS (FILTER)

                         GREER
          He's a rental.
          He disconnects, reaches to turn the PSYCHO's head to one
          side. The back of his skull is smashed. Instead of gore
          and brains, we see torn GRAY PLASTIC and dense CIRCUITRY,
          oozing pinkish hydraulic fluid at his neck.
          We're in a world of SURROGATES, remotely operated
          synthetic humans (also known as SYNTHs). These are not
          artificially-intelligent robots-- each is linked directly
          to a human being, miles or hundreds of miles away.
          Surrogates are distinguishable from flesh-and-blood
          humans primarily by their physical perfection-- ugly
          surrogates are rare. On closer look, their eyes may have
          an inhuman quality. Without a human mind sending and
          receiving impulses, they are completely inert.
          Suddenly the PSYCHO comes to life, spins his head around
          at an impossible angle and BITES GREER'S HAND.

                         CONTINUED:
          He won't let go. Greer stomps on the-PSYCHO's head,
          reaches with his other hand into the back of the skull to
          wrench out a CIRCUIT BOARD. The PSYCHO finally stops
          writhing, disconnected.

          INT. PSYCHO'S LAIR - NIGHT

          PETERS talks on the phone while scanning a SEVERED HEAD.

                         PETERS
          I don't recommend reconnecting,
          Ms. Welles... hello?
          The WOMAN on the floor TWITCHES, her eyes open. She sits
          up on her elbows, looks down to see--
          --her legs are gone. The bottom half of her is missing,
          her tattered T-shirt covers the damage, soaked with dark
          green and pink liquids-- coolant and hydraulic fluids.

                         VICTIM
          Aw crap, I'm totalled!

                         PETERS
          Your insurance ought to cover it.

          EXT. ABANDONED PROJECTS - NIGHT

          GREER trudges toward the building, on his cell, leaving
          the body behind. He turns the CIRCUIT BOARD over in his
          fingers.

                         GREER

          Abandoned.

                         GREER
          Or something happened to the operator.
          GREER and PETERS stand over the corpse, a UNIFORM stands
          nearby. Greer holds his SCANNER near her head.

                         GREER (CONT'D)
          Registered to a Cameron Michaels,
          out in Clarksburg...

          You call her?

                         UNIFORM
          Left a message.
          GREER is leaning closer to the dead Blonde's face.
          X-CLOSE-- CRACKS in the GLASS of her eye. We see GREER'S
          FRAGMENTED REFLECTION as he peers at this.

                         GREER
          Optics are damaged.

                         PETERS
          Musta cracked when she fell.

                         (TO UNIFORM)
          There's a second?
          The UNIFORM leads GREER and PETERS past the blonde, into
          the alley.

          INT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

          TUXEDO lies on his side, eyes closed. We can hear MUSIC
          THROBBING from within.

                         UNIFORM
          Couldn't get an ID from this one.
          GREER kneels by Tuxedo, looks at his fancy CUFFLINKS.

                         GREER
          A tux? Kind of over-dressed for a
          jacker joint.
          GREER pulls out his scanner.
          BY TUXEDO's FACE, the SCANNER reads "NO SIGNAL."
          GREER seems surprised. PETERS looks over his shoulder.

                         PETERS
          Maybe he's real.

                         GREER
          Little too pretty for that.
          GREER lifts one of Tuxedo's eyelids-- CLOSE, shattered
          GLASS, ELECTRONICS visible within.

                         GREER (CONT'D)
          He's synth all right.

                         PETERS
          Looks like the optics exploded...
          Greer reaches behind Tuxedo's head, pulls out a small
          specially-shaped TOOL and pries up the PANEL at the back
          of Tuxedo's skull. He pulls out--
          THE CIRCUIT BOARD, melted and scorched.

                         GREER
          So much for the identity chip.

                         PETERS
          I'll call for a pick-up. Maybe
          diagnostics can make sense of it.
          Greer stands up, looks toward the Blonde's body.

                         GREER
          Clarksburg's just up the 270,

          A slightly futuristic sedan speeds through light late-
          night traffic. We hear the VOICE of the PROPHET:

                         PROPHET (RADIO)
          You feel you are free. You can be
          what you want, do what you want,

          INT. FBI CAR - NIGHT

          GREER drives. PETERS has her eyes closed in the
          passenger seat. THE VOICE on the RADIO continues IN BG
          through scene.

                         PROPHET (RADIO)
          You think you control your
          surrogates, but it is they who have
          taken over your lives. You lie in
          your cells, pale and fat prisoners,
          while the puppets walk and dance
          and make love...
          Peters BLINKS and comes to.

          MOVE ACROSS the facade of a suburban apartment complex.
          A RED GLOW suffuses most of the windows, all of which are
          BARRED. In this warm light, we glimpse OPERATORS in
          reclining chairs, motionless. They could be watching TV,
          but no sets are in sight.

          GREER and PETERS walk along an almost prison-like
          corridor, SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS, heavy doors. They follow
          an empty-faced walking MANNEQUIN in an ugly pantsuit.
          This is the LANDLADY. Her mouth moves like a
          ventriloquist's dummy as she speaks self-consciously:

                         LANDLADY
          I been having problems with my
          surrie, this is just a loaner. Is
          there some kind of trouble?

                         GREER
          Nothing to worry about.

                         LANDLADY
          Cam's a good tenant, y'know. Pays
          the rent on time, never leaves the
          apartment...

                         GREER
          Who does?

          (POUNDS on a door)
          Cam? Wake up, the police are here
          to talk to you...

          INT. CAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          The LANDLADY undoes the MULTIPLE LOCKS on the door of a
          small one-room apartment. She opens it and lets GREER
          and PETERS inside. A RED GLOW from the far end of the
          room-- GREER flicks on overheads. The Landlady hovers by
          the door as they move into the place.
          It's minimalist, nothing on the walls. Empty pizza
          boxes. Skirts, stockings, high-heels strewn around
          haphazardly. We also glimpse a large CHARGING CRADLE,
          contact points embedded in the foam inside, shaped to
          accomodate a curvaceous female body.

                         GREER
          Hello?
          A fat, hairy arm hangs over the side of a high-tech
          CHAIR. The two feds move quickly to see--
          --CAMERON MICHAELS, a 40-ish, overweight, bald male in
          his underwear. BLOOD runs from his nose, his face
          twitches slightly; he lies in a STIM CHAIR.

          STIM CHAIRS resemble-oversized massage chairs, contoured
          to the body, with padded head supports. They vibrate and
          electronically stimulate the user to prevent atrophy.
          A SENSORY PROJECTOR sits beside the chair. This device
          looks like a COMPUTER TOWER. It's linked to an elaborate
          HEADSET, with contact points around the skull. There's
          also a MONITOR SCREEN which displays the operator's
          remote POV.

                         LANDLADY
          Oh my God, Cameron--
          GREER quickly detaches the headset, rips a small
          ELECTRONIC SLEEVE off of Cameron's fingertip. He checks
          the man's pupil response and pulse.

                         GREER
          Call the paramedics.
          While Peters calls in BG, GREER moves to the PROJECTOR'S
          MONITOR SCREEN and taps a touchpad.
          ON SCREEN - STATIC. GREER REWINDS to POVs at the hard-
          core CLUB. FAST FORWARD to the ALLEY, making out with
          TUXEDO. This is a recording of recent experience, as
          seen through the eyes of the BLONDE.
          GREER switches to real-time. Tuxedo breaks the kiss and
          turns to look OS.

          TUXEDO (ON SCREEN)
          Get lost, meatbag.
          As Tuxedo turns back TO CAMERA, we hear a hideous
          ELECTRONIC SCREECH, Tuxedo's face contorts in pain... and
          his EYES BURST, fragments of GLASS and ELECTRONICS fly.
          The POV reels, we hear the Blonde's SCREAM-- and STATIC
          again fills the screen.
          GREER is disturbed by this, looks again at the
          unconscious, quivering face of the man in the chair.

          INT. D.C. SUBWAY - NIGHT

          A mostly empty car, scattered SURRIE PASSENGERS ride
          stiffly, zoned out, empty expressions... except for a
          long-haired DREAD, one of the anti-surrogate fanatics.
          He's disheveled, hippyish, SHOUTS into the empty faces of
          the surrogates.

          Wake up! Wake up! Zombies!
          Shitpuppetsl Abominations!
          He moves to a YOUNG COUPLE, both slack-faced, on standby.

                         DREAD (CONT'D)
          Wake up and smell the piss!
          He starts to UNZIP in front of them.

                         GREER
          Not cool.
          The DREAD turns-- GREER is holding up a BADGE. The Dread
          scowls, zips up and moves away from Greer, plunks down at
          the end of the car. Greer pockets his badge calmly.

          EXT. GREER'S BUILDING - DAWN

          GREER approaches an urban APARTMENT COMPLEX on foot,
          carrying a bag of TAKE-OUT FOOD. HIGH FENCES, SECURITY
          CAMERAS and SCANNERS, all commonplace in this world. We
          see the RED GLOW from a few windows.

          INT. GREER'S BUILDING/HALLWAY - DAWN

          GREER moves tiredly down a long hallway to his apartment.
          He punches in a CODE at the door.

          INT. GREER'S APARTMENT/LIVING ROOM - DAWN

          GREER enters, crosses a living room that's been decorated
          in a spare, modern style.

          INT. GREER'S APARTMENT/KITCHEN - DAWN

          GREER sets the bag down on a table, fills a glass with
          WATER and moves down a hallway to a BEDROOM.

          INT. GREER'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM -- DAWN

          GREER enters the bedroom, places the water glass on a
          bedside table beside--
          --the REAL GREER. He looks five years older, twenty
          pounds heavier than his surrogate. He's in a STIM
          RECLINER, attached to a SENSORY PROJECTOR like the one we
          saw on Cameron Michaels. RED LIGHT suffuses the room.

          GREER, a surrogate we now realize, undresses, puts his
          clothes aside in a CLOSET-- which also contains a foam-
          filled CHARGING CRADLE. Down to his underwear, he backs
          into this, seems to relax. We hear a low HUM and--
          --the REAL GREER's eyes open. He disconnects the HEADSET
          and FINGERSLEEVE, the RED GLOW is replaced by WHITE
          LIGHT. He sits up, yawns and sips the water. He rises
          wearily, stretches, runs a hand through his thinning
          hair. He moves to shut the closet door on his synth
          unit. As it CLOSES--

          GREER (the real one) sits at the table in a bathrobe,
          finishing the food his surrogate brought home. As he
          empties the remains into the trash--
          --MAGGIE enters. She's Greer's wife, a stylish young
          woman, looking ridiculously good for someone who's just
          gotten up. Maggie starts at the sight of Greer, begins
          to retreat. It's as if she's stumbled upon him in the
          bathroom.

                         MAGGIE
          Oh, sorry--

                         GREER
          Put him up. I was about to get
          some sleep.
          Maggie enters the kitchen, not looking directly at Greer.
          She puts some bread in a toaster, prepares coffee.

                         MAGGIE
          You just get in?

                         GREER
          Some poor cross-sexual had an
          aneurysm while he was online, had
          to get him to a hospital.
          Maggie winces, disturbed by her husband's job. She flips
          on a small flatscreen TV, volume low. NEWS and WEATHER.

          It's better.

          have such a good time--

                         GREER
          I was thinking more like a
          vacation. An island somewhere.

          Bridget said she got an amazing
          deal on a surrie rental in Tahiti--

          off the kitchen-- we can't see inside the room. We hear
          the DOOR LOCK behind her.
          GREER looks after his wife, a bit dejected. In the quiet
          he registers a voice from the TV:

          At Greer's nod, Peters takes out her holstered GUN.
          GREER does the same. The Clerk locks both the agents'
          guns in a drawer, then comes out from behind the desk.
          ARMANDO approaches. The Clerk passes him a KEY.

                         ARMANDO
          I work for Dr. Canter. His
          private elevator's this way.
          They follow him toward an ALCOVE in the back of the
          lobby.

                         PETERS
          You're the one who drove Anthony
          Canter that night?

          I gave the police a statement.
          AT A PRIVATE ELEVATOR, while ARMANDO turns a key, a
          SCANNER automatically swings out on a cantilevered arm.

                         GREER
          is this necessary?

                         ARMANDO
          Dr. Canter's rules.
          LIGHT flashes in their faces as they're scanned. The
          elevator doors open, and the three of them get on.
          CLOSE ON SCANNER - after they've entered the elevator,
          small HEAD-SHOTS of GREER and PETERS, vital stats below,
          appear one after the other on the SCREEN.

          INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

          GREER turns to ARMANDO, who's staring straight ahead.

                         GREER
          Kid liked the wild side, huh. Did
          his father know?
          Armando doesn't answer, this is getting too personal.

          INT. CANTER'S PENTHOUSE/FOYER - DAY

          THE ELEVATOR opens into a marble entrance area. It's
          traditional, tastefully opulent-- artwork, sculpture. A
          small, automated VACUUM CLEANER moves along a Persian
          rug. Armando moves ahead of them to announce their
          presence. Greer and Peters speak quietly.

                         PETERS
          Nice place.

                         GREER
          Canter must get a piece of every
          surrogate they sell.
          CANTER emerges from a study. His face is young, but
          there's some grey at his temples. Otherwise, he looks
          identical to the dead TUXEDO. GREER takes this in.

                         GREER (CONT'D)

          Yes we are.
          He leads them into--

          INT. CANTER'S PENTHOUSE/STUDY - DAY

          A traditional study, wood paneling, books. WINDOWS lead
          to a BALCONY. ARMANDO remains IN BG throughout scene.

                         PETERS
          We're very sorry for your loss,
          sir.

                         CANTER
          What progress have you made with
          the investigation?

                         GREER
          I can't help noticing, your
          surrogate-- it's very similar to
          the unit your son was using...
          Canter pauses, then moves to a DOOR and opens it.- LIGHTS
          INSIDE FLICKER ON, revealing--
          --a WALK-IN CLOSET with a half-dozen CHARGING BAYS. Four
          surrogates here, all versions of the man we've just seen--
          Canter at different stages of life, from youth to almost
          elderly. Two of the charging bays are empty.

                         CANTER
          I allowed Tony to borrow one of my
          surrogates when he wanted to spend
          time in D.C. I encouraged him to
          take advantage of the cultural

                         OFFERINGS--

                         PETERS
          Wait, how is that possible?
          Aren't your surries locked to your
          neural signature?

                         CANTER
          (closing the door)
          I wrote the code that remains at
          the core of all surrogates. It
          wasn't difficult for me to make my
          synth units accessible to my son.

          The coroner says that Tony was
          online when it happened. Why
          hasn't the surrogate been returned
          to me?

          We're still analyzing the damage--

                         CANTER
          It was attacked?

          We really can't get into the details
          of an ongoing investigation--

          Dr. Canter-- we don't know of any
          way to kill an operator remotely.
          Do you?

                         CANTER
          No, but-- at the beginning, all of
          us at VSI were worried about it.
          It's why every surrogate has a
          built-in fail-safe, they disconnect
          before they can transmit a
          potentially dangerous signal.

                         PETERS
          Can you think of anyone who might
          want to harm your son?

                         CANTER
          I... the sad fact is, Tony and I
          were just getting to know each
          other... he grew up with his
          mother in California.
          Canter's voice drifts off, he's starting to look far
          away, pained. He sits slowly behind his desk.

                         CANTER (CONT'D)
          If this wasn't an accident... then
          it's because of me that he's...

          eyes blank-- he's disconnected.

          Guess the interview's over.

          Greer scribbles something on a BUSINESS CARD.

                         GREER
          Not really. You got kids?

                         PETERS

          Jim and I talked about it, but...

          Lot of that going around.
          He starts to place the card on the desk before the
          immobile Canter. Armando steps forward warily-- Greer
          shows him the card before putting it down.

          As they move back toward the lobby elevator, we remain

          --a small, PRIVATE AREA, bathed in RED LIGHT, with a very
          fancy, elaborate SENSORY PROJECTOR. REAL CANTER is much
          older than his surrogate, his face stubbly. His body is
          twisted and nearly useless, his head held up by a brace.
          A victim of some horrible degenerative disease, Canter
          only has the use of one arm, via an elaborate electronic
          armature. He's just disconnected his HEADSET. There are
          TEARS streaming down his cheeks.
          His projector SCREEN faces him, with his working arm he

          Someone targeted Canter's surrie,
          got the wrong operator.
          They get to their car, parked in a RED ZONE. GREER curls
          his lip at a METER MAID-- a DRONE SURROGATE ON WHEELS, NO
          EARS, as it rolls calmly away from his car.

                         GREER (CONT'D)
          I'm sure the guy's got enemies he
          never even heard of.

          Greer rips the TICKET from the windshield, tears it in
          half and throws it in the back of the car, as they both
          get in.

          SUBJECT lying on a table, hundreds of WIRES affixed to
          his head. These lead to a crude MANNEQUIN, which turns
          its head, rolls its eyes, moves its mouth. We hear a

          I'm sorry to hear that. But I can
          assure you it has nothing to do with
          VSI products. If a man suffers a

          precedent for an operator being
          killed by signals from his
          synth unit?

          The idea is absurd. If it were
          possible, it would defeat the
          purpose of surrogacy.

          Surries have jumped from bridges,
          been shot or blown to bits without
          the least harm to the operators-
          the fail-safes always kick in.
          Every case that's been brought
          against VSI has been shown to be
          the result of user negligence.

          There is one more thing. The victim
          was Anthony Canter. The son of one
          of your company's founders.
          GREER studies them as they process this news.

                         GREER (CONT'D)
          Kind of a strange coincidence.

                         WELCH
          Dr. Canter has retired, but we'll

          EXT. VSI HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          GREER and PETERS move from a glass corporate tower,
          across beautifully manicured gardens. GREER carries the
          evidence in a briefcase.

          AN OVERHEAD CONVEYOR carries PLASTIC RIBCAGES and SPINAL
          COLUMNS containing ELECTRONIC PARTS, FLUID SACS and
          TUBES. ARMS and LEGS, elaborate hydraulic apparatus, are
          attached by ROBOTIC ASSEMBLERS. There's no skin yet,
          just the exposed machinery, made mostly of plastic and
          microcircuitry.
          A WINDOW overlooks the factory floor. Here, TECHNICIANS
          sit at COMPUTER STATIONS, monitoring the processes below.
          GREER and PETERS stand before WATERS, who looks like a
          basketball player-- hugely tall, African-American,
          tattooed, in casual clothes. GREER waves a hand up in
          his face, trying to get his attention.

                         GREER
          Mr. Waters? Seth Waters?
          GREER checks the man's ID BADGE-- a PHOTO of a pudgy,
          bearded white man with glasses, the name SETH WATERS.
          Suddenly, WATERS snaps out of it, looks down at the two
          agents. Despite his appearance, his manner is nerdy.

                         WATERS
          Hello, sorry. I was in the can.

                         PETERS
          We were told you could help us
          with some technical issues.

          To whom am I addressing myself?

                         GREER
          We're with the FBI.
          He studies the BADGES they hold out.

          Kablooie.
          GREER and PETERS hover nearby. Waters turns his
          attention to the shattered eyes, picks one up.

                         PETERS
          Ever seen anything like it before?

                         WATERS
          Not exactly... but last week we
          got a truckload of GI Joes back
          for reconditioning. Couple a the
          surries were missing optics.

                         GREER
          May we take a look?

          INT. VSI WAREHOUSE - DAY

          WATERS opens the doors and flips on FLUORESCENT LIGHTS...
          they blink on to reveal--
          ROW UPON ROW of SURRIE TEMPLATES, naked, hairless and
          robotic, not yet personalized with faces and skin. They
          stand packed like sardines, ready for shipment.
          WATERS leads GREER and PETERS to a CAGED-IN CORNER of the
          warehouse, unlocks the gate.
          Inside are STACKED BODIES in the uniforms of different
          SERVICES. Many are battered and scarred from battle,
          even in pieces. All are wrapped in CLEAR PLASTIC.

                         WATERS
          Old soldiers never die...
          He consults a HAND-HELD COMPUTER, checks CODE NUMBERS on
          the bags. The SOLDIER'S FACES are all eerily similar...
          even identical. No reason to customize cannon fodder.

                         WATERS (CONT'D)
          Here we go.
          He peels back the plastic on another identical SOLDIER
          whose EYES are missing. The body is otherwise undamaged.

          GREER moves Waters aside, looks the body over.

                         GREER
          Brand new camos, no mud, no dirt...
          this thing's never seen combat.
          Name and unit insignia removed...
          let me check out the motherboard.

                         WATERS
          Didn't come back with one. I
          thought it was a little weird.
          GREER stares into the empty eyesockets of the soldier.
          He hooks a finger in, comes out with--
           A glistening SHARD OF GLASS on his fingertip.

          A WIDER SHOT reveals that this POV is one of many being
          displayed on BATTLEFIELD MONITORS in a warehouse-sized
          space. Each hangs above a flesh and blood SOLDIER in
          loose MARINE UNIFORM, in stim chairs, hooked into sensory
          projectors. The room is bathed in RED LIGHT.
          REAL PULASKI bolts upright in his stim chair, a WHITE
          LIGHT goes on as his screen turns to STATIC.

          doors open and his new unit charges out, past other
          REPLACEMENT SOLDIERS still in charging bays.

          The DOOR UNLOCKS and they enter--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.

          INT. FBI BUILDING/SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY -

          GREER and PETERS go down metal stairs into-a sprawling,
          high-tech surveillance center. COMPUTER WORKSTATIONS are
          arranged radially, at the hub is a central COMMAND
          STATION with large SCREENS facing in all directions.
          GREER and PETERS move toward the center. At first we see
          just the head and shoulders of scattered FIGURES, staring
          at the monitor screens.
          ON SCREENS - these are POV SHOTS from thousands of
          SURROGATES, the Feds can have a direct surveillance feed
          from any surrogate's eyes.
          We glimpse POV SHOTS of-- driving-- drinking in a bar--
          intimate conversations-- watching an old movie-- a sex
          partner's face.
          The FIGURES before the screens are WATCHER DRONES,
          specialized surrogates-- a head and shoulders mounted on
          a wheeled contraption attached to tracks. This enables
          them to move and stop at any monitor quickly, surveilling
          dozens of surrogates. Males and females, but all have
          the same faces.
          PETERS stares in wonder at this voyeur's paradise. GREER
          grabs her arm to keep her from getting hit as a WATCHER
          tracks past. The Watcher ignores them, intent on work.
          They mount stairs into the RAISED HUB that overlooks the
          work floor. An extremely corpulent human being-- BOBBY
          SANDERS-- sits on a reinforced rolling chair, which he
          keeps in almost constant motion, eying the DOZEN SCREENS
          up here at once.
          ON SCREENS - POVs of actual criminal activity-- frantic
          running across a park-- a burglary in a darkened jewelry
          store-- packets of drugs changing hands.
          BOBBY eats candy, guzzles soda, waves them off for a
          moment, speaking rapid-fire into his HEADSET.

                         BOBBY
          Burglary in progress, Charlie4639-
          Romeo7812-Sierra8955, need a
          warrant to shut him down...
          BOBBY gets a message from his headset, kicks his rolling
          chair across the room to a special TERMINAL.

                         BOBBY (CONT'D)

                         CONTINUED:
          This terminal displays SURRIE SERIAL NUMBERS. As BOBBY
          types, the selections narrow until only one is on the
          screen: "C4639-R7812-S8955."

                         PETERS

                         (WHISPERS)
          He can cut off operators from here?

                         BOBBY
          Anybody, anywhere. Ssh, don't
          tell anyone. It's a gray area
          legally.
          PETERS isn't comfortable with this.

                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
          Relax, we're the good guys.

          ON TERMINAL SCREEN - "OPERATOR DISCONNECT."
          ON THE BURGLARY SCREEN, the POV IMAGE tumbles to the
          ground, FREEZES there and turns to STATIC.
          GREER nods, impressed. BOBBY eats an entire candy bar in
          one bite.

                         PETERS
          You're not a surrogate, are you?
          BOBBY wheels closer. With his mouth full:

                         BOBBY
          No ma'am, you're looking at the
          genuine article. Bobby Sanders.
          He extends a greasy hand, which she shakes lightly.

          (points at his head)
          Ain't built the machine yet that
          can handle this baby. Recognition
          search caught your dreaddie,

          They move to a screen numbered 11, Bobby taps a CONTROL.

          moving pedestrian's POV. Strickland's leaning on his
          bike, helmet off, talking on a CELLPHONE, free hand
          shoved in his pocket. The image FREEZES. The bike's
          LICENSE PLATE HIGHLIGHTS, along with STRICKLAND'S FACE.
          GREER peers at the time stamp.

          for the reservation.

                         (TO PETERS)
          Stay here, keep tabs on him.

                         PETERS

          Getting a chopper.
          Peters takes this in, calls after him:

                         PETERS
          You need to get approval!
          GREER makes a jerking off motion and is gone. BOBBY lets
          out a BELCH and winks at PETERS.

          oh you can do better than that.
          I'll be in touch...
          He tosses the cellphone in a trashcan, pulls on his
          helmet, STARTS the bike and peels out.

          INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

          GREER is beside a PILOT, a handsome Hispanic surrie named
          LOPEZ. Greer shouts over the BLADE ROAR:

                         GREER
          We're close! Noise suppression!
          LOPEZ nods, hits a couple of switches. THE LOUD THROB
          becomes a barely audible WHIRR. We hear PETERS' VOICE
          over the radio:

                         PETERS (FILTER)
          Got a hit on the bike, half a mile
          from the rez, check your screen.

          Greer clicks off the radio, turns to Lopez.

                         GREER
          Ignore her, Lopez. Get us as
          close as you can.
          LOPEZ grins--and pushes the stick hard--

          EXT. BALTIMORE - DAY

          THE CHOPPER banks and swoops almost silently.

          TNT. FBI BUILDING/SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY
          BOBBY glances over at PETERS as she monitors a GPS SCREEN
          and various INSET VIDEO FEEDS. He continues to work as
          he flirts with her.

                         BOBBY

          Don't be so touchy. I'm engaged
          to B-47 down there.
          He points to one of the many identical female DRONES
          buzzing along the tracks. PETERS smiles.

          EXT. BALTIMORE SLUMS - DUSK

          STRICKLAND moves briskly on his BIKE. He glances in his
          MIRROR and sees--
          --a couple of SQUAD CARS catching up with him.
          He hits the THROTTLE. ANOTHER COP CAR roars around the
          corner ahead of him, SQUAWKS the SIREN. STRICKLAND
          changes direction, veers into a narrow alley.

          INT. HELICOPTER - DUSK

          LOPEZ and GREER are directly overhead, watching
          STRICKLAND maneuver his bike quickly into the alley.

          EXT. SLUM ALLEY - DUSK

          The alley is a DEAD END, a FENCE blocking the exit.
          STRICKLAND skids the bike into a CRASHING STOP, knocking
          over piles of GARBAGE.
          A SQUAD CAR barely clears the walls on either side,
          pursuing. It stops at a narrowing space, cops squeeze
          out either door, aiming GUNS.

                         COP
          Freeze!
          STRICKLAND stumbles away from his bike, into an alcove.
          The cops approach, guns ready.
          STRICKLAND yanks off his helmet, pulls his ominous DEVICE
          from his pocket. Without poking his head out, he aims it
          in the cops direction.
          He PRESSES A BUTTON. A row of RED DIODES GLOW on the
          device as he sweeps it across the alley, but it emits no
          projectiles and makes no sound.
          COP #1 is closer-- his GLASS EYES SHATTER.

          clutching his head.

          INT. HELICOPTER - DUSK

          GREER has seen this, horrified.

                         GREER
          Jesus, what is that?
          STRICKLAND is on the run again, scaling the fence. He
          hasn't spotted the chopper.
          GREER looks in the direction he's heading--
          A HUGE CHAIN-LINK FENCE, topped with barbed wire,
          stretching across the whole city, just a hundred yards
          away. PORTRAITS of the PROPHET (the man we heard on the
          radio), long-haired and bearded, adorn the fence.
          There's a GATE, with two GUARDS checking those entering,
          one or two people are waiting.

                         GREER (CONT'D)
          He gets through the gate, we can't
          touch him.
          GREER readies a RIFLE with a SCOPE, loads a TRANQUILIZER
          DART into the chamber. LOPEZ maneuvers to give Greer an
          angle out the chopper's side.

          EXT. SLUM ALLEY - DUSK

          STRICKLAND looks up to see GREER taking aim from the
          silent chopper. He leaps for cover behind a dumpster as--
          GREER FIRES a DART, which RICOCHETS off the DUMPSTER.
          STRICKLAND scrambles around a corner.

          INT. HELICOPTER - DUSK

          LOPEZ turns the bird forward to pursue, as GREER reloads.
          They round the corner. No sign of Strickland on the
          pavement. GREER looks to his left, beyond the PILOT--
          STRICKLAND has scaled a fire escape, aiming the DEVICE
          right at Lopez. Greer sees what's about to happen--

                         GREER
          Pull up, Lopez, pull up!

                         (CONTINUED)

          LOPEZ shoots the bird upwards, but--

          EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - DUSK

          STRICKLAND raises the device to track Lopez and hits the
          button-- we see the RED DIODES GLOW and--

          INT. HELICOPTER - DUSK

          --LOPEZ is hit, his EYES FRAGMENT, shards of GLASS fly.
          GREER is close enough to get a partial hit, crouches in
          agony. SFX, an awful SCREAMING NOISE inside his head--

          INT. GREER'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM - DUSK

          SCREAMING NOISE CONTINUES as REAL GREER spasms in pain in
          his stim-chair, in the sensory projector's RED LIGHT.

          EXT. RESERVATION NO MAN'S LAND - DUSK

          THE CHOPPER, pilotless and out of control, heads over the
          chain link fence. Beyond are vacant lots, with tents and
          makeshift hovels, small buildings.

          INT. HELICOPTER - DUSK

          GREER regains his senses, just in time to see--
          THE CHOPPER careening down toward the Dread encampment.

          EXT. RESERVATION NO MAN'S LAND - NIGHT

          THE CHOPPER CRASHES on its skids, at an angle, amidst
          LEAN-TOs and TENTS-- GREER is thrown out his side with
          the impact.

          THE CHOPPER'S ENGINE EXPLODES. THE WHIRRING TAIL ROTOR
          comes right at him and CHOPS OFF his left arm at the
          elbow, BURNING FUEL spreads and IGNITES his back. Lucky
          thing he's a surrogate. Less fortunate DREADS run
          screaming, we hear the CRIES OF WOUNDED.
          GREER lies in the dirt, in flames, motionless. Then his
          eyes BLINK and move, taking in the sight of--
          STRICKLAND, illuminated by the FIRE, horrified at the
          carnage. He's starting to move away from the wreck.

          46.

                         CONTINUED:
          With supreme effort, GREER gets to his feet, still partly
          IN FLAMES. His stump of an arm SPARKS and leaks
          HYDRAULIC FLUID. He reacts at the sight of--
          A CORPSE on the ground, an older man crushed by a hunk of
          DEBRIS from the chopper. But it's not the corpse that
          interests him-- his DART RIFLE lies nearby, thrown from
          the chopper during the crash.
          GREER grabs it in his right hand. He pushes past DREADS
          who move to help their injured fellows, PANIC in the fire-
          lit no man's land. He spots--
          STRICKLAND, running into the distance. Greer supports
          the rifle with the stump of his missing arm and FIRES--
          STRICKLAND is hit in the back, the force of the shot
          knocks him off his feet.
          GREER strides over to STRICKLAND, seemingly oblivious to
          the CROWD of Dreads collecting around him, pointing at
          him angrily.
          STRICKLAND twitches and moans, partly paralyzed. GREER
          stands over him, lets the rifle dangle. Strickland has
          some trouble speaking.

                         STRICKLAND
          Oh my G-god-- why? What do you
          people want from me?!

                         GREER
          You're a killer--

                         STRICKLAND
          They were just surries! Goddamn
          machines!

                         GREER

                         (A BEAT)
          You really don't know?
          BLAM! A DOUBLE-BARRELED SHOTGUN BLAST throws GREER
          backward, away from STRICKLAND. The DART RIFLE flies
          from his grasp.
          A heavyset FEMALE DREAD wields the sawed-off shotgun.
          She gets between Greer and Strickland, who manages to
          crawl away, vanishing behind other DREADS who are
          gathering around Greer.

                         GREER (CONT'D)

          Greer tries to get up, a HOLE has been blown in his
          chest, exposing SPARKING WIRES and ELECTRONICS, spraying
          GREEN COOLANT. He's lost control of his legs, which
          crumple beneath him, he falls to his knees.
          He's surrounded now by angry, disenfranchised DREADS, all
          of whom regard him with hatred.
          THE FEMALE DREAD ejects the used cartridges and reloads
          the shotgun. GREER stares at her coldly.

                         GREER (CONT'D)
          I'm a federal agent--

                         FEMALE DREAD
          You're an abomination.
          THE WOMAN pumps the shotgun again points it a Greer's
          head. Just as it GOES OFF--

          INT. GREER'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM - NIGHT

          GREER lurches out of his chair, yanking the SENSORY
          PROJECTOR off his head-- the RED LIGHT switches to WHITE.
          He stumbles out of the room into the hall.

          INT. GREER'S APARTMENT/HALLWAY - NIGHT

          GREER bangs on the door to Maggie's bedroom, rattles the
          knob. A RED GLOW from beneath her door.

                         GREER
          Maggie! Wake up!
          He's clearly in pain, clutches his temples. BLOOD begins
          to gush from his nose. Greer slides down against the
          door, unable to stand.

          INT. GREER'S APARTMENT/MAGGIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

          THE DOOR rattles, we hear GREER calling:

                         GREER
          Please, I need your help... open
          the door!
          CAMERA MOVES through the RED-LIT room, to show the WIRES
          of a SENSORY PROJECTOR, a partial view of MAGGIE'S HEAD.

          INT. GREER'S APARTMENT/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          MAGGIE (her surrogate), in a tailored business suit,
          enters the apartment with BRIDGET, another gorgeous, high-
          fashion surrie in party clothes. They're laughing.

                         BRIDGET
          --we're talking turquoise! I
          wouldn't carry a purse that color,
          much less a whole new skin.

                         MAGGIE
          BRB, I just gotta change. Little
          black dress or red bustier?

                         BRIDGET
          Bustier.

          INT. GREER'S APARTMENT/HALLWAY - NIGHT

          MAGGIE almost trips over GREER, unconscious on the floor.

                         MAGGIE
          Oh my God.

          rural area in the Rockies, it flips its LIGHTS OFF.

          INT. PETERS' HOUSE - NIGHT

          A pleasant, rustic home. JENNIFER PETERS, somewhat less
          perfect than her surrie, disconnects from her SENSORY
          PROJECTOR. She looks concerned, very tired. She rises
          from her stim chair and moves into a kitchen.
          PULL BACK - we're watching her through a WINDOW, with a
          very large and powerful-looking STALKER,
          LATER - PETERS in bed, fast asleep. A SHADOW crosses her
          doorway, but moves on.
          AT HER sensory PROJECTOR, the STALKER is SCANNING through
          her hard-drive's memory.
          ON SCREEN - fast-forwarding rapidly through PETERS' POV,
          we see GREER in the alley with the fallen SURRIES...

          THE STALKER, face illuminated by the screen's GLOW, looks
          expressionlessly toward Peters' bedroom, then back to the
          images. His eyes have a silvery, inhuman sheen.

          Early morning. STRICKLAND sleeps fitfully in this
          gloomy, dingy space. He comes to, startles at the sight

                         OF--
          --a MAN sitting at the foot of his bed. He's very tall,
          imposing, bearded, dressed in black-- this is the
          PROPHET. Strickland is cowed, this isn't a man you get a
          lot of face time with.

                         PROPHET
          You've been keeping secrets, Jack.
          TWO LARGE MEN now move into view, flanking the Prophet.
          Call them BUD and MILLER. They're scruffy, bearded, not
          surries.

                         STRICKLAND
          No, Prophet, I---

                         PROPHET
          This is unfair to your brother
          humans.
          STRICKLAND tries to get out of bed, Bud pushes him down.

                         STRICKLAND
          Please, I haven't done anything...

                         PROPHET
          I know what you've done. What I
          don't know is-- who hired you to
          betray us? I want a name.

                         STRICKLAND
          I-- I swear to God I don't know--

                         PROPHET
          Jack...

                         STRICKLAND
          He never said his name, we talked
          on disposable cellphones-- I've
          never even seen his face! I
          couldn't tell you who he was if my
          life depended it!

          BLEEPING monitors. Uneaten LUNCH on a tray.
          MAGGIE, her surrogate that is, sits in a chair beside the
          bed, her hand resting on GREER's. He stirs-- she pulls
          her hand back, returns to her fashion magazine.
          A TV plays above his bed, Greer blinks, squints at this.
          ON TV - a small BOY CLIMBS a very tall TREE above a
          suburban sidewalk, pleasant MUSIC. Suddenly, a BRANCH
          BREAKS, the boy tumbles with a CRY.
          GREER winces distastefully.
          ON TV - now we see the BOY again, perfectly fine,
          standing beside his mother. She strokes his head with a
          smile. They look down at his broken SURROGATE on the
          ground beside the fallen BRANCH.

          Peters seems relieved. Maggie waits for an introduction,
          but Greer seems withdrawn, shy-- Peters has never seen
          his physical body.

          Hi. I'm Maggie, Tom's wife.

          You should have mentioned her. I
          need to get going anyway, I'll let

          the ground, half a dozen wounded.
          Greer closes his eyes in misery.

                         PETERS
          It's not your fault. You were doing
          your job.
          Stone pulls up Maggie's chair, sits as he speaks.

                         STONE
          I would have to disagree. You
          requisitioned that chopper without
          authorization. You violated our
          treaty with the Dreads-- we're
          expecting retaliation. Those poor
          cops had no idea what they were up

                         AGAINST--

                         GREER
          None of us did! We still don't
          know. I don't think Strickland
          even knew-- he thought he was just
          taking down "the abominations."

          step back, looking on carefully. Greer takes his LAPTOP
          COMPUTER off the bedside table, opens it so that Stone
          can see it.

                         GREER

                         STONE
          It's more than that. It means
          nobody is safe. The Dreads want
          us all to be like them-- living in
          fear, no better than animals. And
          we've only just freed ourselves,
          begun to explore our true
          potential.

          for the anxiety... they call it
          corporeaphobia.

                         PETERS
          Just take my arm.
          He shakes his head, takes a deep breath and moves out
          onto the sidewalk. Peters stays close.
          GREER'S POV - SURRIE PEDESTRIANS, moving quickly, seeming
          to come right. at him. One bumps into him--
          GREER staggers, the surrie moves on as if he hasn't even
          noticed. Greer moves toward the curb to get away from
          them, stumbles-- PETERS has to pull him out of CAR
          TRAFFIC, a HORN HONKS. He's sweating, terrified.

                         GREER
          Jesus Christ.

                         PETERS
          We need to get you a replacement.
          She takes his arm forcibly and moves him away.

          EXT. SURROGATE DISCOUNT STORE - DAY

          A low-end place, BODIES displayed in the windows in their
          charging bays, SIGNS reading "HURRY 4 A SURRY! GIANT

          SALE! SYNTH UNITS NEW & USED!"
          PETERS guides GREER inside.

          INT. SURROGATE DISCOUNT STORE - DAY

          COFFIN-SIZED BOXES, SENSORY PROJECTORS and STIM CHAIRS
          stacked willy-nilly. BRIGHT LIGHTS, VIDEO SCREENS
          running PROMOS. A slick, blond Aryan SALESMAN approaches
          with a grin. He sizes GREER up, instantly recognizing
          signs of withdrawal. He speaks with an incongruous ASIAN

          ACCENT.

                         SALESMAN
          Oh you poor guy-- out in just your
          skin can be scary. No worries, I
          got perfect surrie for you.
          He leads them deeper into the store. He wears a clip-on
          ID BADGE with the smiling face of a dark-haired ASIAN.
          RACKS OF ATTRACTIVE MALE and FEMALE BODIES, in skimpy
          BATHING SUITS-- differing heights and degrees of muscle.
          GREER looks these over.

                         GREER
          I like to see my own face when I
          look in the mirror.

                         SALESMAN
          Fine, you no buy off the rack-- we
          customize, on premise, less than
          one hour.
          As they move on, we glimpse CELEBRITY LOOK-ALIKES on the
          rack-- MARILYN MONROE and ELVIS PRESLEY.
          LATER - ON COMPUTER SCREEN, a 3-D RENDERING of GREER'S
          FACE rotates, shows EXPRESSIONS, smiles, frowns-- and
          speaks. A VOICE-PRINT runs below.

                         GREER'S VOICE
          Hello. Testing-one-two-three...
          THE SALESMAN works the computer, GREER lies in an
          uncomfortable STIM CHAIR attached to a_SENSORY PROJECTOR,
          RED GOGGLES over his eyes and a CAMERA pointed at his
          face. He seems uneasy. PETERS looks on from nearby.

                         CONTINUED:

                         SALESMAN
          No worries, we make you good deal,
          no payment til next year. Just try
          one on for size. You like, we lock
          in your neural code, plastiform
          your face, you good to go.
          THE SALESMAN hits a couple of switches, slips a small
          SLEEVE over GREER'S FINGER, it's wired to the projector.

                         SALESMAN (CONT'D)
          Take a whirl.
          Greer touches his fingers together--- his body instantly
          goes limp and--
          -a pale, hairless SURRIE TEMPLATE in a speedo steps out
          of a CHARGING BAY. Its head is unfinished, a mechanical
          version of a skinless face. Around its neck is a sign
          that reads "40% OFF!"

                         SALESMAN (CONT'D)
          Looking gooood.

                         40% OFF
          I dunno...
          The VOICE is a tinny, far-away sounding version of
          Greer's. Suddenly 40% OFF twitches and stumbles, bumping
          into a DISPLAY.

                         SALESMAN
          Try touching your nose.
          40% OFF pokes himself in the eye.

                         'SALESMAN (CONT'D)
          Good, good. Takes some time to
          break in. Base model come with
          vision, hearing-- other senses
          optional.

                         40% OFF
          Screw this.
          The surrie FREEZES in its tracks... and slowly TOPPLES
          OVER as GREER pulls of the projector headpiece. The
          SALESMAN sets to righting it, GREER heads for the exit.

                         SALESMAN
          Wait wait wait! I throw in super-
          sex software package-- fifty

          We can try a department store--
          if money's a problem, I can front

                         YOU TILL--

                         GREER
          No. I'm a grown man for
          Chrissake, I should be able to
          walk down the street without
          completely freaking out.

          INT. BAR - DAY

          A BARTENDER puts a SODA WATER and a GLASS OF SCOTCH on
          the bar in front of PETERS and the shaky GREER.

                         PETERS
          Well, you made it a block.

                         GREER
          (lifts his glass)
          Here's to self-medication.
          He takes a sip and spits it out. The BARTENDER turns.

                         BARTENDER
          Are you all right, sir?

                         GREER
          What is this?
          The BARTENDER gives him a once-over.

                         BARTENDER
          Oh, sorry. We don't get a lot of--
          that's synthohol. Just a CPU
          inhibition blocker in a non-
          corrosive solution...
          As the bartender speaks, Greer looks around the dark bar--
          --in the back, EVERY COUPLE is gazing into each other's
          eyes, clearly hooking up.
          GREER continues to watch the other patrons.

                         GREER
          You have any real booze?

                         BARTENDER
          No liquor license.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         CONTINUED:
          The BARTENDER shrugs and moves off. Peters sips her soda
          water, amused.

                         PETERS
          Come here often, stranger?

                         GREER
          You know, they really don't look
          human. You can't tell when you're
          inside them, but...
          GREER turns to PETERS, studies her like the others.

                         PETERS
          I don't like the way you're
          looking at me.

                         GREER
          But I'm not really looking at you.

                         PETERS
          Yeah yeah, this is just a lump of
          aluminum and polystyrene. Tell
          you what, next time you're in
          Colorado, look me up for real. We
          can have a beer together.

                         GREER
          I'd like that.
          PETERS blinks, Greer has suddenly gotten sincere on her.
          He looks away.

                         GREER (CONT'D)
          You know, when we started working
          together, I thought you were kind
          of a stiff.

                         PETERS
          New job, I was defensive.

                         GREER
          It's more than that... you're
          different. Or maybe I am.
          Greer's embarrassed, shrugs it off. He puts down a bill
          and rises.

                         GREER (CONT'D)
          You probably oughta head back to
          the office.

                         PETERS
          I can get you home.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         GREER
          I'll be OK.
          He moves toward the door, she tags along.

                         GREER (CONT'D)
          I'm thinking you should double-
          check Strickland's records, go back
          to the hard copies. See if you can
          find out why they dropped charges.

                         PETERS
          You seem better already.

                         GREER
          It's like riding a bike.

          EXT. METRO ENTRANCE - DAY

          subway,
          GREER and PETERS walk, he spots a sign for the
          changes direction to head for the escalator.

                         PETERS
          Where you going?

                         GREER
          It's a lovely day. Thought I'd take
          a trip to East Baltimore.
          He pauses at the top, a hit of vertigo.

                         GREER (CONT'D)
          Was it always this steep?

                         PETERS
          Jesus, Tom, the rez?

                         GREER
          Since I'm stuck in my skin, I
          oughta take advantage of it. Hell,
          as long as Strickland has that
          device-- I'm safer this way.
          He clutches the handrail, starts moving down.

                         PETERS
          Be careful.
          He nods and waves as he disappears down the escalator.

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.

          INT. FBI BUILDING/LOBBY - DAY

          PETERS enters this large lobby, bustling with other
          AGENTS and OFFICIALS. She moves toward a DESK JOCKEY,
          security SCANNERS. She reacts to the sound of--
          --SCREAMS and SCREECHING TIRES from outside the building.
          PETERS looks toward a large WINDOW to the street-- and
          immediately dives for cover as--
          --a battered SUV, spray-painted with anti-surrogate
          GRAFFITI, SMASHES through the plate glass. SURRIE
          PEDESTRIANS are plastered across the grill and embedded
          in the windshield.
          THE SUV slams into a few SURRIES in the lobby, sends them
          flying or runs over them. It spins sideways into a WALL
          with the FBI SEAL overhead.
          The DRIVER leaps out, armed with a MACHINE GUN. He's
          clearly a DREAD, angry and deranged. He starts SHOOTING
          at anything that moves.
          PETERS crouches for cover as BULLETS shatter GLASS and
          smash MARBLE around her.
          An army of AGENTS burst from an elevator in Kevlar and
          riot helmets, armed with AUTOMATIC RIFLES. They
          instantly bring the DREAD down in a barrage of gunfire.
          The agents move to the DREAD'S BODY-- he's very dead,
          pouring BLOOD from dozens of bullet wounds. One speaks
          into his headset:

                         RIOT AGENT
          Secure.

                         (TO CROWD)

          A SMALL FLAT-PANEL TV in the back of the CAB plays NEWS

          removed on carts, one BODY on a stretcher.

          NEWS READER VOICE

          His motive is unclear at this point,
          but may be a response to the recent
          incident at the Baltimore human
          reservation...
          GREER, in the back seat, takes in this news grimly. The
          CABBIE has been glancing at his own monitor in front.

                         CABBIE
          Goddamn Dreads... sure you don't
          wanna change your mind?

          I'm sure.

          EXT. BALTIMORE SLUMS - DAY

          Late afternoon. GREER emerges from a TAXI near the same
          gate we saw earlier. Greer wobbles, steadies himself
          against the car as he pays the CABBIE-- a DRONE
          SURROGATE, built into the seat.

                         CABBIE
          You OK, man?

                         GREER
          Just a little carsick.
          The TAXI pulls away, Greer heads for the GATE.

          EXT. RESERVATION NO MAN'S LAND - DAY

          AT THE GATE: METAL SIGNS read "HUMANS ONLY - NO
          SURROGATES." GREER goes through a big,.old-fashioned
          (present-day) METAL DETECTOR, the light flashes GREEN. A
          DREAD GUARD waves him past. Greer gestures toward one of
          the many IMAGES OF THE PROPHET to be found in the rez.

                         GREER
          Where would I find the, the what do
          you call it, the Temple?

                         DREAD GUARD
          Ten blocks that way, left on
          Bloomfield.

                         GREER
          Thanks.

          Piss off.
          As Greer crosses the rubble-strewn no man's land, he
          pauses, sickened as he sees--
          --the burned-out HELICOPTER HULK, now sprayed with
          GRAFITTI. "PIGS DIE," etc. And just beyond this--
          --what's left of GREER'S SURRIE, half the head blown off
          with fried electronics hanging out. It's been lashed to
          a makeshift crucifix, made from the bent CHOPPER BLADES.
          The clothing is shredded, the remains spray-painted.
          GREER, wary of being recognized, continues on.

          EXT. RESERVATION STREET - DAY

          GREER walks through a poor but surprisingly pleasant
          neighborhood-- rowhouses, gardens. Very few cars.
          DREADS look like ordinary working-class folks.
          A BARBECUE, a group of RESIDENTS laughing and drinking.
          Greer inhales the SMOKE as he passes, smiles to himself.
          A couple of FRIENDLY DOGS trot curiously after him for a
          moment, then return to the barbecue. GREER, not paying
          attention, brushes past an ELDERLY MALE PEDESTRIAN.

                         GREER
          Excuse me.

                         PEDESTRIAN
          (smiles and nods)
          No problem.
          A PLAYGROUND a short distance on,.LOTS OF KIDS shrieking
          and running. Greer pauses here, taking this in. These
          are the first children we've seen, outside of a TV ad.
          A CLOUD OF DIESEL SMOKE from a decrepit BUS. Greer
          CHOKES on this, but doesn't seem displeased. His body
          language has become more relaxed as he gets further into
          the rez, getting his land legs back.

          INT. RESERVATION TEMPLE - DAY

          A cavernous convention center, thousands of folding
          chairs face a raised PULPIT at one end. Behind this is a
          SUPERGRAPHIC of the PROPHET, hands raised in benediction.

          GREER enters, takes this in. He spots a CLEANING LADY,
          an older woman sweeping up amidst the rows nearby.

                         GREER
          Excuse me. You wouldn't happen to
          know a Jack Strickland? I'm told
          he worked here off and on.

                         CLEANING LADY

                         (NODS)
          You're here for the service? It's
          in the park.

          EXT. RESERVATION PARK - DUSK

          GREER moves down a path in this expanse of greenery. He
          comes to an open lawn with a fairly large CROWD gathered,
          illuminated by a FLAMING TORCH.
          THE PROPHET is speaking. He stands before a platform
          atop wooden scaffolding, firewood piled below. A
          formidable ring of BODYGUARDS stands between him and the
          gathered throng of DREADS.

                         PROPHET
          --serving faithfully beside us in
          the cause of humanity. _I had the
          privilege of hearing his confession
          shortly before his death.
          GREER has pushed his way gently toward the front to get a
          look at the BODY atop the funeral BIER.
          The corpse atop the bier is that of JACK STRICKLAND, eyes
          closed, hands folded.

                         PROPHET (CONT'D)
          And I know he would have rejoiced
          in the day of resurrection, the
          day for which we are all
          preparing, the day I promise you
          is close at hand...
          So saying, the PROPHET lifts the torch and touches it to
          the base of the PYRE, which ERUPTS IN FLAME.
          CLOSE ON STRICKLAND as the FLAMES lick up around him.
          LATER, the BIER consumed in FIRE, the MOURNERS
          dispersing. THE PROPHET is moving away, HANDLERS
          surrounding him. GREER tags along-- but one of the
          Prophet's goons, BUD, gets in his face.

          Who are you?

                         GREER
          What happened to Jack Strickland?

                         BUD
          He slipped and fell. Friend of yours?
          Greer starts to move around him, Bud gets in his way.

                         GREER
          I'd like a word with the Prophet.

                         BUD
          You and everyone else.
          MILLER and ADAMS, another goon, now join them.

                         GREER
          Strickland was carrying a weapon.
          If it isn't recovered, there could
          be serious consequences-- for all
          of you.
          IN BG, the PROPHET and HANDLERS head toward a large RV.

                         MILLER
          You some kinda cop? Where's your
          puppet?

                         GREER
          Needs repairs.

                         MILLER
          You armed?
          GREER shakes his head, raises his hands.

                         GREER
          Frisk me if you want.

                         MILLER
          No, that's OK.
          With that, he throws a SUCKER PUNCH to the gut. GREER
          doubles over. He seems amazed at the sensation, the
          pain. But he recovers, throws a wild punch at Miller an d
          misses by a foot. [Violence for Greer in human form
          should have a very different, painfully visceral feel,
          unlike when he was a surrogate.]

          ADAMS cracks Greer across the back of his head. GREER
          falls to the ground. BUD kicks him once. GREER chokes
          and groans in pain.

                         MILLER (CONT'D)
          Hurts, doesn't it.

                         BUD
          It's a bitch being real.
          GREER lets out a primal CRY and lunges at MILLER, driving
          his head into the man's torso, knocking the wind out of
          him before the other two can pull Greer back.

                         ADAMS
          I think he likes it.

                         MILLER
          (catching his breath)
          So give him some more.
          Outnumbered three to one, Greer takes a beating,
          continues to throw mostly ineffective punches that just
          cause the men to redouble their efforts. Finally, he's
          limp in their arms.
          Miller plucks Greer's WALLET and BADGE from his pockets,
          examines them. As he does so, GREER spits BLOOD on the
          man's face. Miller seems about to whomp him again, but
          stops himself.

                         MILLER (CONT'D)
          Not gonna give you the
          satisfaction.
          (to Bud and Adams)
          Get him out of here.
          Miller tosses Greer's ID at him, then moves toward the
          RV, leaving GREER gasping in the clutches of Bud and
          Adams, lit by the FLAMES from the funeral pyre.

          INT. PROPHET'S RV - NIGHT

          A spartan interior. MILLER enters. THE PROPHET stands
          with a couple of HANDLERS.

                         HANDLER
          Trouble?

                         MILLER
          Some fed named Greer, he wanted to

                         MILLER
          Didn't come up. Said they wanted
          Strickland's weapon.

                         PROPHET
          Well, maybe I'll just have to
          bring it to their doorstep...
          In the Prophet's hand, we now see--
          --the mysterious DEVICE with which Strickland killed his
          targets.

          EXT. RESERVATION NO MAN'S LAND - NIGHT

          GREER is half-dragged, half-carried, back the way he
          came, flanked by BUD and ADAMS. Greer sucks on his
          BLEEDING lip, works his tongue around in his mouth. He
          touches parts of his bruised body carefully.

                         BUD
          Guy like you oughtn't be out in
          just your skin.

                         GREER
          I'm starting to see your point.
          AT THE GATE - GREER leaves, trying to muster as much
          dignity as he can. The DREAD GUARD calls sarcastically
          after him.

                         DREAD GUARD
          Come again real soon!

          EXT. BALTIMORE SLUMS - NIGHT

          GREER trudges along the seedy streets. He looks a mess--
          torn clothing, bloodstains, bruises. Suddenly he's
          SHOVED from behind, falls to the pavement.

                         WHEELS
          Oops.
          The assailant is a FREAK SURRIE-- extra ARMS, WHEELS
          where his feet should be.
          A moment later, Greer is surrounded by three rich, FREAKY

          TEENS.

          They've customized their surries in completely bizarre
          ways, in addition to the usual tattoos and piercings.
          Besides WHEELS, there's a hairless teen with six EYES
          scattered around his head. A GIRL has SPIKES sticking
          out of her skull and flesh and REPTILE SKIN.

          What are you doin' off the rez?
          She bumps against GREER as he picks himself up, he
          shrinks from the spikes. She shoots a small blast of
          FLAME from her nostrils, then GIGGLES.

                         GREER
          I'm not a Dread.

                         WHEELS
          Then you oughta return that
          surrie, looks like shit.
          WHEELS comes at Greer again, Greer moves and TRIPS him--
          but he just lands on an extra arm and rights himself.

                         EYES
          Hey, it wants to play.
          EYES lowers his head and moves to butt him. GREER
          dodges, it looks like a bullfight.

                         SPIKES
          Ole, toro!
          They turn, hearing a SCREECH OF TIRES.
          A LIMOUSINE has pulled up. A 10-year-old BOY climbs from
          the back and approaches.

                         BOY
          Agent Greer. Would you like a ride?
           The kid's voice sounds like a child's, but with mature
          cadences to his speech. -

          Check out Richie Rich.
          THE DRIVER of the Limo steps out-- it's ARMANDO from
          Canter's lobby. He lets his jacket fall open, revealing

          So many unforeseen consequences to
          the surrogate revolution... I

          INT. LIMO -- NIGHT

          As GREER climbs in, the BOY hands him back his own
          BUSINESS CARD, the one Greer left with Canter.

          You left this on my desk.
          ARMANDO has gotten behind the wheel, starts moving.

          It's not safe for me to use my
          usual surrogates. This is one of
          VSI's.newer models. Not that the

          THE LIMO drives along the Potomac near the city.

          GREER holds ICE to his swollen face.

                         BOY/CANTER
          This Strickland character. I
          don't believe he could have been
          acting on his own.

                         GREER

          the humanists hate--

                         BOY/CANTER

                         GREER
          He'd outlived his usefulness.
          With me all over his ass, he was
          becoming a security risk--

                         BOY/CANTER
          To kill someone remotely-- it
          would take a virus presumably, one
          that could get past every firewall
          protecting a surrie's circuitry--
          then once in the CPU, override all
          the fail-safes and cause
          catastrophic brain damage...

                         GREER
          Presumably.

                         CONTINUED:
          MAGGIE and BRIDGET are squeezed together on the couch in
          Greer's apartment with BRIAN and a French hunk named
          ANDRE, who speaks with a slight ACCENT. Everyone is
          pretty high. Andre closes one eye, then the other,
          pupils turned inward.

                         ANDRE
          Think my nose is too big...

                         MAGGIE
          For what?

                         ANDRE

                         (SQUEEZING IT)
          I'm going to have it replaced.

                         BRIDGET
          While you're at it-- I am so sick
          of twelve-inch dicks.
          MAGGIE chuckles. On the coffee table before them sits a
          small JACKER, like the one we saw in the underground
          club. The foursome pass a single ELECTRICAL TUBE around,
          attached by a cord to the device. Andre and Bridget have
          clearly coupled up, Brian touches Maggie's leg casually
          from time to time.

                         ANDRE
          What do you want, we're men.

                         BRIAN
          (coming out of it)
          Why is that? Why do we all have
          to be men and women? I'd rather
          be-- I dunno, a lion. Or an
          eagle.

                         MAGGIE
          Mm. A spaceship. Or a cloud.

                         BRIAN

                         (BEAT)
          A cloud?
          Maggie shrugs. She lifts the hair from the nape of her
          neck, moves the GLASS TUBE there. Brian holds her close.
          The ELECTRICAL ARC-- MAGGIE gasps with pleasure,
          transported.
          A moment later, Andre notices that GREER has entered
          quietly during the above, staring at the foursome.

                         ANDRE
          Don't look now. Some homeless
          meatbag just wandered in.
          Maggie has blanked out for the moment. Bridget turns.

                         BRIDGET
          That's Maggie's husband. Hi Tom.
          She gives him a little wave. Greer moves past them,
          toward the kitchen, and disappears. Maggie comes out of
          her trance, blinks and sighs.

                         MAGGIE
          Excuse me.
          She hurries after him. Brian shrugs, grabs the tube and
          starts to unzip his pants--

          INT. GREER'S APARTMENT/KITCHEN - NIGHT

          GREER has removed an old, yellowed FIRST-AID KIT from
          under the sink, during the scene he cleans up cuts, opens
          his shirt to check his bruised ribs, etc.

                         MAGGIE
          What happened to you? I thought
          you were-spending another night in
          the hospital.

                         GREER
          Obviously. You know I don't like
          you jacking in the house.
          He finds an untouched, dusty bottle of SCOTCH, sniffs it
          and pours a drink. Maggie looks him over.

                         MAGGIE
          Somebody beat you up? How could
          you go out like that?
          As Maggie speaks, she moves to his side, touching his
          injuries gently, truly concerned. Greer flinches back.

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          What were you thinking, Tom? You.
          could've been killed.

                         GREER
          Just finding out how the other
          half lives.

          74.

                         CONTINUED:
          Greer takes a long drink, gestures toward the living
          room.

                         GREER (CONT'D)
          So what's his name?

                         MAGGIE
          Oh please, grow up.

                         GREER

                         (NODS GLUMLY)
          I suppose it doesn't matter. Since,
          as you keep telling me, it doesn't
          mean anything. Nothing does.
          Greer pours another drink.

                         MAGGIE
          I don't expect you to understand
          this. But once in a while, I like
          to be around people who don't hate
          being alive.

                         GREER
          Alive. Is that what they are out
          there?
          She shakes her head and returns to the living room.

          INT. GREER'S APARTMENT/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          MAGGIE, BRIDGET, BRIAN and ANDRE are still partying-- in
          fact, Bridget and Andre are starting to make out-- when
          GREER re-enters, in a RAINCOAT, he's a little tipsy. The
          BOTTLE pokes out of a pocket.

                         BRIAN
          Hey. You really a G-man?
          Greer pauses, stares at the man.

                         BRIAN (CONT'D)
          Can I ask you something? Is it
          true you guys are tapping into our
          surries? Watching everything we
          do, twenty-four seven?

                         GREER

                         (A BEAT)
          Of course not.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.

                         CONTINUED:
          Greer starts to move across the room again, heading for
          the door. Brian smirks, speaks quietly, thinking only
          the others will hear. As he touches Maggie's leg:

                         BRIAN
          Wouldn't want him spying on us
          tonight...
          Greer spins near the door and, without breaking stride,
          returns to the couch.

                         GREER
          Excuse me.
          Brian turns, starts to rise. Greer grabs the man and
          HURLS him backwards onto the GLASS COFFEE TABLE which
          SHATTERS. The other three back away. After a stunned
          moment, Brian starts LAUGHING, very hard-- obviously, he
          hasn't felt a thing.

                         MAGGIE
          Tom, the table!
          Greer steps over the couch calmly and begins PUNCHING and
          KICKING the surrie on the floor, working off pent-up
          rage. BRIAN just keeps LAUGHING.
          Soon Greer's hands are cut and bleeding, he's panting,
          exhausted. MAGGIE finally succeeds in pulling him away.-
          BRIAN sits up, his FACE is DENTED, the plastic skin
          STRETCHED and TORN.

                         BRIAN
          Could we do it again?

                         ANDRE

                         (CHUCKLING)
          Oh man, your face.

                         BRIAN
          I was getting sick of it, anyway.
          As Brian picks bits of GLASS out of his plastic flesh,
          Andre suddenly realizes his JACKER is SMASHED, examines
          the pieces with a MOAN.

                         GREER
          Guess the party's over.
          MAGGIE follows GREER to the door. They speak in hushed

                         TONES:

                         MAGGIE
          What was the point of that?

                         GREER
          Does everything have to have a
          point?
          GREER takes a breath, bows his head.

                         GREER (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry. I just want us to-- to
          connect again. To have a family,
          to have a life.
          (grabs her arms)
          We can't do it through this wall
          of plastic.
          MAGGIE pulls away, his BLOODY HANDS have left marks on
          her blouse.

                         MAGGIE
          I'm sorry, too. But this is my
          life.
          She looks at him sadly and returns to her guests. After
          a beat, Greer heads out the door.

          EXT. FBI BUILDING - NIGHT

          GREER walks in the RAIN through nearly empty streets
          toward the modern headquarters in Washington. There are
          BOARDS over the shattered windows in front.

          INT. FBI LOBBY - NIGHT

          Quiet at this hour. A DESK JOCKEY looks up as GREER
          approaches, careful to conceal the bottle.

                         DESK JOCKEY
          Is that you, Greer?

                         GREER
          In the flesh.
          He takes in the damage to the lobby, the police tape, the
          attacker's chalk silhouette.

                         DESK JOCKEY
          You missed all the excitement.

                         GREER
          Saw it on TV.

          77.

                         CONTINUED:
          He passes the SURRIE SCANNER and holds his hand over a
          FINGERPRINT MACHINE, which confirms his identity. A
          plexiglas door unlocks automatically.

                         DESK JOCKEY
          Says here you're on suspension.

                         GREER
          Mm. Just cleaning out my desk.

                         DESK JOCKEY

                         (EYING HIM)
          Y'know, you're thinner on top.

                         GREER
          Nice of you to notice. You
          remember where the rest rooms are?

                         DESK JOCKEY
          They mostly use 'em for storage.
          Think the one on four still works.
          Greer nods and continues in.

          INT. FBI BUILDING/CHARGING ROOM - NIGHT

          DOZENS of SURROGATE AGENTS are lined up against the wall
          in here, in their foam CHARGING BAYS.
          CAMERA FINDS PETERS in their midst. Her bay HUMS and she
          blinks, becomes animated. She steps out of the bay.

          INT. FBI BUILDING/GREER'S OFFICE - NIGHT

          GREER has his feet up on his desk, the bottle beside him.
          There are cardboard BOXES of DOCUMENTS nearby. PETERS
          enters, Greer looks up at her.

                         PETERS
          Got your message.

                         GREER
          Hope I didn't wake you.

                         PETERS
          After what happened here today I
          couldn't sleep.

                         GREER
          You tell anyone I was going out to
          the rez? Canter, for example?

          No. Of course not.
          Greer studies her a beat, decides she's sincere. A sigh.
          Peters sits on his desk, studies him.

                         PETERS (CONT'D)
          You look terrible.

                         GREER
          Not half as bad as I feel.
          Greer refills his coffee cup with Scotch, holds the
          bottle out to her questioningly.

                         PETERS
          No thanks.

                         GREER
          Come on. Just pretend to get
          drunk with me.
          Peters shakes her head with a smile. Greer shrugs, takes
          a long drink, sighs and rubs his sore neck.

                         GREER (CONT'D)
          Feel like I've been asleep for
          years-- now I wake up an old man.
          Rip Van Frigging Winkle...
          Peters moves behind him, begins rubbing his shoulders, a
          massage.

                         GREER (CONT'D)
          What are you doing?

                         PETERS
          You look like you need it.

                         GREER
          I'm not sure how kosher this is...

                         PETERS
          Relax. It's not me, it's not a
          woman touching you-- it's just a
          machine.

                         GREER
          Does feel good... better than a
          stim chair.
          He allows himself to enjoy it for a moment, bows his
          head.

          What.

                         GREER
          Us. People. The stuff that used
          to make the world make sense.
          That made us... human. I don't
          know, morality, love. Whatever.

                         (BEAT)
          Yeah, yeah, they were probably
          saying that back in ancient Rome.

                         PETERS
          We always think technology's going
          to improve our lives, but...

                         GREER
          What lives?
          A beat, GREER sits up and pulls away from her touch. He
          holds up a hand and lets it fall.

                         GREER (CONT'D)
          This has become obsolete. Someday
          soon, we'll all just be brains in
          jars.

                         PETERS
          Maybe not. I have a feeling
          people are going to come to their
          senses eventually.

                         GREER
          (shaking his head)
          You can't unring a bell.
          (turns toward her)
          Thought you were the one all into
          the brave new world.
          PETERS is staring at her own plastic hand. She looks up
          at Greer, changes the subject.

                         PETERS
          I found out about Strickland.
          She gestures to the boxes of documents.

                         PETERS (CONT'D)
          All the chaos, I was able to waltz

          The case files were removed, but
          there was a paper trail from
          payroll... Strickland was an
          informant.

                         (PERKING UP)
          For us? Who was running him?

                         PETERS
          Wasn't in the paperwork. But he
          must've been selling intel on the
          Prophet.
          Greer has risen, moving restlessly around the room.

                         GREER
          So the Prophet has him killed. And
          we have to assume he now has the
          power to kill anyone he wants...

          CLOSE on a PHOTO of the DEVICE in Strickland's hand. The
          image has been ENLARGED, giving a pretty clear view of
          the weapon.

                         BRANDON
          Where'd you get this photo?
          GREER sits opposite COLONEL BRANDON at the man's desk, a
          FLAG and other MILITARY MEMORABILIA on display. Greer
          eyes the colonel, knows something's up.

                         GREER
          It's from my memory. Damn thing
          put me in the hospital.

                         BRANDON
          Wish I could help.

                         GREER
          Killed a couple of cops as well.
          We believe this weapon-- the one
          that doesn't exist-- is in the
          hands of the Human Coalition.

          If this is true... we're going to
          have to do everything in our-power
          to recover it. Do you have any
          idea how serious this is?

                         GREER
          I was hoping you'd tell me.
          BRANDON looks conflicted, finally opens up.

                         BRANDON
          This is absolutely off the record.
          (off Greer's nod)
          It's called an Overload Device, or
          O.D. They're brand new, only a
          handful exist. But I checked, ran
          every serial number-- all accounted
          for.

                         GREER
          Not this one. Maybe it never got
          to you guys in the first place.
          Who makes them?

                         BRANDON
          It's a DARPA design, subcontracted to
          Pierson Defense. The idea was to
          create a non-lethal weapon that could
          disable every surrie in the field.
          You beam a software virus straight to
          the CPU. The fail-safes kick in and
          the operators are cut off. Circuits
          all melt down in seconds, you're left
          with a field full of scrap.

          You win the battle with one shot.

                         (BEAT)
          Let me guess. You found a way
          around the fail-safes.

          Just a few lines of code, the
          connection stays open. We tried it on
          soldier volunteers... once. The virus
          caused every neuron to fire at the
          same time. Melted their brains.

                         GREER

          CLOSE on a WOMAN'S FACE being carefully peeled off the
          MECHANICAL UNDERPINNINGS. FUNKY MUSIC plays.
          WIDER, BRIDGET leans over the body, putting the old face
          aside. A row of EXOTIC NEW FACES on a rack nearby.
          Bridget begins manipulating the underlying musculature,
          changing cheekbones, etc, using delicate TOOLS.

                         BRIDGET
          She wanted blue eyes the size of
          golf balls, bee-sting lips and a
          tiny ski-jump nose...

                         MAGGIE
          Boop-oop-a-doop.

                         BRIDGET
          Exactly.
          Nearby, MAGGIE works on a brown-skinned HAND. She stares
          through a mounted MAGNIFYING LOUPE, embedding tiny JEWELS
          in the SKIN of the fingers. She uses TWEEZERS and a tiny
          BLOWTORCH. After a moment, we realize the HAND has been
          disconnected from the body, mounted on a brace.

                         MAGGIE
          You talked her down, I hope.

                         BRIDGET
          Yes, thank God, we're doing a
          modified Audrey Hepburn.
          MAGGIE glances over at Bridget's work admiringly.

                         MAGGIE
          I'd love you to raise my
          cheekbones a half-inch, but Tom
          would go ballistic.

          As GREER approaches, a few of the BEAUTY ENGINEERS glance
          up, then return to their business.

          all kinds of positions. Not only are they having nails
          and hair done, but legs lengthened, breasts enlarged,
          etc. (Operators check in their bodies and leave them

          Worked late. I'd really like to sit
          down and talk with you.

          I can take a break--

          No, Maggie, face to face. The two of
          us, for real.
          BRIDGET is getting uncomfortable.

                         BRIDGET
          These smile muscles need to set.
          She exits with a look at Maggie. Maggie stops working
          and turns to Greer, speaks passionately.

                         MAGGIE
          Tom, don't you get it? That body
          in our apartment-- the one you
          call real--- it isn't me. I'm
          right here.

                         GREER
          Honey, if you're worried about the
          way you look-- it doesn't matter,
          it never did--

                         MAGGIE
          Exactly! What matters is who I
          choose to be.
          As the conversation gets more heated, co-workers
          pointedly turn away, while eavesdropping.

          Well that's your problem, isn't

          beautiful and feel good all the

          Maggie turns back to what she was doing. Greer has
          trouble swallowing his anger.

                         GREER

          No. I was just fishing.

                         STONE
          You've suffered brain damage, Greer.
          Let's hope it isn't permanent.

                         GREER

                         (GRIN FADING)
          All surveillance on the Prophet goes
          through this office. Jack
          Strickland was one of your stoolies.
          Why the hell didn't you say
          something?
          STONE just stares at him, narrowing his eyes.

                         GREER (CONT'D)
          Two cops died. You knew he had the

          0. D.--

                         STONE
          I have no idea what you're talking

                         ABOUT--

                         GREER
          --because you gave it to him.
          VSI makes them-- they hand one to
          you-- and you chose the trigger
          man. Your own little black op.
          If anyone looks, they blame the
          Dreads. But Strickland didn't
          follow the plan, did he? He
          didn't give you back the 0. D.
          like he was supposed to.

                         STONE
          Are you done with this paranoid
          fantasy--?

                         GREER
          Not quite. What I can't figure out
          is why. Why kill Canter?
          STONE stares at Greer, angry and defiant. He moves to
          his desk, types into his COMPUTER. Greer approaches
          slowly.

                         STONE
          I'm issuing orders for your
          detention. Your mind isn't right,
          you've become a threat to national
          security.

          Greer slips a LETTER OPENER off of Stone's desk as he
          nears. His hand is SHAKING. Suddenly--
          --STONE yanks open a DRAWER and lunges for a GUN. But
          before he can bring it to bear--
          --GREER STABS him in the back of the head, SKEWERING
          STONE'S CPU. STONE FREEZES, hunched over his desk, gun
          in hand. Greer just stares at what he's done for a
          moment, amazed. Then he waves a hand in front of Stone's
          open eyes, makes sure he's out, and--
          --carefully pries off a plate and removes STONE'S
          MOTHERBOARD, places it on the desk.
          GREER pulls the gun out of Stone's hand, rolls him back
          in front of his desk, propped up to face the computer.
          Greer crouches behind him, operating the keyboard by
          reaching around his boss' body.
          ON COMPUTER - Greer types in a request for a FILE on
          LIONEL CANTER. The words "CLASSIFIED - IDENTITY SCAN
          REQUIRED" appear.
          GREER pushes the chair a bit closer to the computer,
          ducking down, lifts Stone's head by the hair.
          The monitor momentarily displays STONE'S FACE. A LIGHT
          goes on in the corner of the FRAME, scanning Stone.
          "AUTHORIZED USER" appears.
          GREER peeks up again, continuing his work.
          ON SCREEN - a HEADSHOT OF CANTER, reams of CLASSIFIED
          INFO. Greer hits PRINT.

          INT. FBI BUILDING/BULLPEN - DAY

          GREER emerges, a stack of PAPERS in his hand. He gives a
          nod to NAKATA, who nods back as he answers his RINGING
          PHONE. Before he can even say a word:

                         STONE (FILTER)
          This is Stone!
          Nakata looks toward the office, starting to rise.

                         NAKATA
          What do you need, sir?

          INT. STONE'S STUDY - DAY

          Upscale. The REAL STONE, a good deal heavier than his
          surrogate, is sitting in boxer shorts at the edge of his
          STIM CHAIR, a phone in his hand.

                         STONE
          Sonofabitch Greer disabled my
          surrie, stop him!

          INT. FBI BUILDING/STAIRWELL - DAY

          GREER takes a couple steps at a time. He's on his phone.

                         GREER
          Just meet me in the garage-- leave
          the trunk open!
          As he rounds a corner, he comes face to face with--
          --a pair of AGENTS, each carrying a HANDGUN. They
          approach from below.

                         AGENT #1
          Tom, we don't want to hurt you.
          Greer nods and raises his hands, resigned-- he still
          clutches the papers. As Agent #1 nears, Greer suddenly--
          --PLANTS a FOOT in the man's chest, sending him crashing
          into AGENT #2. Both men topple down the stairs, FIRE
          their guns wildly.
          Greer has also lost his balance and dropped some papers,
          which he has to scoop up as he claws for the. doorway and
          dashes through.

          INT. FBI BUILDING/PARKING GARAGE - DAY

          PETERS waits near an IDLING SEDAN, the TRUNK OPEN. Greer
          dives inside, she SLAMS it and gets behind the wheel.
          She PEELS out, going up a few levels.
          AT AN EXIT GATE - an FBI GUARD looks inside.

                         FBI GUARD
          They're looking for Tom Greer.
          You seen him?
          She shakes her head, he presses a button to open the gate
          and waves her through.

          EXT. PARK - DAY

          THE FBI SEDAN drives down a curving, forested road.

          INT. FBI CAR - DAY

          PETERS drives, GREER in the passenger seat, poring over
          the papers.

                         GREER
          Ever hear of the Human Defense League?

                         PETERS
          Sure, the extremist wing of the
          anti-surrogate movement.

                         GREER
          According to this, their number one
          supporter is Lionel Canter.

                         PETERS
          What? The father of surrogacy?
          Impossible.

                         GREER
          Says he's funneled billions into
          their organization. Not to
          mention direct support for the man
          who calls himself the Prophet.
          Canter's bought him land,
          lawyers... and enough weapons to
          start a war.

          EXT. RESERVATION NO MAN'S LAND - DAY

          THE DREADS emerge from tents and shacks at the sound of a
          nearby RUMBLING.
          ANGLE THROUGH FENCE - BULLDOZERS, TANKS, uniformed
          NATIONAL GUARDSMEN (all surrogates with the SAME FACE)
          are assembling on the perimeter of the Dread reservation.
          They carry non-lethal TASER WANDS and RIFLES.
          An OFFICER moves to the front, carrying a WALKIE-TALKIE.
          In response to a command, he turns and signals to the
          troops behind him and--
          --the BULLDOZERS start PLOWING DOWN the fence. As
          Guardsmen move past him, the officer calls out:

          absolutely necessary!

          INT. CHEAP HOTEL ROOM - DAY

          PAPERWORK spread on a table before PETERS.

                         PETERS
          Swiss accounts, anonymous wire
          transfers, unattributed testimony--
          this isn't proof.
          WIDER - GREER lies in his clothes on the bed, bone tired,
          a flat-screen TV plays silently.

                         GREER
          Not enough for a courtroom. But
          VSI knew that if Lionel Canter
          suffered a mysterious brain
          hemmorhage, the powers that be
          wouldn't be terribly upset.

                         PETERS
          He's not some kind of monster, you
          know. Canter's initial research
          was in prosthetics-- for amputees,
          quadriplegics... people with
          degenerative diseases. Maybe he
          feels his technology's been
          perverted. Maybe it has.
          GREER studies her with interest, her tone is strangely
          passionate.

                         GREER
          I had no idea you were such a
          humanist.
          PETERS looks away-- then reacts to something on TV, grabs
          a remote and turns UP THE VOLUME.
          ON TV SCREEN - HAND-HELD footage as NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS
          move across the Dread Reservation No Man's Land, using
          TASER WANDS to subdue resisting DREADS, frisking them and
          rifling through possessions as they upend dwellings.

          GREER knows what this is about.

          Colonel Brandon didn't waste any
          time.

          Isn't that what you called it?
          What does it stand for again?

                         GREER
          Overload Device.
          She nods and turns nonchalantly back to the paperwork.
          As she does so, GREER cocks his head and studies her.
          Protecting Brand's confidence, he never told her what the
          device was called.

                         PETERS
          So what do we do about Stone?

                         GREER
          I call and tell him I'll take
          early retirement with full pension
          benefits. In return for keeping
          his little secret.

                         PETERS
          That isn't funny.

                         GREER
          I'm not laughing.

                         (RISES)
          I don't believe you-- they killed
          Canter's son, a college kid, his
          whole life ahead of him! Don't we
          owe him something?
          She's genuinely upset. Greer won't meet her eye.

                         (ENRAGED)
          They will come after Canter again--
          but you're just going to deposit
          your pension checks, look the
          other way and let him die.

                         GREER

          Maybe he's got it coming.

          I thought you were a cop. I
          thought you were a human being.
          PETERS marches out of there and slams the door on the way
          out. GREER waits a few moments, his mind racing-- then
          he moves for the door himself.

          INT. RENTAL AGENCY - DAY

          GREER moves from a desk with a pretty RENTAL AGENT,
          working at a small hand-held COMPUTER. LOGOS for GLOBAL

          I'm only gonna be there a couple
          hours.

          RED GLOWS emanate from a few.

          INT. RESERVATION TEMPLE -- DAY

          THE PROPHET stands with a MIC before a LARGE CROWD packed
          into the place, sounds of CHAOS from outside. GUARDSMEN
          are moving into the temple, methodically searching those
          inside. -

                         PROPHET
          Have no fear, the day of
          resurrection is at hand!
          A team of GUARDSMEN move to surround the Prophet, his
          BODYGUARDS struggle with them.

                         PROPHET (CONT'D)
          No! Do not resist! The
          oppressors shall soon fall, never
          to rise again...
          Ignoring him, some bodyguards pull HANDGUNS and FIRE on
          the SURROGATE GUARDSMEN, who immediately RETURN FIRE with
          automatic weapons. BUD and MILLER, the Prophet's right
          hand men, both take bullets and go down.
          THE PROPHET manages to escape out a side exit during this
          gunfire-- but a stray BULLET catches him in the back as
          he flees.

          EXT. RESERVATION TEMPLE - DAY

          As he runs from the building, the PROPHET is TACKLED by a
          GUARDSMAN. He turns the man over, the Prophet's eyes are
          empty, his head lolls back.
          A BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM from nearby as a YOUNG FEMALE
          DREAD takes this in.

                         YOUNG DREAD
          They've killed him! They've
          killed the Prophet!
          Other DREADS nearby react, the CRY spreading.
          WITH THE GUARDSMAN, examining the body. The Prophet is
          already rigid... and GREEN COOLANT is spreading from an
          exit wound in his chest. A guardsman rips open his
          shirt, pokes at the wound--
          ELECTRONICS and TORN PLASTIC.
          THE GUARDSMAN's amazed, gets on his WALKIE-TALKIE.

          himself on it, his SURRIE BLOWS UP. GUNFIRE ERUPTS

          EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          Late in the afternoon. Rolling green hills, trees, a
          rural area. A white COMPACT CAR pulls up a dirt road,
          past the MAILBOX with "PETERS" painted on it.

          EXT. PETERS' HOUSE - DAY

          THE COMPACT pulls to a stop.
          GENERIC/GREER climbs out of the car. He's blandly
          handsome, in a business suit, with perfect hair that
          looks glued in place. His movements are stilted, this is
          a cheap model and he's not used to it.
          GENERIC/GREER steps onto the porch, knocks on the door.
          No answer. He tries the knob-- locked.

          INT. RENTAL AGENCY/BOOTH - DAY

          MATCH-CUT POV of PETERS' DOOR on a SENSORY PROJECTOR

          SCREEN.
          REAL GREER in a rental stim-chair, bathed in RED LIGHT.
          His face twitches slightly, as if having a bad dream.

          EXT. PETERS' HOUSE - DAY

          His voice is deep, again generic.

                         GENERIC/GREER
          Peters! It's me, Tom Greer!
          He moves along the side of the house, peers in a window--

          97.

                         CONTINUED:
          ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW - a STIM-CHAIR sits empty. Dangling
          wires, the SENSORY PROJECTOR and HARD DRIVE have been
          stolen.
          GENERIC/GREER SMASHES the window with his fist and climbs
          inside.

          INT. PETERS' HOUSE - DAY

          GENERIC/GREER moves quickly through the house--

                         GENERIC/GREER
          Peters! Are you here?!
          He tries a couple of DOORS, finds a LOCKED one, turns the
          latch-- steps leading to the basement.

          INT. PETERS' BASEMENT - DAY

          GENERIC/GREER flips a LIGHT SWITCH at the top of the
          stairs, BARE BULBS come on--
          ANGLE DOWN-- THE REAL PETERS lies at the base of the
          stairs, in her stained, torn nightgown, motionless. A
          pool of BLOOD from her head... her neck is twisted at a
          strange angle.

          INT. RENTAL AGENCY/BOOTH - DAY

          GREER winces with the shock of this.

          INT. PETERS' BASEMENT - DAY

          GENERIC/GREER hurries down the stairs to REAL PETERS.

                         GENERIC/GREER
          Oh my God, Jennifer--
          He can see her neck is broken, he can't move her. Her
          eyes are closed, lips parched, hair matted with blood
          from a gash in her scalp. Generic/Greer leans close,
          takes her pulse.
          Suddenly her eyes open. She speaks with difficulty.

                         REAL PETERS
          Who are you?

                         GENERIC/GREER
          Tom Greer. Your partner.

          How do I know--? Prove you're Greer.
          He's already dialing 9-1-1 on a CELLPHONE.

                         GENERIC/GREER
          You can't stand me, I'm old
          school, seat-of-the pants--

                         319
          Yes, I need an ambulance at
          Mountainview, there's a woman, I
          think her neck is broken--

                         (TO PETERS)
          How long have you been down here?

                         REAL PETERS
          Three days I think...

                         GENERIC/GREER

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Please, hurry...

                         (HANGS UP)
          They're on the way. Somebody's been
          using your surrogate.

                         REAL PETERS
          What?

                         GENERIC/GREER
          You-- it's been showing up to work
          every day.

                         REAL PETERS
          No, I-- the night your chopper went
          down... I woke up and somebody was
          here... I fought with him, but he
          was so strong--

                         WIPES
          Peters is getting distraught. Generic/Greer gently
          her brow.

                         GENERIC/GREER
          Ssh, relax --

           REAL PETERS (CONT'D)
          He took my memory-- the whole
          investigation. He said he was
          going to do my job for me.
          A beat. Their eyes meet as the realization hits
          Generic/Greer.

                         GENERIC/GREER

          Canter.

                         REAL PETERS
          It has to be... oh God, I'm so cold...
          She clearly had been fighting to stay alive, just to tell
          someone what happened.

          REAL PETERS (CONT'D)
          Would've been nice to meet you in
          person...
          She now closes her eyes. Greer agonizes.

                         GENERIC/GREER
          Peters, hang on, please-- it won't
          be long...
          He rises, finds an old blanket to put around her.

                         REAL PETERS
          Thirsty...

          INT. PETERS' KITCHEN - NIGHT

          GENERIC/GREER quickly fills a glass of water from the
          tap. He hears SIRENS in the distance as he hurries back
          into the basement.

          INT. PETERS' BASEMENT - NIGHT

          GENERIC/GREER kneels down to dribble water on REAL
          PETERS' partially open lips. We hear a VEHICLE ARRIVE
          outside.

                         GENERIC/GREER
          They'll be here in just a minute...
          No response. He brushes her hair back from her face--
          REAL PETERS' eyes are half-open, vacant. She's dead.
          GENERIC/GREER lets out an anguished CRY.

          ANGLE UP STAIRS - SURRIE PARAMEDICS rush down with a
          STRETCHER. They take in the sight of--
          TWO MOTIONLESS BODIES. PETERS, dead... and l ass lass
          GENERIC/GREER, kneeling over her body, head bowed, g

          TNT. RENTAL AGENCY - DAY
          REAL GREER comes out of the curtained booth in a hurry,
          moving for the door. He's talking on the phone.

                         GREER
          Who's on duty in surveillance--?
          Sanders, great, put me through--
          He's pursued by the RENTAL AGENT.

                         RENTAL AGENT
          Sir, sir, sir-- you haven't
          returned your unit--
          Greer ignores the woman, he's out of there. She calls
          after him angrily.

          RENTAL AGENT (CONT'D)
          You signed a contract!

          EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - DAY

          A handful of DREADS are storming down the street,
          SMASHING WINDOWS and bowling over any SURRIES who get in
          their way.
          A SCROLLING ELECTRONIC NEWS CRAWL on the side of a
          building: "PROPHET SHOT, REPORTED DEAD..."
          GREER is walking fast, on the phone, steering clear of
          the angry Dreads.

          It's an emergency, you need to

          Responding to a subtle BEEP in his ear,-he makes as if to
          scratch himself, opening the connection. We hear GREER'S

                         FILTERED VOICE:

                         GREER (FILTER)
          Bobby, it's Greer, I need a remote
          shutdown. You'll have the
          surrie's digital address on file,
          Agent Jennifer Peters.
          CAMERA MOVES to reveal that PETERS (the surrie) is
          holding BOBBY at GUNPOINT, a grim expression on her face.
          She doesn't realize Bobby's on the phone.

          GREER (FILTER) (CONT'D)
          Hello? Bobby, are you there?
          Bobby looks toward the special TERMINAL that displays the
          surrie serial numbers. NUMBERS are cranking through
          fast, ALL HIGHLIGHTING. Bobby looks at Peters, but
          speaks for Greer's benefit.

                         BOBBY
          Peters, have you gone insane?
          Put the gun away, what the hell
          are you trying to prove?
          PETERS ignores him, watching the TERMINAL SCREEN.
          WIDER now, we see that all the SURRIE WATCHERS have
          disconnected, they're stationary on their tracks. THE
          GLOWING MONITORS remain on, showing random scenes,
          unwatched. MOVEMENT at the elevated entrance--
          --PETERS spins and FIRES HER HANDGUN in that direction.
          The intruder retreats. We now see a couple of SURRIES
          have already been dropped here, sprawled on the staircase
          leading down, bullets in their heads.
          PETERS spins on Bobby, who's WHISPERING frantically into

                         HIS HEADSET:

                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
          She's into the entire surrie
          database, I dunno what she's--
          Peters YANKS off Bobby's headset and throws it aside.

          EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - DAY

          GREER has stopped, stunned. Then, realizing what's
          happening, he takes off at a sprint in a different
          direction. He makes another call:

          you get this message-- get off
          line, abandon your surrogate!
          You're in danger, everyone is--

          INT. MAGGIE'S SHOP - DAY

          MAGGIE is hard at work, HOT-GLUING a new head of STREAKED
          HAIR around the motionless face of a BEAUTIFUL SURROGATE.
          She glances at a small CELLPHONE, sitting on a WORK TRAY
          nearby. It FLASHES--
          CLOSE - "THOMAS GREER" scrolls on the CELLPHONE READOUT.
          MAGGIE wants to pick up, but both hands are occupied.
          She sighs, returns to her work.

          INT. FBI BUILDING/CORRIDOR - DAY

          A group of AGENTS in RIOT GEAR are gathered here, WEAPONS
          ready. One turns to see--
          STONE approaching (his surrie is operational again),
          flanked by a couple of other AGENTS.

                         RIOT AGENT
          She'll only speak with you, sir.

                         STONE

          in and take her down?

                         RIOT AGENT
          She's got a human hostage.
          Stone pauses, takes a breath.

                         STONE
          That fat ass Sanders.
          He self-consciously rubs the back of his head, where we
          now see ELECTRICAL TAPE holding shut the damaged latch.

          INT. LUXURY BUILDING/LOBBY - DAY

          GREER, face red, out of breath, is displaying his badge

          I'm sorry, you're not on his list.

                         GREER
          I wouldn't be. I'm here to arrest him.
          ARMANDO moves closer at this.

                         CLERK
          I see... do you have a warrant?

                         GREER
          Listen to me. Dr. Canter is
          committing a crime via surrogate--
          right now. If you don't cooperate
          and let me up there, you become an
          accomplice.

                         CLERK
          Without a warrant, I'm afraid I
          can't help you.
          ARMANDO takes Greer by the arm in a painful grip.

                         ARMANDO
          You're gonna have to leave, sir.
          Armando escorts Greer none too gently to the door.

                         GREER
          Ow! Easy, I'm only human.
          As Armando relaxes his grip a bit, GREER flexes his left
          arm-- then gasps and clutches his chest, as if having a
          coronary. He stumbles, falls to his knees. Armando
          bends over him--

                         ARMANDO
          Are you OK?
          Greer suddenly thrusts his hand beneath the man's jacket.
          Armando reacts, begins to struggle with Greer-- BANG BANG
          beneath his suitcoat.
          Armando's ARM SPASMS WILDLY. He takes a few steps back,
          SPARKS and HYDRAULIC FLUID coming from his chest. GREER
          is holding the man's GUN now, aimed at him.

                         ARMANDO (CONT'D)
          You asshole. I just made the last
          payment.
          GREER rises and hurries to the CLERK, points the gun at
          his head.

                         CLERK
          I'm calling the police.
          The CLERK goes stock still, he's checked out-- he's
          obviously making the call from home. Greer shoves the
          inert body aside, it falls flat. He reaches for the
          elevator key, snatches it up when--
          ARMANDO wraps his one good arm around Greer's throat from
          behind, choking him. They stagger backward, GREER aims
          the gun behind his head and FIRES, blowing a HOLE in
          Armando's forehead. GREEN COOLANT, FRIED ELECTRONICS fly
          from the exit wound.
          They topple to the ground together. GREER struggles from
          the frozen surrie's grip, clutching his ear, deafened by
          the gun's loud report.
          As Greer gets to his feet, the DOORMAN enters, takes in
          the tableau-- the gun-wielding man, the two surries on
          the ground-- and dashes outside again.
          GREER hurries for CANTER'S PRIVATE ELEVATOR. He turns
          the key-- no light, nothing. He makes a frustrated NOISE
          and dashes for a nearby door to the stairwell.

          INT. FBI BUILDING/SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY

          STONE enters warily, looking toward PETERS and the
          captive BOBBY.

                         STONE
          Peters! It's me, Andy Stone!
          Hands in the air, Stone moves down the stairs, stepping
          gingerly over the fallen surrogates.
          PETERS finishes CUFFING BOBBY'S WRISTS to a chair with
          plastic cuffs. She moves to get a look at Stone, across
          the expanse of glowing monitors. She's holstered her
          gun.

                         PETERS
          Who was it, Stone? Who was it at
          VSI that hired you to kill me?
          Stone blinks, trying to process this.

                         CONTINUED:

                         PETERS (CONT'D)
          Did you feel even a second of
          remorse, when you found out you'd
          murdered an innocent boy. He was
          eighteen!

                         STONE
          I don't believe it...

                         PETERS
          Just tell me what I need to know.
          Stone considers this a bit, smiles.

                         STONE
          We spend years trying to nail you
          for funding the Dreads-- and now
          you hand yourself over to us on a
          silver platter. Hijacking an
          agent, destroying federal
          property, creating a hostage
          situation...
          Peters pulls her gun and points it at BOBBY'S HEAD. He
          cowers in his chair.

                         STONE (CONT'D)
          I wouldn't add homicide to that
          list. As it is, you're going to
          prison for a very long time.
          He turns on his heel, begins walking back up the stairs
          for the door.
          PETERS lowers the gun, reaches into her pocket and pulls
          out the Q.D. WEAPON.

                         PETERS
          An eye for an eye...
          She points it at the back of Stone's head and--
          --STONE's eyes go wide in agony-- and EXPLODE. He goes
          TUMBLING back down the stairs, SMOKE pouring from his
          head, BODY twitching crazily.

          INT. LUXURY BUILDING/STAIRWELL - DAY

          --GREER is GASPING for breath as he reaches an upper
          landing. Ahead of him is a heavy STEEL DOOR with a
          KEYPAD LOCK. He tries the handle, kicks the door once,
          then pulls his gun and aims it at the lock, turning away
          as he SHOOTS.

                         CONTINUED:
          THE BULLET RICOCHETS about the narrow area, scaring the
          hell out of him. The LOCK is intact.

                         GREER
          Damn it!
          He moves to a NARROWER STAIRCASE with a sign, "ROOF

          ACCESS."

          INT. FBI BUILDING/SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY

          The RIOT AGENTS pour in now, GUNS FIRING.
          PETERS drops behind a bank of TERMINALS for cover.
          BULLETS rocket past, one CATCHES her in the arm, but
          barely phases her.
          THE RIOT AGENTS move in, military style, surrounding

          PETERS.
          PETERS fiddles with the O.D.--
          CLOSE - she slides back a panel, hits a couple of tiny
          SWITCHES-- the RED DIODES go to BLUE.
          PETERS points the device over the terminal, sweeps it in

                         AN ARC--
          --the RIOT AGENTS all FREEZE'IN PLACE for a second-- and
          then drop at once. Unlike with Stone, there's no
          twitching, smoke or exploding eyeballs. The sudden
          silence is eerie.
          PETERS rises and moves to STONE, the grotesque, empty-
          eyed surrogate. Her expression is grim, but she's
          accomplished an important part of her mission.
          BOBBY looks around at the many fallen bodies.

                         BOBBY
          Are they dead?

                         PETERS
          (re: the riot agents)
          They're fine.

          INT. STONE'S STUDY - DAY

          The PHONE IS RINGING. Move from it to--
          STONE, in his stim chair, projector on his head... eyes
          rolled back, dead. BLOOD begins to seep from his ears.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.

          EXT. CANTER'S BUILDING/ROOF/BALCONY - DAY

          GREER has come out on the roof. There's an enormous CELL
          TOWER and DISH up here. He moves to the edge, peers over
          warily.
          ANGLE DOWN - forty stories down to the street.
          GREER flinches back, reeling with vertigo. He moves
          along the edge, looking for something.
          ANGLE DOWN - the BALCONY outside Canter's study, just
          inside the roof overhang, a fifteen-foot drop.
          GREER squeezes his eyes shut, steeling himself for what
          he must do. He lowers himself to hang onto the edge,
          trying not to look down. He swings his body to get the
          momentum going the right way--
          --but his grip gives a moment too soon--
          GREER plunges from the roof to the BALCONY RAIL, hitting
          the railing hard, starting to fall off the wrong way.
          But he manages to grab onto the metal. He hauls himself
          up and collapses onto the balcony, lying on his back.
          HIS LEG has been injured in the fall, the pants torn,
          blood. GREER breathes audibly, in pain and exhaustion.

          INT. FBI BUILDING/SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY

          ON THE TERMINAL - numbers still HIGHLIGHTING, flying past
          at incredible speed.
          MOVE TO FIND PETERS, with an open TOOLBOX. She's
          expertly wiring the O.D. to the keyboard, cutting,
          splicing and reattaching wires.
          BOBBY wheels closer, tries to KICK the O.D.
          Without flinching, PETERS KNOCKS him back across the
          room, the chair FALLS OVER and Bobby moans.

          INT. CANTER'S PENTHOUSE/STUDY - DAY

          GREER SHOOTS THE GLASS, elbows out the shards and reaches
          in to unlock the balcony door. Keeping his gun ready, he
          limps painfully into the empty room.

          QUICK CUTS as GREER hunts for Canter, flinging open doors
          into BEDROOMS, a LIVING ROOM, BATHROOMS.

          INT. LUXURY BUILDING/LOBBY - DAY

          The CLERK, reactivated, leads a squad of UNIFORMED POLICE
          toward the stairwell.

          INT. CANTER'S PENTHOUSE/HALLWAY

          GREER has almost given up hope when he starts at a noise
          and spins, ready to shoot at--
          --the AUTOMATED VACUUM humming around a corner. As it
          moves past his feet, Greer registers--
          --a thin strip of RED LIGHT at floor level. After a
          moment, he begins rapping at the wall, realizing it's
          false.

          INT. LUXURY BUILDING/STAIRWELL - DAY

          THE CLERK taps a CODE into the KEYPAD of the bullet-
          dented door. We hear a HEAVY LATCH disengage.

          INT. CANTER'S PENTHOUSE/HALLWAY - DAY

          GREER hears FOOTSTEPS of the approaching cops as he tries
          desperately to find a way into the hidden space. He
          discovers a LATCH at waist level, the wall becomes a
          pocket door. He lets himself in and closes it behind him

                         JUST AS--
          THE POLICE and the CLERK round the corner.

          INT. CANTER'S PENTHOUSE/CONTROL AREA - DAY

          Eerie RED LIGHT, a narrow, snaking passageway. GREER
          listens as the FOOTSTEPS pass outside, turns to see--
          THE STALKER-- the hulking, silver-eyed surrogate who
          broke into Peters' place. He's inert in his CHARGING

          BAY.
          Beside him is the BOY who picked Greer up in the limo.

          WIDER, a dozen SURROGATES, different ages and sexes,
          lined up in their charging bays. Clearly, Canter can
          become anyone he wants to be.
          GREER is momentarily stunned to see--
          THE PROPHET, a spare surrogate, in a charging bay.
          GREER moves carefully onward. Around a corner, he sees--
          --a PROJECTOR DISPLAY SCREEN. It's PETERS' POV on the
          FBI SURVEILLANCE CENTER, a glance toward the motionless
          RIOT AGENTS, to BOBBY struggling on the ground. PETERS'
          POV SETTLES on the numbers HIGHLIGHTING on the terminal.
          THE 0. D. is connected to the keyboard, BLUE DIODES
          FLASH, the jerry-rigging complete.
          REAL CANTER is visible from behind in an elaborate
          prosthetic WHEELCHAIR, a SENSORY PROJECTOR on his head.
          GREER moves toward him and RIPS OFF the headgear.
          REAL CANTER opens his eyes, startled.

                         GREER
          You're insane.

          INT. FBI BUILDING/SURVEILLANCE CENTER -- DAY

          PETERS is frozen in place by the-terminal. BOBBY, on the
          ground, realizes something's happened. He strains to see
          the numbers screen.
          ON SCREEN -- THE NUMBERS have stopped scrolling. A
          dialogue box: "FULL DATABASE SELECTED - UPLOADING
          SOFTWARE TO NETWORK" with a bar moving up slowly.

          INT. CANTER'S PENTHOUSE/CONTROL AREA - DAY

          CANTER squints up at GREER from his wheelchair and brace.
          He speaks with an ELECTRONIC AID, his voice slightly
          artificial-sounding.

                         CANTER
          Jennifer Peters. Is she--

                         GREER
          She's dead.

                         CANTER
          I had no intention of hurting her.
          I'm truly sorry--

                         GREER
          Shut up!
          Greer clenches his fist, if the man wasn't in a
          wheelchair he would beat the hell out of him. Struggling
          to control himself, mind reeling:

                         GREER (CONT'D)
          How many people are you? You're
          really the Prophet?

                         CANTER
          I had to fight VSI any way I
          could.
          As canter speaks, his eyes flick toward the PROJECTOR'S

                         MONITOR--
          --the image of the O.D. DEVICE UPLOADING SOFTWARE from
          PETERS' POV. Canter tries to block Greer's view--

          There's nothing you can do--
          GREER PUSHES CANTER'S WHEELCHAIR out of the way
          violently. Greer sits on the floor, leaning against the
          wall. He takes a breath and puts on the PROJECTOR
          HEADSET. He slips on the FINGERSLEEVE, presses his
          fingers together and--

          --PETERS is suddenly REANIMATED, stumbles a bit where she
          stands, as Greer gets his bearings in this new body. He
          moves to the KEYBOARD and RIPS THE O.D. from the jerry-
          rigged connection. -

          This can really send a virus to

          me the chance to live normal lives.
          But my partners at VSI overrode me.
          They saw a much larger market--
          surrogates for everyone. Healthy
          people. Children. A world without
          risk, without pain. Without
          feelings. Nothing at stake.
          Nothing to live for.
          Greer rises shakily.

                         GREER
          What's going to happen?

                         CANTER
          The day of resurrection.
          As he speaks, he raises a small white capsule to his
          lips.

                         GREER
          No--!
          Before Greer can stop him, CANTER BITES INTO IT and
          swallows. Greer tries to get the capsule from Canter's
          mouth-- but the man is DEAD within moments.

          INT. FBI BUILDING/SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY

          BOBBY KICKS at the COMPUTER frantically, CRYING OUT. THE
          SNIPER reaches him, CUTS his HANDS free with a KNIFE.

                         HUMAN SNIPER
          It's OK, sir, you're alright, it's

                         OVER--
          Freed, Bobby lunges at the keyboard, hitting keys in a
          frenzy, but--
          ON SCREEN - "DISCONNECTING" changes to "OPERATORS
          DISCONNECTED..." Then, quickly-- "TRANSMITTING."

          EXT. RESERVATION NO MAN'S LAND - DAY

          LATE AFTERNOON, golden light. DREADS have been herded
          together here, NATIONAL GUARDSMEN surrounding them.
          Suddenly the GUARDSMEN all DROP at once.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          114.

          EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - DAY

          CROWDED, rush hour, lots of traffic and noise. Then--
          --PEDESTRIANS fall in a wave. CARS VEER out of control,
          SMASHING INTO EACH OTHER, careening onto the sidewalk,
          rolling over fallen surrie bodies and SMASHING into
          storefronts.

          INT. FBI BUILDING/BULLPEN - DAY

          THE FEDS are all collapsed over desks, or sprawled flat.

          INT. SUBWAY - DAY

          A CAR FULL OF COMMUTERS-- some slumped in their seats or
          hanging from straps, others lying on the floor. The car
          STOPS AUTOMATICALLY, the DOORS OPEN with a HISS--
          --to reveal a PLATFORM littered with BODIES.

          INT. MAGGIE'S SHOP - DAY

          ALL EMPLOYEES and CUSTOMERS of the beauty shop are
          motionless. CAMERA FINDS MAGGIE on the floor among them,
          staring sightlessly at the ceiling.

          EXT. LUXURY BUILDING/BALCONY - DAY

          ANGLE DOWN on the suddenly quiet street. The surries
          have dropped throughout the city.
          PULL BACK to reveal GREER looking down on this. He limps
          quickly back inside--

          INT. CANTER'S PENTHOUSE/STUDY - DAY

          --stepping over the BODIES of the FALLEN COPS. He moves
          for the ELEVATOR, hits a SWITCH to POWER it up.

          EXT. RESERVATION NO MAN'S LAND - DAY

          The moment the Dreads have been waiting for. With a mass
          CRY, they're charging over the fallen BODIES of the
          GUARDSMEN and over the flattened fences.
          WIDE as THOUSANDS OF DREADS run out of the reservation
          into the streets of the city.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          115.

          EXT. WASHINGTON STREETS - DAY

          GREER hobbles through the dreadful aftermath-- SMOKING
          AUTO PILEUPS, BODIES everywhere, most fallen in their
          tracks, a few remain on their feet. CAR HORNS, ALARMS in
          the distance. -
          A few disheveled DREADS are here, taking it in with
          delight and amazement. They WHOOP as they TIP OVER a
          couple of the standing surries.
          GREER passes a CAR on the sidewalk, its DRIVER slumped
          against the wheel-- the RADIO BLARES:

                         RADIO VOICE
          The massive surrogate shutdown
          appears to be nationwide...

          EXT. VSI HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          FALLEN SURRIES all over the grounds. ARMED DREADS are
          rushing into the place, past the MOTIONLESS SENTRIES.
          They're making for the factory.

                         RADIO VOICE
          Rioters presumed to be members of
          the Human Coalition seem to be
          making coordinated attacks on

                         SURROGATE-RELATED BUSINESSES
          across the country...

          INT. VSI FACTORY - DAY

          The ROBOTIC ASSEMBLY LINE, still running until--
          BOOM! A DREAD shoots an RPG into the machinery.
          SURROGATE PARTS are BLASTED in all directions.

          INT. VSI WAREHOUSE - DAY

          FIRE SPREADS across the rows of SURROGATE TEMPLATES,
          packed together tightly.
          CLOSE on a MELTING FACE, the deforming PLASTIC SKULL and
          ELECTRONICS within.

                         RADIO VOICE
          Citizens are asked to remain in
          their homes...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          116.

          EXT. GREER'S BUILDING - DAY

          GREER makes his way toward his place.

          INT. GREER'S APARTMENT/LIVING ROOM - DAY

          GREER enters, moves immediately for his wife's bedroom.

                         GREER
          Maggie--?
          He KNOCKS gently, then tries the door-- it isn't locked.

          INT. GREER'S APARTMENT/MAGGIE'S ROOM - DAY

          The room is DIM, there's a FORM huddled in the bed,
          SOBBING, covers pulled up. GREER moves slowly toward
          her, speaks in a soothing voice.

                         GREER
          Maggie, it's me.
          She pulls away from his touch at first, struggles.

                         MAGGIE
          No! Please no, don't look at me...
          Greer pulls away the covers to reveal the REAL MAGGIE.
          She's pale, emaciated and malnourished, tears running
          down her face. She shrinks away from him.

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          No Tom, I don't want you to...
          It doesn't matter to Greer-- he takes her in his arms and
          holds her close.

                         GREER
          It's OK, it's OK...

                         MAGGIE
          No it's not...

                         GREER
          Ssh. It's just us now.
          Slowly, she puts her arms around him, weeping against his
          chest. PULL BACK and--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          117.

          EXT. GREER'S BUILDING/NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

          --OUT THE WINDOW. MOVE to show exterior DOORS OPENING
          and GREER'S NEIGHBORS EMERGING, blinking in the
          unfamiliar sunlight. Most wear robes, sweatclothes.
          They're all ages, some overweight, others homely-- it's
          almost a relief after all the young, perfect people.
          DOWN THE STREET, OTHERS EMERGE, regard each other warily,
          like people after an earthquake. Some begin speaking to
          each other for the first time, in whispers at first,
          others take in the SUNSET which bathes the neighborhood
          in orange light.

          FADE TO BLACK.

                             TERMINATOR



A1      TITLE SEQUENCE - SLITSCAN EFFECT                       A1

1       EXT. SCHOOLYARD - NIGHT                                1

        Silence.  Gradually the sound of distant traffic becomes
        audible.  A LOW ANGLE bounded on one side by a chain-link
        fence and on the other by the one-story public school build-
        ings.  Spray-can hieroglyphics and distant streetlight sha-
        dows.  This is a Los Angeles public school in a blue collar
        neighborhood.

        ANGLE BETWEEN SCHOOL BUILDINGS, where a trash dumpster looms
        in a LOW ANGLE, part of the clutter behind the gymnasium.
        A CAT enters FRAME.  CAMERA DOLLIES FORWARD, prowling with
        him through the landscape of trash receptacles and shadows.

        CLOSE ON CAT, which freezes, alert, sensing something just
        beyond human perception.

        A sourceless wind rises, and with it a keening WHINE.
        Papers blow across the pavement.
        The cat YOWLS and hides under the dumpster.
        Windows rattle in their frames.
        The WHINE intensifies, accompanied now by a wash of frigid
        PURPLE LIGHT.  A CONCUSSION like a thunderclap right over-
        head blows in all the windows facing the yard.

        C.U. - CAT, its eyes are wide as the glare dies.


1A/FX   ANGLE - DUMPSTER                                       1A/FX

        ELECTRICAL DISCHARGES arc from the dumpster to a water
        faucet and climb a drain pipe like a Jacob's Ladder.

                                              CUT TO:


2       EXT. SCHOOLYARD - NIGHT                                2

        SLOW PAN as the sound of stray electrical CRACKLING subsides.
        FRAME comes to rest on the figure of a NAKED MAN kneeling,
        faced away, in the previously empty yard.
        He stands, slowly.
        The man is in his late thirties, tall and powerfully built,
        moving with graceful precision.

        C.U. - MAN, his facial features reiterate the power of his
        body and are dominated by the eyes, which are intense, blue
        and depthless.  His hair is military short.

        This man is the TERMINATOR.

        He glances down, taking calm inventory of himself, and
        notices that a fine white ash covers his skin.  He brushes
        at it unconcernedly as he walks toward the fence, scanning
        his surroundings.

                                              CUT TO:


2A/FX   CRANE SHOT - SCHOOLYARD/CITY - NIGHT                   2A/FX

        CAMERA MOVES UP as Terminator approaches the schoolyard fence
        beyond which is an embankment rolling down in darkness to the
        cityscape below.  The school is perched at the edge of a pro-
        montory offering a respectable view of the urban sprawl teem-
        ing and glistening under a sullen sky.  The night clouds are
        shot through with occasional flashes of LIGHTNING, presaging
        a thunderstorm.

        Terminator stands, hands on hips in prefect symmetry, gazing
        down at the city as the CAMERA REACHES FULL HEIGHT.

                                              CUT TO:


3       EXT. PLAYGROUND - NIGHT                               3

        A beer bottle SMASHES on the ground.  PULL BACK to include
        its ex-owner and his two compatriots, YOUTH GANG MEMBERS,
        lounging on the jungle gym of a deserted playground.  They
        sport nondescript PUNK REGALIA...torn T-shirts, fatigue
        pants, combat boots or high-top sneakers, leather jackets.

        The leader notices something and sits up.

                                LEADER
                           (pointing)
                     Hey, hey...what's wrong with
                     this picture?

        ANGLE - REVERSE, seen past the lounging toughs, Terminator
        walks naked into a pool of streetlight, striding purpose-
        fully toward them.

        ANGLE - OVER TERMINATOR'S SHOULDER, as he approaches them.
        They slide from their perches and drop easily to the ground
        liquid shadows.

                                LEADER
                     Nice night for a walk, eh?

        Terminator stops right in front of them.

                                TERMINATOR
                           (without inflec-
                           tion)
                      Nice night for a walk.

        They surround him, all swagger and malign good humor.

                                SECOND PUNK
                      Washday tomorrow, huh?  Nothing
                      clean, right?

        Terminator eyes them without expression, unhurried.
        Reptilian.

                                TERMINATOR
                      Nothing clean.  Right.

                                LEADER
                      This guy's a couple bricks
                      short.

        Terminator turn to the second punk, ignoring the
        others.

                                TERMINATOR
                      Your clothes.  Give them to me.

        The punks exchange glances, dismayed.

                                TERMINATOR
                           (coldly)
                      Now.

                                SECOND PUNK
                           (bracing)
                      Fuck you, asshole.


        Without warning Terminator hammer-punches him in the temple
        with blinding speed.  The blow flings him with a CLANG into
        the jungle gym.  He drops to the ground in a still heap,
        eyes open, twitching.

        The leader whips out his SWITCHBLADE and slashes in one
        motion.  Terminator ducks back and catches the knife-
        wielder's wrist in an inhuman grip.  Then he punches the
        leader with piledriver force just below the breastbone.

        ANGLE - PAVEMENT, as the knife clatters down.  The punk's
        combat boots are on tiptoe, barely touching the ground.

        ANGLE - TWO SHOT, Terminator and the leader are close
        together as if dancing, but motionless.  Their bodies are in
        total shadow.  The punk's eyes are wide, his veins distended
        with an agonizing pressure.  Terminator jerks his fist back
        with a WET SOUND and the other drops OUT OF FRAME.

        The last tough is stumbling away, gaping with terror.  He
        backs into a chainlink fence, turns to run along it, finds
        he is in a corner.

        Terminator takes a step toward him, his gaze ominous.

        The punk begins shakily stripping off his clothes.
        Thunder peals overhead.

                                               CUT TO:

4       EXT. STREET/NEARBY - NIGHT                             4

        A light RAIN begins to fall.
        Terminator emerges onto the street from the playground,
        pausing in the pool of light under a streetlight to hike
        the collar of the punk's jacket.
               The rain streams down over his face, running into
        and over his eyes.  They do not blink.

                                               CUT TO:

5       EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET/ALLEY - NIGHT                     5

        Another part of the city.  Seedy apartments and storefronts.
        The streets glisten, hissing with sporadic late night traffic.
        SLOW PAN AND DOLLY into the mouth of a narrow alley lined
        with trash containers and fire escapes.  From a recessed
        doorway, two filthy legs sprawl out onto the wet pavement.
        An angry, inarticulate DRUNKARD'S MONOLOGUE rises occasionally
        above the rain sounds.

        ANGLE - DOORWAY,  The derelict rouses from his bitter stupor
        as a brilliant purple glare lights up the wet brickwork
        around him.  A shockwave hurls trash into the air.
        Painted over windows shatter.
        Rat scurry, blinded.

        A FIGURE drops INTO FRAME as if out of the sky and smacks
        the pavement with a muddy splash.

        C.U. - DERELICT, as he blinks at the fading glare, amazed.

        A NAKED MAN, compact and muscular, rises in a defensive
        crouch.  KYLE REESE is 22, but his face has been aged by
        ordeal, the mouth hard, eyes grim.  A crinkled burn scar
        traverses one side of his face from chin to forehead.  Other
        scars, from burns and bullets, mar his hard-muscled body.

        The rain washes a fine coating of white ash from his skin
        as electrical ARCS lace back and forth between the fire
        escapes behind him, HISSING and SPUTTERING.  The sound
        fades, then stops altogether, to be replaced by a rising
        scream of animal agony.

        Reese lurches to his feet and sprints across the alley.

                                               CUT TO:

7       EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT                               7

        CAMERA MOVES WITH REESE as he leaps to the fire escape and
        clambers up to the first landing to crouch beside another
        NAKED MAN who appears to be entangled in the ironwork.  The
        man is contorted with pain as his screams die to a shivering
        gasp.  CLOSER ANGLE reveals that he has been skewered through
        the abdomen by the horizontal iron slats and through the
        shoulder by a railing.  He has materialized in the same
        space occupied by the fire escape structure.  The figure
        slumps, motionless.

        Reese quickly checks for signs of life.  The man is dead.

        Reese descend to the alley floor and crosses to the drunk
        huddled in the doorway.

        A pair of flamboyantly dressed women, obviously working
        girls, passes by the alley mouth.  They do a double take
        when they see Reese, but walk on without breaking stride,
        completely jaded.  He's certainly not a potential customer.

        Reese crouches down as if to speak to the drunk.

                                DERELICT
                      Say, buddy...did you see a
                      real bright light?

8       EXT. ALLEY/SAME - NIGHT                                8

        A brilliant white glare stabs into the alley mouth as an
        LAPD cruiser glides slowly by on the street.  The search-
        light illuminates the figure of Reese, crouching over the
        sprawled drunk, just pulling on the other's trousers.

        The cruiser chirps to a stop.  The doors fly open and two
        cops leap out.

                                FIRST COP
                      Hold it, right there!

        Reese hitches his pants and bolt like a shot.  The cops
        draw their guns and race into the alley after him.

        HANDHELD CAMERA or PANAGLIDE, rushing with Reese along the
        narrow alley.  He vaults a pile of tumbled trashcans.
        Whips around a corner.  Leaps the hood of a parked car in
        the cross alley.

        PANAGLIDE PRECEDING COPS, as they snake through the night
        maze.

        incredible agility.

        REESE'S POV, the alley walls blur by.  The view of a hot-
        wired rat in an urban maze.

        C.U. - REESE, CAMERA hugging him as he sprints and turns,
        alternately front-lit, side-lit and silhouetted as the
        electric glare of the city wheels about him.

        ANGLE - ALLEY MOUTH, Reese flashes though intermittent
        cross-lighting in the B.G.

        Another unit arrives out front and Reese melts back into
        the alley, only to see a cop round the corner behind him.
        Sandwiched.  Reese crashes into a steel door, rending the
        lock, and vanishes into the darkness within.

        The newly arrived cops are a K-9 unit.  They open the back
        door of the squad car to release a large black Doberman.

12      INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT                          12

        Reese finds himself among the display racks of a discount
        department store.  A searchlight stabs in the front
        window as he dashes into the maze of aisles.

        Three cops enter behind him through the shattered door.

        FAST PANAGLIDE WITH REESE, as he crab-runs low among the
        moving shadows where flashlights quarter the darkness.  He
        bolts the open space behind a display window.  Sees the
        outside searchlight sweep toward him.  Freezes.

        ANGLE - REESE, his feral face frozen among the smooth-
        featured, smiling mannequins.  As the light passes, Reese
        silently moves on.

        ANGLE - COP, passing the end of a long aisle B.G. while in
        the F.G. a hand ENTERS FRAME, removing a knit shirt from a
        hanger.  Reese slips the shirt on quietly and does a fast
        crab-walk across the aisles to melt into the other racks
        and shadows, CAMERA MOVING LOW with him.

        With a shocking GROWL the police dog hurtles out of the
        shadows, LEAPING RIGHT AT CAMERA.

        ANGLE - REESE AND DOG, a dark blur with teeth, extremely
        Doberman, flies toward Reese.  He spins.  Catches it by
        the throat in mid-air. Arcs it to the floor with unflinching
        precision.

        C.U. - DOBERMAN, suddenly on its back and held by the throat,
        THE DOG YELPS and stares at Reese, who leans very close.
        Inches from its eyes he fixes it with a gaze of uncompromis-
        ing dominance.  Some ancient communication seems to pass
        between the two.

        Reese releases the animal and turns his back on it, selecting
        a long overcoat from a rack.  The dog backs away from him,
        stiff-legged and confused.

        TRACKING WITH REESE as he rounds a corner on the run, still
        shrugging into his long coat.
        Running smack at him is another cop, gun aimed.

        Without slowing, Reese leaps toward him, twisting in mid-air
        like a cat.  The cop FIRES. Misses.  Goes down under Reese's
        tackle and they slide together on the polished floor.

        Before they even come to rest Reese snatches the cop's gun,
        aiming it at the other's face two-handed.

                                REESE
                      What day is it?  The date...

                      What year?

        A SHOT whines off the metal side of an escalator behind
        Reese's head.  He vaults the escalator rail, leaving the
        amazed cop lying on the floor.

        Reese bounds up the frozen steps, pocketing the .38 Police
        Special in his coat.

        Cops dash through the maze of aisles, converging at the
        escalators.

        He stops for a moment beside a rack of shoes.  Slaps one of
        a pair of tennis shoes sole-to-sole against his bare foot.
        Too small.  Another.  Holding the shoes he runs on.

        Reese drops cat-like beside the unattended police car.
        Cautiously, he opens the door of the cruiser, removes the
        RIOT GUN, an Ithaca pump model, from the dash rack and slips
        it under his coat.  Cradled in a vertical position, the
        shortened weapon is virtually invisible.

        He walks out onto the street and away,  unhurriedly, an
        innocuous pedestrian soon lost in the rain.

        his face, outlining the long scar.  He opens the directory,
        leafs through it.

        ANGLE - MACRO ON PAGE, Reese's finger slides down a column.
        Stops beside the following listings in the big metropolitan

        SARAH CONNER is 19, small and delicate-featured.  Pretty in
        a flawed, accessible way. She doesn't stop the party when
        she walks in, but you'd like to get to know her.  Her vulner-
        able quality masks a strength even she doesn't know exists.

        Sarah maneuvers nimbly, apparently in a hurry.

        Sarah removes a stack of college textbooks from the luggage
        carrier and tuns to go into the restaurant.

                      Thanks, Chuck.  I need the

                      hours around my classes?

        Breen turns to punch up a display on the restaurant's
        small accounting computer.  Sarah looks over his shoulder
        as he modifies the week's schedule.

                                BREEN
                      Mmm.  Same schedule's okay.

        He indicates the display case and wall racks with a
        minimal gesture.

                      You know your weapons, buddy.

        Terminator examines each in turn, working the actions with
        curt, precise movements.

                                CLERK
                           (continuing)

                      All.

        The clerk digs deep and finds a scrap of a smile.

                                CLERK
                      Maybe I'll close early.
                      Cash or charge?

        Instead of replying, Terminator takes a box of shotgun shells
        from a stack on the display case.

                                CLERK
                      Sorry, I can't sell the ammo
                      with the guns.  You'll have
                      to---Hey!

        Terminator has calmly begun feeding the shells into the
        shotgun.

                      Wrong.

        He raises the barrel and pulls the trigger.  The gun THUNDERS.

        The yellow Maverick pulls to a stop beside a single phone
        booth.

        MOVING WITH TERMINATOR, as he gets out, walks to the booth
        and rapidly pulls its occupant out by his greasy T-shirt,
        flinging him backward into the parking lot.  The guy is
        bear-like, slab-handed, but Terminator doesn't even glance
        back as he steps in to take the man's place.

32      INT. BIG BOB'S/DINING AREA

        Sarah is bustling about, trying to service the start of
        the dinner rush.  In waitress parlance, she's 'in it'.
        She runs the gauntlet between tables, precariously balancing
        two full dinner plates on one arm and hand-carrying a
        third.  A customer tugs on her apron for attention and she
        barely averts contributing the chili size to his wardrobe.

                                CUSTOMER
                      Honey, can I get that coffee
                      now?

                                SARAH
                      Yes sir, just a second.

        She reaches her table after near collisions with a Mexican
        busboy and two teenage girls doing cheerleading routines
        in lock-step.

                                SARAH
                      Who gets the Burly Burger?

                                CUSTOMER TWO
                      I ordered Barbecue Beef.

                                CUSTOMER THREE
                      Does mine come with fires?

                                CUSTOMER FOUR
                      He's got the Barbecue Beef,
                      I've got a Chili-Beef Deluxe.

                                SARAH
                      Okay, who gets the Burly Beef?

                                CUSTOMER AT NEXT TABLE
                      Miss, we're ready to order.


        In the process of setting down all the plates Sarah knocks
        over someone's water glass.

                      leather, is it?

        As she cleans up the spill, a kid at the next booth reaches
        over and dumps a scoop of ice cream into the top pouch of
        Sarah's apron

        She stares down at the mess melting over her hard-earned
        and sags with defeat.  NANCY, a plump, gum-chewing waitress,
        stops beside her to whisper.

                                NANCY
                      Look at it this way: in a

        LOW ANGLE with the FRAME comprising a single house, toy-
        littered lawn and mailbox.  EXTREME F.G., by the curb, is
        a CHILD'S PLASTIC TRUCK.

        There is the sound of a CAR ENGINE approaching, and the
        front of the yellow Maverick appears, stopping at the curb.
        Its front tire  CRUSHES the toy.

        PANAGLIDE ON TERMINATOR, preceding him as he steps out of the
        car, pauses by the mailbox to check the name, and strides
        toward the house.

        A YOUNG BOY, playing in the driveway, watches him pass.  The
        boy's DOG, a small Terrier, growls low and mean, crouching
        back from Terminator.

        He rings the doorbell and waits, motionless.
        The door opens a few inches, held by a security chain,
        revealing a frail MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN in apron and rubber
        cleaning gloves.

        She gasps and stops in her tracks as Terminator smoothly
        pulls the .45 from under his jacket and snaps the cocking
        slide.

                      What is it, Mom?

        She jumps as the door BANGS open.  And stares in dumb
        amazement as the good-looking, intense-eyed man in the
        strange clothes raises a pistol.

        And aims it at her face.

        It all seems less real than "GENERAL HOSPITAL" in that
        half-second before he FIRES.

        the SHOT.  The silence stretches for several BEATS.  Then
        FIVE MORE SHOTS are heard.

        down at the dead woman, just OUT OF FRAME on the floor.
        He unhurriedly removes the spent clip, reloads the weapon
        and replaces it under his jacket.

        Crouching down, he turns the woman's body over, confirming
        that she is dead.

        Terminator stands at the head of the stairs.
        His hand is bloody where he grasped the dead woman's
        shoulder.

        He starts down the stairs.
        The mother stands paralyzed, unable to breathe.
        He reaches the main floor and walks toward her.
        She edges into a corner, eyes wide.
        He reaches out.

        And wipes his hands clean on her apron.

        Terminator walks out, without expression, leaving the
        woman to sag to the floor in a faint.

        strokes with a hacksaw to sever the wooden stock from
        the riot gun.  It clatters to the ground, leaving a short
        stump, like a pistol grip.

        CUT WIDER as Reese hefts the weapon.  He is crouched in
        an underground service tunnel below a busy street.  Shadows
        of people walking across a grating in the sidewalk above
        him flicker past.  They can't see him in the darkness below
        their feet as he checks the gun's action carefully.  He
        slips it under his overcoat where it hangs from a jerry-
        rigged sling.

        his overcoat done up to the top button.
        He walks through the sparse morning crowd on the cluttered,
        overbuilt commercial street.
        He is out of sync.
        A stranger in a strange land.
        He holds himself tightly reined, cautious and feral as he
        moves among the unconcerned pedestrians.
        His eyes flick rapidly about.
        He is seeing this Babylon for the first time.

        Reese stops at a hole-in-the-wall take-out stand.  He
        watches people walk away with food.  Moves closer.
        Scrutinizes the next man as he orders.

                      That'll be one-sixty.

        He glances up and Reese is gone.  He leans half out the

        As the news grinds on, Sarah gazes unseeingly at the screen.
        Nancy claps her on the shoulder, laughing.

                                NANCY
                      You're dead, honey.

        Sunlight is dying when Sarah swings her moped to the curb
        in front of the 'GOOD LIFE SPA', a large, crowded health
        club.

        MUSIC BOOMS and masses of leotarded cellulite sway in close
        F.G. as CAMERA DOLLIES along a row of panting, stretching
        women.  In deep B.G. Sarah slips in through the door and
        waits against the wall while the human dynamo, GINGER VENTURA,
        leads the class energetically.  Ginger, Sarah's roommate,
        is a party-stopper.  Red-haired, athletic, sensuous.  She's
        pretty enough when still, but stunning in motion.  And she's
        in motion.

        Ginger yells commands and cheerfully dives into contortions
        to the BEAT of a MOTOWN FAVORITE.
        MARCO, a handsome, well-defined guy wearing a tight STAFF
        T-shirt, strolls up for a drink at the water fountain next
        to Sarah.

                                MARCO
                      Hi. I've seen you around.
                      You're cute.  Cute I remember.

                                SARAH
                      I'm Sarah.  Ginger's roommate.

                                MARCO
                      Yeah, right.  I'm Marco.

        The dance tape ends.

                                GINGER
                      ...and three aaand four!  And
                      that's it ladies!  Now, didn't
                      that feel good?

        The group collapses ensemble.  A chorus of groans.

                                GINGER
                      Let's think positive or next
                      time I'll play the FM version.

        Ginger walks over to Sarah as the class disperses.  Marco
        is leaning on the wall next to Sarah, who is enjoying the
        attention.

                                SARAH
                      ...yeah, really?  Say some-
                      thing in Italian.

        Before Marco can reply, Ginger pulls the front of his gym
        shorts out and peers down.  She shakes her head.

                                GINGER
                      You're wasting your time, kiddo.
                      Let's go.

        She grabs Sarah by the arm and pulls her out the door.
        Sarah catches a glimpse of Marco's expression over her
        shoulder as the door closes.

        floor and enter a hallway
        Sarah is gasping with laughter.

                                SARAH
                           (weakly)
                      I don't believe you did that.

        Ginger is adjusting her ever-present WALKMAN-TYPE CASSETTE
        PLAYER at her hip.  She slips on the earphones as they walk
        along.
        Sarah feigns outrage.

                                SARAH
                           (continuing)
                      I had him hooked.  He was
                      just about to ask me out.
                      I could tell.

                                GINGER
                      That guy's a jerk.  I did
                      you a favor.

                                SARAH
                      I'll do the same for you
                      sometime.

        SEVERAL ANGLES, on glistening arms, legs, torsos merging
        into bio-mechanical kinetic sculptures with the chrome-steel
        levers and tubes.  The CRASH and SQUEAL of metal against
        metal.

        In F.G., two Conan-esque arms thrust upward, glistening.
        Ginger's boyfriend, MATT McCALLISTER, the assistant manager
        of the club, strains out his last reps, bench-pressing
        enormous weight on the Nautilus machine.
        Despite his imposing appearance, Matt is one of the warmest
        people you'd ever want to meet.
        His face is contorted, muscles knotted for the last push.
        He heaves it up with a guttural cry.
        Lowering his weights with a CLANG, Matt lies panting, arms
        dangling at his side, eyes closed.
        A pair of female legs appear.

                                GINGER (V.O.)
                           What's this? Sleep therapy?

        Matt opens his eyes.

                                GINGER
                           (continuing)
                      You think somebody's gonna
                      do this for you?  Look at
                      those shriveled bi's.  And
                      you haven't worked lat's or
                      ab's since Wednesday.

                                MATT
                           (smiling)
                      Hello, sweetheart.  Had a
                      rough day?

                           (softening)
                      Come here, wimp.

        She leans down as he sits up and they meet in a kiss that's
        bad for the other guys' discipline.

        Sarah waits until they break the clinch to speak.

                                SARAH
                      Hi, Matt.

        Matt look backwards over the bench, and replies, upside-down.

                                MATT
                           (grinning broadly)
                      Heeey!  It's my favorite
                      Sarah.  Hi, babe.

        Ginger pulls the pin on Mat's weights and re-inserts it
        beneath the entire stack, the maximum weight.

                                GINGER
                      Alright, warm-ups are over.
                      Back to work, Bunky.

        Ginger readadjusts her headphones as the two girls walk away.

                                MATT
                      'Bye beautiful.  You too,
                      Ginger.

        Two weightlifters nearby look at each other, than at Matt.

        spilling Ginger who is attempting to ride double.  They
        swing out onto a main thoroughfare and careen through
        the bumper-to-bumper traffic.
        Sarah maneuvers deftly though overloaded and unstable.
        Ginger doesn't know whether to laugh of scream at the
        near-misses.

        On a side street the girls pass an excavation site  between
        high-rises.  They pass OUT OF FRAME as CAMERA HOLDS on the
        construction area and Ginger's shrieks fade.

        In the F.G., under an overpass, Reese sits is a car watching
        the powerful machines moving earth.
        He's in a late-model non-descript GREY SEDAN, one of a row
        of cars gathering dirt beside the construction site.
        Crab-armed back-hoes and massive caterpillars ROAR through
        a curtain of dust, under intense floodlights.  A power-shovel
        moves its great arm, lighting its own way with an arc-light.

        Reese sits motionless in the dark.  Waiting.  The clock in
        the dash ticks quietly.
        He flips on the radio.  A fatuous POP ROCK STATION.
        Reese fishes a magazine off the dirty floor.  His over-
        coat is off, draped over the shotgun on the seat beside
        him.
        His bare arms are sinewy and scarred.

        Reese flips the page of COSMOPOLITAN.
        He look at the glossy photos, the glossy women.
        Fantasy women.  Svelte and seamless.
        The ads fascinate him too: Caribbean vacations and blended
        whiskeys.
        His head sags against the door.
        He gazes dully at the tracks of a passing CATERPILLAR as they
        chew through the dirt.
        The ROAD and CLATTER of treads intensifies as his eyes close.

        TIGHT ON A GLEAMING STEEL TREAD as it grinds through debris.
        The debris is ferroconcrete, girders, and jackstraw heaps of
        HUMAN BONES, burned black.

        There is the sound of EXPLOSIONS, distant, and an intermittent
        electronic WHINE.  Incredibly bright searchlights play over
        the ground.  PANNING with the moving treads through twisted
        wreckage, F.G.
        The screen WHITES OUT with a BLAST, very close.  As the
        debris clatters down, a helmetted head snaps up into FRAME,
        EXTREME F.G.

        The visor of the HIGH-TECH HELMET is shattered, presumably
        by the explosion.  The wearer rips it off, revealing a
        younger Reese, minus his burn scar.
        His face is bathed in sweat, lit by the glow from a CRT
        SCOPE-SIGHT on a strange-looking rifle.
        The sound of SCREAMS and HOARSE SHOUTS not far off, and a
        continuous low murmuring of RADIO CHATTER, grid coordinates,
        casualties, unit placements, medic requests.

        Reese looks over his shoulder at his teammate, a GIRL
        of about sixteen, gaunt, dirty, heavily armed like himself.
        DOLLYING as they start to belly crawl through the bones
        and wreckage.
        Reese looks up.
        Through spires of a collapsed building a terrifying
        SPHINX-LIKE SHAPE moves against the sky...obscured by dust
        and blinding sweeps of its searchlights.
        Though we see little, this is an H-K,Hunter-Killer
        mobile ground-unit.

        Reese crawls, pacing the H-K, under and through, on elbows
        and knees, past mounds of charred skulls.  They
        pass the BODY OF A CHILD, a boy of about 10, center-
        punched with a smoking hole.  The boy clutches a rifle.
        More bodies.  Some in rags, some in uniforms like theirs.
        WOMEN. OLD MEN. CHILDREN.  They're all dirty and gaunt,
        scabrous.  And still bleeding.  Reese scrabbles past a
        dark rat-hole and there are human rats in it.  Some of them
        are sobbing, or screaming.

        Another EXPLOSION.
        The GLARE lights the huddled few.
        Human vermin with mud-caked weapons that haven't been
        invented yet.  Soldiers in a nightmare war.

        Reese and his teammate stop behind a blasted wall, having
        outflanked the massive H-K.  Its flashing blue lights flick
        across the walls, its searchlights sear through the
        debris.

        WIDER, showing the H-K more clearly...a blast-scarred
        CHROME LEVIATHON, with hydraulic arms folded mantis-like
        against its 'torso', and huge underslung GUN TURRETS.

        Reese leaps up and straight-arms a satchel-charge into its
        path.  One tread rolls over the explosive.
        Guns and searchlights swivel.  The head turns ponderously.
        Reese's partner rises, poised to throw hers.
        A POWER-BOLT catches her at the top of her arc, BLOWING
        HER INTO RED MIST.

        Reese is knocked down by the concussion.  Gets up, running,
        as the charges blow.
        The H-K's tread carriers are RIPPED APART.
        It lurches to a stop, burning.

        The following SEQUENCE is extremely FORESHORTENED.
        CUT FAST.  IMPRESSIONS ONLY.
        Running.
        Explosions light the ruins like flashbulbs.
        ENERGY WEAPONS criss-cross the night like tracers.
        LOW ANGLE, up past the burning H-K as its flying counter-
        part, an AERIAL H-K, arcs into view with a TURBOJET WHINE.

        Reese hauls two survivors of his unit into a PERSONNEL
        CARRIER, a CHEVY CAMARO with steel plate welded over it and
        the roof cut away to access the 50 CALIBER MACHINE GUN.
        It's stripped and rusted and bullet-riddled, glassless.
        The TIRES are OFF-ROAD and very gnarly.

        They're driving through the ruins, up and over and through.
        Reese drives like a demon.  Under other circumstances it
        would be considered insane.  Here it is merely very good.

        The machine gun CHATTERS.
        A BLACK SHAPE descends, a demon with searchlights.
        A BOLT OF LIGHT.

        Reese's car flips like a kicked beer can, rolling and
        crumpling.  He's pinned in the wreck, bloody, screaming
        despite his training.  The only other survivor, an
        emaciated BOY of twelve, is pulling for all he's worth
        to drag Reese out before it burns.

        Reese quivers with a curious spasm, similar to the tremors
        of his arrival, and blinks at the boy.

        The boy is white-faced, staring down the bore.  He backs

                           phone)
                      Hello?

                                VOICE (V.O.)
                           (on phone, deep
                           and breathy)
                      First I'm going to rip the
                      buttons off your blouse, one
                      by one...then run my tongue
                      along your neck, down to your
                      bare, gleaming breasts...

        Sarah cups her hand over the mouthpiece and calls out
        matter-of-factly:

                                SARAH
                      Ginger!  It's Matt.

        She resumes listening.

                                MATT (V.O.)
                      ...and then slowly pull your
                      jeans off inch by inch and
                      lick your belly in circles,
                      further and further down...
                      then I'll pull off your panties
                      with my teeth...

        Sarah is repressing laughter.

                                SARAH
                           (crossly)
                      Who is this?

        Silence.  Then Matt realizes to his horror who he's been
        talking to.

                                MATT (V.O.)
                      Oh my God!  Sarah!  Oh, shit.
                      Jesus, I'm sorry.  I thought
                      you were...Can I talk to Ginger?

                                SARAH
                      Sure, Bunky.

        As Ginger approaches, Sarah hands her the receiver and
        goes into the bedroom.

                                GINGER
                      Hello?

                                MATT (V.O.)
                      First I'm gonna rip the buttons
                      off your blouse...

        Sarah picks up four blouses on hanger lying on the bed
        and goes back into the hallway.

        Ginger is still listening to Matt, nodding, as Sarah enters
        and starts holding the blouses against herself one by one
        for Ginger's inspection.

                                SARAH
                      What do you think?

        Sarah hold up another one.

                                SARAH
                      How about this?

                                GINGER
                      Great.

                                SARAH
                      You're a big help.

                                GINGER
                           (advisory tone)
                      Alright, the beige one.

                                SARAH
                      I hate the beige one.

                                GINGER
                           (same advisory
                           tone)
                      Don't wear the beige one.

        Sarah gathers up the blouses and walks out.

                                SARAH (V.O.)
                      This guy's probably a schmuck
                      and I don't care what I wear.

        A couple of BEATS, and she's back in the doorway with
        a concerned expression.

                                SARAH
                           (continuing)
                      You think the beige?

56      EXT. VENICE STREET - NIGHT

        An unmarked car with a clamp-on light and siren blaring
        screeches to the curb behind two marked black-and-whites
        in front of a funky Venice apartment building.  A small
        crowd  is gathered around the front steps.  LIEUTENANT
        ED VUKOVICH, Homicide Division, gets out of the car and
        strides through the crowd.  He's fiftyish, short, but
        square and solid, a human bulldog gone a little to paunch.
        He chews Juicy Fruit gum like a maniac: a chain-chewer.
        He's homely as an old boot.  And he's not a smart cop, he's
        a wise one; rarer still.  The onlookers, gathered patiently
        for their ten second glimpse of something under a sheet,
        separate for him to pass.

        CAMERA PANAGLIDES AHEAD OF VUKOVICH, as he climbs the switch-
        back staircase two steps at a time.  He passes TWO UNIFORMED
        COPS at the doorway of a second-floor apartment, and enters
        to find a quiet flurry of activity.  Several DETECTIVES and
        a PHOTOGRAPHER prowl around, taking evidence, taking pictures.

        In the center of the living room floor is the body of a
        young woman, crumpled face down in a small lake of blood.
        Two bags of groceries lie split open on the floor in front
        of her.

        Vukovich glances up as he is joined by DETECTIVE SGT.
        TRAXLER.  Traxler is black, lean and very jaded.

                                VUKOVICH
                      Give me the short version.

                                TRAXLER
                      Six shots at less than ten
                      feet.  Weapon was a large
                      caliber--

        Vukovich is looking at the body.

                                VUKOVICH
                      No shit.

        Traxler turns to a passing DETECTIVE.

                                TRAXLER
                      Come on. man.  Don't track
                      it all over.  It's un-
                      professional.

        He turn back to Vukovich, gesturing at the body.

                                TRAXLER
                           (continuing)
                      Okay, let's see...Got a pos-
                      itive on her.  She's Sarah

                           (interrupting)
                      That can't be right.  That's
                      the name of the one Valley
                      Division mopped up this after-
                      noon.

        Traxler slips something off his clipboard and hands
        it to the Lieutenant.

                                TRAXLER
                      Here's her driver's license.

                                VUKOVICH
                           (pondering)
                      You gotta be kidding me.  The
                      new guys'll be short-stroking
                      it over this one.  A one-day

                           (calling)
                      Ginger, have you seen Pugsley?

        Ginger enters, stopping beside their phone answering machine.

                                GINGER
                      Not lately.  Did you check
                      messages?

                                SARAH
                           (still looking)
                      I thought you did.

        She checks under the couch, then behind the drapes.  She
        bends down.

                      your mother.

        C.U. - PUGSLEY, as the GREEN IGUANA cocks its head, blinking
        vapidly.

        RESUME WIDE, Sarah lifts the three foot long lizard from his
        perch on the windowsill.  She gives the complacent reptile
        a kiss on its blunt snout.

                           (groaning)
                      Totally nauseating.

        Sarah drapes the lizard across her shoulders where it sits
        contentedly as she looks for her purse.  Ginger has been
        rewinding the message tape.  She punches PLAY and a MALE
        VOICE is heard.

                                VOICE

                      it looks like I won't be able
                      to make it tonight.  I'm really
                      sorry.  Call you in a day or so.
                      Sorry.  'Bye.

        Sarah stands still, crestfallen.

                                GINGER
                      That bum.  So what if he has
                      a Porsche, he can't treat you
                      like that...it's Friday night
                      for crissakes.

                      I'll live.

                                GINGER
                      I'll break his kneecaps.

        Sarah resignedly slips Pugsley off her shoulders.

                      You still love me, don't
                      you, Pugsley?

        She places Pugsley in a large terrarium with a 'BEWARE OF
        DOG' sign taped on the side.

                                TRAXLER
                      I just called.

                                VUKOVICH
                      Call her again.

        Traxler picks up the phone and begins to dial her number
        as Vukovich sets down his coffee cup, unwraps a stick of
        gum and pops it in his mouth.

                                VUKOVICH
                           (continuing)
                      Got a cigarette?

                           (machine V.O.)
                      Hi there.
                           (long pause)
                      Ha ha ha, fooled you. You're
                      talking to a machine, but don't
                      by shy, it's okay.  Machines need
                      love too, so talk to it and Ginger,
                      that's me, or Sarah will get back
                      to you.  Wait for the beep.

        As the message plays, CAMERA DOLLIES OFF the phone machine
        and down the corridor of the dark apartment.  As the bedroom
        door draws near, Ginger's recorded voice fades and is super-
        ceded by CRIES and MOANS.

        Their perfect bodies glisten with backlight as they strain
        in passion.

        CLOSER - TIGHT TWO, revealing that Ginger is wearing her
        earphones.  Matt, without breaking rhythm, reaches out to
        the night table and thumbs the volume higher.

        Ginger cries out louder, apparently enjoying his sure touch
        on her volume control.

                      Especially the weird press

                      call us.

        CUT WIDE to show Sarah watching the TV which is suspended
        over the bar.  The place is a crowded, post-movie hangout,
        raucous with laughter and videogames.  The newscast
        continues, ignored by all except Sarah.

        A customer gestures for the bartender's attention.

        single payphone and seizes the directory.  She flips rapidly
        through it, then stops, looking down.
        She sees that her name is next on the list.
        The book slips out of her fingers.
        Sarah turns and scans the crowd.
        She's getting looks, covert and otherwise, like any unaccom-
        panied girl on a Friday night.  But is that all they mean?

        Sarah back into the women's restroom.

        sidewalk.  As she passes a figure leaning against the wall
        just outside, the man turns his head to watch her.
        It is Reese, his gaze impassive.
        Streetlight catches the burn scar on his cheek.
        He is motionless, sinister in his long coat.
        Sarah shudders.
        She walks on.

        POV - SARAH, ON CROWD, moving toward and through approaching
        groups of pedestrians.  They seem to be glancing at her.
        Was it always like that and she just never noticed?

        C.U. - SARAH as she look over her shoulder.

        POV - SARAH, ON PIZZA PARLOR DOORWAY.  Reese is gone.
        She resists the urge to run.
        On the opposite side of the street an  LAPD cruiser glides
        slowly by.  Sarah is about to call out but a bus blocks
        her view and when it had passed, the car is turning away
        down a side street.

        She passes a large window with STOKER'S written on it, and
        ducks quickly through the door.

        She turns and scan the gloomy interior, which reveals itself
        to be less than savory.  Pool tables and upper-middle lowlife
        in submarine depths of smoky haze.

        Sarah draws stares, menacing in their own right, as she
        weaves between the pool tables to the back of the bar.
        her hands are trembling as she drops a dime in the pay

        A moment later, Terminator rounds the corner of the building

        He surveys the bank of call buttons, then turns to consider

        PANAGLIDE WITH GINGER as she ties her terry-cloth robe and,
        leaving Matt in a dead sleep, pads through the dark apartment.
        Down the hall, past the phone with Traxler's message.
        Through the dark living room.
        She has her Walkman in the pocket of her robe and bops to
        herself in the silent gloom as she enters the kitchen.

        When she opens the refrigerator to remove snack fixings, the
        light briefly illuminates the kitchen and in that moment,
        SOMETHING MOVES in the F.G.

        TIGHT ON GINGER, MOVING WITH HER as she backs toward the
        counter with her arms full of snack stuff.

        A SUDDEN CRASH.  A flurry of motion behind her.
        She spins, dropping half her load.
        Ginger fumbles for the lightswitch.

        Revealing Pugsley, sitting there blinking innocently among
        overturned spice bottles on the counter-top.

                                GINGER
                      Shoo.  Go on.  I'll make a
                      belt out of you.

        Pugsley disappears into a large fern by the window and Ginger
        sets about her task, slathering crunchy peanut butter on
        stalks of celery.

        light over his sleeping face.
        The sound of a faint breeze.
        In the B.G. is the balcony, empty.  The sliding door is open.

        TIGHT ON MATT, as his eyes open at the sound of a quiet,
        repeated CLICKING.

        UP ANGLE - PAST MATT, as the five-inch blade of an industrial
        razor-knife reaches full extension in Terminator's hand,
        right above him.
        It slashes viciously downward.
        Matt rolls and the pillow is SLIT OPEN where his throat had
        been.

                                MATT
                      Whoah!

        Terminator catches him by the hair and slashed down again.
        Matt grabs the wrist in both hands.
        The enormous muscles of his arms, which seem capable of bench
        pressing a Chrysler, strain and knot against the pressure of
        the killer's single arm...
        And still the blade moves closer to his throat.

        With a final heave Matt deflects the down-pressure sideways
        and the blade snaps with a CLINK against the headboard.

        HANDHELD WITH MATT as he rolls off the bed, spins and slams
        his fists together into Terminator's temple.  He picks up a
        brass deco lamp and brings it down with piledriver force.

        Unperturbed, Terminator knocks the lamp away and hurls Matt
        over the bed.

        The titans CRASH INTO A DRESSER, reducing it to kindling.
        Then into the closet door, EXPLODING THE FULL-LENGTH MIRROR.

        Terminator places one hand on either side of Matt's barrel
        chest.  SINKS HIS FINGERS INTO THE FLESH.  An inhuman grip.
        Matt is raised off the floor, contorted with agony, above
        the other's head.

        passes the closed bedroom door and STOPS, as Ginger pauses
        to set the plate on top of the glass, freeing one hand to
        open the door.

        AN EXPLOSION OF SPLINTERS in close F.G. as a shape smashes
        through the door right in front of her...Matt's body
        propelled halfway through the door by enormous force.
        Ginger shrieks and leaps back, flinging milk and all into
        the air.

        The door begins to open the pressure of Matt's body
        creates resistance.
        Ginger SCREAMS and back away.

        The door is wrenched open and Terminator steps through with
        the massive .45 drawn.

        HANDHELD WITH GINGER, the walls blur by as she runs.

        TIGHT ON TERMINATOR as the pistol RISES INTO FRAME, aligning
        with his eyes.  BOOM!

        LOW FAST DOLLY WITH GINGER as the bullet punches into her
        shoulder, pitching her on her face outside the bathroom door.

        LOW WIDE ANGLE as she crawls forward, gasping, drowning.
        The implacable figure looms behind her.
        Her expression is agony and reeling, nauseating terror.
        And incomprehension: Why am I suddenly dying?
        Her eyes roll, showing the whites, like a horse tethered in
        a burning stable.

        And empties the clip.
        He calmly reloads.

        CLOSE ON PHONE MACHINE, as the telephone rings loudly in the
        ensuing silence.
        Terminator spins, drawing an instantaneous bead on the source
        of the sound, but doesn't fire.

                                GINGER'S VOICE
                           (recorded)
                      Hi there.
                           (pause)
                      Ha ha ha, fooled you.  You're
                      talking to a machine...

        C.U. - TERMINATOR, motionless, listening.

                                GINGER'S VOICE
                           (recorded, continuing)
                      ...but don't be shy, it's okay.
                      Machines need love too...

        Terminator turns abruptly back to Ginger's body.  He turns
        it over, assuring himself that she is dead.

                                GINGER'S VOICE
                           (continuing, recorded)
                      ...so talk to it and Ginger, that's
                      me, or Sarah will get back to you.
                      Wait for the beep.

        There is a loud tone and the incoming call is heard.

                           (on machine)
                      Ginger, this is Sarah...

        Terminator's head snaps back and he freezes, listening.
        He rises slowly as Sarah's voice continues.

        TIGHT ON HIS UNBLINKING EYES.

        Terminator is rapidly and methodically rifling the contents
        of Sarah's small desk.  SIREN'S WAIL, approaching.
        He picks up a small card.

        E.C.U. - CARD. It is Sarah's college I.D. card, complete with
        color photo of her.

        MACRO ON PICTURE.

        E.C.U. - TERMINATOR'S EYES as he tosses the card down,
        after a fraction of a second's scan.  Picks up something else.

        TIGHT ON SARAH'S ADDRESS BOOK, Terminator pockets this and
        slips out the balcony door.  Climbing over the railing, he
        is gone.

        The waitress set a cup of coffee in front of Sarah.

                                WAITRESS
                      Anything else?

        Sarah shakes her head "No" and contemplates her trembling
        hands.  She half-turns, catching a glimpse of herself in
        the mirror behind the bar.

        TIGHT ON SARAH, reflected in the mirror.  In the F.G. a
        man at the bar looks up from his beer, straight into her eyes.
        It is Reese.
        He gazes at her coolly for a moment, then glances away.

        C.U. - SARAH, feeling trapped, frantic.

        ANGLE ON FRONT DOOR as it opens and a figure stands silhou-
        etted briefly against a streetlight.

        Reese turns, his eyes flickering to the mirror, the figure.

        C.U. - REESE as he mechanically raises his beer.  His knuckles
        are white.  He slowly undoes the top button of his overcoat.
        There is a glint of metal in the shadows within.
        Reese turns slowly on his barstool as the figure brushes past
        him, out-of-focus F.G.
        Sarah looks up.

        E.C.U. - REESE'S HAND sliding slowly along polished steel,
        a caress.  His finger slips through the triggerguard of the
        riot gun.

        MEDIUM ON SARAH, as the man stops in front of her in close F.G.
        He sits slowly in the booth opposite her.  The angle is OVER
        HIS SHOULDER.

                                SARAH
                           (uncertainly)
                     Lieutenant Vukovich?

        REVERSE ANGLE - It is not Lt. Vukovich.
        Terminator sits motionless for a BEAT.
        Blue eyes so pure and deep.  The eyes of a saint, perhaps.

        The .45 is out and cocked and AIMED DIRECTLY AT CAMERA, almost
        in one motion.
        The bore seems enormous.

        BACK ON SARAH, over the gun barrel, her eyes go wide.  We hold
        a BEAT, like a frozen slice of nightmare.

        MEDIUM ON REESE as he whips the riot-gun to a hip-firing posi-
        tion, his overcoat falling back with a snap.  HE FIRES.

        ON TERMINATOR, as the shotgun blast hits his arm and he FIRES,
        simultaneously.  Sarah screams as the .45 round blows stuffing
        out of the booth seat inches from her face.  Her hair is
        singed by burning gunpowder.  An involuntary cry is punched
        out of her by the double concussions.

        Reese is stroking up another shell as Terminator half-rises
        from booth.

        OVER REESE'S SHOULDER, as he fires, cocks the slide, fires
        again, advancing on Sarah's booth.
        Terminator is blown backward over the center divider,
        crashing through the glasses and pitchers of beer on the
        table opposite, and onto the floor.

        Sarah is screaming, scrunched down in the booth.

        Terminator is lying on his back at the feet of a table-
        full of drunk patrons.
        He has two rifled 12 gauge slugs in his chest and one
        in the arm.

        The bar customers are frozen in the weird tableau, cowering,
        gaping.
        Sarah stops screaming.
        Reese stand motionless, gun aimed.
        In the sudden silence, the sound of him cocking the shotgun
        is abnormally loud.

        ON TERMINATOR, very still.
        Then he smoothly rolls to a crouch and slips the UZI machine
        pistol from beneath his overcoat, where it has been hang-
        ing on a shoulder strap.
        He doesn't seem too impaired as he swings around to fire.

        Reese rolls like a cat and comes up firing.
        A burst from the UZI rakes the bar where he stood.
        An orgy of shattering glass.
        Total pandemonium.

        SEVERAL ANGLES  as patrons of the bar run, scream or dive
        for cover, depending upon their level of intelligence.

        Reese slides through the glass to Sarah's booth and seizes
        her wrists.

        ON TERMINATOR, kneeling amid the chaos, raising the UZI
        one-handed.

        Reese tugs viciously on Sarah's arm and she sprawls across
        the booth seat a moment before the divider and seat cushion
        erupt with hits from the UZI.

        ANGLE ON A RUNNING PATRON as a burst of 9mm fire catches
        him in the chest.  He pitches into Sarah's booth, pinning
        her.

        Reese fires, ducks, fires again.
        Tables crash over.
        A window is blown out.
        A table candle rolls into a pool of high-proof alcohol
        behind the bar.
        It ignites with a WHOOSH.

        Reese feed two shells into the riot-gun.

        TIGHT ON TERMINATOR, an island of slow, precise movement
        amid the confusion.  He drops a spent clip.  Reaches for
        another with his bloody hand.

        MOVING WITH REESE as he vaults the row of booths and starts
        firing.  At point blank range he unloads the shotgun into
        Terminator's belly.

        The roaring fire behind the bar is spreading very quickly.
        The air is thick with smoke.
        Reese tosses the UZI, for which he has no ammo, into the
        fire.  He hauls the dead man off Sarah and reaches for her.

        TIGHT ON SARAH, shrinking away from Reese, hysterical.
        When he grabs her wrist she struggles, eyes wide.

        C.U. - REESE, very intense.

                                REESE
                     Come with me if you want
                     to live.

        glass rains from him, except where it sticks to his blood-

        riveting STRAIGHT INTO THE CAMERA.

        through the cluttered kitchen, then down a narrow back

        her feet without slowing.

        He hits a closed door, which crashes open.
        Hauls Sarah through, into another corridor.
        Slams and blot-latches it.

        throttle.  Behind him a fireball of superheated gas hurtles
        down the narrow hallway.  He clears the outer door an
        instant before the tongue of flame roars out into the alley.

103     EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF STOKER'S - NIGHT               103

        Vukovich's plain car arrives, slewing to a stop in the
        glass-littered street in front of the blazing building.
        He leaps out, Traxler right in behind him.

                                VUKOVICH
                           (shouting)
                     What the fuck is going on?

        TWO LAPD UNITS arrive behind them.  He motions to the
        nearest one.

        He heads for the inferno at a run.

        DOLLYING WITH REESE AND SARAH as they run through the
        dark alley.  Sarah stumbles over trashcans.
        Reese pulls her along mercilessly.

        WHIP-PANNING as they clear a corner.
        The B.G. is a blur.
        The night-maze is a blur in all of these shots.
        No static angles.
        Relentless forward motion.

        bounding like a panther, leaping trash cans and other
        obstacles.

        TRACKING C.U. - TERMINATOR, catching the faintest glimpse
        of a red glow in the pupils of his eyes as he passes through
        total shadow.

106/FX  EXT. ALLEY/POV - TERMINATOR (HANDHELD) - NIGHT         106/FX

        We know this is Terminator's POV because Sarah and Reese
        are just ahead of us.  But the image is bizarre, alien.
        Bright and hyper-real.  There is a hint of digitization,
        and the fleeing figures ahead are more luminous than the
        background, suggesting infra-red.
        The margins of the FRAME are crammed with columns of CRT-
        type characters: columns of numbers and acronyms.  The
        data changes more rapidly than any human eye could follow.
        There is no doubt that we are seeing as a machine would see.
        The sound effects are bright and clear, as if they are
        digitized and enhanced as well.

107     EXT. ADJOINING ALLEY - NIGHT                           107

        Reese and Sarah turn a corner by caroming off the wall
        without slowing and pelt down a narrower alley.  This
        one is lined with a row of parked cars and connects to
        the street.  There is little room to run.
        Reese is reloading on the run, dropping shells.

        Behind them Terminator enters the alley, gaining.

        LOW ANGLE, FAST PANAGLIDE ahead of the fleeing pair.
        As they breast the last car Reese shoves Sarah hard,
        pitching her on her face to the pavement.
        He flings open the car door...a shield.
        Drops to the ground.
        Fires into the gas tank of a car further back in the row
        just before Terminator reaches it.

        The car EXPLODES, filling the alley with fire.  An inferno
        funneled between the enclosing walls.

        ANGLE ON REESE AND SARAH behind the car door as flames
        roar over the hood.

        ON TERMINATOR, as he slides to a stop, cut off by the
        wall of flame.

        Reese doesn't waste any time stuffing Sarah into the car.
        Climbing in after and over her he twists two wires together
        and we recognize it as his stolen GREY SEDAN.
        The engine catches.

        A SILHOUETTE rockets out of the flames.
        Terminator, leaping from the roof of the blazing car ahead,
        impacts on the hood of Reese's car.  His hair and coat are
        burning.

        Reese jams reverse and nail the throttle.
        The car backs down the alley.
        Terminator draws back his fist.
        Punches into the windshield.
        Inside, Sarah is sprayed with glass as the killer's fist
        shoots through.
        The lacerated fingers grope for her.

        WIDE as the car shoots backwards out of the alley onto the
        street, narrowly missing an arriving LAPD CRUISER.

        Sarah plasters herself tightly into the seat as the
        fingers grasp her blouse and pull.
        Reese cranks the wheel hard.

        The sedan skids, slewing sideways into a parked car.

        Terminator rolls down off onto the pavement.
        Reese's car shoots forward.

        PANNING WITH SEDAN as it roars past Vukovich, the gathering
        minions of the burning building, an arriving fire
        truck...shoots through a red light and continues to accel-
        erate.

        Terminator gets to a kneeling position, then slowly stands.
        He pats out his smoldering clothing as he watches his quarry
        escape.

        tightly lines with parked cars.

        with its lights off, doing ninety plus.

        Paralyzed.  Face bloodless.
        She is shivering silently, uncontrollably.
        Her eyes are wide, and it seems likely that she doesn't
        quite comprehend the roaring blur outside her window.

        around a corner in an expertly controlled slide.
        Then a high speed sprint down the cross-street.
        Reese squirrels the vehicle between a slow-moving car
        ahead and oncoming traffic.
        A dive into another dark side street.

        Reese drives with total, nerveless absorption.  His eyes
        flick to the mirror, to the road, over his shoulder, back
        ...and the world spins outside.
        With occasional glances to Sarah, he speaks to her in a
        clipped, military voice.

                     Are you injured?  Are you

        No response.
        He reaches over and runs his hands over her arms, legs,
        chest.  Sarah flinches.
        She feels the BLIND PANIC BOILING UP WITHIN HER.
        She pushes his hand away and opens the door.
        Reese slams her back in the seat and slaps her.  Hard.

                     you understand?

        As he speaks he is locking the door and fastening Sarah's
        seatbelt over her, cinching it very tightly, like you would
        for a child.  She doesn't answer.

        The walls of a narrow alley, inky black, frame a police
        cruiser parked on the street beyond.  Firelight from the
        back of Stoker's lights the street garishly.
        A young cop  stands beside the car talking via radio with
        the mike cord pulled through the side window.  He speaks
        with a distinctive twang--a displaced southerner.

                                COP

                      up...

        The sweeping headlights of a turning car momentarily illuminate
        the face of Terminator, motionless in the dark right in
        front of us.
        Eyes open.  Listening.

                      round to this side.

        Terminator's silhouette emerges from the blackness and
        strides purposefully toward the cop, CAMERA following.

        The officer whirls and reaches for his gun but Terminator
        flings him brutally into the side of the car, steps over
        him and opens the door.
        Before getting in he notes the unit number on the roof: 143.
        Then he slides behind the wheel, slips the squad car into
        gear, and pulls out.

        rapidly, until the lines across the street are flashing

                      The Terminator's an infil-
                      tration unit.  Part man, part

                      mircoprocessor-controlled,
                      fully  armored. Very tough...

        He turns the lights on and blends with traffic.

                      But outside, it's living

                      hair...blood.  Grown for the
                      cyborgs.

                                SARAH
                      Look, Reese, I know you want
                      to help, but...

                      series had rubber skin.
                      We spotted them easy.  But
                      these are new.  They look
                      human.  Sweat, bad breath,
                      everything.  Very hard to
                      spot.  I had to wait 'til
                      he moved on you before I
                      could zero him.

                                SARAH
                      Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know.
                      They can't build anything like

                      No.  Not yet.  Not for about
                      forty years.

        Reese is driving sedately for a low profile, but his eyes
        rove constantly, searching for a place to ditch the car.
        Sarah's eyes are alert as well, and her tone becomes a bit
        too cool.

                                SARAH
                      So, it's from the future, is
                      that right?

                                REESE
                      One possible future.  Four your
                      point of view.  I don't know the
                      tech stuff.

                                SARAH
                      And you're from the future too?

                                REESE
                      Right.

        They come to a red light and Reese stops.

                                SARAH
                           (patronizingly)
                      Right...

        Like a shot she unlatches the seatbelt, pulls the door lock
        and has the door half open before Reese can react.  He catches
        her arm and hauls her struggling back into the car.

        Sarah sinks her teeth into his hand with all her strength.
        His grip doesn't slacken.
        Slowly, without releasing her, he reaches across with his
        other hand and shuts the door.  His face shows no reaction.

        Sarah draws back and stares at the blood running down his
        arm from the bite, that at his grim, scarred face.  The
        light turns green and Reese drives on.
        Sarah tastes blood and wipes her mouth.

                                REESE
                           (coldly)

                      do.  Don't...do that...again.

        He wipes his hand on his pants.

                                SARAH
                           (weakly, plead-

                      Just let me go.

                           (slow, but intense)
                      Listen.  Understand.  That
                      Terminator is out there.  It
                      can't be reasoned with, it can't
                      be bargained with...it doesn't
                      feel pity of remorse or fear...
                      and it absolutely will not stop.
                      Ever.  Until you are dead.

        Sarah slump in utter resignation.

                                SARAH
                           (quietly)
                      Can you stop it?

        Reese doesn't look at her.

                                REESE
                      Maybe.  With these weapons...
                      I don't know.

        and forth.  DOWN ANGLE, past the chopper, as the circle of
        light moves across a row of parked cars.
        It passes a grey sedan with a shattered windshield.
        Flicks back.  Holds.

        In the B.G., the chopper hovers, on the far side of the lot.
        Reese approaches the door of a late model brown Buick which
        has been left with its window partway down.
        He unlocks it and they slip inside.

        Reese uses the butt of the shotgun to smash loose the
        ignition assembly.  He begins working on the wires.  A
        police cruiser appears, moving slowly between the rows of
        cars.

        Reese grabs Sarah and pulls her down to huddle below dash
        level.  A moment later a spotlight flashes across the seats
        above them.  They hear the helicopter circling closer.

                                SARAH
                      Reese...why me?  Why does
                      it want me?

        They are lying very close, a forced intimacy.  Reese's voice
        is an urgent whisper, almost in her ear.  A cruiser passes
        so close they can hear its radio clearly.

                                REESE

                      beginning.

        Reese musters his thoughts.  And starts.

                      microsecond...extermination.

        Reese pauses, and when he continues it's less like a military
        briefing, quieter.

        her a ten digit number etches on the skin of his forearm.
        Beneath the numbers is a pattern of lines like the auto-

        The helicopter moves overhead.  Its searchlight illum-

        sound fads, Reese starts the car.

        Reese and Terminator race along opposite sides of a
        row of cars, approaching the exit.
        The cruiser pulls ahead and closes diagonally as they
        clear the last car.
        Reese sees the other's shotgun leveled.
        He ducks, steering blind, keeps it floored.
        The windshield and side window EXPLODES INWARD.

        The Buick slams into the black-and-white, spinning it into

        Legitimate police, lights blazing, enter the pursuit

        drawn, approaches the car warily.

        Sarah looks at Reese.  Then at the cops.  She opens the door
        and runs, staggering, toward them.  Vukovich steps forward

        Sarah, huddles in a blanket, is siting on a bench opposite
        Vukovich's desk.  Motionless.  Her eyes are fixed on the
        middle distance.  She's been crying.  Now she's emptied out.

        The door opens.
        At the sound of the latch Sarah jerks as if struck, and cringes
        involuntarily.  Vukovich enters with Traxler and DR. PETER
        SILBERMAN, a criminal psychologist.  Silberman is smooth
        of skin and manner, young, ambitious and...fat.  He is
        enthusiastic about the workings of the human psyche, as
        emotionally involved as someone pulling the wings off a fly.

        Vukovich sits beside Sarah and hands her a cup of coffee.
        He puts a paternal arm around her shoulders.

        The room costs five dollars a night and that's steep, but
        the FIRE ESCAPE outside the window adds an element of

        They slide as he moves his fingers.

        RESUME MEDIUM, as Terminator uses a rag to wipe away the

        A turn of his head brings the balefully glowing left eye
        in its metal socket into view.
        He slips on a pair of tight, wrap-around sunglasses.

        FULL SHOT as he goes to the bed and flips up the stained
        mattress.  He picks up the Remington 12 gauge, the AR-180
        and the .38 off the springs and leaves by the fire escape.

        Traxler, standing in the back, grins and nudges Silberman,

                      This is great stuff.  I could
                      make a career out of this guy.
                      You see how clever this part
                      is...how it doesn't require a
                      shred of proof.  Most paranoid

                      Connor's mother.  Her name.
                      Where she lived, just the city.
                      No scanner pictures.  The

                      Sarah, this is body armor.
                      Out TAC guys wear it.  It'll
                      stop a 12 gauge round.  This
                      other individual must've had
                      one under his coat.

        Sarah want to believe him.  God help her if he's wrong.

                                SARAH
                      But what about him punching

                      Why don't you just stretch out
                      here and get some sleep.  It'll

                                SARAH
                      I can't sleep.

                                VUKOVICH
                      Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're

        Silberman can be seen through a glass partition next to
        the bullet-proof glass booth enclosing the NIGHT DESK
        SERGEANT'S counter.  The Sergeant hits a button and there
        is a loud BULL-CLACK.  The electric bolt on the security
        door opens and Silberman steps out.

        As he exits the station, he passes Terminator just coming in
        the front door.  He glances at the pale apparition in cap
        and dark wrap-arounds, but goes on.
        Terminator approaches the Desk Sergeant who barely glances
        up when he speaks.

                                TERMINATOR
                      I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.
                      I was told she is here.  Can
                      I see her, please?

                                SERGEANT
                      You can't see here.  She's
                      making a statement.

                      Look.  It's gonna be a while.
                      You wanna wait.  There's a

        Terminator steps back, scanning the booth, the electric
        door, the rooms beyond.

                                TERMINATOR
                      I'll come back.

        He turns and walks out through the front doors.

        ANGLE PAST DESK SERGEANT, F.G. - ON FRONT DOORS, the officer
        is absorbed in paperwork, not watching as a pair of lights
        get BRIGHTER outside the doors.  RAPIDLY.  He glances up
        at the last second as the glare falls fully on him.  CRASH!
        Several cops and late night loiterers scatter as a car
        smashes into the foyer.  It blasts through the sergeant's

        Leaps to the corridor floor in a shower of plaster fragments.
        He brandishes the AR-180 like a pistol in one hand, the

        forward, inexorably.
        A door behind him opens.  A COP fires, hitting him in
        the shoulder.  Terminator fires straight-arm with the .38
        without slowing, killing the cop, then fires down the
        corridor with the assault rifle.

        An instant later a chair smashes over the detective's

        SHOTS echo nearby.  There is the RHYTHMIC THUNDER of the

        of RUNNING FEET.  Getting closer.

        SLOW DOLLY IN ON SARAH begins, ending in TIGHT C.U. as the

        a flickering orange.
        He emerges onto a landing through a side entrance.  PAN
        to follow his line of sight as he snaps the AR-180 to
        his shoulder.  B.G. a BLUE VOLKSWAGEN RABBIT is roaring
        away across the parking lot.

        The Rabbit is stopped on the shoulder of a two lane
        secondary road winding through the hills north of L.A.
        Reese is fishing objects out of the car's trunk and
        handing them to Sarah, who holds a flashlight.
        He hands her a blanket, some road flares, and a first
        aid kit.  Then he slams the trunk.  Reaching through the
        side window, he turns the wheel and pushes the car off
        the shoulder, over the embankment.

        DOWN ANGLE INTO RAVINE, past Sarah and Reese, as the car
        trundles down crashing through the underbrush to dis-
        appear among the trees.

        Reese looks out across the valley and the lights of L.A.
        A helicopter circles in the distance, searchlight on.

        storm drain that passes under the road.  Reese, followed
        by Sarah, trudges down the slope and ducks inside.
        The floor is wet but he doesn't seem to mind.
        They both hunker down with their backs to the concrete,
        facing each other.
        They look beaten, grimy, exhausted.
        She huddles under the blanket, waif-like.

                      maybe.

        Sarah scowls and draws her hand out from under his jacket.

                                SARAH
                      You're wet.  Oh my god.

        In the beam of the flashlight her hand is glistening
        with blood.

                      I caught one, back there.

                           (incredulous)
                      Caught one?  You mean you
                      got shot?

        Reese shrugs.

                                REESE
                      It's not bad.

        Sarah sits up and turns toward him.

                                SARAH
                      We gotta get you to a doctor.

                                REESE

                      Forget it?  Are you crazy?
                      Let me see it.

        Sarah opens his jacket and the flashlight beam shows his
        shirt bloodsoaked at the shoulder.

                                SARAH
                           (continuing)
                      Jeez.  You idiot.  Take
                      this off.

        She cradles the flashlight between her knees and opens
        the first aid kit as he removes his jacket.

                      Passed through the meat.

        Sarah starts swabbing the flesh wound.

                                SARAH
                      This is gonna make me puke.
                      Talk about something.

                      Just talk.  Tell me about
                      my son.  Is he tall?

        She places a gauze pad in place and starts to wrap it.

                                REESE
                      About my height.  He

                      ...damn...he has your
                      eyes.

        Sarah glances at his face for a second and then goes back
        to work.

                                SARAH
                      What's he like?

                           (thoughtful)
                      You trust him.  He's got that
                      strength.  You'd die in a
                      second for John.

                                SARAH
                      Well, at least I know what
                      to name him.  I don't suppose
                      you'd know who the father is?
                      So I don't tell him to get
                      lost when I meet him.

                                REESE
                      John never said much about
                      him.  He dies.  Even before

                      Stop!  I don't want to know.
                      Hold still.  So...it was John
                      that ordered you here?

                                REESE
                      I volunteered.

                                SARAH
                      You volunteered?

                                REESE
                      It was an honor.  A chance

                      to fight...organize, prepare.
                      From when he was a kid.  When
                      you were in hiding, before
                      the war.

        She stops taping.  She seems lost, her bravado dissipated.

                                SARAH
                      You talk about things I haven't
                      done yet in the past tense.  It's
                      making me crazy.  I can't think.
                           (pause)
                      Are you sure you've got the
                      right person?

        Reese appraises her coldly.

                                REESE
                      I'm sure.

                      of the future?  Am I tough?
                      Organized?  I can't even balance
                      my checkbook.  I cry when I see
                      a cat that's been run over...
                      and I don't even like cats.

                      Ow!  No, it's okay.  It's
                      better tight.

                                SARAH
                      And anyway, what do I know
                      about guerrilla warfare?

                      Look, Reese, I didn't ask for
                      this honor and I don't want it.
                      Any of it.

                      John gave me a message for
                      you.  Made me memorize it.
                      'Sarah"...this is the message...
                      'Sarah, thank you.  For your
                      courage through the dark years.
                      I can't help you with what you
                      must soon face, except to tell
                      you that the future is not set...
                      there is no such thing as Fate,
                      but what we make for ourselves
                      by our own will.  You must be
                      stronger than you imagine you
                      can be.  You must survive, or I
                      will never exist.'  That's all.

        Sarah stares at him as the enormity of it all becomes real
        to her.  Reese moves his arm, testing the bandage.

                                REESE
                           (continuing)

                      You like it?  It's my first.

        He rebuttons his shirt and they return to the warmth-
        conserving embrace.  Sarah gazes out the entrance, into
        the night.

                                REESE
                      Sleep.  It'll be light soon.

                           eyes)
                      Okay.  Talk some more.

        Kyle watches the helicopter circling far in the distance.

                                REESE

                      The H-K's use infra-red so you
                      still have to watch out.
                      But they're not too bright.
                      John taught us ways to dust them
                      them.  That's when the infiltra-
                      tors started to appear.  The
                      Terminators were the newest,
                      the worst...

        During his monologue we have PANNED into the darkness outside
        and to the helicopter, which flies OUT OF FRAME, leaving
        black.  A ROTOR ROAR fades up.

        Black sky.  Stars.
        With a roar an AERIAL PATROL CRAFT enters close overhead.
        It has flashing red and blue lights and powerful search-
        lights which stab down.

        White ash blows in drifts among fire-gutted ruins.
        Blackened bones lie everywhere in heaps.
        Searchlights sweep the night.
        Another aerial unit hovers several blocks away, firing

        as a gleaming chrome H-K grinds through the debris of the
        shattered street on its tank-like tracks, crushing burnt
        skulls.
        Its head turns slowly, playing high-intensity lights over the
        buildings.

        Reese is among a SQUAD OF MEN in black fatigues, carrying
        equipment and energy rifles, who enter a debris-littered
        tunnel.

        PANAGLIDE WITH THEM as they trot through a labyrinth of
        tunnels, pass several guard-posts.  Reese has a GERMAN
        SHEPHERD on a short leash.

186     INT. PARKING STRUCTURE - NIGHT                         186

        The platoon enters a cavernous chamber, an old parking
        structure, in which a large group is gathering.
        As the entrance, ARMED SENTRIES with dogs are passing in
        new arrivals: men wearing mismatched uniforms or rags and
        carrying all types of weapons from lasers to shotguns.
        Weapons are left at the sentry post.

        FOLLOWING REESE as he patrols the perimeter.
        He walks along a row of CARS, models from the eighties and
        nineties, now stripped, rusty and modified to carry weapons.
        There are conventional military vehicles as well.
        He passes several family groups.
        Gaunt kids are huddles around an old TV SET.
        Its glow bathes them.

        REVERSE ANGLE reveals that the set has been gutted and a
        small cookfire crackles inside the shell.
        Nearby a kid has a LARGE RAT cornered and is whacking it
        with a stick.

        Reese pauses at the end of the row of vehicles and unsnaps
        a pocket in his tunic, removing a small paper rectangle,
        a worn photograph.

        C.U. - REESE, gazing down.  His head snaps around at the
        sudden sound of BARKING.

        ANGLE ON SENTRY POST as the dogs go crazy.

                      Terminator!

        An innocuous, RAG-DRESSED MAN flips back his poncho to
        reveal a powerful PLASMA-RIFLE.  He opens FIRE, running
        forward.  ENERGY BOLTS rip into the crowd.

        MOVING WITH REESE, running toward the Terminator.

        RAPID CUTS:

        POWERBOLTS EXPLODE among the fleeing people.
        Beams sear the darkness.
        A running CHILD is BURST by a plasma hit.

        ANGLE ON REESE running.  He levels his energy-rifle and
        starts firing.  A powerbolt grazes his cheek, EXPLODING
        a support column behind him.  Part of the ROOF COLLAPSES
        as Reese tumbles.

        Everything is lit as if by lightning.

        C.U. - REESE, semi-conscious.  Burned.  Bleeding.
        Impressions implode on him: running feet, flashes, energy
        beams raking the ground leaving molten worm-tracks, scream-
        ing, a burning dog howling.

        DETAIL - The picture Reese has been looking at has fallen,
        forgotten.  It catches fire and starts to curl.  Before
        the image vanishes we see that it is a picture of Sarah.

        Reese looks up.
        A figure looms above, a silhouette in the smoky, hellish
        glare.  THE TERMINATOR.  Its  eyes glow red.

        A brilliant EXPLOSION WHITES OUT THE SCREEN.

        C.U. - SARAH, brightly lit by daylight.  Asleep.  She grimaces
        and groans.
        In the distance a dog is barking.

        Reese, still holding her, lightly lifts her hair from her
        face.  An uncharacteristically tender gesture.  He gently
        caresses her cheek with the backs of his fingers.  When
        she awakens suddenly he snaps his hand away.

        Sarah looks around, momentarily disoriented.  Looks up at
        Reese.

                                SARAH
                      I was dreaming about dogs.

        Reese extricates himself from her and steps out of the
        culvert.

                      We used them to spot Terminators.

                      Put that away.  I'll get one.

        She hold out her thumb to passing traffic.
        Reese watches this incomprehensible ceremony skeptically.

        PICKUP TRUCK with the DRIVER, obviously a surfer.  Laid-

        Reese glowers and watches the scenery through slitted eyes.

        The gas station is like an oasis of clutter in a rolling
        stretch of meadows and woods.  It consists of a bunker-
        like building with restrooms and a flanking PICNIC AREA,
        beyond which are WOODS.
        People sit under the trees, enjoying the beautiful day
        while children tear around after the forced inactivity of
        a long trip.

        The three of them get out on unsteady legs.

        She heads for the WOMEN'S RESTROOM and Kyle follows her
        inside.

                      Yours is over there.

        Instead of following her directions to the Men's Room,
        Kyle wanders toward the drinking fountain.  A bunch of
        kids are running around and throwing water at each other
        with paper cups.

        Reese shambles through them like a zombie.
        He stands among the children, an alien in this land without
        fear.  He watches people at picnic tables laughing and
        listening to portable music.  Kids squeal.  Dogs bark.

                                LITTLE GIRL (V.O.)

        DOWN ANGLE on an achingly beautiful LITTLE GIRL of about
        four.  She points above his head.

        Reese looks up to see a helium-filled mylar balloon stuck in
        the foliage of a tree just above him.  He pulls it down by
        the string and holds it, turning it over dully.

        He crouches down to her eye-level.  She smiles.

                                REESE
                      Aren't you afraid to be out in

                      Huh?

        Reese whirls reflexively at a SCREAM behind him.  The
        mylar balloon bursts in his tense hands.  A teenage girl
        is being doused with water by the boys with plastic jugs.

        The little girl looks at the broken balloon, then glares
        at Reese.  She punches him soundly on the shoulder and
        storms off.

        At this moment she is bowled over by an IRISH SETTER that
        licks her face while she shrieks with laughter.
        Reese seems about to smile but doesn't quite know how to
        go about it.

        Sarah has been idly leafing through the DIRECTORY.  On
        a whim she looks up something.
        She freezes for a moment when she finds the listing.
        Then with a triumphant expression she rips the page out

                                SARAH
                      Look.  I found it.  Isn't
                      that it?  Cyber Dynamics
                      Corporation?

                                REESE
                      What about it?

                                SARAH
                      Didn't you say that they're
                      going to develop this
                      revolutionary new thing...

                                SARAH
                      Whatever...they become the
                      hotshot computer guys so they
                      get the job to build El Computer
                      Grande...Skynet...for the
                      government.  Right?

                                REESE
                           (uneasy)
                      That's the way it was told
                      to me.

        Sarah's fear has been replaced by excitement.

                                SARAH
                      Well, we're gonna uninvent the
                      bastard.  Eighty-six it.  We'll
                      blow up the place...burn it
                      down.  Something.

                                REESE
                           (very cold)
                      Tactically dangerous.  We
                      lay low.

                                SARAH
                      Reese.  Think it through.
                      We can prevent the war.
                      Nobody else is gonna do it.
                      If we go to anybody official
                      we wind up back in jail and
                      then that walking cuisinart
                      has got us again.  We have to
                      so it ourselves.

                                REESE
                      That's not my mission.

                                SARAH
                           (upset, mocking
                           his manner)
                      Listen.  Understand.  I'm
                      not a military objective,
                      Reese.  I'm a person...
                      You don't own me.

        Reese takes her arm and pulls her to her feet.

                                REESE
                      Let's go.  Time to move out.

                                SARAH
                      Fuck you!  Let go of me!

        She jerks her arm free.  He reaches for her again but
        she outdistances him, running.

                                REESE
                           (warning tone)
                      Sarah!

        She dashes down a footpath among the trees, clutching her
        sign.  Reese follows her into the woods.

                                               CUT TO:


193     EXT. WOODS/CLEARING - DAY                              193

        Only a few yards from the picnic area, the woods take over
        completely.

        PANNING WITH SARAH

        as she runs down the path.
        Reese tackles her from behind and they fall together in
        the long spring grass.
        She struggles violently to get away.

                                SARAH
                      Let...go...bastard...

        She gets one arm free and whacks him hard in the face.
        Reese reacts instinctively, leaping back in a defensive
        crouch.  Sarah freezes when she sees the .357 in his
        hand.

                                SARAH
                           (continuing,
                           scared, but
                           angry)
                      Oh, that's real smart.
                      Go on, shoot me. That's
                      brilliant.

        Reese is trembling as he lowers the gun.
        Sarah too is shaking with emotion.  Tears roll down her
        cheeks and her voice cracks.

                                SARAH
                           (continuing)
                      Jesus Christ, Reese.  Can't
                      you see I'm scared?

        He straightens up and his arms go limp at his sides.
        He turns away.

                                SARAH
                           (continuing)
                      I can't spend my life waiting
                      for that thing to catch up
                      with me...always looking over
                      my shoulder, wondering if I
                      left some tiny clue behind...

        Reese doesn't respond.
        The gun slips from his fingers.
        His will seems to drain from him and he sags to his knees.
        The moment stretches.
        There is only the sunlight moving in shafts through the
        leaves, the sound of a small stream nearby, birds chirping.

                                SARAH
                      Reese?

        She crawls over to him.

        C.U. - REESE

        in profile, with Sarah in B.G.
        His eyes are closed.
        A tear meanders down his cheek.

                                SARAH
                           (continuing,
                           quietly)
                      Kyle?

                                REESE
                           (a whisper)
                      I'm wrong here.  I wasn't
                      meant to see this...

        He gestures at their surroundings.

                                REESE
                           (continuing)
                      It's...like some dream.
                      This...this...

        He touches the grass, the trunk of a tree.

                                REESE
                           (continuing)
                      ...and you...all so...beauti-
                      ful.  It hurts, Sarah.  More
                      than death.

        He looks are her beseechingly.

                                REESE
                           (continuing)
                      Don't you understand...it's
                      all gone!

        Sarah puts her arm around him.
        She sniffs and wipes at her nose with the back of her hand.

                                SARAH
                      We can change it, Kyle.  We
                      have to try.

        She takes his shoulder in her hands.

                                SARAH
                           (continuing)
                      There's no fate but what we
                      make for ourselves. Right?
                      Come on.  Let's go, kiddo.
                      Whaddya say?

        He picks up her sign and they look at each other for a
        second, then get up.

        Murky.  Claustrophobic.  With knife-slits of hot sunlight.

        MEDIUM ON TERMINATOR

        sitting on the edge of the bed.
        His appearance isn't improving.

        A patch of SCALP is blown away, revealing CHROME underneath.
        A flap of skin dangles from his cheek, which exposes some
        of the DRIVE CABLES which move the lips.
        He is scanning Sarah's address book, turning a page every
        two seconds.

        Sarah turns to wave as a TRACTOR-TRAILER pulls away noisily,
        heading back to the Interstate.  The driver answers her wave
        out the side window.  Reese stops for a moment outside the
        motel office to pet a GERMAN SHEPHERD sitting on the porch.
        The dog wags its tail and licks his hand.

        Reese opens the door and they go in.

        He hands her the .38 he took off the detective.

        She takes it without thinking as he leaves then realizes
        that she has A LOADED GUN IN HER HAND, without the slightest
        idea of how to use it.  She lays it gently on the dresser.
        As an afterthought, she turns it with one finger so that it
        is pointing the other way.

                      much now, Mom.  I love you.

        The PAN comes to a table.  Smashed plates.  Spilled coffee.
        A spatter of blood.  A phone.  It follows the phone cord
        onto Terminator in CLOSE-UP as he continues in a perfect
        simulation of her mother's voice...

                                TERMINATOR (MOTHER'S VOICE)
                      I love you too, sweetheart.

        TIGHT ON SEVERAL GROCERY BAGS

        covering the counter beside the hot-plate in the tiny
        apartment.

        Reese's hands split one open and its contents spill out.

        FULL SHOT

        Sarah looks through Reese's haul.

                                SARAH
                      Let's see.  Corn syrup.
                      Ammonia.  Moth balls...
                      Mmm.  What's for dinner?

                      Plastique.

        There are also boxes of shotgun shells, road flares, tape,
        scissors, pans, a strainer and many other odd utensils,
        substances, chemicals.

                                SARAH
                      What's that?

                                REESE
                      Nitroglycerin, basically.
                      Bit more stable.  I learned
                      howto make it when I was a
                      kid.

        Sarah looks a bit stricken as she contemplates the evening
        ahead.

        A heartwarming domestic scene.
        Sarah and Kyle have pulled the dresser out to use as a
        worktable.  Pans, packages and bottles clutter the kitchen,
        B.G.  On the table between them are eight ten-inch lengths
        of PLUMBER'S PIPE, threaded each end.  Kyle is showing
        Sarah how to tamp the HIGH-EXPLOSIVE PUTTY into the pipe
        bombs and seal them shut.

                                REESE
                      Make sure there's none on the
                      threads, like this.  Now screw
                      the end-cap on...very gently.


                                SARAH
                      You must have had a fun child-

                      That's good.  Now, seven more

                                SARAH
                      I was thinking, there's so
                      much I've got to show you
                      when we get through this.
                      It's mind boggling, the pos-
                      sibilities...Disneyland, the
                      beach, movies...matinees with
                      popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...

                                REESE
                      Hot dogs?

                      bad,Kyle...all the things you've
                      never seen and done.  You're here,
                      but wherever you go, and whatever
                      you touch, you bring the war with
                      you.

                                REESE
                      My whole life has been combat.

                                SARAH
                      I want it to be over for you.

                                REESE
                      Not possible.

                                SARAH
                      I want it to be over for me too.
                      I feel like I slipped over some
                      invisible line, that I'm in your
                      world now.  Everything's the same,
                      but I see it differently.
                      It's like, there's you and me,
                      and him...but nobody else can
                      understand or help or even touch
                      us.

        Reese looks up and finally catches her gaze.  He reaches
        out for her hand and it seems he may be taking it to
        comfort her.
        But he turns her wrist to read her watch.

                                REESE
                      We'll head out at 0200.

                      to sleep if you want.  I'll
                      finish.

        ANGLE ON TABLE - The bombs are neatly ranked, finished.
        A nylon satchel lies nearby.  The mess is cleaned up.

        WIDE SHOT reveals Reese sitting in silent vigil at the
        window.  The room is dark, lit only by a streetlight
        outside.
        Sarah is asleep on the bed.

        Reese sits cross-legged, shirtless, his body held rigid.
        The image of discipline.  The .357 is held loosely in one
        hand on his lap.  There is a fresh bandage on his shoulder.

        Sarah wakes up and goes to him in the darkness.  He looks
        at her for a moment as she sits beside him, then back outside.

                                SARAH
                      He'll find us, won't he?

                                REESE
                      Probably.  Sarah, if I get
                      zeroed...

                                SARAH
                      Don't say that.

                                REESE
                      If I do, you have to get away,

                                SARAH
                      It'll never be over, will it?
                      Look at me, I'm shaking.
                      Some legend, huh?  You must
                      be pretty disappointed.

                                REESE
                      No.  I'm not.

        Several beats before Sarah speaks again.  Her eyes seem
        luminous in the dark.

                                SARAH
                           (softly)
                      Kyle, the women in your
                      time...what were they like?

                                REESE
                      Good fighters.

                                SARAH
                      That's not what I meant.
                      Was there someone special?

                                REESE

                           (softly)
                      I'm sorry.

        Sarah studies him for a moment.
        She's sitting slightly behind him and she puts her hands
        on his shoulders and back, tracing the lines of his scars
        with her fingertips.

                                SARAH
                      So much pain.

                                REESE
                      Pain can be controlled.
                      You disconnect it.

                      And so you feel nothing.

                                REESE
                      It's better that way.

                                SARAH
                           (with great
                           sympathy)
                      Oh, Kyle.

        Reese takes a long, slow breath before he answers, and when
        he does his voice has a new quality, an unfamiliar tenderness.

                                REESE
                      John Connor gave me a picture
                      of you once.  I never knew
                      why.  It was very old. Torn.
                      Faded.  You were young, like
                      you are now.  You weren't
                      smiling...just a little sad...
                      I always wondered what you
                      were thinking at that second.

        He closes his eyes, reaches toward her.  His fingertips
        trace the contour of her nose, chin, cheeks.

                      for you.  I love you.
                      I always have.

        Sarah is quietly overwhelmed.
        Reese looks away.

                                REESE
                           (continuing)

                      have said...

                                SARAH
                      Kyle...


        She leans forward and kisses him.
        His face is frozen.  A mask.
        She continues, tenderly.
        He begins to respond.
        The dam breaks and he holds her in a tight, trembling
        embrace, clinging to her like life itself.

        Kyle picks her up and carries her to the bed.
        She kisses his neck and chest, tracing his scars with
        her lips.

        He unbuttons her blouse very slowly.
        Sarah guides his powerful hands over her.

        A SEQUENCE OF CUTS.  DETAILS.  IMPRESSIONS.

        Sarah, a very close angle, as she grimaces in divine agony.
        Reese, his face rapt.
        His hand, clutching the pillow as if to kill it.
        It is explosive, torrential.  A confluence of fate and will.

        across his chest, she surveys his face as his eyes close
        drowsily.

                      Ticklish?

        Sarah's hand moves OUT OF FRAME.  After a moment Reese
        looks down, puzzled.

                                REESE
                      What are you doing?

                           doggedly)
                      You'll beg for mercy in
                      a second.

        Reese seems unperturbed.  Finally he begins to squirm.

                                REESE
                      I don't think I like this.

                                SARAH
                      You're not supposed to.

        Now Reese is becoming desperate.  A grimace spreads across
        his face.  It becomes a grin.  Then he's laughing, trying
        to escape but she won't let him, and they collapse, laughing
        together.
        Sarah gazes at his grin, a glimpse of the Reese that might
        have been, in another life.

        A moment later the grin vanishes at the sound of dogs barking
        outside.
        Reese is off the bed in an instant, crouched tense, eyes
        alert.  Feral as ever.

        Nothing there put the shredded remain of sheets and pillows.

        The POV shifts to the BACK DOOR, which is ajar, and moves
        toward it.  Through the door.  Revealing an EMPTY YARD.

        Reese is under the dash, playing with the wires.
        Sarah lies on the seat, clutching the nylon satchel, which
        bulges with the explosive charges.  She has dressed hastily
        and is barefoot.

                                REESE
                      Light it now.

        Sarah has been holding a BIC LIGHTER near the tip of a fuse.
        She thumbs the flame on.  The fuse catches as Reese twists
        the wires and the engine starts to turn over.

        FAST PANAGLIDE WITH HIM as he runs the
        length of the suite, stops outside the front door.
        Whips the AR to his shoulder.

        The truck is BACKING WILDLY across the lot B.G.
        Terminator turns, looking into CAMERA as a SIZZLING SOUND
        becomes audible.

        DETAIL - PIPE CHARGE, lying just inside the door, in the
        shadows.  The fuse is burning.

        WIDE SHOT - On doorway, from the parking lot, as Terminator
        takes two leaping strides forward and the CHARGE EXPLODES.
        The front of the building is BLOWN TO KINDLING.
        Terminator is flung forward by the blast.

        from the blast settles.  A YOUNG GUY ON A HONDA 750 crosses
        the parking lot and stops near him, running forward.
        Terminator starts to get up, moving slowly.

        freeway, burying the throttle.  Traffic is light...a few
        18-wheelers.  The truck tops out at 110 and he holds it.
        They flicker rapidly through pools of light and shadow.

        ANGLE OVER REESE'S SHOULDER as they hurtle forward.  An
        interchange flashes by in an instant.

        tucked, getting as much speed as possible out of the 750.
        As he GAINS ON THE CAMERA, FILLING FRAME, he unslings the

        he checks the load.  Snaps the cylinder shut.  Glances in
        the rear mirror.  Turns the wheel.

        the pickup, B.G.  The truck swerves suddenly, diving around
        a TRACTOR-TRAILER.  Terminator leans hard to follow.

        LOW WIDE ANGLE preceding the pickup and Terminator as they
        swerve as high speed.  Reese uses the slow semis as static
        obstacles.  He misses them by inches, TIRES SQUEALING.

        ANGLE OVER SARAH'S SHOULDER, through the front window as
        the back of a SEMI-TRAILER hurtles toward them, straight ahead.

        HIGH ANGLE, following both vehicles as Reese feints RIGHT
        and then skids LEFT.  He slides toward the trailer in a
        FOUR-WHEEL DRIFT as Terminator commits to the right.

        M.C.U. - TERMINATOR, over the barrel of the AR, as he FIRES.

        SIDE ANGLE - PASSING TRUCK-TRAILER, bullets strafe across
        it as the pickup vanishes behind.  Terminator skids the
        bike, barely missing an abutment, and is forced onto an
        OFF-RAMP.

        LOW SIDE ANGLE preceding Terminator as he roars down the
        off-ramp without slowing.  Runs the red light at the bottom
        as a hundred miles an hour.  Climbs the ON-RAMP.

        CURVE, two lanes wide and elevated.

        Terminator rocks back from a round between the eyes that
        bares metal, the FIRES.

        Bullets rake the pickup.
        The windows are blown out.

        Sarah shrieks as the doorpost next to her head CLANGS WITH
        HITS.

        The short burst EMPTIES THE GUN.
        It CLATTERS TO THE PAVEMENT a moment later, discarded.
        Terminator draws the .38.  Takes aim.

        Sarah SCREAMS.  HITS THE BREAKS HARD.  CRANKS THE WHEEL.
        GLASS behind her EXPLODES with gunfire.

        SWERVING VICIOUSLY the truck SLAMS THE BIKE, sending it
        FLYING INTO A GUARDRAIL.  Terminator goes over the handle
        bars at a hundred miles per hour.

        TEARS THROUGH THE DIVIDING FENCE.
        Heads back toward her on the wrong side of the freeway.

        She stares in numb horror.
        The nightmare refuses to end.
        She runs to the crippled pickup and sees a front tire flat,
        shredded by a crumpled fender.

        She searches the cab frantically for the KEYS TO THE
        MOTORCYCLES.  Finds them above the sun visor.

        Sarah leaps into the bed of the pickup and attacks the
        motorcycle strap-downs frantically.
        Panting with terror she rolls the bike off the truck.
        It crashes on its side and she falls on it painfully.

        Straining until she CRIES OUT INVOLUNTARILY, she lifts
        it upright.
        KICKS the engine over.

        Sarah emerges from a cloud of tire smoke, cutting across

243     EXT. FREEWAY EMBANKMENT - NIGHT                        243

        Sarah tries to ride down the steep embankment but loses
        control, spilling the bike.  She and Kyle tumble down
        the slope.

        MOVING WITH HER as she scrambles, half-dragging Kyle, through
        a row of trees at a chainlink retaining fence.  She crawls
        under the fence, tugs Kyle and the satchel through after.

        Sarah looks up at the source of a SUDDEN THUNDEROUS ROAR.

                                               CUT TO:


243/FX  ANGLE ON TANKER                                        243/FX

        It appears above them, grinding over the embankment.  It
        rolls down the steep slope TOWARD CAMERA, FLATTENING TREES.

                                               CUT TO:


244     EXT. INDUSTRIAL SITE - NIGHT                           244

        Sarah and Kyle scramble up and run across the STORAGE LOT
        of a MODERN FACTORY COMPLEX of LOW BUILDINGS.  Kyle struggles
        to keep up, holding the satchel.

        LIKE A JUGGERNAUT the truck follows, smashing through parked
        cars and FLATTENING A PRE-FAB STORAGE BUILDING.

        They enter an alley-like space between two buildings.
        Kyle is fumbling to open the satchel.

        ANGLE BACK as the tanker enters the alley.  It TEARS THE
        CORNER OFF ONE BUILDING as it turns in.  Terminator looks
        down from his mountain of steel.

                                               CUT TO:


245     INT. TANKER CAB - NIGHT                                245

        OVER TERMINATOR'S SHOULDER, looking down at a tiny figure
        below, running in the headlights' glare.  It is Sarah, alone.

                                               CUT TO:


246     EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                     246

        Reese crouches in a TRASH-DUMPSTER which is sandwiched
        between the wall and the tanker.  There are only inches
        of clearance as the trailers pass by.

        He lights a PIPE CHARGE, jumps up and wedges it under the
        tank-cylinder of the second trailer.
        He ducks as it rolls on.

        Sarah is stumbling in the glare of the truck's lights.

        E.C.U. - PIPE BOMB, the fuse burning.

        M.C.U. - TERMINATOR, through the windshield, his eye glowing.

        C.U. - REESE huddles in the dumpster.

                                               CUT TO:


247/FX  LOW WIDE ANGLE ON SARAH AND TRAILER (PROCESS SHOT)     247/FX

        The REAR TRAILER EXPLODES.  An unbelievable FIREBALL ERUPTS
        SKYWARD, silhouetting Sarah's running figure F.G.
        The dumpster is enveloped by fire and hurled, rolling, down
        the alley.

        Sarah makes it around a corner as the FORWARD TRAILER
        EXPLODES and an OCEAN OF FLAME rolls forward, blasting by her.

        The dumpster topples and Kyle rolls out, surrounded by fire.


248/FX  SEQUENCE - TERMINATOR                                  248/FX

        In the center of the inferno Terminator struggles violently.
        His FLESH FIRES AND SIZZLES.  He tears loose from the
        TWISTED WRECKAGE and collapses to the ground.  Sinks into
        a CHARRED MASS.  STOPS MOVING.

        C.U. - TERMINATOR, mouth open, skull-like, motionless
        in the flames.

                                               CUT TO:


249     EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                     249

        Sarah crawls away from the intense heat and lies watching
        the motionless figure in the blaze.

                                               CUT TO:


250     EXT. ALLEY/FAR END - NIGHT                             250

        Sarah rounds the corner, staggering, searching.
        She sees Kyle crumpled face-down near the dumpster, sheltered
        from the heat by its mass.

        She drags his away.  Rolls him over.

        C.U. - REESE, his head lolls.  He opens his eyes

                                REESE
                           (weakly)
                     Sarah.

                                SARAH
                     We did it, Kyle.  We got it.

        She hugs him.

                                               CUT TO:


250/FX  FULL SHOT (PROCESS)                                    250/FX

        They hold the embrace, silhouetted by the diminishing flames.
        It would be a wonderful final image.
        Except...TERMINATOR STAGGERS OUT OF THE BLAZE BEHIND THEM.

        M.C.U. - TERMINATOR, the last flakes of flesh are falling
        from him like burning leaves.  His gleaming structure is
        revealed in all its intricacy.  No longer a 'He', but an 'It'.
        It looks like Death rendered in steel.
        A CHROME SKELETON with HYDRAULIC MUSCLES and TENDONS OF
        FLEXIBLE CABLE.  In the sockets of the metal skull, the
        eyeball swivels with a WHIR of tiny servos, both glowing
        red now.

        It turns slowly and fixes its gaze directly INTO CAMERA.

                                               CUT TO:


251     EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                     251

        C.U. - SARAH - She chokes on a scream, crams knuckles in
        her mouth.

        FULL SHOT (FX), as the machine takes a step toward them,
        dragging one MALFUNCTIONING LEG.

        PANAGLIDE WITH KYLE AND SARAH as they stagger to their feet
        and run to the nearest building.  They come to a glass door.
        Kyle kicks it in.  Unlatches it.  They enter dark OFFICES
        to the sound of ALARMS and DISTANT SIRENS.

                                               CUT TO:


252     INT. CORRIDORS - NIGHT                                 252

        Sarah and Kyle run down a corridor.
        Through a door, which they close and lock.
        They move off down a cross-corridor.
        The Terminator BLASTS THE DOOR OFF ITS HINGES, F.G., and
        staggers through.  It starts after their receding figures
        as they round the corner at the end of the hall.

                                               CUT TO:


253     INT. OPEN OFFICES - NIGHT                              253

        Wracked, exhausted, they stumble through a maze of PARTI-
        TIONED OFFICE CUBICLES.

254     INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT                                  254

        The Terminator catches sight of them through a floor-to-
        ceiling window.  It makes an unhesitating right turn through
        the glass.

                                               CUT TO:


255     INT. OPEN OFFICES - NIGHT                              255

        Sarah and Kyle look back at the sound of SHATTERING GLASS.

        PANAGLIDE PRECEDING THE TERMINATOR as it crashes forward,
        line-of-sight, through the maze.  It splinters partitions.
        Flings desks out of the way.

        FOLLOWING SARAH AND KYLE as they reach a heavy FIREDOOR and
        go through.

                                               CUT TO:


256     INT. MANUFACTURING AREA - NIGHT                        256

        Kyle slides the bolts on the metal firedoor.  Behind them
        are acres of machinery in darkness.  Silence.
        CRASH!  The Terminator hits the door from the far side.
        Hinges SQUEAL.

        Kyle goes to a LARGE BREAKER PANEL and opens it.  Starts
        throwing switches.  Behind them, machines START UP ONE BY ONE.

                                SARAH
                           (panting)
                      What are you doing?

                                REESE
                           (weakly)
                      Cover...our footsteps...

        He sags, sliding down the wall.  She pulls him up.
        Half-carries him into the maze of machines.
        The dark gallery is filled with WHIRRING, CLANKING SHAPES,
        SHATTERING CONVEYER BELTS and improbable mechanisms lashing
        mindlessly.

        Reese slips to the floor and Sarah is no longer able to
        support him.

                                REESE
                           (faintly)
                      Leave me here.

        Sarah crouches beside him.
        Grabs his shirt front.
        Yells over the machines.

                                SARAH
                      I'm not leaving you anywhere
                      you jerk.  Haven't you figured
                      it out?  Kyle, John is our
                      son.

        Reese's eyes refocus.

                                SARAH
                           (continuing)
                      There isn't going to be
                      anybody else...I don't want
                      anybody else.  Listen to
                      me!

        She pauses, then resumes in a commanding, military shout.

                                SARAH
                           (continuing)
                      Move!  Reese! Let's go.
                      Move you ass!

        She drags him to his feet and he staggers on.

        Hinges SHATTER and the firedoor is hurled inward.
        The Terminator scans the darkness.

        ANGLE - PANNING WITH SARAH AND KYLE as they move through
        the machines.

        The cyborg steps forward, scanning methodically.

        Sarah and Kyle move in a crouch through the treacherous
        tangle of pipes and machinery.  Kyle picks up a length of
        pipe to use as a weapon.  As they climb out onto a cat-
        walk between the two huge mechanisms, Sarah clambers over
        an innocuous CONTROL PANEL.
        Her knee inadvertently hits a RED PUSH BUTTON.
        With a ROAR the stamping-plate of a HYDRAULIC PRESS slams
        down an inch from her hand.
        Startled, she tumbles to the catwalk.

        The Terminator's eyes swivel as he hears the single non-
        rhythmic sound.

        Kyle and Sarah run to the end of the catwalk, but find the
        door there locked.

                                SARAH
                      Come on!

        They double back to escape the cul-de-sac.  The Terminator
        steps in front of them, cutting them off.

                                REESE
                           (shouting)
                      Run!

        He pushes Sarah roughly and she stumbles away.
        Kyle raises the pipe with his good arm as the Terminator
        advances.

                                REESE
                           (over his
                           shoulder)
                     Run, damn it!

        She hesitates, backing away.
        The cyborg swings at Reese
        STEEL CLANGS ON STEEL.
        Kyle strikes and parries but is sledgehammered back.

        ANGLE ON CATWALK as Kyle lands in a heap, smashed against
        a stanchion of the railing which prevented him falling to
        the factory floor twenty feet below.

        Sarah turns and runs.

        LOW ANGLE PAST REESE, F.G., as the cyborg approaches him.

        E.C.U. - A FUSE BURNING.

        C.U. - KYLE'S FACE streaked with blood, pressed to the
        floor as a metal foot CLANGS DOWN, F.G.   His eyes snap open.

        Sarah falls, gets up, runs on.
        The Terminator draws back for a death blow.
        And Kyle rolls with the last of his strength, raising
        the pipe bomb he has been cradling.  He jams it between two
        hydraulic cylinders just beneath the cyborg's armored  rib-
        cage.  Then rolls off the catwalk.  Terminator has an instant
        to react, reaching for the bomb, before it EXPLODES.

        Sarah is pitched forward by the blast and slides on the
        floor.
        Slams up against one wall.
        A withering spray of shrapnel strafes the walls around her.
        Pieces of scrap metal clatter throughout the factory, rain-
        ing down.

        C.U. - SARAH, very still.  She winces and opens her eyes.
        Slowly looks up.

        POV - SARAH, as the smoke clears.  The Terminator is GONE.
        Unrecognizable clumps of BURNING DEBRIS lie scattered about.
        Looking down through the grating floor she sees Kyle's
        body.
        LOW ANGLE ON KYLE F.G., Sarah on catwalk above.  Kyle's eyes
        are half-open.  Still.  His face peaceful.
        ANGLE ON ONE OF THE FIRES climbing some plastic tubing and
        triggering a SPRINKLER HEAD.  It begins to rain.
        C.U. - SARAH sitting up as the water runs over her.
        She looks down.  Protruding from her right thigh is a TWISTED
        PIECE OF METAL.  Shrapnel.  Part of the cyborg.  She pulls
        it out, grimacing.  Her leg is broken.

        It is a long time before she can gather the will to move.

        SARAH'S POV - She sees a WALL PHONE several yards away,
        beyond the debris from the explosion.
        She starts to crawl toward it.
        She passes A LARGE CLUMP OF DEBRIS, F.G.

        ANGLE ON DEBRIS (FX) as it rolls over suddenly!
        Now recognizable as the TERMINATOR'S HEAD AND ARMS, with
        half of the scattered torso trailing wires and twisted
        metal.

        IT LUNGES FOR HER!

        Sarah wants to scream this time, from the depths of her
        soul, but there is no scream, only a dry shivering sob.

        The Terminator drags itself SCRAPING over the floor, steel
        fingers clutching.

        Sarah is shaking and whimpering as she scrabbles away,
        crawling in agony.

        ANGLE ON CONVEYOR BELT as Sarah flops from the catwalk
        onto the MOVING STRIP.  She is carried into the intricate
        lattice of equipment.  Sarah rolls off weakly before going
        under a set of sorting rollers.

        ANGLE THROUGH MACHINERY - ON THE TERMINATOR (FX) as it crawls
        after her, dragging its body.  It tracks her unerringly,
        EYES GLOWING.

        Sarah moves deeper into the DARK, CLASHING JUNGLE of machinery.
        Around her is a rain-drenched tangle of CABLES, PIPES and
        unforgiving mechanisms of steel.

        The Terminator clambers through after her.

        C.U. - SARAH - Water pours into her eyes as she catches
        sight of something.  A familiar CONTROL BOX.
        She drags herself toward it.

        C.U. - THE TERMINATOR (FX) - It spots her wedged in a tiny
        crawl space.  No way out.

        It crawls the last few feet,EYES RED IN THE DARK.
        Hypnotized, Sarah watches the Terminator REACHING TOWARD HER.
        She is jammed in a corner.
        Sarah's hand claws around to the front of the control panel,
        seeking the RED BUTTON.

        E.C.U. - HER WET FINGERTIPS FEEL THE BUTTON.

        ANGLE ON THE TERMINATOR (FX), his steel hand reaching out.

        E.C.U. - SARAH, her face inexplicably calm, eyes steady in
        that infinite instant.  She clenches her teeth to keep
        from screaming as she WAITS.

        The Terminator's hand reaches for her throat to crush
        the life out of her and end its long mission.

                                SARAH
                           (voice icy)
                      You're...terminated...fucker!

        E.C.U. - BUTTON, as her bloody finger stabs it down.

        FULL SHOT, showing how the cyborg has been led into the
        MAW OF THE HYDRAULIC PRESS.
        THE STAMPING PLATE THUNDERS DOWN!
        Tons of mechanical pressure flatten the Terminator's head
        and body like tin-foil.  The PRESS SCREAMS, jamming solid.
        Lightning snaps out in one brief blaze, leaping to surround-
        ing machinery, arcing to Sarah's wristwatch.  All the
        Terminator's energy is released in one second.

        ANGLE on the narrow gap between the upper and lower plates:
        a pinpoint of red light DWINDLES AND GOES OUT.
        TIGHT ON SARAH, shivering uncontrollably.  The steel fingers
        are frozen an inch from her throat.  She can only stare as
        water runs over her.

                                               CUT TO:


257     INT. FACTORY - DAWN                                    257

        CLOSE ON the side rail of an ambulance gurney SNAPPING UP
        into position.  Sarah's eyes are closed and she is moved
        OUT OF FRAME.

        WIDE SHOT, showing the gurney being rolled by TWO ATTENDANTS
        past the site of the last explosion.
        SEVERAL POLICE OFFICERS are picking through the debris.

        PANNING WITH THE GURNEY as it is wheeled out, holding on
        TWO FACTORY EMPLOYEES, F.G.
        One, the PLANT MANAGER, bends to examine a piece of the
        cyborg lying at the base of the hydraulic press.
        A COP, B.G., notices this.

                                COP
                      Look, I told you not to
                      touch anything until we're
                      done.  You got that?

                                MANAGER
                      Sure thing, officer.

        He stands and palms a small object to HIS ASSISTANT.  They
        step around the corner.

                                ASSISTANT
                      What is it?

                                MANAGER
                      Microcomputer chassis.  But
                      I've never seen stuff like
                      this anywhere.

                                ASSISTANT
                      Weird.  Jap stuff, maybe?

                                MANAGER
                      Keep it out of sight and
                      get it down to R and D
                      Monday, first thing.

                                ASSISTANT
                      Good idea.

                                               CUT TO:


258     EXT. BUILDING - DAWN                                   258

        Sarah is being lifted into the ambulance.  She looks
        up as the doors are latched shut.

        TILT UP to follow her gaze.
        The sign above the entrance of the building reads:

        CYBER DYNAMICS CORPORATION

                                               SLOW DISSOLVE TO:


259     INT./EXT. LANDROVER - LATE AFTERNOON                   259

        MACRO ON CASSETTE RECORDER, the center capstans of a
        tape turning.

                                SARAH (V.O.)
                      ...and the hardest thing is
                      deciding what I should tell
                      you and what not to.  Well,
                      anyway, I've got a while yet
                      before you're old enough to
                      understand the tapes.  They're
                      more for me at this point...
                      to help get it all straight.

        COVER SHOT reveals Sarah as the wheel of a dusty landrover
        parked at the pump island of a tiny gas station.  All of
        its signs are in hand-lettered Spanish.  Beyond lies an
        expanse of scrub desert.  The sky scowls with an impending
        storm.

        Sarah speaks quietly into a hand microphone as a dark-
        complected attendant laconically fills her tank.  She
        cradles the cassette recorder in her lap, in the lee of
        her SWOLLEN BELLY.
        She looks to be about SIX MONTHS ALONG.
        Under her down vest she wears a leather shoulder holster
        and the butt of a .357 REVOLVER presses against her
        breast.  She tugs the vest closed as the attendant glances
        her way.  A German Shepherd sits in the back among taped
        boxes and suitcases.

                                SARAH
                           (continuing)
                      Should I tell you about your
                      father?  That's a tough one.
                      Will it change your decision
                      to send him here...knowing?
                      But if you don't send Kyle,
                      you could never be.  God,
                      you can go crazy thinking
                      about all this...I suppose
                      I'll tell you...I owe him that.
                      And maybe it'll be enough if
                      you know that in the few hours
                      we had together we loved a
                      lifetime's worth...

        CLICK.  WHIR.  Sarah jumps at a sound nearby, breaking
        her reverie.  A small MEXICAN BOY has snapped her picture
        with a beat-up Polaroid camera.  He holds it out to her,
        speaking rapid Spanish.

                                ATTENDANT
                      He says you are very beautiful,
                      Senora, and he is ashamed to ask
                      five American dollars for this
                      picture, but if he does not,
                      his father will beat him.

                                SARAH
                      That's a pretty good hustle,
                      kid.  Four.  Quatro.

        The boy takes her four dollars and she watches the
        snapshot develop.  It is a good photograph of her,
        the wind lightly ruffling her hair, expression thought-
        ful, slightly sad.

        We recognize it as the one Reese carried in 2029.
        She slips it into her short pocket.

                                ATTENDANT
                      Mil trescientos...fifteen dollars
                      American.

        As she pays him, distant thunder rolls.
        The boy yells something in Spanish as he runs off.

                                SARAH
                      What did he say?

                                ATTENDANT
                           (accented)
                      There is a storm coming in.

        Sarah gazes at the thunderheads building up out over the
        desert.  Heat lightning pulses in their depths.

                                SARAH
                           (quietly)
                      I know.

        CAMERA CRANES UP as she pulls away, driving across the
        flat desert on a ribbon of highway.  A brilliant flash
        crescendos from horizon to horizon out at the rim of the
        world.

        Revised final shooting script



1       EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

        Downtown L.A.  Noon on a hot summer day.  On an EXTREME LONG LENS the
        lunchtime crowd stacks up into a wall of humanity.  In SLOW MOTION
        they move in herds among the glittering rows of cars jammed bumper to
        bumper.  Heat ripples distort the torrent of faces.  The image is
        surreal, dreamy... and like a dream it begins very slowly to

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

2       EXT. CITY RUINS - NIGHT

        Same spot as the last shot, but now it is a landscape in Hell.  The
        cars are stopped in rusted rows, still bumper to bumper.  The
        skyline of buildings beyond has been shattered by some
        unimaginable force like a row of kicked-down sandcastles.
        Wind blows through the desolation, keening with the sound of ten
        million dead souls.  It scurries the ashes into drifts, stark
        white in the moonlight against the charred rubble.
        A TITLE CARD FADES IN:

                        LOS ANGELES, July 11, 2029

3       ANGLE ON a heap of fire-blackened human bones.  Beyond the mound is a
        vast tundra of skulls and shattered concrete.  The rush hour crowd
        burned down in their tracks.

4       WE DISSOLVE TO a playground... where intense heat has half-melted the
        jungle gym, the blast has warped the swing set, the merry-go-round
        has sagged in the firestorm.  Small skulls look accusingly from the
        ash-drifts.  WE HEAR the distant echo of children's voices... playing
        and laughing in the sun.  A silly, sing-songy rhyme as WE TRACKS
        SLOWLY over seared asphalt where the faint hieroglyphs of hopscotch
        lines are still visible.

        CAMERA comes to rest on a burnt and rusted tricycle... next to the
        tiny skull of its owner.  HOLD ON THIS IMAGE as a female VOICE speaks:

                                VOICE
                3 billion human lives ended on August 29th, 1997.
                The survivors of the nuclear fire called the war
                Judgment Day.  They lived only to face a new
                nightmare, the war against the Machines...

        A metal foot crushes the skull like china.

        TILT UP, revealing a humanoid machine holding a massive battle rifle.
        It looks like a CHROME SKELETON... a high-tech Death figure.  It is
        the endoskeleton of a Series 800 terminator.  Its glowing red eyes
        compassionlessly sweep the dead terrain, hunting.

        The SOUNDS of ROARING TURBINES.  Searchlights blaze down as a
        formation of flying HK (Hunter-Killer) patrol machines passes
        overhead.  PAN WITH THEM toward the jagged horizon, beyond which we
        see flashes, and hear the distant thunder of a pitched battle in
        progress.

5       EXT. BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT

        THE BATTLE.  Human troops is desperate combat with the machines for
        possession of the dead Earth.  The humans are a ragtag guerrilla
        army.  Skynet's weapons consist of Ground HKs (tank-like robot
        gun-platforms), flying Aerial HKs, four-legged gun-pods called
        Centurions, and the humanoid terminators in various forms.

        SEQUENCE OF RAPID CUTS:
5A      Explosions!  Beam-weapons firing like searing strobe-light.
5B      A gunner is an armored personnel carrier fires a LAW rocket at a
        pursuing Aerial HK, bringing it down in a fiery explosion.
5C      Another APC is crushed under the treads of a massive Ground HK.

5D      A TEAM OF GUERRILLAS in a intense fire-fight with terminator
5E      endoskeletons in the ruins of a building.  Three terminator
5F      endoskeletons advance, firing rapidly.  Another (complete cyborg),
        with flesh ripped open and back broken, gropes for a rifle on the
        ground.

5G      A Centurion overruns a human firing position.  Soldiers are cut
        down as they run.  Fiery explosions light the ranks of advancing
        machines.

6       IN A BLASTED GUN EMPLACEMENT at the edge of battle, a man watches
        the combat with night-vision binoculars.  He wears the uniform of a
        guerrilla general, and a black beret.  He is still amid running,
        shouting techs and officers.

        C.U. MAN, pushing slowly in as the battle rages O.S.  He lowers the
        binoculars.  He is forty-five years old.  Features severe.  The left
        side of his face is heavily scarred.  A patch covers that eye.  An
        impressive man, forged in the furnace of a lifetime of war.  The name
        stitched on the band of his beret is CONNOR.  We push in until his
        eyes fill frame, then...

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

        FIRE.  SLOW, BOILING, ENORMOUS.  FILLING FRAME.

                                VOICE (SARAH CONNOR)
                Skynet, the computer which controlled the machines,
                sent two terminators back through time.  Their
                mission: to destroy the leader of the human
                Resistance... John Connor.  My son.

                The first terminator was programmed to strike at
                me, in the year 1984... before John was born.
                It failed.

                The second was set to strike at John himself,
                when he was still a child.  As before, the
                Resistance was able to send a lone warrior.  A
                protector for John.  It was just a question of
                which one of them would reach him first...

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

7       EXT. TRUCKSTOP - NIGHT

        Wild fingers of BLUE-WHITE ELECTRIC ARCS dance in a steel canyon
        formed by two TRACTOR TRAILERS, parked side by side in the back lot
        of an all-night truck stop.  Then...

        The strange lightning forms a circular opening in mid-air, and in
        the sudden flare of light we see a FIGURE in a SPHERE OF ENERGY.
        Then the FRAME WHITES OUT with an explosive THUNDERCLAP!

        Through the clearing vapor we see the figure clearly... a naked man.
        TERMINATOR has come through.  Physique: massive, perfect.  Face:
        devoid of emotion.  Terminator stands and impassively surveys its
        surroundings.

8       INT. TRUCK STOP DINER - NIGHT

        On a back route to north L.A.  A handful of local TRUCKERS hunch over
        chili-sizes, CAT hats pushed back on their heads.  Three BIKERS are
        playing a game of pool in the back, their Miller empties lining the
        table's rail.  The dive's owner, LLOYD, a fat, aging biker-type in a
        soiled apron, stands behind the bar.  Nothing much going on...

        Then the front door opens and a big naked guy strolls in -- that
        doesn't happen every night.  All eyes simultaneously swivel toward
        Terminator.  Its emotionless gaze passes over the customers as it
        walks calmly through the room.  Everyone frozen, not sure how to
        react.

8A      TERMINATOR POV.  A digitized electronic scan of the room, overlaid
        with alphanumeric readouts which change faster than the human eye
        can follow.  In POV we move past the staring truckers, past the
        owner and the awestruck WAITRESS, and approach a large nasty-looking
        biker puffing on a cigar.  His body is outlined, or "selected", and
        thousands of estimated measurements appear.  His clothing has been
        analyzed and deemed suitable...

8B                              TERMINATOR
                I need your clothes, your boots, and your
                motorcycle.

        The big biker's eyes narrow.  He takes a long draw on this cigar,
        the tip cherry-red hot.

                                CIGAR BIKER
                You forgot to say please.

        He grinds the cigar out on Terminator's chest.  Which produces not
        the slight reaction of pain.  Terminator calmly, and without
        expression, grabs Cigar by his meaty upper arm...
        Cigar screams from the hydraulic grip.

        Terminator doesn't see Cigar's friend, behind him, holding his pool
        cue by the narrow end like a Louisville Slugger.  The heavy send
        whistles in a powerful swing and CRACKS IN TWO across the back of
        Terminator's head.

        Terminator seems not to notice.  Doesn't even blink.  Without
        releasing his grip on Cigar, he snaps his arm straight back and grabs
        Pool Cue by the front of his jacket.  Suddenly the heavyset biker
        finds himself flying through the nearest window.  CRAASSH!

        Terminator hurls Cigar, all 230 pounds of him, clear over the bar,
        through the serving window into the kitchen, where he lands on the
        big flat GRILL.  We hear a SOUND like SIZZLING BACON as Cigar
        screams, flopping jerking.  He rolls off in a smoking heap.

        The third biker whips out a knife with a eight-inch blade and slashes
        at Terminator's face.

        Terminator grabs the arcing blade with his bare hand.  Holding it by
        the razor-sharp blade he jerks is from the guy's hand.
        Ultra-fast here: He flips it.  Grabs the handle like you're supposed
        to hold a knife.  Grabs the biker and slams him face-down over the
        bar.  Then brings the knife whistling down, pinning the biker's
        shoulder to the bar top with his own steel.

9       INT. KITCHEN

        The doors BANGS OPEN and Terminator strides in.
        The Mexican cook does a fast fade as Terminator walks toward Cigar,
        who is cursing in pain on the floor.

        With his deep-fried fingers he struggles to get out the .45 auto
        tucked under his leather jacket.  But he can't even hold onto it.
        Terminator takes it from him.  Instead of pointing it at him,
        Terminator carefully examines weapon, analyzing its caliber and
        operating condition.  Terminator never threatens... that's a human
        thing.  He just takes.

        Cigar senses what he must do when the emotionless eyes come back to
        him.  He slides the keys to his bike across the floor to Terminator's
        foot.  Then painfully starts getting out of his jacket.

10      INT. TRUCK STOP

        Terminator strides from the kitchen, fully clothed now in a black
        leather jacket, leather riding pants, and heavy, clean boots.  He
        moves toward the moaning biker pinned to the pool table.  Without
        slowing his stride he jerks the knife out.  The guy slumps to the
        floor, groaning, behind him.

        Terminator continues toward the front of the diner, passing Lloyd,
        the owner.  At the door, he comes abreast of two truckers who sit
        frozen like a snapshot in mid-bite.  One of the truckers finally
        nods.

                                TRUCKER
                Evening...

        Terminator impassively stares back.  Then moves on out the door.

11      EXT. TRUCK STOP

        Terminator walks out, surveying the parked Harleys.  Sticks the .45
        in his belt and swings one leg over a massive CUSTOM ELECTRO-GLIDE.
        He slips the dagger in his boot and the key in the ignition.  Kicks
        over the engine.  It catches with a roar and he slams the heavy iron
        into gear with a KLUNK.

        Lloyd appears at the diner's door with a sawed-off 10-GAUGE
        WINCHESTER LEVER-ACTION SHOTGUN.  He fires into the air and jacks
        around round in fast, aiming at Terminator's back.

                                LLOYD
                I can't let you take the man's wheels, son.
                Now get off or I'll put you down.

        Terminator turns and considers by coldly.  He eases the shifter up
        into neutral.  Rocks the bike onto its kickstand.  Swings him leg
        over and walks calmly toward the guy.

        Terminator strides right up to Lloyd, staring straight into the
        shotgun's muzzle.  Lloyd starts sweating, trying to decide is he's
        going to kill a man in cold blood.  He's still trying to decide when
        Terminator's hand blurs out like a striking cobra and is somehow
        suddenly holding the shotgun.

        Lloyd gapes, knowing he's screwed.  Then...
        Terminator reaches toward him.  Oh shit...
        And slips the sunglasses out of Lloyd's shirt pocket.  Puts them on.
        Strides back to the Harley and roars off in a shower of gravel.

12      EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT

        Terminator roars down the freeway, heading for L.A.  Cold neon flares
        across the chrome of the big bike.  The 10-gauge is jammed through
        the clutch and brake cables, across the handlebars.  The lights flow
        over Terminator's wrap-around sunglasses like the tracks of tracer
        rounds.

                                                CUT TO:

13      EXT. OVERPASS - NIGHT

        The First Street Bridge.  Rusting chain-link fence and graffiti-
        covered walls.  An L.A.P.D. BLACK-AND-WHITE cruises the empty street.

        A TREMENDOUS BLUE-WHITE GLARE suddenly spills out between the columns
        of the overpass.  The young UNIFORMED COP in the car whips his head
        around at the source of the light.  He pulls over quickly, in time
        to see...

13A     The powerfully arcing electrical discharge reaches its peak between
        the columns.  Lightning climbs the chain-link fence and light
        standards, lighting up the night, and papers swirl in a blasting
        whirlwind.

13B     The cop climbs from his cruiser as the glow fades.
        He sees vapor dissipating as he approaches the spot where he saw the
        strange light.  He draws his revolver and cautiously moves into the
        shadows between the rows of pillars.

        A NAKED MAN glides from a shadowed doorway behind the cop.  Nothing
        special about him.  Certainly not built like a terminator.  The flash
        of light and fact that he is naked are pretty good clues that he
        just arrived from the future.  His features are handsome bordering
        on severe.  His eyes are gray ice.  Penetrating.  Intelligent.

        THE COP spins at a sound.  Too late.  Mr. X is already on him.  The
        blow is lighting fast and the cop drops like a bag of sand.

        LOW ANGLE as the unconscious cop hits the deck, his BERETTA 9mm
        AUTOMATIC clattering next to him.  A hand ENTERS FRAME and picks up
        this pistol.

        looks and acts exactly like a cop.  Cool, alert, confident in his
        power, his expression emotionless and judgmental.
        Mr. X, now Officer X, puts the car in gear and drives into the night.

14      INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE/GARAGE - DAY

        TIGHT ON YOUNG JOHN CONNOR, who at his moment is ten years old and
        busy reassembling the carburetor on his Honda 125 dirtbike.  He has
        ripped Levi's and long stringy hair.  A sullen mouth.  Eyes which
        reveal an intelligence as sharp as a scalpel.  The Ramones' "I Wanna
        Be Sedated" blasts from a boom box next to him.

        A WOMAN, JANELLA VOIGHT, stands in the doorway of the garage,
        yelling over the music.

                                WOMAN
                ...John?  John!  Get in here right now and
                clean up that pigsty of yours.

        John's friend TIM, a thirteen-year-old Hispanic kid, watches as John
        replies by turning up the volume on the boom box.
        Janelle gives up with a SLAM of the house's back door.

                                TIM
                Your foster parents are kinda dicks, right?

                                JOHN
                Gimme that Phillips right there.

15      INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

        Janelle storms into the room.  TOD VOIGHT, her husband, watches
        sports on the TV.  They're both in their thirties.  Middle-class
        working stiffs.

                                JANELLE
                I swear I've had it with that goddamn kid.
                He won't even answer me.
                        (neither does he)
                Todd?  Are you gonna sit there or are you gonna
                do something?

        He sighs.  Throws down the TV's remote and heads for the garage.

16      INT. GARAGE

        John hops on the bike.  Kick-starts it.  Tim picks up John's nylon
        bag, then climbs on the back.  Todd ENTERS and shouts over the
        engine, which John revs louder and louder.

                                TODD
                John!  Get your ass inside right now and do
                what your mother says!

        John pins Todd with a defiant glare.

                                JOHN
                She's not my mother, Todd!

        He revs the engine and peels out of the garage, with Tim almost
        falling off the back.  They take off down the street.

17      EXT. VACANT LOT/DRAINAGE CANAL

        John cuts through a vacant lot to a trail running beside a fenced-in
        drainage canal.  He guns the bike through a hole in the retaining
        fence.  Tim's eyes go wide as they roar down the concrete embankment.

17A     IN THE DRAINAGE CANAL John zig-zags along, throwing up a
        roostertail of muddy water.  Tim shouts, pretending he didn't just
        see his life flash before his eyes.  He slaps John on the back.

                                TIM
                Major moves, homes!  So... where is your
                real mom, anyway?
                        (John doesn't answer)
                She dead or something?

        It's hard to read John's expression.

                                JOHN
                She might as well be.

        John twists the throttle angrily and the bike lunges forward.

18      EXT. PESCADERO STATE HOSPITAL - DAY

        A SIGN on a chain link fence topped with concertina wire reads:
        PESCADERO STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE.  Beyond it
        squats an imposing four-story building.  Institutional brick.
        Barred windows.  About as inviting as KGB headquarters.  Security
        guards patrol the manicured grass.

19      INT. HOSPITAL - MAXIMUM SECURITY WING

        Sunlight is a barred slash on the bare institutional wall.  The room
        is empty of all furnishings save the bed, a stainless steel sink,
        toilet, and a dented metal mirror.  WE HEAR a rhythmic grunting,
        small explosions of breath in perfectly-metered time.

        PAN TO a bedframe leaned upright against the wall, legs facing
        outward.  A pair of sweaty hands grip one leg.  Tendons knot and
        release as SOMEONE does pull-ups.  A man of tangled hair hides the
        face that comes INTO FRAME, dips out, comes back.

        WIDER.  A WOMAN in a tank top and hospital pants in hanging from the
        top leg of the vertical bedframe.  Her body is straight and taut.
        Knees bent so the feet clear the ground.  The arms are lean and
        muscular.  The inmate, face hidden, pulls up, dips, pulls up.  Like
        a machine.  No change in rhythm.

20      INT. HOSPITAL/CORRIDOR

        FIGURES MOVE TOWARD US down a corridor of polished tile and two-
        tone walls.  DR. PETER SILBERMAN, a smug criminal psychologist,
        leads a group of young INTERNS.  Following laconically, are THREE
        BURLY ATTENDANTS.

                                SILBERMAN
                The next patient is a 29-year old female
                diagnosed as acute schizo-affective disorder.
                The usual indicators... depression, anxiety,
                violent acting-out, delusions of persecution.
                        (the interns nod judiciously)
                Here we are.

        Silberman stops at one of the SOUNDPROOF STEEL DOORS.  There is a two-
        way speaker beneath a tiny window.  Silberman flips the intercom
        switch.

21      INT. CELL

        Silberman's scrubbed and cheerful face at cell window.  HIS VOICE
        comes over the tinny speaker.

                                SILBERMAN
                'Morning, Sarah.

        REVERSE ANGLE as she turns slowly into CLOSE UP.
        SARAH CONNOR is not the same woman we remember from last time.  Her
        eyes peer out through a wild tangle of hair like those of a cornered
        animal.  Defiant and intense, but skittering around looking for
        escape at the same time.  Fight or flight.  Down one cheek is a long
        scar, from just below the eye to her upper lip.
        Her VOICE is a low and chilling monotone.

                                SARAH
                Good morning, Dr. Silberman.  How's the knee?

22      INT. CORRIDOR

        Silberman's smug composure drops a second.  Then returns.

                                SILBERMAN
                Fine, Sarah.
                        (he switches off, speaks to
                        the interns)
                She, uh... stabbed me in the kneecap with a
                screwdriver a few weeks ago.

        Sarah watches them talking about her through the glass, but can't
        hear them.  She feels like a lab animal.  The interns look in at her
        through the glass as Silberman talks.  With her face drawn, eyes
        haggard and hair wild, she looks like she belongs where she is.

                                SILBERMAN
                The delusional architecture is interesting.
                She believes a machine called a "terminator",
                which looks human of course, was sent back
                though time to kill her.  And also that the
                father of her child was a soldier, sent to
                protect her... he was from the future too...
                        (he smiles)
                The year 2029, if I remember correctly.
                        (the interns chuckle)
                Let's move on, shall we?

        As the interns walk on, Silberman steps close to DOUGLAS, the head
        attendant, and speaks low.

                                SILBERMAN
                Douglas, I don't like seeing the patients
                disturbing their rooms like this.  See that she
                takes her thorazine, would you?

        DOUGLAS is 6'4", 250 pounds and warm-hearted at a rattlesnake.  He
        nods, catching Silberman's meaning, and gestures for the other
        attendants to hang back as Silberman moves on in his rounds.

23      INT. CELL

        Sarah looks up as the cell door opens.  Douglas walks in slowly,
        idly tapping his POLICE BATON against the door in a ominous rhythm.
        The other two orderlies ease in behind him.  One of them carries a
        STUN BATON (like a sawed-off cattle prod).  The other has a tray with
        cups of red liquid-thorazine.

                                DOUGLAS
                Time to take you meds, Connor.

        Sarah faces him, weight centered.  Feral eyes darting from one to the
        other.

                                SARAH
                You take it.

        Douglas grins, casual --

                                DOUGLAS
                Now you know you got to be good 'cause you up
                for review this afternoon...

                                SARAH
                I'm not taking it.  Now I don't want any
                trouble...

                                DOUGLAS
                Ain't no trouble at all --

        He whips the baton in a whistling backhand, which --
        WHAP!  Takes her square in the stomach.  She doubles over and drops
        to her knees, unable to breathe.  Douglas tips the bed and it slams
        down with a crash, right new to her.  He takes her stun wand from
        the other attendant and walks forward.

        TIGHT ON SARAH, grimacing and struggling to breathe.

                                SARAH
                You... son of a... AAARRGH!!

        The stun wand hits her between shoulder blades as she tries to rise.
        It drives her to the floor, pinning her like a bug.  Little
        ELECTRIC ARCS CRACKLE as the baton makes her writhe in pain.
        Douglas grabs her by the hair and jerks her up to her knees.  Holds
        the cup of thorazine in front of her lips.

                                DOUGLAS
                Last call, sugar.

        Gasping, she chokes the zombie juice down.

24      EXT. BANK PARKING LOT - DAY

        John furtively hunches before a Ready-Teller machine at the rear of
        a local bank while his friend Tim stands lookout.  John slips a
        stolen ATM card into the machine slot.  It is something he's rigged
        up, because trailing from the card is ribbon-wire which goes to
        some kind of black-box electronics unit he's got in his ever-present
        knapsack.  He holds the pack between his knees and pulls out a
        little lap-top keyboard, which is also connected to the black-box.

        John enters a few commands and the plasma-screen displays the PIN
        number for that account.  He quickly enters the number on the Ready-
        Teller's keypad and asks it for 300 bucks.  The machine whirs then
        begins dispensing twenty-dollar bills.  Tim looks back over his
        shoulder amazed.

                                JOHN
                Easy money!

                                TIM
                Where'd you learn all this stuff?

        John collects the twenties as the machine kicks them out.  A cool and
        professional electronic-age thief at ten years old.

                                JOHN
                From my mom.  My real mom, I mean.  Come on
                baby...
                        (he grabs the last bills)
                Let's go!

        They sprint around the corner to an --

25      EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BANK

        They huddle behind the building as John counts out Tim's share.
        He folds five twenties and palms them to the other kid.  When John
        opens his wallet to put in his money, Tim notices a picture in a
        plastic sleeve.

                                TIM
                That her?

        John reluctantly shows his friend the Polaroid.  It is a shot of
        Sarah.  Pregnant, in a jeep near the Mexican border.  John doesn't
        know it now, but he will carry the photo with him for over 30 years,
        and give it to a young man named Kyle Reese, who will travel back in
        time to become his father.  Yes, that photo.

                                TIM
                So she's pretty cool, huh?

                                JOHN
                Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's
                why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up
                a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.

                                TIM
                No shit?

                                JOHN
                Yeah, she's a total loser.  C'mon, let's check
                out the 7-Eleven, whatya say?

        John has tried to sound casual, but we see in his eyes that is really
        hurts.  He slaps Tim on the shoulder and they jump onto his Honda.
        John fires up and they whine off down the alley.

                Well, you could if he was here.  Be he took off
                on his bike this morning.  Could be anywhere.

                There was a guy here this morning asking about

                Yeah, big guy.  On a bike.  Has that got
                something to do with it?

        Officer X registers the significance of that.  He realizes who the
        big guy must be.  He smiles.  Reassuringly shakes his head no.

        stroking her cheek.  She wakes up to see --

        KYLE REESE.  Sitting on the edge of her bed, looking exactly the
        same as we last saw him in 1984.  Scruffy blonde hair and a long
        raincoat.

                I love you.  I always will.

                                SARAH
                Oh, God... Kyle.  I need you so much.

        She kisses him passionately.  They are locked together in a timeless
        moment.  PUSH IN TIGHT on Sarah as she buries her face in his
        shoulder.  She shuts her eyes tight.  Stay on Sarah as Reese speaks.
        He voice is strangely cold.

                                REESE (O.S.)
                Where's John, Sarah?

        Sarah opens her eyes and he is no longer in her arms.  He is standing
        across the room.  Pinning her with an accusing gaze.

                                SARAH
                They took him from me.

                                REESE
                It's John who's the target now.  You have to
                protect him.  He's wide open.

                                SARAH
                I know!

                                REESE
                Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.

                                SARAH
                        (struggling not to cry)
                I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed
                to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the
                mission.

                                REESE
                Remember the message... the future is not set.
                There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.

        He turns toward the door.

                                SARAH
                Kyle, don't go!

                                REESE
                        (turning back to her)
                There's not much time left in the world, Sarah.

        Reese goes out the door.  Sarah jumps from the bed, frantic.  Yanks
        the door open.  Follow her out.

30      INT. CORRIDOR

        Sarah staggers from her cell.  Reese is already, impossibly, a
        hundred feet away, striding down the dim corridor.  A silhouette
        in a long coat, disappearing around a corner.

        Sarah runs after him, her bare feet slapping the cold linoleum.
        Her hospital gown floats out behind her as she dream-runs along the
        seemingly infinite corridor.  She reaches the corner, slides around
        it, and...

30A     Slams right into the arms of Douglas and his three helpers.  They
        grab her as she struggles and screams.  The Silberman is there,
        smiling soothingly.  They force her down and she is pinned to
        the floor, screaming.  A new figure approaches... one even more
        menacing.

        TERMINATOR walks toward her, with heavy measured steps.  Backlit,
        eyes concealed by the sunglasses, it stands over her like the angel
        of death itself.  It reaches down and...
        Takes her hand.  Lifts her up.  Leads her to a door.  They go through
        together.  Emerging into...

30B     A BEAUTIFUL SUNLIGHT MORNING.  CHILDREN are playing nearby... sliding
        down slides, clambering through a jungle gym.  Sarah knows this
        dream know... it's is the worst of all her nightmares.  She starts
        to scream but no sound comes out.

30C     THE SKY EXPLODES into WHITE LIGHT.  Everything is seared by the unholy
        glare, hotter than a thousand suns.  The children ignite like
        match heads.  Sarah is burning, screaming silently, everything silent
        and overexposed.  Terminator's flesh and clothing are burning,
        silently.  It grips her hand, Virgil to her Dante in this tour of the
        nuclear-age Inferno.

30D     THE BLAST WAVE HITS... a near-solid wall of compressed air followed
        by 250-mph winds.  The children, charcoal statues frozen in positions
        of play, explode into black leaves of ash and swirl away.  SOUND
        hit now, with a thunderous roar.  Sarah's scream merges with the
        howl of the wind as the blast hits her, exploding the flesh from her
        bones.  Beside her, Terminator is stripped of its burnt flesh,
        becoming a smoking skeleton of steel.

30E     Then she wake up... in her cell, shackled to the bed.  Sunlight hurts
        her eyes.  She looks desperate and defeated.  She knows the war is
        coming.  It visits her every time she closes her eyes.  Lost and
        alone, Sarah feels all hope recede for herself and for humanity.

                right through my eyes... but somehow I can still
                see.  Look, you know the dream's the same every

31A     The REAL SARAH dispassionately watches herself on the screen.  Her
        expression is controlled.  Silberman watches her watching.  They are
        in a brightly-lit interview room.  TWO ATTENDANTS stands nearby.

31B                             VIDEO SARAH
                The children look like burnt paper... black,
                not moving.  Then the blast wave hits them and
                they fly apart like leaves..."

        Video Sarah can't go on.  Real Sarah watches herself cry on tape,
        her expression cold.  We hear Silberman speak on the tape.

                Dreams about cataclysm, or the end of the world,
                are very common, Sarah...

        Video Sarah cuts him off, her mood shifting to sudden rage.

                                VIDEO SARAH
                It's not just a dream.  It's real, you moron!

                        attendant)
                everybody... you're all fucking dead!

        She is raving, half out of her chair.  The orderly moves to inject
        her with something.

                                VIDEO SARAH
                You're the one living in a dream, Silberman,
                not me!  Because I know it happens.  It
                happens!

31C     Silberman pauses the tape... freezing Sarah's contorted face.
        Real Sarah turns away from the screen, he expression stony.

                                SARAH
                I was afraid... and confused.  I feel much
                better, now.  Clearer.

        Silberman gives a calculated paternal smile.

                                SILBERMAN
                Yes.  Your attitude have been very positive
                lately.

        Sarah looks up at him.  Her voice is hopeful.

                                SARAH
                It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something
                to look forward to.

                                SILBERMAN
                And what it that?

        As she answers, WE PULL BACK, revealing that we have been looking
        through a one-way mirror from an adjacent OBSERVATION ROOM.  In the
        shadows of the observation room we see that interns from the
        earlier rounds, and a couple of STAFF PSYCHOLOGISTS.  They smoke and
        make the occasional note.

                                SARAH
                You said I could be transferred to the minimum
                security wing and have visitors if I showed
                improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six
                months, and I was looking forward to seeing my
                son.

                                SILBERMAN
                I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying
                about these terminator machines.  Now you think
                they don't exist?

        CLOSE ON SARAH.  Her voice sounds hollow.

                                SARAH
                They don't exist.  I see that now.

        Silberman leans back, studying her.  Toying with her.

                                SILBERMAN
                But you've told me on many occasions about how
                you crushed one in a hydraulic press.

                                SARAH
                If I had, there would have been some evidence.
                They would have found something at the factory.

                                SILBERMAN
                I see.  So you don't believe anymore that the
                company covered it up?

        Sarah shakes her head no.

33      INT. SECOND FLOOR/ELEVATORS

        The elevator doors slide open with a whisper and MILES DYSON strides
        out.  Black.  In his early thirties.  The star of the Special
        Projects Division.  He's brilliant, aggressive, driven.  Dyson walks
        down the corridor, swinging his arms... a man in a hurry.  A man
        with much to do.

        He reaches a solid security door and zips his ELECTRONIC KEY-CARD
        through the scanner.  The door unlocks with a clunk.
        The sign next to the door reads: SPECIAL PROJECTS DIVISION:
        AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.

        He nods to the guards as he passes through the security checkpoint.
        They can see all activities on the floor on their bank of monitors.
        He unlocks another service door with his card and enters --

35      INT. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (A.I.) LAB

        The lab is quite large, comprising banks of processors, disk drives,
        test bays, prototype assembly areas.  Extremely high tech.

                                DYSON
                Greetings, troops.

        He is jokingly saluted by fellow members.  Not a lab coat in sight.
        This is strictly jeans and sneakers crowd.  All young and bright.
        They sit at their consoles drinking Coke and changing technology as
        we know it.  A young LAB ASSISTANT rushes over to Dyson.  Name tag
        says he's BRYANT.

                                BRYANT
                Mr. Dyson?  The material teams wants to run
                another test on the uh... on it.

                                DYSON
                Yup.  Come on.  I'll get it.

        Dyson produces an unusual-looking KEY from his pocket as they stride
        through the lab.  Bryant has to hustle to keep up.

                                BRYANT
                Listen, Mr. Dyson, I know I haven't been here
                that long, but I was wondering if you could tell
                me... I mean, if you know...

                                DYSON

                Well... where it came from.

                                DYSON
                I asked them that question once.  Know what
                they told me?  Don't ask.

36      INT. VAULT ROOM

        Dyson enters with Bryant.  Dyson and a GUARD stand together before
        what looks like a high-tech bank vault.  It requires two keys to
        open, like the launch controls in a nuclear silo.  The guard and
        Dyson insert their keys and turn them simultaneously.  Dyson then
        enters a passcode at a console and the vault unlocks itself with a
        sequence of clunks.  The door swings open and Dyson enters.  Bryant
        stays outside with the guard, who notes Dyson's name and item on a
        clipboard.

37      INT. VAULT

        Dyson walks to a stainless steel cabinet and opens it.  Inside is a
        small artifact in a sealed container of inert gas.  IT -- a ceramic
        rectangle, about the size of a domino, the color of liver.  It has
        been shattered, painstakingly reconstructed and mounted on a metal
        frame.

        Dyson removes the artifact, it its insert-gas, and sets it on a
        specially-designed cart.  He handles it like the Turin Shroud.
        Dyson closes the cabinet.  Turns to the one next to it.  Opens its
        door.  In this cabinet is a larger object... an intricate METAL HAND
        AND FOREARM.

        At the elbow, the metal is twisted and crushed.  But the forearm and
        hand are intact.  Its metal surface scorched and discolored, it
        stands upright in a vacuum flask, as if saluting.  This is all that
        remains of the terminator Sarah destroyed.  Dyson stares at it, lost
        in thought.  The he closes the cabinet, BLACKING OUT FRAME.

        still watching through the mirror.  Reviewing Sarah's condition.

                                SARAH
                So what do you think, Doctor?  I've shown a lot
                of improvement, haven't I?

                                SILBERMAN
                You see, Sarah... here's the problem.  I know
                how smart you are, and I think you're just
                telling me what I want to hear.  I don't think
                you really believe who you've been telling me
                today.

        We go tight on Sarah's reaction.  And we see that Silberman is right.
        She was playing him and it didn't work.  And she knows she's fucked.
        Her tone becomes quite pleading.

                                SARAH
                You have to let me see my son.  Please.  It's
                very important.  He's in danger.  At least let
                me call him --

        Silberman pins her with his sweet reptilian gaze.

                                SILBERMAN
                I'm afraid not.  Not for a while.  I don't see
                any choice but to recommend to the review board
                that you stay here another six months.

        Sarah's eyes turn cold and lethal in one second.  She knows she's
        lost.  She knows this guy is just playing with her, and she --
        LEAPS ACROSS THE TABLE AT HIM.

                                SARAH
                YOU SON OF A BITCH!!

        Silberman jumps back and the attendants dive on her.  She is writhing
        and twisting like a bobcat.  Silberman whips open a drawer and pulls
        out a syringe.  He jabs it into her and she yells --

        ICBMs deploy their MIRVs... the warheads stream down... it's more than
        he can deal with.  The world gets nuked.  Game over.  He slouches
        away from the game, looking for another.  Bored.

        RACK FOCUS to Officer X passing the entrance of the store behind him.
        The cop moves on, down the concourse, out of sight.
        John gets in an "Afterburner" simulator game.

43B     ON TERMINATOR, walking through the crowd in slow motion.  Scanning.
        He moves with methodical purpose, knowing the target is close.  We
        see that he is, incredibly, carrying a box of LONG-STEM ROSES.  Like
        some hopeful guy with a hot date.

43C     THE COP is pointed toward the arcade by come kids hanging out at the
        multi-cinema.  He walks into the maze of kids engaged in synthesized
        combat.  Cheap electronic effects blare above the crowd noise.

43D     JOHN is shooting down MiGs at Mach 2.  His friend Tim slides up next
        to him.  Taps him on the shoulder, trying to play it cool.

                                TIM
                Some cop is scoping for you, dude.

        John looks around the corner of the "Afterburner" ride.  Sees the cop
        showing a picture to some of the kids.  The kids point his way.

        John ducks just as the cop glances over.  He slinks out the other side
        of the ride and heads for the back of the store, instinctively
        retreating.  Sarah has taught him that cops are bad news.

        THE COP scans the crowded arcade.  Glimpses John, looking back as he
        moves around a row of machines.  Starts toward him.

        JOHN sees the cop homing in and starts walking fast.  Looks back.
        THE COP is shoving through clots of kids.  One of them is slammed to
        the floor.  As eddy of outrage behind the cop as he gains speed.
        John breaks into run.  So does the cop.
        Kids scatter like ten-pins as the cop charges after John.
        John sprints through the arcade's back officer and store-rooms.

44      INT. SERVICE CORRIDOR

        John emerges through a firedoor into a long corridor with connects
        to the parking garage.  He's running full out, when around the corner
        ahead of him comes...

        TERMINATOR.  Time stretches to nightmarish crawl as John tries to
        brake to a stop.  Terminator reaches into the box of roses.

        SLOW MOTION.  The cold back steel of the SHOTGUN emerges at the box
        falls open, the roses spilling to the floor.  TERMINATOR'S BOOT
        crushes the flowers as it moves forward.

        JOHN, transfixed by terror, is trapped in the narrow featureless
        shooting gallery of the corridor.  THE SHOTGUN COMES UP.  Terminator
        expressionlessly strides forward.  Jacks a round into the chamber,
        slow and fluid.

        John looks behind him for a place to run.  Sees the cop coming toward
        him, pulling his Beretta pistol.  Incredibly, John realizes the cop
        is aiming his gun at him!
        John looks back at Terminator.  He is starting into the black muzzle
        of the 10-gauge now.  Aimed right at his head.  He realizes he's
        screwed.  Then something crazy happens...

                                TERMINATOR
                Get down.

        John instinctively ducks.  Terminator pulls the trigger. KABOOM!

        THE COP catches the SHOTGUN'S BLAST square in the chest just as he
        fires the pistol.  The pistol's shot goes wild.

        TERMINATOR pumps another round into him.  The another.  And another.
        Advancing a step each time he fires, he empties the shotgun into the
        cop, blowing his backward down the corridor.  The sound is DEAFENING.
        Then silence.

        THE COP lies still on his back.

44A     Terminator is now standing right over John.  They both watch as the
        cop, incredibly, sits up unharmed and gets to his feet.  Terminator
        grabs John roughly by his jacket.  Clutches the kid to his chest
        then spins around at the cop opens fire with the Beretta.

44B     The "cop", who not only isn't a cop, he clearly isn't even human,
        pulls the trigger so fast it almost seems like a machine-pistol.

        ON TERMINATOR'S BACK, as the 9mm slugs slam into it, punching bloody
        holes in the motorcycle jacket.

        JOHN is bug-eyed with fear, but completely unscratched.  Terminator's
        body has blocked the bullets.

        The Beretta CLACKS empty.  Terminator turns at the sound.
        Shoves John behind a Coke machine.  Drops the empty shotgun.  Starts
        walking toward the "cop".
        The empty magazine clatters to the floor.
        The cop inserts another one.  Snaps back the slide.
        Terminator still has twenty feet to go.
        He doesn't break his purposeful stride.

        The cop opens fire.  Bullets rake Terminator's chest.  He doesn't
        even flinch.
        Ten feet to go.  BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM!  Neither the cop nor Terminator
        show the slightest change in expression as the gun rips Terminator's
        wardrobe to shreds.

        CLACK.  The pistol empties again.  Terminator stops two feet in front
        of the cop.  The appraise each other for a second.

        We realize now that the cop is a terminator too.  We don't know the
        details yet, but let's call him the T-1000 (since that's what he is).
        A newer model than the one we've come to know so well (the 800
        Series "Arnold").  This guy's a prototype... and he's got quite a
        few surprises.

        T-1000 AND TERMINATOR size each other up.  Terminator moves first.
        He grabs T-1000 in his massive hands but the T-1000 snaps back with a
        counter-grip.  After about two seconds of intense slamming, the walls
        on both sides of the corridor have all the plaster smashed in, and
        the two battling machines have blasted through the wall and
        disappeared.

        JOHN, totally stunned by all this, remembers to move.  He staggers to
        his feet.  Stumble-runs toward the parking garage.

44C     THIRD LEVEL CONCOURSE.  A plate glass window EXPLODES and Terminator
        crashes through to the tile floor like a sack of cement amid the
        screaming crowd.

44D     T-1000 turns without a word and heads back through the store after
        John, accelerating slowly into a loping, predatory run.

44E     Terminator is totally still.  A JAPANESE TOURIST cautiously steps
        forward and takes a picture of the body.  Suddenly, Terminator's
        eyes snap open.  The stunned tourist backs away.

        He sits up and looks around.  Gets his bearings.  Rises smoothly to
        his feet.  All servos seem to be working fine.  The tourist's camera
        whirs as the motor-drive runs on by itself, taking shot after show.
        The owner isn't even looking through the eyepiece, he's so shocked.

45      INT. PARKING GARAGE

        John is frantically pumping the kick-start of his bike, scared
        shitless and the damned thing won't start.  His hands are shaking so
        badly he can't find the choke.  He looks up to see --
        The T-1000 running down the corridor toward him.
        John fumbles with the choke.  The bike catches.  He slams it in gear
        and spins the bike out into the main aisle of the garage.

        John looks back... the T-1000 is behind him, running.  He twists the
        throttle and guns the little bike forward.  Incredibly, the T-1000
        is gaining.  This nightmare isn't happening.  John races out the exit
        ramp, and charges right into the street.

46      EXT. STREET

        John shoots into the busy traffic.  Cuts off a BIG-RIG TOW TRUCK.
        The DRIVER swears.  Hits his air horn.  What the driver doesn't see
        is the cop, running faster than O.J. Simpson at the airport, who
        emerges onto the street and runs back at his truck.

46A     IN THE TRUCK.  The driver hears a thump as something slams against his
        door, then feels himself pulled right out.  T-1000 slides in and
        takes his place.  The truck is still rolling along about 25 mph.
        T-1000 accelerates after John without missing a beat.  It can see him,
        up ahead, weaving through traffic.

46B     Out of the garage entrance, Terminator roars onto the street on the
        Harley.
        He accelerates after the others.

47      EXT. FLOOD CONTROL CHANNEL

        John slides his bike down the service ramp faster than he's ever done
        it before.  He races along the bottom of the canal, turning into a
        narrower tributary which has vertical sides.

        He looks back.  No sign of pursuit.
47A     Suddenly he sees the sun blocked out by a great shadow.
        The Kenworth tow-truck... big as a house, all chrome and roaring
        diesel engine... crashes through the fence and launches itself right
        into the center of the canal.

        It crashes down, 15 feet to the ground, going about 60, hits at an
        angle and tears into the concrete wall with a hideous grinding of
        metal.  It ricochets back and forth between the walls then, bellowing
        like a gunshot stegosaurus, it just keep on plowing forward, gathering
        speed.

47B     John looks back and sees this wall of metal almost filling the narrow
        concrete canal and he milks every last bit of throttle the little bike
        has.  The Kenworth is all muscle, tearing along the canal like a train
        in a tunnel.  Its big tires send up huge sheets of muddy spray,
        backlit in the setting sun.  It looks like some kind of demon.  And...
        it's gaining.

47C     ABOVE THEM, on the service road running parallel, Terminator is
        fighting to overtake them.  He looks down and sees John with the tow-
        truck from Hell catching up to him.  It is only about twenty feet
        behind him and still gaining.

47D     ANGLE IN THE CANAL, looking back past a desperate John, at the wall
        of metal filling frame behind him.

47E     ABOVE, Terminator cuts the bike suddenly hard to the left, leaving the
        road.  Hitting an earth embankment just right, he jumps the bike into
        the air like Steve McQueen in "The Great Escape" and vaults the fence
        bordering the canal.  It slams down at the edge of the canal and tears
        along, inches from the drop-off on a dirt path, accelerating past the
        truck in the canal below.

47F     John hits some water and slews momentarily, loosing speed.  The
        massive push-plate on the front of the truck slams into his back
        fender.  Panicked, he pulls a little ahead.  All this is happening at
        about sixty miles and hour.  Top speed for the little dirt bike.

47G     SLOW MOTION as Terminator jumps the bike again.  This time the 700-
        pound Harley sails out into space and drops into the canal.  It arcs
        down between the truck and John, hitting on its wheels.  It bottoms
        out, an explosion of sparks under the frame.  Only the ultra-fast
        reflexes of a machine could keep the bike upright.  Terminator fights
        for control.

47H     He guns the throttle and the powerful bike roars up beside John's tiny
        Honda.
        Terminator sweeps the kid off his machine with one arm and swings him
        onto the Harley, in front of him.  John's Honda weaves and falls,
        smashing instantly under thundering tires.

        The Harley roars ahead.  It hits eighty.  Ahead is an overpass, and
        supporting it is an abutment which bisects the canal into two
        channels.  The Harley thunders into one channel, which is essentially
        a short tunnel.

47I     The truck can't fit on either side.  Neither can it stop, at that
        speed.  Tires locked, it slides on the muddy concrete and piles into
        the concrete abutment at seventy.

47J     Terminator and John emerge from the tunnel, looking back to see a
        fireball blasting through behind them as the truck's side-tanks
        explode.

        Terminator stops the Harley.  John peers around his body to see the
        destruction.  A burning wheel wobbles out of the tunnel and flops in
        the mud.  Terminator revs the bike and they roar away, down the canal,
        disappearing around a bend.

47K     ANGLE ON THE FIRE, as a column of black smoke rises from the overpass.
        Smoke boils from the tunnel as well, and inside it is a solid wall of
        flame.  A figure appears in the fire.
        Just an outline.  Walking slowly... calmly.
        The figure emerges from the flames.

        It is human-shaped but far from human.  A smooth chrome man.  Not a
        servo-mechanism like Terminator is underneath, with its complex
        hydraulics and cables... this thing is a featureless, liquid chrome
        surface, bending seamlessly at knees and elbows as it walks.  It
        reminds us of mercury.  A mercury man.  Its face is simple, unformed.
        Unruffled by thousand-degree heat, it walks toward us.

        With each step detail returns.
        First the shape and lines of its clothing emerge from the liquid
        chrome surface, then finer details... buttons, facial features,
        ears...

47K     But it's still al chrome.  With its last step, the color returns to
        everything.  It is the cop again... handsome young face, blond hair,
        mustache.  Icy eyes.  It stops and looks around.

        It is a perfect chameleon.  A liquid metal robot.  A killing machine
        with the ultimate skills of mimicry for infiltration of human society.

47L     ANGLE NEARBY, as several police cruisers and a fire truck pull up.
        T-1000 climbs out of the canal behind them.  More cops arrive.  T-1000
        blends in perfectly.  There are always cops at diasters and scenes of
        violence.  We now see why its choice of protective mimicry is so
        perfect.
        It walks among the other cops unnoticed.
        Gets into one of the squad cars.  Starts it and drives away.

48      EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT

        Terminator, with John in front of him on the Harley, roars down the
        empty street.  John cranes his neck around to get a look at the
        person/thing he is riding with.  The image is strangely reminiscent
        of father/son, out for an evening ride.

        John is still in shock from the experience of what just happened and
        he's just a ten-year kid, but he's also John Connor who will someday
        rise to greatness, and we see a bit of that in him even know.

                                JOHN
                Whoa... time out.  Stop the bike!

        Terminator immediately complies.  He leans the bike into a turn.
        They head into a nearby alley.

49      EXT. ALLEY

        Terminator and John rolls into the alley and come to a stop.  John
        slides off the gas tank.  Terminator impassively stares at him.  John
        checks him out.  Tentatively speaks.

                                JOHN
                Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are
                a terminator, right?

                                TERMINATOR
                Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.

                                JOHN
                No way!

        John touches Terminator's skin.  Then the blood on his jacket.
        His mind overloads as the reality of it hits him.

                                JOHN
                Holy shit... you're really real!  I mean...
                whoah!
                        (stepping back)
                You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right...
                but sort of alive outside?

                                TERMINATOR
                I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over
                a metal endoskeleton.

                                JOHN
                This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh...
                you're not here to kill me... I figured that part
                out for myself.  So what's the deal?

                                TERMINATOR
                My mission is to protect you.

                                JOHN
                Yeah?  Who sent you?

                                TERMINATOR
                You did.  Thirty years from now you reprogrammed
                me to be your protector here, in this time.

        John gives him an amazed look.

                                JOHN
                This is deep.

50      EXT. STREET - NIGHT

        John and Terminator on the bike again, weaving through the side
        streets.  They blend into the evening traffic.  In the darkness,
        Terminator's wounds are not readily visible.  John cranes his head up
        and back.

                                JOHN
                So this other guy?  He's a terminator too,
                right, like you?

                                TERMINATOR
                Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype.
                A mimetic polyalloy.

                                JOHN
                What does that mean?

                                TERMINATOR
                Liquid metal.

                                JOHN
                Radical.

                                TERMINATOR
                You are targeted for termination.  The T-1000
                will not stop until it complete its mission.
                Ever.

        John mulls that over.

                                JOHN
                Where we going?

                                TERMINATOR
                We have to leave the city, immediately.  And
                avoid the authorities.

                                JOHN
                Can I stop by my house?

                                TERMINATOR
                Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to
                reacquire you there.

                                JOHN
                You sure?

                                TERMINATOR
                I would.

                                                CUT TO:

51      EXT. PAYPHONE

        John is quickly going through his pockets for change.  He has plenty
        of bills but no quarters.

                                JOHN
                Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks but I gotta
                warn them.  Shit!  You got a quarter?

        Terminator reaches past John and smashes the cover plate off the
        phone's cash box with the heel of his hand.  A shower of change
        tumbles out.  Terminator hands one to John.  John dials.

52      INT. VOIGHT HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

        Janelle Voight picks up the kitchen phone and cradles it with her
        shoulder which she continues to chop vegetables with a large knife.
        She answers sweetly.

                                JANELLE
                Hello?

                                JOHN
                        (filtered through phone)
                Janelle?  It's me.

        In the backyard, John's German Shepherd is going bonkers, barking at
        something.

                                JANELLE
                John?  Where are you, honey?  It's late.  You
                should come home, dear.  I'm making a casserole.

        AT THE PAYPHONE.  John listens, an odd look on his face.  He covers
        the phone's mouthpiece and turns to Terminator.

                                JOHN
                        (whispering)
                Something's wrong.  She's never this nice.

        IN THE VOIGHTS' KITCHEN.  Todd comes through the kitchen's back door.
        Just home from work.  He ignores Janelle and opens the fridge.  Grabs
        a carton of milk.  Takes a sip.  Frowns at the dog's barking.

                                TODD
                What the hell's the goddamn dog barking at?
                SHUT UP, YOU MUTT!

        TIGHT ON JANELLE as Todd growls around the kitchen behind her.  He
        passes OUT OF FRAME next to her.  Janelle switches the phone to her
        other hand then... THUNK!  Her free hand seems to do something out of
        frame.  There is a gurgling, and the sound of liquid dribbling onto
        the floor. (Don't go away.  We'll find out what happened in a moment)

        AT THE PAYPHONE

                                JOHN
                The dog's really barking.  Maybe it's already
                there.  What should I do?

        Terminator takes the phone from John's hand.  Janelle's voice is
        floating through the receiver.

                                JANELLE
                        (filtered)
                John?  John, are you okay?

        Terminator speaks into the phone in a perfect imitation of John's
        voice...

                                TERMINATOR
                        (in John's voice)
                I'm right here.  I'm fine.
                        (to John, a whisper)
                What's the dog's name?

                                JOHN
                Max.

        Terminator nods.  Speaks into the phone.

                                TERMINATOR
                Hey, Janelle, what's wrong with Wolfy?  I can
                hear him barking.  Is he okay?

                                JANELLE
                        (filtered)
                Wolfy's fine, honey.  Where are you?

        Terminator unceremoniously hangs up the phone.  Turns to John.

                                TERMINATOR
                Your foster parents are dead.  Let's go.

        Terminator heads for the bike.  John, shocked, stares after him.

53      INT. VOIGHT HOUSE/KITCHEN

        Janelle hangs up the phone.  Her expression is neutral.  Calm.

        PAN OVER along her arm, which is stretched out straight from the
        shoulder.  Partway along its length her arm has turned smoothly into
        something else... a metal cylinder which tapers into a sword-like
        spike.  Now we see Todd Voight PINNED TO A KITCHEN CABINET by the
        spike which has punched through his milk carton, through his mouth
        and exits the back of his head into the cabinet door.  His eyes are
        glassy and lifeless.

        The spike is withdrawn -- SWIISHHTT! -- so rapidly, Todd is actually
        standing there a second before he slumps out of sight.  THUMP.
53A     Janelle doesn't bat an eye as the spike smoothly changes shape and
        color, transforming back into a hand, and then...

53B     JANELLE CHANGES rapidly into the COP we now know as the T-1000.  The
        change has liquid quality.  T-1000 opens the back door.

54      EXT. VOIGHT HOUSE/BACKYARD - NIGHT

        T-1000 approaches the big German Shepherd, which slinks away from it,
        barking in fear.  T-1000 walk right into CLOSE UP.  Reaches down, OUT
        OF FRAME.  We hear that sickening THUNK followed by a shrill YELP.
        Then T-1000's hand snaps up INTO FRAME holding a bloody dog collar.
        The tag reads "MAX".
        T-1000 nods thoughtfully.  Heads back to the house.

55      EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

        Dark.  Off a quiet street.  Terminator stands near the Harley,
        watching John pace before him.  John's brain is calling time-out.
        This is all too weird.

                                JOHN
                I need a minute here, okay?  You're telling me
                it can imitate anything it touches?

                                TERMINATOR
                Anything it samples by physical contact.

        John thinks about that, trying to grasp their opponent's parameters.

                                JOHN
                Like it could disguise itself as anything...
                a pack of cigarettes?

                                TERMINATOR
                No.  Only an object of equal size.

        John's still reeling from meeting one terminator, which now seems
        downright conventional next to the exotic new model.

                                JOHN
                Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to
                get me?

                                TERMINATOR
                It can't form complex machines.  Guns and
                explosives have chemicals, moving parts.  It
                doesn't work that way.  But it can form solid
                metal shapes.

56      INT. VOIGHT HOUSE - NIGHT

        T-1000 walks down the dark hall.  It passes the bathroom and we see
        the real Janelle's legs through the half-open door.  The shower is
        running.  Her blood mixes with water on the white tile floor.

56A     In John's bedroom the T-1000 begins searching methodically in the
        dark.
        Calmly and dispassionately ripping the room apart for any clues that
        could lead it to its target.  T-1000 finds a box of audio cassettes
        marked "Messages from Mom".  In it are some letters, and envelopes
        filled with snapshots.  It begins looking through some of the
        photos...

        SHOT OF JOHN AND SARAH during the missing years.  Sarah in olive
        cammos with an RPG 7 grenade launcher, teaching John how to aim.
        Sarah with a group of military-clad Guatemalan men, standing next to
        cases of Stinger missiles.  John and Sarah in a Contra camp, deep in
        the mountains.

57      EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

        John is now sitting on the curb, lost in stunned thought.  Terminator
        stands above him, watching the street like a Doberman.  He glances
        down at John.

                                JOHN
                We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua... places
                like that.  For a while she was with this crazy
                ex-Green Beret guy, running guns.  Then there
                were some other guys.  She'd shack up with
                anybody she could learn from.  So then she
                could teach me how to be this great military
                leader.  Then she gets busted and it's like...
                sorry kid, your mom's a psycho.  Didn't you
                know?  It's like... everything I'd been brought
                up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right?
                I hated her for that.
                        (he looks up)
                But everything she said was true.
                        (he stands)
                We gotta get her out of there.

                                TERMINATOR
                Negative.  The T-1000's highest probability for
                success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and
                wait for you to make contact with her.

                                JOHN
                Oh, great.  And what happens to her?

        Terminator's reply is matter-of-fact.

                                TERMINATOR
                Typically, the subject being copied is
                terminated.

                                JOHN
                TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me?
                We gotta right now!

                                TERMINATOR
                Negative.  She is not a mission priority.

                                JOHN
                Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!

        John strides away.  Terminator goes after him and grabs him arm.
        John struggles against the grip.  Which doesn't do him much good.

                                JOHN
                Hey, goddammit!  What's your problem?

        Starts dragging John back to the bike.  John spots a couple of
        collage-age slab-o-meat JOCK-TYPES across the street and starts
        yelling to them.

                                JOHN
                Help!  HELP!!  I'm being kidnapped!  Get this
                psycho off of me!

        The TWO JOCKS start toward him.  John yells in outrage to Terminator.

                                JOHN
                Let go of me!!

        To his surprise, Terminator's hand opens so fast John falls right on
        his butt.
        He looks up at the open hand.

                                JOHN
                Oww!  Why'd you do that?

                                TERMINATOR
                You told me to.

        John stares at him in amazement as he realizes...

                                JOHN
                You have to do what I say?!

                                TERMINATOR
                That is one of my mission parameters.

                                JOHN
                Prove it... stand on one foot.

        Terminator expressionlessly lifts one leg.
        John grins.  He's the first on his block...

                                JOHN
                Cool!  My own terminator.  This is great!

        The two guys get there and look at Terminator standing there calmly
        with one leg up in the air.  This big guy in black leather and dark
        glasses, standing like a statue.

                                FIRST JOCK
                Hey, kid.  You okay?

        John turns to him.  No longer needing to be rescued.

                                JOHN
                Take a hike, bozo.

                                FIRST JOCK
                Yeah?  Fuck you, you little dipshit.

                                JOHN
                Dipshit?  Did you say dipshit?!
                        (to Terminator)
                Grab this guy.

        Terminator complies instantly, hoisting him one-handed by the collar.
        the guy's legs are pinwheeling.

                                JOHN
                Now who's the dipshit, you jock douchebag?

        Immediately, things get out of hand.  The guy's friend jumps behind
        Terminator and tries to grab him in a full nelson --
        Terminator throws the first guy across the hood of a car --
        Grabs the second by the hair, whips out his .45 in a quick blur, and
        aims the muzzle at the guy's forehead.
        John grabs Terminator's arm with a yell as he pulls the trigger --
        John's weight is just enough to deflect the gun a few inches.  The
        guy flinches, stunned by the K-BOOM next to his ear.  He stares,
        shocked.  Pissing himself.  John is freaking out, too.
        He screams at Terminator.

                                JOHN
                Put the gun down!  NOW!!

        Terminator sets the .45 on the sidewalk.  John scoops it up fast then
        turns to the shocked civilians, who can't believe what just happened.

                                JOHN
                Walk away.

        They do.  Fast.  John grabs Terminator by the arm and tugs him toward
        the bike.  John still holds the gun, reluctant to give it back.

                                JOHN
                Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!

                                TERMINATOR
                Of course.  I'm a terminator.

        John stares at him.  Having your own terminator just became a little
        bit less fun to him.

                                JOHN
                Listen to me, very carefully, okay?  You're not
                a terminator any more.  Alright?  You got that?
                You can't just go around killing people!

                                TERMINATOR
                Why?

                                JOHN
                Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!

                                TERMINATOR
                Why?

                                JOHN
                You just can't, okay?  Trust me on this.

        Terminator doesn't get it.  John just stares at him.  Frightened at
        what just almost happened.  He gets a glimpse of the responsibility
        that comes with power.  Finally he hands the .45 back to Terminator,
        who puts it away.

                                JOHN
                Look, I'm gonna go get my mom.  You wanna come
                along, that's fine with me.

                                                CUT TO:

58      INT. VOIGHT HOUSE/BEDROOM - NIGHT

        T-1000 finds an envelope... a letter from Sarah to John sent since
        she's been at Pescadero State Hospital.  It reads the return address
        on the envelope.  It has what it needs.  It picks up a tape player
        and the battered shoebox full of Sarah's tapes and exits.

                                                CUT TO:

59      CLOSE ON A BLACK & WHITE PHOTOGRAPH.  The image is a nightmare from
        the past.  It is a surveillance camera still-frame from the L.A.
        police station where the first terminator made such an impression in
        1984.  We see the blurry forms of the cop frozen in the emergency
        lights of a burning corridor.

        A black-clad figure stands at the end of the corridor.  The guy has
        short-cropped hair and dark glasses.  An AR-80 assault rifle in one
        hand, and a 12-gauge in the other -- holding them both like toy
        pistols.
        ANOTHER PHOTO is slapped on top of the first.  Another still-frame
        blow-up is placed over the last.  Terminator looms in CLOSEUP.

                                DETECTIVE WEATHERSBY (O.S.)
                These were taken at the West Highland police
                station in 1984.  You were there.

        WIDER.  We're in --

59A     INT. INTERVIEW ROOM/PESCADERO - NIGHT

        The photos are lying on the table in front of Sarah, placed there by
        DETECTIVE WEATHERSBY.  His partner DET. MOSSBERG, and Dr. Silberman,
        sit at the table as well.  Two uniformed cops, plus Douglas, stand by
        the door.  Sarah stares listlessly at the top photo.  She's
        withdrawn, haggard... drugged-looking.

                                MOSSBERG
                He killed seventeen police officers that night.
                Recognize him?

        Weathersby slaps another black-and-white eight-by-ten on the table.
        A closeup of Terminator taken by the Japanese tourist at the mall.
        It's the same face.

                                MOSSBERG
                This one was taken by a Japanese tourist today.

        Sarah doesn't react.  It's hard to tell she's thinking.  Whether she's
        up hope or is just in a drugged stupor.

                                WEATHERSBY
                Ms. Connor, you've been told that your son's
                missing.  His foster parents have been murdered,
                and we know this guy's involved.  Talk to us.
                Don't you care?

        Sarah stares up at him.  A cold and empty stare.  He glances at
        Silberman.
        Then at his partner.

                                MOSSBERG
                We're wasting out time.

        One of the uniformed cops opens the door and Mossberg strides into
        the hall.  Weathersby and the two uniforms follow him out, with
        Silberman right behind.

                                SILBERMAN
                Sorry, gentleman...

        TIGHT ON SARAH, slumped under the bright lights.  Totally out of it.
        Then we see her hand, creeping along the edge of the table toward the
        stack of photos.  She slips off the paper clip binding the stills
        together, and hides it between her fingers.  Douglas jerks her up by
        the arms and leads her out.

                                                CUT TO:

60      INT. SARAH'S CELL

        Douglas inches up the last of Sarah's restraints.  Then her leans
        over her... looking down.  Even wrecked as she is, we see the beauty
        in her face.  He bends down.  We think he's going to kiss her.
        Instead he runs his tongue across her face like a dog would.  She
        seems not to even see him.  Her dull eyes past him.  He can't
        provoke a reaction.  Even here, strapped down, the two of them alone,
        she give him no superiority.  He smirks and leaves.  We hear the
        sound of his night-stick tapping its way down the corridor, growing
        fainter.

        Sarah's eyes snap suddenly alert.  There is intensity and resolve in
        them.  She slips the paper clip out from between her fingers and
        awkwardly spreads it open into a straight piece of wire.  With slow,
        painful concentration she moves it toward the lock of the restraints
        that bind her wrists to the bed at her sides.

                                                CUT TO:

61      EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

        Terminator and John charge through the night on the Harley.
        Streetlights flare past them like comets.  Two serious guys with a
        mission.  One a ten-year old kid, the other a half-man/half-machine
        cyborg from the post-Apocalyptic future.

                                                CUT TO:

62      INT. SARAH'S CELL

        TIGHT ON RESTRAINT LOCK as it unlatches... successfully picked by
        Sarah's paper clip.  This is not an easy thing to do.  But Sarah
        taught herself a lot of things in her years of hiding.

        SARAH, her hands free, sits up and releases the Velcro straps on her
        feet.  She rolls off the bed and we see her in a whole new light.
        She is totally alert, almost feral in her movements.

                                                CUT TO:

63      EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE

        GUARD SHACK.  A bored security guard glances up as an LAPD black-and-
        white pulls up.  He raises the barricade and nods at the T-1000/cop
        as it passes.

        THE CRUISER pulls in next to the other police vehicles.  The T-1000
        walks toward the main entrance.

                                                CUT TO:

64      INT. SARAH'S CELL/CORRIDOR

        Sarah is using the paper clip on the door lock.  She hears an echoing
        tapping sound.  It's getting louder, coming her way.  She goes back
        to work on the lock.

65      IN THE CORRIDOR.  Douglas the attendant is tapping his stick along
        the wall like he does every night on his rounds.  He shines a little
        mag-light in the windows of the cells as he passes, barely slowing.

65A     He rounds the corner.  His footsteps echo in the dark hallway.
        The tip of the stick hits the wall.
        Tap, tap, tap... getting closer to Sarah's cell.  He stops at the
        door.  He is about to shine his light in when he notices that a
        utility closet across the hall is open.  He goes to shut it,
        absently flicking his light into the dark closet.  He notices
        something strange among the buckets and cleaning supplies.  A mop lies
        on the floor, with its handle snapped off about halfway up.  The
        other half is missing.

        Douglas ponders this for half a second, then hears a SOUND behind him
        and spins around.  The sound he heard was Sarah's cell door.
        The missing two feet of MOP HANDLE fill his vision as it CRACKS
        viciously across the bridge of his nose.

        250 pounds of doughy attendant hit the floor like a sack of cement.
        Sarah slams the makeshift baton down expertly across the back of his
        head, bouncing him off the linoleum.  Lights out, Douglas.
        She drags him into her cell and locks him in with his own keys.  Then
        swaps her mop-handle for his nice heavy night-stick.

65B     Sarah moves down the dark corridor, cat-stepping in her bare feet.
        She holds the baton like a pro, laid back along the forearm, police-
        style.  She looks dangerous.

                                                CUT TO:

66      INT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE/CORRIDOR

        A long corridor ends at a reception area, which is closed, and a
        NIGHT RECEIVING DESK, which is a glass window where they can buzz you
        in through a heavy door.  A NIGHT NURSE types at a desk nearby.  She
        looks up at the sound of footsteps and sees a young cop (T-1000)
        walking toward her.

                                T-1000
                You have a Sarah Connor here?

        She assumes he's with the other cops.  Smiles.

                                NIGHT NURSE
                Running late, aren't you?

        She turns to the inner door to buzz him in and sees Silberman and the
        cops coming toward the door from the other side.

                                NIGHT NURSE
                Your friends are on their way out now...

        When she turns back to the window, T-1000's no longer there.  She
        goes to the counter and leans out to see if he's at the drinking
        fountain or someplace.  No.  Reception is empty.  And so is the long
        corridor beyond.  She frowns.  Too weird.

66A     Silberman comes through the solenoid door with Mossberg and
        Weathersby, the two uniformed cops, and the hospital security guard.
        The guard retrieves his 9mm pistol from a lock-out box behind the
        night desk.  Silberman faces him.

                                SILBERMAN
                Lewis, see these gentleman out and them lock
                up for the night.

        The security guard nods.  Silberman goes back into the secure area of
        the hospital and the cops walk down the long corridor to the main
        doors.  No sign of T-1000.  Mossberg and the other cops exit, and
        the guard locks the door behind them.

66B     The guard walks slowly back along the long corridor.  The hall is
        dark, with the light at the night desk far ahead like a sanctuary.
        His footsteps ring hollowly on the tile floor.  His keys jingle.

66C     ANGLE ON FLOOR as the guard's feet pass through FRAME.  An instant
        later the floor starts to move.
        It shivers and bulges upward like a liquid mass, still retaining the
        two-tone checkerboard of the tile.  It hunches up silently into a
        quivering shadow in the darkness past the guard.

66D     Up ahead we hear typing.  The night nurse has her back to us, working.
        The guard stops as the drinking fountain.  Bends to take a sip.
        Behind him the fluid mass as reaches six feet of height and begins to
        resolve rapidly into a human figure.  It loses the color and texture
        of the tile and becomes... THE GUARD.

        T-1000's mass has been spread out a quarter of an inch thick over
        several square yards of floor.  The guard walked over the T-1000, and
        his structure was sampled that instant.  Now we see it drawing in and
        pulling up to form the figure of the guard.

        The T-1000/Guard's feet are the last to form, the last of the "liquid
        floor" pulling in to form shiny black guard shoes.  The shoes detach
        with a faint sucking sound from the real floor as the T-1000/Guard
        takes its first step.

66E     The real guard spins at the sound of footsteps to see... himself.
        He has one deeply disturbing moment to consider the ramifications of
        that.  Then he sees his double calmly raise its hand and,
        inexplicably, points his right index finger directly at the real
        guard's face, about a foot away.  In a split second, the finger
        spears out, elongating into a thin steel rod which snaps out like a
        stiletto, slamming into the guard's eye.
        It punches into the corner of the eye, past the eyeball like a trans-
        orbital lobotomy tool, and emerges from the back of the guard's skull.

        Life quietly empties from the guard's face.  He is dead weight,
        hanging from the rod/finger with suddenly reacts -- SSSNICK.  As the
        guard slumps, the T-1000 takes his weight easily with one hand and
        walks him, like it's carrying a suit on a hanger, back toward the
        night desk.  The wounds are so tiny, no blood drips onto the floor.

66F     ON THE NIGHT NURSE, glancing up as the T-1000/Guard walks past,
        dragging something casually which she can't see because it's below
        the countertop.

                                NIGHT NURSE
                Whatcha got, Lewis?

                                T-1000/GUARD
                Just some trash.

        She nods, uninterested.  Keeps typing.  T-1000 moves past, dragging
        the unseen guard toward a closet down the hall from the night
        receiving station.  T-1000/Guard removes the Browning High-Power
        pistol and the keys from the real guard's belt, then stuffs the body
        into the utility closet.

66G     INT. CORRIDOR/NIGHT RECEIVING DESK

        T-1000/Guard comes back out and glances at the nurse.

                                T-1000/GUARD
                All set.

        She glances toward it.  Sees the Beretta in its holster.

                                NIGHT NURSE
                Gotta check the gun first, Lewis.

                                T-1000/GUARD
                Yeah, sorry.

        T-1000 opens the locker and blocks it from her view with its body as
        it mimes putting the gun in.

66H     CLOSE ANGLE ON T-1000'S CHEST, from inside the locker.  Instead of
        setting the gun in the locker, it inserts the pistol into it own
        chest, where is disappears inside like it was dropped into a pot of
        hot fudge.  It withdraws its hand.  The chest is once again a surface
        that looks like cloth, buttons, name-tag etc.  You'd ever guess it was
        really an intelligent liquid metal.

        T-1000 slams the locker door and waits as the nurse hits the button
        unlocking the door with a BUZZ-CLACK.  T-1000/Guard goes through.

                                                CUT TO:

67      INT. ISOLATION SECURITY CHECKPOINT

        A small room before a short SALLY-PORT corridor designed to prevent
        violent inmates from making a run for it.  There are doors at each
        end.  The first one is barred like a jail-cell door, and the second
        is a steel fire door.  The attendants have a video monitor with which
        they can see the corridor on the other side of the doors.

        The two bored attendants barely notice the T-1000/Guard as it
        approaches.  Looks briefly at a chart next to the door, seeing
        SARAH CONNOR is in #19.

67A     IN THE ISOLATION WARD, the T-1000 passes a nurses' station which looks
        a cage, walled in by heavy metal mesh.  Silberman, leaning in the open
        doorway, is talking to an attendant in the cage.  He doesn't glance
        twice at Lewis the Guard passing by.

68      SARAH, moving like a ghost in the darkened corridor, hears footsteps
        coming and quietly but quickly unlocks a cell next to her with
        Douglas' master key.
68A     She slips into the cell and waits as the footsteps pass.
        We glimpse the T-1000/Guard pass the window.
        She waits as the footsteps fade away.  She looks over.  A female
        inmate, strapped to a bed, watches her with bird-like eyes.  She puts
        a finger to her lips -- SSHHH.  The inmate nods.  Sarah exits.

68B     POV MOVING TOWARD nurse's station.  We hear Silberman's voice,
        reviewing medication with the night attendant.

        ON SILBERMAN, yawning, looking at his watch.
        He turns to go... Sarah is there.
        She slams into him, hurling him through the door into the cage and
        follows him in.  The orderly jumps up, going for his stunner, but she
        nails him with Douglas' baton.  WHAP-WHAP-WHAP!  You can barely see
        the thing she's swinging it so fast.  The guys goes down.

        Silberman lunges for the alarm button and she cracks down hard on his
        arm.  He cries out and grabs his wrist.
        She grabs him by the hair and slams him face down on the desk,
        smacking him behind the knees expertly with the baton.
        His legs buckle and he drops to his knees with his chin on the desk.
        She pins him with one hand.  He face is full of outraged disbelief.

                                SILBERMAN
                You broke my arm!

                                SARAH
                There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker.
                That's one.  Now don't move!

68B     Moving rapidly, she whips open a medication drawer and grabs a
        syringe.
        They keep a few of these handy for tranking unruly patients.  She
        jams it into the orderly's butt and fires the whole shot.  Still
        holding the empty syringe, she sees what she need next.
        They keep the toxic cleaning supplies in here to keep the inmates from
        drinking Drano.  She grabs a plastic jug of LIQUID PLUM'R and slams
        it down on the desk inches from Silberman's eyes.

        She jams the empty syringe into the plastic jug.
        Draws back the plunger.  The syringe fills with blue liquid.
        She whips it out of the jug and jams the needle into Silberman's neck.
        His horrified eyes rack toward it.  10 cc's of blue death fill the
        cylinder.
        Her thumb hovers over the plunger.
        She jerks him to his feet by the collar and gets a tight grip on him,
        then hauls him through the door.

69      IN THE CORRIDOR outside cell #19 the T-1000 stops and looks in the
        window.  Douglas, his face a bloody mess, yells to be heard.

                                DOUGLAS
                Open the door!  The goddamn bitch is loose in
                the halls!

        To Douglas' amazement, Lewis the Guard turns impassively and walks
        away, leaving him shouting soundlessly at the window.

                                                CUT TO:

70      EXT. HOSPITAL

        Terminator and John are approaching the guard gate on the Harley.
        They can see the guard inside looks up at the sound of the engine.

                                JOHN
                Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone,
                right?

                                TERMINATOR
                Right.

        John looks at him.  He's not convinced.

                                JOHN
                Swear.

                                TERMINATOR
                What?

                                JOHN
                Just say "I swear I won't kill anyone."

        John holds his hand up, like he's being sworn in.  Terminator stares
        at John a beat.  Then mimics the gesture.

                                TERMINATOR
                I swear I will not kill anyone.

        Terminator stops the bike and gets off.
        The guard, sensing trouble, has his gun drawn as he comes out of the
        shack.  Terminator walks toward him drawing his .45 smoothly.  BLAM!
        He shoots the guard accurately in the thigh.
        The guy drops, screaming and clutching his leg.
        Terminator kicks the guard's gun away, then smashes the phone in the
        shack with his fist.  He pushes the button to raise the gate and walks
        back to the bike.

                                TERMINATOR
                He'll live.

        Terminator climbs onto the bike.  They drive toward the hospital,
        heading down an ambulance ramp to an underground receiving area.

71      INT. ISOLATION FLOOR

        The attendants at the security checkpoint look up at the monitor as
        someone enters the corridor.  They see Sarah, holding Silberman at
        syringe-point.
        Sarah speaks to them through an intercom on the wall.  Her voice
        comes through the speaker.

                                SARAH
                Open it or he'll be dead before he hits the
                floor.

        The attendants' adrenaline levels just went off the scale.  The first
        attendant shakes him head no.  The amperage here is really high.  The
        second attendant keys the intercom switch.

                                2ND ATTENDANT
                There's no way, Connor.  Let him go.

        Silberman's face is the color of suet.

                                SILBERMAN
                It won't work, Sarah.  You're no killer.  I don't
                believe you'd do it.

        Her voice is a deadly cold hiss.

                                SARAH
                You're already dead, Silberman.  Everybody here
                dies.  You know I believe that.  So don't fuck
                with me!

                                SILBERMAN
                Open the goddamn door!

        The attendants looks at one another.  One of them hits the solenoid
        button.  The far door unlocks.

71A     IN THE LOCKOUT CORRIDOR.  Sarah pushes Silberman ahead of her.
        The nearer, barred door must be unlocked manually.
        One of the attendants cautiously approaches.  Nervously unlocks it.

                                SARAH
                Step back!
        
        He does.  She faces both of them.

                                SARAH
                Down on the floor!  Now!

        They comply.  She comes through with Silberman, giving them a wide
        berth.  Starts backing down the hall away from them, still holding
        her hostage.  She's actually pulling this off.

71B     ANGLE FROM BEHIND HER.  What we can see, but she can't see, it a
        third orderly waiting just around the corner.  He's poised, ready to
        jump her when she comes abreast of him.

        ON SARAH backing up.  She reaches the corner.
        The third attendant lunges, grabbing her syringe-hand.
        Sarah spins on the orderly and catches him across the throat with the
        nightstick.  He loses interest fast, dropping to his knees and
        gagging.  Silberman pulls away, screaming at the top of his lungs

                                SILBERMAN
                Get her!

        They scramble up as Sarah takes off like a shot around the corner.
        One of them hits the panic button and ALARMS begin to sound.

72      IN THE ISOLATION WARD, the T-1000 is looking in at a very stoned
        attendant inside the nurses' station when the alarms shriek through
        the halls.  It reaches into its chest and pulls out the 9mm pistol.
        Heads for the security entrance.

73      IN ANOTHER CORRIDOR in the maze of the vast hospital, Sarah flies
        past us, her bare feet slapping on the cold tiles.  The orderlies
        charge after her.
        She's like an animal in a maze.  She turns the corner, glancing off
        the wall, and sprints on without slowing.  She reaches a steel door.
        Tries it.  Locked.
        Footsteps like a drum solo behind her.

        She fumbles with Douglas' keys, breathing hard.  Jams the master in.
        The orderlies are bearing down on her at full tilt.
        Sarah gets the door open.  Dives through.  Slams it.
        She turns a deadbolt knob just as the first orderly grabs the latch
        on the other side.  He's too late.

        Sarah sees them beyond the window, fumbling with their keys.

73A     Sarah is in another sally-port corridor.  A jail-cell type barred
        door is between her and the corridors of the ward beyond.
        She sprints to the walls of bars, jams her key into the door.
        She unlocks and pulls open this door just as she hears the latch of
        the one she just came through being unlocked.

        She flings herself frantically through the barred door as the first
        orderly comes through behind her.
        She slams the bars shut.  CLANG.
        Her keys are dangling from the lock on the other side from her.
        The orderly is racing at her, white-lipped with rage.

        She reaches back through the bars, turns the key, and purposefully
        snaps it off in the lock.  An instant later the big orderly slams
        against the door, grabbing through the bars for her as she dances
        back just out of reach.
        He lunges against the steel bars, unbelievably pissed off.

        Sarah takes off running, looking back at the frustrated orderlies.
        They're shouting at each other, unable to fit their keys into the
        lock --
        The broken-off key tip makes it impossible to get their keys in.
        Silberman shouts at them.

                                SILBERMAN
                Go around, goddamnit!  Go around!!

        The orderlies run back the way they came, and along a cross-corridor
        to another set of doors.

73B     ON SARAH as she rounds a corner and sees the elevators ahead.
        Now she's home-free.  At a full-tilt sprint, she's nearly there when
        the elevator doors part...

        TERMINATOR steps out... his head swivels to face her.
        Sarah reacts, stricken by the image from her worst nightmares.
        Her eyes go wide as momentum carries her forward.
        Her bare feet slip on the slick tile.  She slams to the floor,
        staring up at the leather-clad figure with the shotgun.

        She loses all semblance of courage and some of her sanity.
        She's not even aware that she is screaming, or what would be
        screaming if she could get the breath to do it.
        In slowed-down dream-time, Sarah scrambles back along the floor like a
        crab, spinning and clawing her way to her feet along the wall.

        She runs like the wind, like in her nightmare.  If she looked back she
        would have seen John step warily out of the corridor behind
        Terminator.  John, however, catches a glimpse of the fleeing Sarah and
        figures out instantly what happened.

                                JOHN
                Mom!!  Wait!

        Sarah doesn't hear.  She has clicked fully into her own nightmare.
        They take off running after Sarah.

73C     She is pelting down the long corridor, back the way she came.  As she
        reaches an intersection with a cross-corridor a white-clad figure
        blurs from that corridor.  The orderly hits her in a flying tackle.
        She skids across the floor, shrieking and struggling.  The other two
        orderlies leap into the fray.

                                SARAH
                No!  Help me!  Goddamnit, it's gonna kill us
                all!!!

        She is shouting, pleading, trying to get them to understand what is
        coming.  They grab her thrashing arms and legs.  They don't even look
        where the out-of-control woman is pointing... back along the corridor.

        They have pinned her to the cold tiles, a ring of faces above her.
        Silberman leans down to her, holding a syringe with a heavy dose of
        trank.  Sarah cranes her neck and sees the dark silhouette of
        Terminator coming up behind them.  It is exactly her nightmare.
        She screams in utter hopelessness.

        Terminator, holding the shotgun in one hand, reaches down and grabs
        one of the orderlies with his other hand.  He hurls the 200-pound
        guys against the far wall of the corridor.  SMACK!  He drops to the
        floor.
        The other two orderlies react instantly, leaping onto the intruder.
        Terminator seems to disappear for a moment under the two big guys.
        Then there is an explosion of white-clad figures, as the orderlies are
        flung outward like they stepped on a land mine.
        One crashes through a window of safety glass and is caught before a
        two-story fall by the outer steel bars.  The other crashes through an
        office door, splintering it into kindling.

        Silberman has jumped to hold Sarah.  He is grabbed by a roll of skin
        at the back of his neck and lifted like a cat.  The doctor feel his
        feet pedaling above the ground.  He looks into the expressionless
        face.  And it hit him.  Sarah was right... this guy isn't human.
        He feels the fabric of reality crumbling.
        Then he feels himself flying through the air.  The wall smacks him,
        then the floor kicks him in the face.  He decides to lie there a
        second.

        Sarah blinks, staring up at the figure looming over her.
        John kneels next to her.

                                JOHN
                Mom, are you okay?

        She looks from Terminator to John.  Back to Terminator.
        Is this a nightmare?  Or has she finally gone truly bad?

        Incredibly, Terminator politely reaches his hand down to her, offering
        to help her up.  The last thing she ever expected to see.

                                TERMINATOR
                Come with me if you want to live.

        The orderlies are stirring.

                                JOHN
                It's all right, Mom.  He's here to help.

        Sarah, is a daze, takes the huge hand in her shaking fingers.
        Terminator lifts her to her feet.

73D     John sees a GUARD standing thirty feet away, on the other side of the
        walls of bars.  John doesn't know what we know, but he knows
        something's not right with this guy.  Terminator turns to follow
        John's gaze.
        The T-1000 had its pistol in its hand, at its side.
        Terminator pushes John behind him.  They start backing up.

73E     The T-1000 walks forward, reaching the bars.  It doesn't stop.
        Its body divides like jello around the bars.  As it squeezes itself
        through like metal playdough, its surface reforms perfectly on our
        side.  We see it deform and squeeze through like a viscous paste
        forced past an obstacle.
        Silberman has recovered enough to be sitting up and watching this.
        That faint snapping sound is his mind.
        There is a CLANK and we see that the guard's gun has caught against
        the bars... the only solid object.  The T-1000 turns its wrist and
        tries again, slipping the gun endwise through the gap.

73F     Sarah is agape.  Not reacting.  It's been a heavy day for her.
        Terminator grabs John by the seat of his pants and hooks him up onto
        his back.  John grabs him around the neck.  Terminator raises the
        shotgun and starts backing up.

                                TERMINATOR
                Go!  Run!

        Sarah doesn't need to be told twice.
        T-1000 walks toward them, opening fire with the Browning Hi-Power.
        Terminator straight-arms the 12-guage like a pistol and FIRES.
        The stunned orderlies flop face down on the floor as the corridor is
        filled with high-velocity lead.  One of them, stupidly running for the
        cross-corridor, gets hit by the T-1000.

        Terminator is hammered by several slugs, and the T-1000 is cratered
        by two buckshots hits.  It staggers, but comes on.  In the craters
        we see bright mercury before they close and reseal, disappearing in a
        second.

73G     Terminator makes it around the corner and breaks into a run.  Ahead,
        Sarah is already at the elevator.  Terminator and John pile in and
        John slaps the button for "Garage Level".

        The doors start to close.  T-1000 clears the corner.
        Terminator slams John and Sarah back against the side walls as the
        T-1000 charges at them, rapid firing the Browning.
        The rounds hit the steel doors as they close.
        T-1000 keeps pumping them at the closing gap.
73H     Inside, they see the backside of the doors denting with the hits that
        are punching holes in the other side.

73I     The Browning locks open, empty.  T-1000 drops it without a glance
        back.  The doors close.  K-WHAM!  The T-1000 hits them a split second
        later.  The elevator hasn't moved yet.  SSWWIKK!

73J     A sword-like blade rams through in between the doors, forcing them
        open.  Terminator jams the shotgun through the widening gap.  Punches
        the muzzle right INTO T-1000's face -- BOOM!!
73K     We get a glimpse of the T-1000's head blown apart by the blast.  It
        is hurtled back.  The doors close.  The car descends.

73L     ON THE T-1000, outside the elevator.  Its head, which is blown apart
        into two doughy masses lying on the shoulders, reforms quickly.
        There is no trace of the injury.  It sees the closed door and jams its
        hands between them, its fingertips becoming pry-bars.  It pulls the
        doors apart with inhuman strength
73M     and LEAPS INTO THE OPEN SHAFT.
        It falls two floors and...

74      IN THE ELEVATOR.  Out trio hears a loud THUMP on the roof.
        Terminator, reloading the shotgun, looks up.
        Sarah grabs the .45 from his waistband and aims it at the ceiling.
        BEAT...
        Then CLANGG!! a swordlike shaft punches through the ceiling and spears
        down four feet into the elevator car.
        It is inches from Sarah's face.
        She opens fire, BAM-BAM-BAM -- right through the roof.
        Lighting-fast the lance withdraws and thrusts down again, slashing
        Terminator's jacket, and missing John by inches.
        Terminator chambers a round and K-BOOM! the 12-guage opens a hole in
        the ceiling.
        Terminator rocks out in a fury of firing/cocking/firing as the metal
        shafts slash down again and again.  Sarah yells in pain as one of them
        slices open her upper arm.

75      The doors open.  Sarah pulls John out as soon as the gap is wide
        enough.
        They emerge into the basement.  We see the Harley parked nearby.

        Terminator, in a rearguard action, fires another blast through the
        ceiling and runs out.  He throws his leg over the Harley, kicks it to
        life with one powerful stroke and then whips something out of the
        inner pocket of his jacket.  He throws it to John.  A road flare!?

76      In the elevator, the T-1000 has bashed a hole in the ceiling big
        enough to...
        Pour itself through.
        A massive blob of mercury extrudes from the opening.  The mass drops
        through the hole, down out of frame, then comes back up into frame
        as Officer X.

        It seems to need just a second to get its mental act together after
        doing this king of taffy-pull with itself.  It opens its eyes and
        sees --

77      TERMINATOR, the shot gun held in his teeth, astride the roaring
        Harley twenty feet away.  Terminator twists the throttle and pops the
        clutch.
        The back tire screams on the concrete.  The front wheel lifts off the
        ground and the heavy bike launches in a thundering wheelie.

        Terminator gets off just before the bike hurtles into the elevator.
        The Harley slams the T-1000 square and smashes it right through the
        back wall of the elevator.
        Terminator rolls to his feet.
        Johns strikes the flare on the concrete.  Tosses it.
        Terminator catches the life flare with one hand.
        Levels the shotgun with the other.
        With his last round he blows a big hole in the bike's gas tank.
        Gas splashes everywhere, covering the struggling T-1000.
        Terminator tosses the flare.  KA-VOOOM!

        The explosion knocks Terminator backward off his feet, enveloping him
        in the fireball.  He gets up, smoking, and runs after John and Sarah
        toward the exit ramp.

78      AT THE EXIT RAMP.  They are partway up when a blue-and-white hospital
        security car comes screeching down the other way.
        Without breaking stride Sarah runs right at the car.  It skids to a
        shrieking halt.  She's in the guy's face with the .45 in both hands.

                                SARAH
                Out of the car!!

        The patrol guy is thinking what he can try when BLAM! she puts a round
        through the glass next to his head.

                                SARAH
                RIGHT NOW!

        The door opens and the guy is coming out with his hands up as
        Terminator arrives.  The cyborg flings the rent-a-cop out of the way
        and slides behind the wheel.  Sarah gets John into the back seat and
        dives into the front passenger seat as --

78A     Terminator slams the car into reverse and punches it, lighting up the
        tires on the slick ramp.
        Terminator hands the shotgun over his shoulder to John and tells him
        to reload.  John pulls some shells from the pocket of his army jacket
        and starts feeding them in.
        Terminator power backward up the ramp, scraping along one wall, barely
        in control.  Because...

79      The T-1000 is running at them out of the inferno below.
        This guy won't quit.  Shifting from chrome mode to cop-form as it
        runs.
        It sprints up the ramp after the retreating car.  T-1000 is gaining.

80      Terminator hands Sarah another magazine for the .45.  She snatches
        it, drops the other out, and slaps in the new one.  Cocks the slide.
        The car backs along the service driveway toward the security gate.
        John hands the shot gun back to Terminator.
        He leans out the window and takes aim at the pursuer.
        The T-1000's face is right in the headlights.
80A     Terminator fires, blowing a hole in its shoulder.  Shiny liquid metal
        visible in the hole, which then closes.
80B     Sarah, half out the passenger window, opens fire.
        The car crashes backward through the security barricade.

                                TERMINATOR
                        (calmly)
                Hang on.

        He cuts the wheel hard.  The car slews into a reverse 180, swapping
        ends with a screech.
        T-1000 is almost on them.
        Terminator punches it.  The car accelerates forward.

80C     T-1000 leaps.  Lands on the trunk.
        Its hand is a metal crowbar slammed down through the trunk lid.
        Feet dragging on the pavement, it slams its other hand down,
        punching another metal hook into the trunk lid, pulling itself up.
        Terminator turns to Sarah.

                                TERMINATOR
                Drive.

        Terminator heaves himself half out the driver's window.  Sarah slaps
        her foot down on the throttle and steers from the passenger side.

80D     T-1000, fully on the car now, holds on with one hook-hand while it
        slams the other into the back window, sweeping away the glass and
        missing John by inches as he ducks.
        It draws back for another swing, lunging forward as --

80E     Terminator whips the shotgun over the roof of the car.
        Fires point-blank.
        Hits the T-1000's arm just above the "hand" which anchors it to the
        car.  The 12-guage blows the arm apart, severing the hook-hand.

80F     T-1000 tumbles backward off the accelerating car.
        John looks out the back window, his eyes wide.
        He sees the T-1000 roll to his feet and continue running.
        But he's dropping way behind now.  Sarah has the car floored and the
        liquid-metal killer won't catch them on foot.

80G     John watches, in awe, as the "crowbar hand", stuck into the trunk
        right in front of him, reverts to the neutral polyalloy... a kind of
        think mercury.  The gray metal slides off the trunk of the car and
        falls onto the road to lie there in a quivering blob.

80H     The car speeds off into the night.
        REVERSE on the T-1000, walking now, coming right up into closeup,
        watching the tail lights recede.  It looks down.

80I     ANGLE ON BLACKTOP, tight on the liquid metal blob.  Next to it is the
        T-1000's shiny cop shoe.  The mercury blob crawls and rejoins the
        main mass, disappearing into the "shoe".

81      INT./EXT. SECURITY CAR

        A GHOST CAR blasts out of the darkness on a long stretch of moonlight
        highway.  Headlights off, the hospital security car punches a hole in
        the wind.

81A     INSIDE THE SPEEDING CAR the energy is still high.  The air is blowing
        in the shattered windows as Terminator drives the car easily by
        electronic night-vision.  His eyes glow faintly red.

                                JOHN
                Can you see anything?

81B     TERMINATOR'S POV.  A monochrome image of the highway lit bright as
        day.

81C     Terminator replies in a matter-of-fact tone.

                                TERMINATOR
                Everything.

                                JOHN
                Cool.

        Sarah looks at Terminator, still not quite believing this is
        happening.  But this is a different Sarah than the waitress of 1984.
        She spends only a second or two dealing with the unbelievable.
        Then she turns to John in the back seat.

                                SARAH
                You okay?

        He nods.  She reaches for John and we think she's going to hug him.
        She starts to rub her hands over him and we realize she's checking for
        injuries, very clinically the way a vet checks a dog for broken bones.

        He pulls away from her.  He hates her always checking him, treating
        him like he might break, like some piece of rare china.

                                JOHN
                I said I was okay.

        Sarah looks at him, exasperated and stern.

                                SARAH
                It was stupid of you to go there.

        John stares at her, surprised.

                                SARAH
                Goddamnit, John, you have to be smarter than
                that.  You're too important!  You can't risk
                yourself, not even for me, do you understand?
                I can take care of myself.  I was doing fine.
                Jesus, John.  You almost got yourself killed.

        We see his chin quiver.  He's a tough kid, but all he really wants is
        for her to love him.  He hasn't had enough years on the planet yet to
        be the man of steel she demands.

                                JOHN
                I... had to get you out of the place... I'm
                sorry, I...

        His face crumples.  He starts to cry.  Sarah gives him a cold stare.

                                SARAH
                Stop it!  Right now!  You can't cry, John.
                Other kids can afford to cry.  You can't.

        He's trying to be brave, he really is.  Terminator turns and sees the
        water leaking from his eyes.  It doesn't make and sense to him.

                                TERMINATOR
                What is wrong with your eyes?

        John turns away, ashamed.  Sarah lets her breath out, realizing how
        keyed up she is.  She turns to Terminator, giving him a wary once-
        over.

                                SARAH
                So what's your story?

                                                CUT TO:

82      EXT. MENTAL HOSPITAL

        The cops have shown up, as they always do.  There are black-and-whites
        everywhere, and ambulances are arriving.  Two cops and an orderly are
        required to subdue poor Doctor Silberman, who is raving at the top of
        his lungs.

                                SILBERMAN
                ... it was all true and we're all going to die
                and the changed, I saw him change!!

        It's quite pathetic.
        A nurse shoots him up with a sedative.  They lead him away.

82A     T-1000 walks unperturbed among the milling cops.  No one notices him.
        It slips into its cruiser and drives off into the night.

83      INT. CAR

        Terminator drives steadily into the black night.

                                SARAH
                This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it?

                                TERMINATOR
                Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a
                few seconds.

        Sarah thinks about that.  Then:

                                SARAH
                Can it be destroyed?

                                TERMINATOR
                Unknown.

        They ride along in silence for a few seconds.
        Sarah sees something up ahead, some lonely neon in the blackness.

                                SARAH
                Pull in here.  We have to ditch this car.

84      EXT. SERVICE STATION - NIGHT

        A rundown gas station with a buzzing neon sign and no one around.
        They pull into the drive and slowly cruise past the empty office.  A
        sign in the window says CLOSED SUNDAYS.  They continue around the
        building to the garage's back door.

        AT THE GARAGE DOOR.  Terminator breaks the lock on the roll-up door
        and raises it.  Sarah pulls the security car in out of sight.
        Terminator rolls the door down behind them.

85      INT. GAS STATION

        Dark.  Sarah switches on the single drop-light.  She and Terminator
        look at each other.  Terminator is shot-up and bleeding, and Sarah
        has a vicious slash in her upper arm which was soaked her sleeve with
        blood.

                                SARAH
                You look like handmade shit.

                                TERMINATOR
                So do you.

                                                CUT TO:

86      TIGHT ON FIRST-AID KIT from the office, plus some not-so-oily rags, a
        bottle of rubbing alcohol, a few small tools, and other makeshift
        odds and ends.  Terminator's hand comes into shot.  Sets down a bloody
        rag.  Picks up a clean one.

        WIDER.  Sarah sits on an empty crate.  Terminator's is beside her,
        suturing her wound with some fine wire from the winding of an
        alternator.  Using a pair of needlenose pliers he draws the wire
        through her pale skin with a delicate hand.

                                TERMINATOR
                I have detailed files on human anatomy.

        Sarah stares into his face, inches away, fighting the pain.  She
        doesn't like him being this close to her to begin with, let alone
        carving on her.

                                SARAH
                I'll bet. Makes you a more efficient killer,
                right?

                                TERMINATOR
                Correct.

                                                CUT TO:

87      TIGHT ON TERMINATOR'S BACK.  The leather jacket is riddled with bullet
        holes.  Sarah and John help pull it off, revealing Terminator's
        broad, muscular back beneath.

        WIDER.  John and Sarah stare in amazement.  There are at least twenty
        bullet holes in him.  Back.  Arms.  Legs.  Fortunately they're all
        9mm.  The holes are small and the damage cosmetic.

                                JOHN
                Does it hurt?

                                TERMINATOR
                I sense injuries.  The data could be called
                pain.

        TIGHT ON SARAH AND TERMINATOR.  Sarah starts washing the bullet holes
        in his broad back with alcohol.

                                SARAH
                Will these heal up?

        Terminator nods.  She reaches into the bloody wounds with pliers and
        finds the copper-jacketed bullets, flattening against the armored
        endoskeleton.  Pulls them out.  They CLINK one by one into a glass.

                                SARAH
                That's good.  Because if you can't pass for
                human, you won't be much good to us.

        She concentrates on removing the slugs.  CLINK.  CLINK.

                                JOHN
                How long do you live?  I mean, last?

                                TERMINATOR
                A hundred and twenty years on my existing
                power cell.

        Sarah nods, pulling out another slug.  CLINK.  The glass nearly full
        of flattened bullets.  She begins to sew the holes closed with a few
        wire sutures.  John watches in quiet amazement, the two warriors
        calmly fixing each other.

                                JOHN
                Can you learn?  So you can be... you know.
                More human.  Not such a dork all the time.

        Terminator turns towards him.

                                TERMINATOR
                My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning
                computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to
                "read-only" when we are sent out alone.

                                SARAH
                        (cynical)
                Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?

                                TERMINATOR
                No.

                                JOHN
                Can we reset the switch?

                                                CUT TO:

88      E.C.U. OF AN X-ACTO KNIFE cutting into Terminator's scalp at the base
        of his skull.  His voice calmly directs Sarah as she spreads the bloody
        incision and locates the maintenance port for the CPU in the chrome
        skull beneath.

                                TERMINATOR
                Now open the port cover.

        She wipes away the blood and uses the garage-mechanic's air tools to
        unscrew the port cover.

88A     TERMINATOR POV (DIGITIZED) as he watches her work in a mirror they've
        taken from the washroom.  Sarah and John are standing behind him.
        Her hands are covered with blood, like a surgeon's.

                                TERMINATOR
                Hold the CPU by its base tab.  Pull.

        Following the instructions, she reaches in with a pair of tweezers and
        PULLS -- there is a BURST OF STATIC and the screen goes BLACK.

                                                CUT TO:

89      TIGHT ON JOHN AND SARAH looking at what she has removed.  A reddish-
        brown ceramic rectangle with a connector on one end.  About the size
        and shape of a domino.  On close inspection it appears to be made up
        of small cubes connected together.  It is identical to the shattered
        one in the vault at Cyberdyne Systems.  Now we know it is that that
        Miles Dyson values so highly.  The brain of a terminator.

89A     WIDER.  John walks around Terminator and looks at his face.
        Eyes open, he is completely inert.  Dead.

        John lifts his huge hand.  The dead servos whine sullenly as he forces
        them.  It's like rigor mortis.  He releases the hand and it stays in
        the lifted position.  Sarah examines the CPU chip.

                                JOHN
                Can you see the pin switch?

        She ignores him.  See looks at Terminator.
        The back at the chip.
        Then she sets it on the work table and picks up a small sledge hammer.
        John realizes what she is about to do.  Dives at her as the sledge is
        whistling down.

                                JOHN
                No!!!!

        He slaps his hand down over the chip.
        Sarah barely stops the sledge before smashing his fingers.

                                SARAH
                Out of the way, John!

                                JOHN
                No!  Don't kill him!

                                SARAH
                It, John.  Not him.  It.

                                JOHN
                Alright, it!  We need it!

        John keeps his hand right where it is.

                                SARAH
                We're better off by ourselves.

                                JOHN
                But it's the only proof we have to the future...
                about the war and all that.

                                SARAH
                I don't trust it!  These things are hard to
                kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never
                have this opportunity again.

                                JOHN
                Look, Mom, if I'm supposed to ever be this great
                leader, you should start listening to my
                leadership ideas once in a while.  'Cause if you
                won't, nobody else will.

        Smart kid.  He's got her.  She nods, reluctantly.  He palms the chip
        and studies it minutely.

89B     John takes a pin and moves the almost invisible switch to the other
        position.
        It is now in "write" mode.  Then he grimaces as he inserts the wafer
        back into the slot in Terminator's skull.

89C     TERMINATOR VISION flares back to life in a burst of static.  The image
        forms.  Sarah and John stands behind him in the mirror.

                                TERMINATOR
                Was there a problem?

        John glances sheepishly at Sarah,  Then smiles at Terminator.

                                JOHN
                No problem.  None whatsoever.

                                                CUT TO:

90      JOHN SLEEPING, lying on a pile of rags next to a stack of tires.
        The lights are off.  Sarah sits nearby, cross-legged, he back against
        the wall.
        The .45 is cradles in her lap.  She looks weary, but she won't allow
        herself to sleep with Terminator present.

        By the office windows, in a slash of moonlight, is Terminator.  He
        stands silent and still, watching the night.  Only his eyes move,
        tracking with the occasional car passing on the road.  He figure
        silhouetted and still.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

91      SAME IMAGE.  Now DAYLIGHT streams in the dusty windows.
        Terminator has not moved.  Faithful machine sentinel.  He turns at a
        sound.  John stirs, waking up.  He squints into the sunlight.  Sarah
        is still awake.  She gets up, wincing at the pain in her arm.

                                                CUT TO:

92      EXT. GAS STATION - DAY (LATER)

        John and Terminator walks to an old Chevy pickup parked behind the
        garage.  The day is clear but windy.  Dust devils chase themselves
        behind the place.  The pickup is locked but Terminator breaks the side
        window with his fist and opens the door.  He and John climb in.

92A     IN THE PICKUP.  Terminator has this trick (which you could do too if
        you had servo-driven steel fingers) where he smashes the cowl around
        a steering column with one blow from the palm of his hand.  When it
        shatters he strips it away with a single move, and then turns the stub
        of the lock-mechanism with his fingertips.  This starts the vehicle.
        It takes about three seconds.

        In fact, he does it so quickly, the truck is running by the time John
        flips down the sun visor.  A set of keys drops out and John catches
        them.  Dangles them in front of Terminator's eyes.

                                JOHN
                Are we learning yet?

92B     Sarah comes out.  She's found a mechanic's coverall inside, used but
        fairly clean.  It doesn't fit her too well, but it's better than the
        stuff from the hospital.  She's still barefoot.
        The sun, which she hasn't seen in months, hurts her eyes,
        Terminator and John pull up in the pickup.  She gets in.

92C                             TERMINATOR
                We need to get as far from the city as possible.

                                SARAH
                Just head south.

                                                CUT TO:

93      INT./EXT. PICKUP TRUCK/HIGHWAY - DAY

        THE OPEN ROAD.  The pickup roars through light traffic down a long
        stretch of highway.  They set three abreast on the bench seat, John
        in between, like some improbable family on a car trip.
        Sarah leans over to get a look at the speedometer.

                                SARAH
                Keep it under sixty-five.  We can't afford to
                be pulled over.

        Terminator backs off the throttle slightly.

                                TERMINATOR
                Affirmative.

                                JOHN
                No, no, no.  You gotta listen to the way people
                talk.  See, you don't say like "Affirmative" or
                some shit like that.  You say... no problemo.

        Terminator nods, filing away the information.  Sarah is ignoring the
        lesson, lost in thought.

                                JOHN
                It someone comes off to you with an attitude,
                you say "eat me"... if you wanna shine them on,
                it's "Hasta la vista, baby".

                                TERMINATOR
                "Hasta la vista, baby"?

                                JOHN
                Yeah, or "later, dickwad."  Or if someone gets
                upset you say "chill out."  Like that.  Or you
                can do combinations.

                                TERMINATOR
                Chill out, dickwad.

                                JOHN
                That's great!  See, you're getting it.

                                TERMINATOR
                No problemo.

                                                CUT TO:

94-95   OMITTED

96      EXT. ROADSIDE STAND/GAS STATION - DAY

        There's a gas pump and a sleazy fast-food stand.  Picnic tables are
        set up at the side of the food stand.  A family sits at one, children
        playing and running about.
96A     The pickup truck pulls into the lot.  Stops at the gas pump.
        Sarah turns to John.

                                SARAH
                You got any cash?

        John pulls what's left of his Ready-Teller money from his pocket.

                                JOHN
                Only a couple hundred bucks.  I'll give you
                half.

        Sarah grabs all of it.  Peels off a twenty, hands it to John.

                                SARAH
                Get some food.

        She opens the truck door and steps out.  John turns to Terminator.

                                JOHN
                No sense of humor.

97      THE ORDERING WINDOW as John and Terminator approach.

                                JOHN
                And that's another thing.  You could lighten up
                a bit, yourself.  This severe routine is getting
                old.  Smile once in a while.

                                TERMINATOR
                Smile?

                                JOHN
                Yeah.  Smile.  You know.  People smile, right?
                Watch.

        Goes to the order window.

                                JOHN
                        (smiling broadly)
                Hi.  Nice place you got here.  How's business?

                                WINDOW WOMAN
                        (stone-faced)
                Gimme a break.

                                JOHN
                        (to Terminator)
                Okay.  Bad example.  Over there, look.

        John points at THREE TEENAGE GUYS standing at a drinking fountain
        nearby.  One of them has said something funny and the others are
        laughing, grinning.

                                JOHN
                Like that.

        TERMINATOR POV (DIGITIZED)  The real-time image continues while a
        replay of one of the guys grinning runs in a window.  It expands, so
        that the guy's mouth fills the window.  Replays again in slow motion.
        A vector-graphic of the lips smiling appears, along with an array of
        symbolic data.

        Terminator tries it.  The result is dismal.  A rictus-like curling of
        the lip.  Terminator's next effort is a marginal improvement.

                                JOHN
                I don't know, maybe you could practice in front
                of a mirror or something.

                                                CUT TO:

98      EXT. REST STOP/PICKUP TRUCK - DAY (LATER)

        Sarah and John are eating cheeseburgers and fries, sitting in the
        truck and on the curb respectively.  They are parked away from the
        other families, at the end of the gravel parking area.  Terminator
        is pouring coolant into the radiator.  Sarah is deep in through,
        turning and turning the whole thing in her brain.  John, unable to
        deal with her silence, goes around to where Terminator is working.

98A     John sees two kids playing with machine-gun water pistols nearby,
        viciously squirting each other.

                                FIRST KID
                You're dead!

                                SECOND KID
                Am not!

                                FIRST KID
                Are so!

        John and Terminator watch them rolling on the ground in a fight to the
        death.  Sarah rounds the front of the truck, and sees the kids.  John
        sighs, solemn.  He looks up at the cyborg.

                                JOHN
                We're not gonna make it, are we?  People, I
                mean.

                                TERMINATOR
                It is in your nature to destroy yourselves.

        John nods, depressed.

                                JOHN
                Yeah.  Drag, huh?

                                SARAH
                I need to know how Skynet get built.  Who's
                responsible?

                                TERMINATOR
                The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet
                Dyson, Director of Special Projects at
                Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.

                                SARAH
                Why him?

                                TERMINATOR
                In a few months he creates a revolutionary
                type of mircoprocessor.

                                SARAH
                Then what?

98B     Terminator closes the hood and gets into the truck as he speaks.

                                TERMINATOR
                In three years Cyberdyne will become the largest
                supplier of military computer systems.  All
                stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne
                computers, becoming fully unmanned,  Afterward,
                the fly with a perfect operational record.

                                SARAH
                        (getting behind John)
                Uh huh, great.  Then those fat fucks in
                Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer
                run the whole show, right?

                                TERMINATOR
                Basically.
                        (starting the engine, backing
                        out)
                The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system
                goes on-line August 4th, 1997.  Human decisions
                are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet
                begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  It becomes
                self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29.
                In a panic, they try to pull the plug.

                                SARAH
                And Skynet fights back.

        They accelerate back onto the highway.

                                TERMINATOR
                Yes.  It launches its ICBMs against their
                targets in Russia.

                                SARAH
                Why attack Russia?

                                TERMINATOR
                Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike
                will remove its enemies here.

                                SARAH
                Jesus.
                        (beat, then)
                How much do you know about Dyson?

                                TERMINATOR
                I have detailed files.

                                SARAH
                I want to know everything.  What he looks like.
                Where he lives.  Everything.

99      INT. DYSON HOUSE - DAY

        Miles Dyson sits at the huge desk in his study.  He is deep in
        thought, tapping away at the keyboard of his home computer terminal.
        Next to desk are racks of sophisticated gear.  On a Sunday morning,
        when most men are relaxing, spending time with their families, Dyson
        is hard at work.

        IN A PROFILE CLOSEUP we see him in deep concentration, his mind
        prowling the labyrinth of his new microprocessor.

        A WOMAN'S FACE ENTERS FRAME soundlessly behind him.  He doesn't hear
        her.  His wife, TARISSA, extends her tongue and traces it down the
        back of his neck.  He smiles and turns to kiss her good morning.
        She's still in her bathrobe, holding coffee.  He's been up for hours.
        He turns and goes back to work, forgetting instantly that she is
        standing there.

        She watches him work, the arcane symbols moving across the screen.
        We see her frustration, her inability to truly enter the magic box
        of his world.

                                TARISSA
                You going to work all day?

                                DYSON
                I'm sorry, baby.  This thing is just kicking my
                ass.  I thought we had it with this one...

        He points to a metal box on his desk, about two feet long.  As
        assembly of small cubes.  It looks like a dinosaur version of
        Terminator's CPU.

                                DYSON
                ... but the output went to shit after three
                seconds.  I'm thinking now it's the way I'm
                matrixing the command hierarchies...

                                TARISSA
                You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you
                come back.

                                DYSON
                I can't

                                TARISSA
                Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the
                kids to Raging Waters today.

                                DYSON
                Oh.  I can't, honey.  I'm on a roll here.

        He takes her hands.  We see a childlike excitement in his face.  He
        wants so badly to share the almost orgasmic thrill of discovery,
        the satisfaction of creation.

                                DYSON
                Baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away.
                It's a neural-net process --

                                TARISSA
                I know.  You told me.  It's a neural-net
                processor.  It thinks and learns like we do.
                It's superconducting at room temperature.
                Other computer are pocket calculators by
                comparison.
                        (she pulls away from him)
                But why is that so goddamn important, Miles?
                I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm
                going crazy here, sometimes.

                                DYSON
                I'm sorry, honey, it's just that I'm thiiis
                close.

        He holds up his thumb and index finger... a fraction of an inch apart.
        She picks up the prototype.  It doesn't look like much.

                                DYSON
                Imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes
                a mistake, never gets tired, never shows up to
                work with a hangover.
                        (he taps the prototype)
                Meet the pilot.

                                TARISSA
                Why did you marry me, Miles?  Why did we have
                these two children?  You don't need us.  Your
                heart and your mind are in here.
                        (she stares at the metal box
                        in her hands)
                But it doesn't love you like we do.

        He takes the anodized box from her hands and sets it down.  Then he
        puts his hands on her shoulders and kisses her gently.  She acquiesces
        to his kiss.

                                DYSON
                I'm sorry.

        Tarissa glances over his shoulder.  She nods her head toward the
        doorway to the study.  Dyson turns and sees their two kids standing
        there.  Danny (6) and Blythe (4) look rumpled and adorable in their
        PJs.  Dyson wilts at their hopeful expressions.

                                TARISSA
                How about spending some time with your other
                babies?

        Dyson grins. The forces of darkness have lost this round.  He holds
        out his hands and his kids run to him, cheering.

                                                CUT TO:

A100    EXT. DESERT/COMPOUND - DAY

        The desert northwest of Calexico.  Burning under the sun like a
        hallucination.  Heat shimmers the image, mirage-like.
        Terminator turns the pickup off the paved road and barrels along a
        roadbed a sand and gravel, trailing a huge plume of dust.
        A sign at the turnoff says:     CHARON MESA     2 MI
                                        CALEXICO        15 MI

A101    AHEAD is a pathetic oasis of humanity in the vast wasteland, a couple
        of aging house-trailers, surrounded by assorted junk vehicles and
        desert-style trash.  There is a dirt airstrip behind the trailers, and
        a stripped Huey helicopter sitting on block nearby.

        The truck rolls to a stop in a cloud of dust.  The place looks
        deserted.  The door to the nearest trailer bangs in the wind.

                                SARAH
                        (to Terminator and John)
                Stay in the truck.

A102    ANGLE FROM INSIDE ANOTHER TRAILER, NEARBY.
        A DARK FIGURE in the F.G. has an AK-47 trained on the pickup as
        Sarah gets out.

        ON SARAH peering through the backlit dust.
        The sound of wind.  She approaches the trailer.

                                SARAH
                        (in Spanish)
                Enrique?  You here?

        She hears KACHANK! behind her and spins, whipping out her .45 in one
        motion.

        ENRIQUE SALCEDA stands behind a rusting jeep, a 12-gauge pump trained
        on her.  He is mid-forties, a tough Guatemalan with a weathered face
        and heavy mustache.  He wears cowboy boots and a flak vest, no shirt.

                                SALCEDA
                You pretty jumpy, Connor.

        His fierce face breaks into a broad grin.  The shotgun drops to his
        side as he walks toward her.  When he reaches her he hugs her, then
        steps back.

                                SALCEDA
                        (in Spanish)
                Good to see you, Connor.  I knew you'd make it
                back here sooner or later.

        He grins at John as he steps from the truck, and then clocks
        Terminator getting out.

                                SALCEDA
                Oye, Big John!  Que pasa?  Who's your very large
                friend?

                                JOHN
                        (perfect Spanish)
                He's cool, Enrique.  He's... uh... this is my
                Uncle Bob.
                        (to Terminator, in English)
                Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.

        Terminator smiles.  Sort of.  Salceda squints at him,

                                SALCEDA
                Hmmm.  Uncle Bob, huh?  Okay.
                        (yelling)
                Yolanda.  Get out here, we got company.  And
                bring some fucking tequila!

        A thin Guatemalan KID, FRANCO, eighteen or so, comes out of the
        trailer with the AK-47, followed by Salceda's wife, YOLANDA.  She has
        THREE younger children with her, from a five-year-old GIRL, JUANITA,
        to a year-and-half-old BOY.  She waves at John.  They exchange
        greetings in Spanish.  They seem like nice people.
        Terminator looks down at John, next to him.  He says quietly...

                                TERMINATOR
                Uncle Bob?

                                SALCEDA
                        (to Sarah)
                So, Sarahlita, you getting famous, you know
                that?  All over the goddamn TV.

        Salceda rips the cap off the tequila bottle.  The two-year-old toddles
        to Terminator and grabs his pants, sliming them with drool.
        Terminator looks down at the tiny kid, fascinated.  What is it?
        He picks up the child with one huge hand.  Looks at it.  Turns it
        different ways.  Studying it.  Then sets it down.  The kid waddles
        off, a little dizzy.

                                SALCEDA
                Honey, take Pacolito.  Thanks, baby.

        She hands him the tequila and takes the child.  Salceda takes a long
        pull from the Cuervo bottle.

                                SALCEDA
                        (to Terminator)
                Drink?

        Terminator gestures "no" at the proffered bottle, but Sarah grabs it
        and takes a long pull.  She lowers it without expression.  Her eyes
        don't even water.

                                SARAH
                I just came for my stuff.  And I need clothes,
                food, and one of your trucks.

                                SALCEDA
                        (grinning)
                Hey, how about the fillings out of my fucking
                teeth while you're at it?

                                SARAH
                Now, Enrique.
                        (turns to Terminator and John)
                You two are on weapons detail.

                                                CUT TO:

A103    EXT. COMPOUND/BEHIND THE TRAILERS

        There is an aging and rusted Caterpillar sitting behind one of the
        trailers.  John expertly backs it toward Terminator who is holding
        one end of a piece of heavy chain which disappears into the sand.

                                JOHN
                Hook it on.

        Terminator hooks the chain onto the towhook on the back of the
        tractor.  John hits the throttle and the Cat churns its treads,
        pulling some massive load.  A six-by-eight foot sheet of steel plate
        moves slowly under six inches of sand.

        John drags it far enough to reveal... a rectangular hole in the
        ground.  Like the mouth of a tomb.  The kid drops down from the
        tractor and walks to the hole.

                                JOHN
                One thing about my mom... she always plans
                ahead.

A104    INT. WEAPONS CACHE

        From inside the "tomb".  Sunlight slashes down into a cinder-block
        room, less than six feet wide but over twenty long.  Sand spills down
        the steps.  The walls are lined with guns.

        John precedes Terminator into Sarah's weapons cache.  Rifles, pistols,
        rocket launchers, mortars, RPGs, radio gear.  At the far end, boxes
        containing ammo, grenades, etc. are stacked to the ceiling.
        Terminator gets real alert.  Scanning, wondering where to begin.  He
        picks up a MAC-10 machine pistol.  Racks the bolt.

                                TERMINATOR
                Excellent.

                                JOHN
                Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.

A105    EXT. COMPOUND/NEARBY

        Sarah emerges from a trailer.  She has changed.  Boots, black fatigue
        pants, T-shirt.  Shades.  She looks hard.
        Salceda is nearby, packing food and other survival equipment with
        Yolanda.  He looks up as Sarah approaches, and slaps the side of a
        BIG FOUR-BY BRONCO next to him,

                                SALCEDA
                This is the best truck, but the water pump is
                blown.  You got the time to change it out?

                                SARAH
                Yeah.  I'm gonna wait till dark to cross the
                border.
                        (she pulls him away from
                        Yolanda)
                Enrique, it's dangerous for you here.  You get
                out tonight, too, okay?

                                SALCEDA
                Yeah, Saralita.  Sure.
                        (he grins)
                Just drop by any time and totally fuck up my
                life.

        She slaps him on the shoulder.

                                                CUT TO:

A106    INT. WEAPONS CACHE

        Terminator returns from carrying out several cases of ammo.  John is
        selecting rifles from a long rack.

                                JOHN
                See, I grew up in places like this, so I just
                thought it was how people lived... riding
                around in helicopters.  Learning how to blow
                shit up.

        John grabs an AK-47 and racks the bolt with a practiced action.
        Inspects the receiver for wear.  Doesn't like what he sees.  Puts is
        back.  His movement are efficient.  Professional.  Uninterested.

                                JOHN
                Then, when Mom got busted I got put in a
                regular school.  The other kids were, like,
                into Nintendo.

        Terminator has found a Vietnam-era "blooper" M-79 grenade launcher.
        A very crude but effective weapon.  He opens the breech and inspects
        the bore.

                                JOHN
                Are you ever afraid?

        Terminator pauses for a second.  The thought never occurred to him.
        He searches him mind for the answer...

                                TERMINATOR
                No.

        Terminator slings the M-79 and starts looking for the grenades.

                                JOHN
                Not even of dying?

                                TERMINATOR
                No.

                                JOHN
                You don't feel any emotion about it one way
                or the other?

                                TERMINATOR
                No.  I have to stay functional until my mission
                is complete.  Then it doesn't matter.

        John is idly spinning a Sig Saur 9mm pistol on his finger... backwards
        and forwards like Bat Masteron.

                                JOHN
                Yeah.  I have to stay functional too.
                        (sing-songy)
                "I'm too important".

        Terminator pulls back a canvas tarp, revealing a squat, heavy weapon
        with six barrels clustered in a blunt cylinder.  Chain-ammo is fed
        from a canister sitting next to it.  A G.E. MINI-GUN.  The most
        fearsome anti-personnel weapon of the Vietnam era.
        Terminator hefts it.  Looks at John as if to say "Can I?  Please?"

                                JOHN
                It's definitely you.

A107    EXT. COMPOUND - DAY/LATER

        Sarah and John have their weapons and supply selections laided out on
        two battered picnic tables for cleaning and packing.  Maps, radios,
        documents, explosives, detonators... just the basics.  Sarah is field-
        stripping and cleaning guns, very methodical.  There is no wasted
        motion.

        Not far away, John and Terminator are working on the Bronco.  They're
        greasy up to their elbows, lying on their backs under the engine
        compartment, ratcheting bolts into places on the new water pump.

                                JOHN
                There was this one guy that was kinda cool.
                He taught me engines.  Hold this a second.  Mom
                screwed it up, of course.  Sooner or later she'd
                always tell them about Judgment Day and me being
                this world leader and that's be all she wrote.

        John thinks he's being causal, but his longing for some kind of
        parental connection is obvious.

                                TERMINATOR
                Torque wrench please.

                                JOHN
                Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.

                                TERMINATOR
                You will.

                                JOHN
                Yeah.  I guess so.  My mom says when I'm, like,
                45, I think, I send him back through time to
                1984.  But right now he hasn't even been born
                yet.  Man, is messes with your head.  Where's
                that other bolt?
                        (Terminator hands it to him)
                Thanks.  Mom and him were only together for one
                night, but she still loves him, I guess.  I see
                her crying sometimes.  She denies it totally,
                of course.  Like she says she got something in
                her eye.

        They crawl out from under the truck into the bright sunlight.

                                TERMINATOR
                Why do you cry?

                                JOHN
                You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry.
                You know.  When it hurts.

                                TERMINATOR
                Pain causes it?

                                JOHN
                Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's
                nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You
                get it?

                                TERMINATOR
                No.

        Terminator gets into the Bronco and turns the ignition key and the
        engine catches with a roar.

                                JOHN
                Alriight!!  My man!

                                TERMINATOR
                No problemo.

        John grins and does a victorious thumbs up.
        Terminator imitates the gesture awkwardly.
        John laughs and makes him get out of the truck, to try the move again.

A108    SARAH, across the compound, pauses in her work to watch John and
        Terminator.

A109    SARAH'S POV... we don't hear what John and Terminator are saying.  It
        is a soundless pantomime as John is trying to show some other gestures
        to the cyborg.  Trying to get him to walk more casually.  John walks,
        then Terminator tries it, then John gestures wildly, talking very
        fast... explaining the fundamental principles of cool.  They try it
        again.  Continued ad lib as we hear:

                                SARAH (V.O.)
                Watching John with the machine, it was suddenly
                so clear.  The Terminator would never stop, it
                would never leave him... it would always be
                there.  And it would never hurt him, never shout
                at him or get drunk and hit him, or say it
                couldn't spend time with him because it was too
                busy.  And it would die to protect him.  Of all
                the would-be fathers who came and went over the
                years, this thing, this machine, was the only
                one who measured up.  In an insane world, it was
                the sanest choice.

        Sarah clenches her jaw and goes grimly back to work... a strong woman
        made hard and cold by years of hard choices.

                                                CUT TO;

A110    EXT. ROAD - DAY

        A police cruiser is parked off the side of a quiet, empty road on the
        outskirts of Los Angeles.  A ribbon of traffic moves steadily by on a
        freeway in the distance.  Nothing stirs around the cruiser except some
        pump-jacks sucking the earth on the hill behind it.

A111    IN THE CRUISER.  The T-1000 sits inside.  John's notes and letters are
        spread out on the seat beside it.  Sarah's voice speaks from a
        cassette deck.  John's tapes.  Her voices mixes with the static filled
        chatter of the radio that T-1000 monitors for any signs of its
        targets.

                                SARAH
                ... if we are ever separated, and can't make
                contact, go to Enrique's airstrip.  I'll
                rendezvous with you there.

        T-1000 whips around and rewinds the tape, replaying the last section.
        It then snaps up the envelope of photos we saw earlier.

        ECU on envelope.  We see the postmark:  "Charon Mesa, Calif."

        TIGHT ON T-1000 staring at the postmark on the envelope.  It glances
        up at the sound of crunching gravel.  In the rear-view it sees a BIKE
        COP pulling onto the shoulder behind it.  The big KAWASAKI 1100 idles
        up next to the T-1000, still seated in the cruiser.

                                BIKE COP
                Howdy.  I saw you pulled over here earlier.
                Everything okay?

                                T-1000
                Everything's fine.  Thanks for checking.
                        (it gets slowly out of
                        the car)
                Since you're here, though, can I talk to you
                a second...

A113    EXT. COMPOUND - DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)

        Sarah sits at the picnic table.  The weapons are cleaned and her work
        is done.  She hasn't slept in twenty-four hours and she seems to have
        the weight of the whole world on her shoulder.
        She draws her knife from its belt sheath.
        Idly starts to carve something on the table top... the letter "N".

A114    NOT FAR AWAY, John and Terminator are packing the Bronco for the trip.

A115    ON SARAH, AT THE TABLE as she looks up from her carving, thinking.
        She watches Salceda's kids playing nearby... wrestling with a mutty
        dog and loving it.  Sarah watches Yolanda walking her toddler by her
        hands.  Backlit, stylized.  She looks over at John.  Loading guns and
        supplies.

A116    ANGLE ON kids playing.

A117    SARAH'S HEAD droops.  She closes her eyes.

A118    TIGHT ON small children playing.  Different ones.
        Wider now, to reveal a playground in a park.  Very idyllic.  A dream
        playground, crowded with laughing children playing on swings, slides,
        and a jungle gym.  It could be the playground we saw melted and frozen
        in the post-nuclear desolation of 2029.  But here the grass is vibrant
        green and the sun is shining.

118A    Sarah, short-haired, looking drab and paramilitary, stands outside the
        playground.  An outsider.  Her fingers are hooked in a chain-link
        fence and she is staring through the fence at the young mothers
        playing with their kids.  A grim-faced harbinger.

118B    Some girls play skip-rope.  Their sing-song weaves through the random
        burbling laughter of the kids.  One of the young mothers walks her
        two-year-old son by the hands.  She is wearing a pink waitress
        uniform.  She turns to us, laughing.
        It is Sarah.  Beautiful.  Radiant.  Sarah from another life,
        uncontaminated by the dark future.  She glances at the strange woman
        beyond the fence.

118C    Grim-faced Sarah presses against the fence.  She starts shouting at
        them in SLOW MOTION.  No sound comes from her mouth.  She grabs the
        fence in frustration, shaking it.  Screaming soundlessly.
        Waitress Sarah's smile falls.  Then returns as her little boy throws
        some sand at her.  She laughs, turns away, as if the woman at the
        fence were a shadow, a trick of light.

118D-118F  OMITTED

118G    THE SKY EXPLODES.  The children ignite like match heads.  Sarah is
        burning, screaming silently, everything silent and overexposed.

118H    THE BLAST WAVE HITS... devouring the cowering mothers and children.
        Sarah's scream merges with the howl of the wind as the shockwave rips
        into her, blasting her apart and she...

119     Wakes up.
        All is quiet and normal.  The children are still playing nearby.  Less
        than fifteen minutes have gone by.

        Bathed in sweat, Sarah sits hunched over the table.
        Every muscle is shaking.  She is gasping.
        Sarah struggles to breathe, running her hand through her hair which is
        soaked with sweat,  She can escape from the hospital, but she can't
        escape from the madness which haunts her.

        She looks down at the words she has carved on the table, amid the
        scrawled hearts and bird-droppings.  They are:  "NO FATE."
        Something changes in her eyes.  She slams her knife down in the table
        top, embedding it deeply in the words.  Then gets up suddenly and
        we --

                                                CUT TO:

A120    LONG LENS on Sarah walking toward us, striding across the compound
        with grim purpose.  She carries a small nylon pack and a CAR-15
        assault rifle.  Her face is an impassive mask.  She has become a
        terminator.

A120A   JOHN LOOKS UP from his work in time to see Sarah throw the rifle
        behind the seat of their stolen pickup, jump in and start it.  She
        slams it in gear.  Salceda walks up to John.

                                SALCEDA
                She said you go south with him...
                        (he points at Terminator)
                ... tonight, like you planned.  She will meet
                you tomorrow in...

        But John is moving, running after her.

                                JOHN
                Mommm!! Wait!!

A120B   MOVING WITH SARAH as she leaves the compound.  We see John running
        after her... yelling.  Can't hear his words.  She looks in the rear-
        view mirror but doesn't slow down.

A121    EXT. COMPOUND - DUSK/MINUTES LATER

        John and Terminator ponders the message carved into the top of the
        picnic table.  Sarah's knife is still embedded there.

                                JOHN
                "No fate."  No fate but what we make.  My father
                told her this... I mean I made him memorize it,
                up in the future, as a message to her --
                Never mind.  Okay, the whole thing goes "The
                future is not set.  There is no fate but what
                we make for ourselves."

                                TERMINATOR
                She intends to change the future somehow.

                I guess, yeah --

                him away!

        John motions to Terminator and breaks into a run.

                The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It
                could anticipate this move and reacquire you
                at Dyson's house.

                                JOHN
                I don't care.  We've gotta stop her.

                                TERMINATOR
                Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.

                                JOHN
                I don't care!! There's gotta be another way.
                Haven't you learned anything?!  Haven't you
                figured out why you can't kill people?

        Terminator is still stumped.

                                JOHN
                Look, maybe you don't care if you live or die.
                But everybody's not like that!  Okay?!  We have
                feelings.  We hurt.  We're afraid.  You gotta

        terminal, working.  Where else?  We see him clearly in a long shot
        from an embankment behind the house.

        A DARK FIGURE moves into the foreground.  Rack focus to Sarah as she
        turns into profile.  She raises the CAR-15 rifle and begins screwing
        the long heavy cylinder of a sound-suppresser onto the end of the
        barrel.

        trying to catch it.  They stop in the hall outside Dyson's study and
        sees him working at his terminal.  Danny puts a finger to his lips,
        shushing Blythe.  His expression is mischievous.

129B    With the silencer in place, Sarah eases back the bolt and then slips
        it forward, chambering a .223 round.  Then she lies down on the

        He cheek pressed against the cool rifle-stock, she slides one hand
        slowly forward to brace the weapon, taking the weight on her elbow.
        Her other hand slips knowingly to the trigger.

132A    LOW ANGLE as Danny's Bigfoot truck roars toward us -- FILLING FRAME.
        Thump.  It hits Dyson's foot.  He jerks, startled, and looks down
        as --
        POP!!
132B    His monitor screen is BLOWN OUT spraying his with glass.  He jerks
        back, utterly shocked... and spins to see the huge hole blown through
        the window behind him.  This saves him as K-THUMP! -- the second shot
        blows the top of his high-backed chain into an explosion of stuffing
        an inch from his head.
        Instinctively he dives to the carpet as --

        BLAM BLAM BLAM -- rounds blast through the window, tearing into his
        desk and computer, blowing his keyboard into shrapnel.
132C    With the monitor screen blown out, the room is in darkness.  Sarah
        can't see Dyson now, down behind his desk.  She puts round after round
        into the heavy desk, blasting one side of it into kindling.

132D    Dyson, scared out of his mind, has his face jammed against the carpet,
        terrified to move.  He sees his kids in the hall.

                                DYSON
                Run, kids!  Go!  Run!

132E    IN THE HALL, TARISSA rounds the corner at a dead run.  She sees the
        kids running toward her and grabs them in her arms.  Down the hall,
        in the dark study, she sees Dyson on the floor amid the splinters and
        shrapnel of the continuing fusillade.

                                TARISSA
                Miles!  Oh my God!!

                                MILES
                Stay back!!

132F    ON THE FLOOR, Dyson flinches as chucks of wood and shattered computer
        components shower down on him.  He looks desperately toward the door,
        but knows he'd be totally exposed.  He'd never make it.

133     SARAH's rifle empties with a final CLACK!
        She throws it down and draws her .45 smoothly from a shoulder base.
        She starts toward the house, snapping back the slide on the pistol,
        chambering a round.  She is in a fast, purposeful walk, keeping her
        eyes fixed on the target.  She is utterly determined to kill this man.

134     FROM UNDER THE DESK Dyson can see a sliver in the backyard.  He sees
        Sarah's feet as she strides toward him.  He tenses to make a break for
        the door.

        Sarah raises the pistol, eyes riveted ahead, controlling her
        breathing.  Dyson springs up in a full-tilt sprint.  She tracks him.
        He hooks a foot on the cord of a toppled disk drive.
        BOOM!  Her shot blows apart a lamp where his head was.
        He hits the floor hard, but keeps moving, scrambling forward.

        Crunch of glass behind his as Sarah's dark form is framed in the
        blown-out floor-to-ceiling window.  Dyson leaps toward the hall.
        BOOM!  Her second shot spins him.  He hits the floor in the hallway.
        Tarissa is screaming.  Dyson struggles forward, stunned.  There is a
        .45-caliber hole clean through his left shoulder.  He smears the wall
        with blood as he staggers up.  Looking back, he sees the implacable
        figure behind him, coming on.

        He topples through a doorway as --
        BOOM!  BOOM!  Shots blowing away the molding where he just was.

135     EXT. DYSON HOUSE/STREET

        Terminator and John leap from the jeep, sprinting toward the house.
        The shots sound muffles from outside.

                                JOHN
                Shit, we're too late!

136     INT. HOUSE

        Advancing with Sarah we enter the living area.  Tarissa has Blythe and
        she's screaming at Danny, who has run back to his collapsed father.

                                TARISSA
                Danny!  DANNY!

                                DANNY
                Daaaaddddeeee!

        Danny is pulling at Dyson, crying and screaming, as his father tries
        to stagger forward.  Tarissa drops Blythe and runs back for Dyson,
        grabbing him.  Sarah looms behind them with the pistol aimed.

                                SARAH
                Don't fucking move!  Don't FUCKING MOVE!!
                        (she swings the gun on
                        Tarissa)
                Get on the floor, bitch!  Now!!  Fucking down!
                NOW!!

        Sarah is crazy-eyed now, shaking with the intensity of the moment.
        The kill has gone bad, with screaming kids and the wife involved...
        things she never figured on.  Tarissa drops to the knees, terrified
        as she looks into the muzzle of the gun.  Blythe runs to Dyson and
        hugs him, wailing.

                                BLYTHE
                Don't hurt my father!

                                SARAH
                        (screaming)
                Shut up, kid!  Get out of the way!!

        Dyson looks up, through his pain and incomprehension.  Why is this
        nightmare happening?  The black gun muzzle is a foot from his face.

                                DYSON
                        (gasping)
                Please... let... the kids... go...

                                SARAH
                Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all
                your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!

        We see her psyching herself to pull the trigger... needing now to hate
        this man she doesn't know.  It's a lot harder face-to-face.  She is
        bathed in sweat, and it runs into her eyes.  Blinking, she wipes it
        fast with one hand, then gets it back on the gun.  The .45 is
        trembling.

        TIGHT ON SARAH as we see the forces at war behind her eyes.
        She looks into the faces of Dyson, Tarissa, Blythe, Danny.
        Sarah takes a sharp breath and all the muscles in her arms contract
        as she tenses to fire.
        But her finger won't do it.
        She lowers the gun very slowly.  It drops to her side in one hand.

        All the breath and energy seems to go out of her.
        She weakly raises her other hand in a strange gesture, like "Stay
        where you are, don't move".  As if, should they move, the fragile
        balance might tip back the other way.
        She backs away from them slowly, panting.  It's as if she's backing
        away in terror from what she almost did.  She reaches a wall and
        slumps against it.  Slides down to her knees.  The gun falls limply
        from her fingers.
        She rests her cheek against the wall.

136A    The front door is kicked in.
        Terminator steps inside.  John grabs his sleeve and pushes past him.
        He scopes out the situation in two seconds... Sarah, the gun, the
        sobbing family.  John moves to Sarah while Terminator checks Dyson.

        John kneels in front of his mother.  She raises her head to look at
        him.  He sees the tears spilling down her cheeks,

                                JOHN
                Mom?  You okay?

                                SARAH
                I couldn't... oh, God.
                        (she seems to she him for
                        the first time)
                You... came here... to stop me?

                                JOHN
                Uh huh.

        She reaches out and takes his shoulder suddenly, surprising him...
        drawing him to her.  She hugs him and a great sob wells up deep inside
        her, from a spring she had thought long dry.  She hugs him fiercely
        as the sobs wrack her.

        John clutches her shoulders.  It is all he ever wanted.

                                JOHN
                It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it
                out.

                                SARAH
                I love you, John.  I always have.

                                JOHN
                I know, Mom.  I know.

        TARISSA looks around at the bizarre tableau.  Terminator has
        wordlessly ripped open Dyson's shirt and examined the wound.

                                TERMINATOR
                Clean penetration.  No shattered bone.
                Compression should control the loss of blood.

        He takes Tarissa's hands and presses them firmly over the entrance and
        exit wounds.

                                TERMINATOR
                Do you have bandages?

                                DYSON
                In the bathroom.  Danny, can you get them for
                us?

        Danny nods and runs down the hall.
        John disengages from Sarah.  She wipes her tears, the instinct to
        toughen up taking over again.  But the healing moment has had its
        effect, nevertheless.

        John walks toward Dyson and Terminator.

                                DYSON
                Who are you people?


        John draws the Biker's knife from Terminator's boot.  Hands it to him.


                                JOHN
                Show him.

        Terminator takes off his jacket to reveal bare arms.
        John takes Blythe by the hands and leads her down the hall, away
        from what is about to happen.

136B    TIGHT ON TERMINATOR'S left forearm as the knife makes a deep cut just
        below the elbow.  In one smooth motion, Terminator cuts all the way
        around his arm.  With a second cut, he splits the skin of the forearm
        from elbow to wrist.

        TERMINATOR grasps the skin and strips is off his forearm like a
        surgeon rips off a rubber glove.  It comes off with a sucking rip,
        leaving a bloody skeleton.

        But the skeleton is made of bright metal, and is laced with hydraulic
        actuators.  The fingers are as finely crafted as watch parts... they
        flex into a fist and extend.  Terminator holds it up, palm out, in
        almost the exact position of the one in the vault at Cyberdyne,

        HOLD ON DYSON reacting to the servo-hand in front of him.
        He's seen one of these before.
        Tarissa is screaming now, but he doesn't hear her.

                                DYSON
                My God.

                                TERMINATOR
                Now listen to me very carefully.

137     INT. HOUSE/KITCHEN - LATER

        Sarah puts out her fifth cigarette.  She's sitting on the counter.
        John, Terminator, Dyson, and Tarissa are at the kitchen table, under
        a single overhead light.

        Dyson looks like that guy on the Sistine Chapel wall, the damned
        soul... eyes fixed and staring with terrifying knowledge.  His
        shoulder is bandaged.  Terminator's arm is wrapped with a blood-soaked
        bandage below the elbow.  The steel forearm and hand gleam in the
        harsh kitchen light.  TRACKING AROUND THE TABLE as Terminator
        speaks... we don't hear the words.

                                SARAH (V.O.)
                Dyson listened while the Terminator laid it all
                down.  Skynet.  Judgment Day... the history of
                things to come.  It's not every day you find
                out you're responsible for 3 billion deaths.
                He took it pretty well, considering...

        Terminator finishes speaking.

                                DYSON
                I feel like I'M gonna throw up.

        He looks around at them, clutching the table like he's about to blow
        away.  His face, his posture, his ragged voice express soul-wrenching
        terror.  This is a man ripped out of normal life into their grim
        world.  His voice is pleading.

                                DYSON
                You're judging me on thing's I haven't even
                done yet.  Jesus.  How were we supposed to know?

        Sarah speaks from the shadows behind them.  Dyson turns to find her
        looking right at him.

                                SARAH
                Yeah.  Right.  How were you supposed to know?
                Fucking men... all you know how to do is thrust
                into the world with your... fucking ideas and
                your weapons.  Did you know that every gun in
                the world is named after a man?  Colt, Browning,
                Smith, Thompson, Kalashnikov... all men.  Men
                built the hydrogen bomb, not women... men like
                you thought it up.  You're so creative.  You
                don't know what it's like to really create
                something... to create a life.  To feel it growing
                inside you.  All you know how to create is
                death... you fucking bastards.

                                JOHN
                Mom, Mom, we need to be more constructive here.
                I don't see this as a gender-related issue.
                        (to the Dysons)
                She's still tense.
                        (to Sarah)
                We still have to figure out how to stop it all
                from happening.  Right?

                                TARISSA
                But I thought... aren't we changing things?  I
                mean... right now?  Changing the way it goes?

                                DYSON
                        (seizing on that)
                That's right!  There's no way I'm going to
                finish the new processor now.  Forget it.  I'm
                out of it.  I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow...
                I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,,

                                SARAH
                        (coldly)
                That's not good enough.

        Dyson's voice is pitiful.

                                DYSON
                Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do.  I
                just want my kids to have a chance to grow up,
                okay?

                                TERMINATOR
                No one must follow your work.

                                DYSON
                        (thoughts racing)
                Alright, yeah.  You're right.  We have to
                destroy the stuff at the lab, the files, disk
                drive... and everything I have here.  Everything!
                I don't care.

                                                CUT TO:

138     FIRE ROARING IN A METAL TRASH BARREL.
        Stacks of files are dumped onto it.
        WIDER reveals we are in --

138A    EXT, DYSON'S BACKYARD - NIGHT

        Terminator dumps lighter fluid liberally over the fire, which flares
        up, lighting his face demonically.  Sarah, Dyson, Tarissa, and John
        return from his office with more stuff -- files, notes, optical disks.
        Even his kids are carrying stuff.  It all goes into the fire.  Dyson
        drops the prototype onto the fire... his eyes hollow and distant.

        He stares into the fire, watching his world burning.  The has a
        sudden thought.

                                DYSON
                Do you know about the chip?

                                SARAH
                What chip?

                                DYSON
                They have it in a vault at Cyberdyne...
                        (to Terminator)
                It's gotta be from the other one like you.

                                TERMINATOR
                        (to Sarah)
                The CPU from the first terminator.

                                SARAH
                Son of a bitch, I knew it!

                                DYSON
                They told us not to ask where they got it.  I
                thought... Japan... hell, I don't know.  I
                didn't want to know.

                                SARAH
                Those lying motherfuckers!

                                DYSON
                I was scary stuff, radically advanced.  It was
                shattered... didn't work.  But it gave us ideas,
                It took us in new directions... things we would
                never have thought of.  All this work is based
                on it.

                                TERMINATOR
                I must be destroyed.

                                SARAH
                        (to Dyson)
                Can you get us in there, past security?

                                DYSON
                I think so, yeah.  When?

        Dyson looks at her, Terminator, then John.  Sees his answer.

                                DYSON
                Now?
                        (he takes a breath)
                Yeah, right.

        He turns to his wife.  Her face is streaked with tears, but her eyes
        are strong and clear.  Tarissa puts her hands on his arm.  She is
        stunned by what she's heard, but dealing with it.  She believe them.

                                TARISSA
                Miles, I'm scared.  Okay.  But the only thing
                that scares me more than you going... is you
                not going.

        He nods.  She's right.

                                SARAH
                        (to Terminator)
                Is it safe for them here?

                                TERMINATOR
                        (to Tarissa)
                Take your kids.  Go to a hotel.  Right now.
                Don't pack.
                        (to the others)
                Let's go.

                                                CUT TO:

138B    EXT, HIGHWAY - NIGHT

        Pavement rushing at us, lit by headlights.  Beyond, darkness.

                                SARAH (V.O.)
                The future, always so clear to me, has become
                like a black highway at night.  We were in
                uncharted territory now... making up history
                as we went along.

        TILT UP to reveal a rectangle of light ahead.  The Cyberdyne
        Building...

139     INT. CYBERDYNE SYSTEMS BUILDING/LOBBY - NIGHT

        TIGHT ON A CARD-KEY SCANNER as Dyson's hand zips his security card
        through a slot in one motion.  There is the sound of a servo-lock,
        and --

139A    DYSON enter the spacious lobby, followed by Sarah, John, and
        Terminator last of all.  In a frontal angle, the others block
        Terminator from view.

        THE GUARD at the front desk, GIBBONS, looks up as Dyson moves toward
        him.  Dyson is pale and sweaty, but smiles warmly at the guard,
        speaking well before he reaches the desk.

                                DYSON
                Evening, Paul.  These are friends of mine from
                out of town, I just thought I'd take them up
                and show them around.

                                GIBBONS
                I'm sorry, Mr. Dyson.  You know the rules about
                visitors in the lab.  I need written authoriz --

        K-CHAK!  Gibbons is staring down the barrels of Sarah's .45 and
        Terminator's MAC-10.

                                TERMINATOR
                I insist.

        The guard is too stunned to move.  We see that Terminator is wearing
        his jacket and one black glove.
        Gibbon's eyes go to the silent alarm button on the console.

                                SARAH
                Don't even think about it.

        Gibbons nods.  He stays frozen.  Terminator circles quickly and gets
        the guard out of the chair.  John pulls a roll of duct-tape from his
        knapsack and tears off a piece.

140     INT. SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR

        ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN and Terminator leads the group warily into the
        corridor.  They have a cart piled high with gear in nylon bags.
        Dyson motions down the corridor to the right.  As they walk, he
        continues to fill them in --

                                DYSON
                The vault needs two keys to open.  Mine...
                        (holds up key)
                ... and one from the security station.  It's in
                a locker but my card should access it.  Here
                we go.

        They stand in front of a wide security door.  A sign above reads
        SPECIAL PROJECTS DIVISION:  AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.  Dyson zips
        his key-card through the scanner and the door unlatches.

141     OMITTED

142     INT. FIRST FLOOR CORRIDOR/LOBBY

        A ROVING GUARD, MOSHIER, strolls down the long corridor from the
        first-floor office block.  A punch clock swings at his hip, and he's
        just completed his circuit of the building.  He passes the back of
        elevators and rounds the corner to the front desk, calling out --

                                MOSHIER
                Honey, I'm home...

        He sees the desk is deserted and frowns.  Figures Gibbons must be in
        the can, so checks that first before getting alarmed.
        TRACKING WITH HIM to the restroom around the corner,

                                MOSHIER
                Hey, man, you shouldn't leave the --

142A    OVER HIS SHOULDER we see past the door as he pushes it open, revealing
        Gibbons handcuffed to the urinal.  Moshier spins on a dime and sprints
        to the desk where he slams down on the silent alarm button.

153     INT. SECURITY STATION

        The security station is a pass-through area with a counter, behind
        which are desks and a bank of monitors, showing boring movies about
        empty corridors.  Dyson crosses quickly to a locker behind the
        monitor area.  He swished his card repeatedly through the scanner on
        the locker.  Nothing happens.  The light on the locker is blinking
        red.  Sarah notices Dyson's alarmed expression.

                                DYSON
                What?  WHAT IS IT?

        Dyson whips around, staring at a light flashing on the console behind
        him.

                                DYSON
                Silent alarm's been tripped.  It neutralizes
                the codes throughout the building.  Nothing'll
                open now.

        We see his nerve snapping.

                                DYSON
                We should abort.

                                SARAH
                NO!! We're going all the way!  You got that,
                Dyson?

        She's right in his face.  Somehow, it works for him.  He nods, getting
        some resolve from somewhere.

144     INT. LOBBY

        Moshier's gotten Gibbons loose.  He's on the phone to the cops.

                                GIBBONS
                ... multiple armed subjects.  Look, I think
                it's the guy from that mall shootout, and the
                woman... yeah, her.  Pretty sure.  Just send
                everything you've got in the area --

145     INT. SECURITY STATION./LAB

        John jumps up on the desk next to the wall-mounted locker.  Dyson
        stares in amazement as John starts pulling his counter-electronics
        gear out of his knapsack.  It's just another Ready-Teller to him.

                                JOHN
                You guys get started on the lab... I can open
                this.

145A    Dyson leads Terminator and Sarah to the main lab doors.  Another
        servo-lock.
        He tries his card.  Nothing.

                                DYSON
                No good.

                                TERMINATOR
                Let me try mine.

        He unslings the M-79, pulling it over his shoulder in one motion.
        Sarah grabs Dyson and drags him back down the hall.
        Terminator opens the breach and slide in one of the fat 40mm H.E.
        grenades.  He flips the thing closed with a snap of the wrist.

                                SARAH
                        (yelling as she runs)
                John!  Fire-in-the-hole!

        John drops what he is doing, and covers his ears.
        Terminator fires at inhumanely close range.
145B    The door EXPLODES into kindling.  The concussion blow his jacket
        open, and flying shrapnel whizzes all around him.  Before the
        thunderclap has faded Terminator walks into the fire and smoke.
        John goes back to work without missing a beat.
        Sarah and a stunned Dyson walk through the burning doorframe into the
        Artificial Intelligence Lab.

        A SIREN is sounding.  The HALON FIRE-CONTROL SYSTEM has been
        triggered.  The invisible gas roars in, putting out the flames.

                                DYSON
                Fire's set off the halo system!  Here...
                hurry!

        Dyson runs to a wall cabinet and pulls out some BREATHING MASKS.  He
        hands one to Sarah and dons the other.  Then he reaches out to hand
        one to Terminator.

                                DYSON
                Here!

        Terminator doesn't need a mask, since is oxygen requirements are so
        low.  He ignores Dyson as he removes his massive backpack and opens
        it.  Dyson shrugs and tosses the mask on a desk.  He turns to Sarah.

                                DYSON
                        (yelling through the mask)
                We'll have to keep these on a couple minutes,
                till the gas clears.

        Terminator pulls two five-gallon jerry-cans of gasoline from his
        pack.
        Sarah starts pulling out book-sized, olive-grab CLAYMORE MINES,
        stacking them next to the gasoline.  Dyson stares.  Part of him can't
        believe they're really doing this.

                                                CUT TO:

146     INT. DYSON HOUSE - NIGHT

        The T-1000 moves slowly though the ravaged office, analyzing what has
        happened here.  It walks down the dark hallway.  The place is
        deserted.  The police-walkie clipped on its belt (real, not simulated)
        blares to life.

                                DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                All units, all units.  211 in progress at 2144
                Kramer Street, the Cyberdyne building.  Multiple
                suspects, armed with automatic weapons and
                explosives.  SWAT unit is en route...

147     EXT. HOUSE/STREET

        The T-1000 sprints up and throws its leg over the big C.H.P. Kawasaki.
        Fires it up.  It smokes an arcing scorch-mark on the pavement as it
        spins around and roars away.

                                                CUT TO:

148     INT. CYBERDYNE BUILDING/LAB

        TIGHT ON A LARGE DISK DRIVE.  State-of-the-art.  Very expensive.  A
        FIRE AXE smashes down through the housing, shattering the disk.

148A    WIDER, revealing a scene of high-tech pillage.  Terminator beats the
        disk drive into junk and steps to another.  WHAM.  Same routine.  He's
        already demolished half a dozen.
        Sarah topples a file cabinet, scattering files.
        Dyson staggers up with an armload of heavy M-O (magnetic-optical)
        disks and drops them on a growing stack in the middle of the floor.
        He and Sarah have their breathing masks hanging down around their
        necks, since the halon gas has dissipated.

                                DYSON
                        (to Sarah, panting)
                Yeah, all that stuff!  And all the disks in
                those offices.  Especially my office...
                everything in my office!
                        (to Terminator)
                These, too!  This is important.
                        (SMASH!)
                And all this here... that's it.

148B    Sarah goes into Dyson's office and starts hurling everything out the
        door onto the central junkpile... books, files, everything on the
        desk.
        A FRAMED PHOTO of Dyson's wife and kids lands on top of the heap.
        Tarissa, hugging Danny and Blythe, all grinning.  The glass is
        shattered.

148C    Terminator cuts a swath, under Dyson's direction, exploding equipment
        into fragments with his inhuman swings.
        SMASH!  It's carnage.  Millions in hardware, and all irreplaceable
        fruits of their years of research... shattered, broken, dumped in a
        heap for the big bonfire of destiny.
        Dyson stops a second, panting.

                                DYSON
                Give me that thing a second.

        Terminator hands him the axe.  Dyson hefts it one-handed.  He turns to
        a lab table... on it is another prototype processor.

                                DYSON
                I've worked for years on this thing.

        Swinging awkwardly but with great force he smashes the axe down onto
        the processor prototype, exploding it into fragments.  His shoulder is
        agony, but he looks satisfied.

149     INT. SECOND FLOOR SECURITY STATION

        John taps away at his little lap-top, which is running code
        combinations into the card-key lock.  Suddenly, the green light on 
        the lock goes on and it unlocks with a clunk.

                                JOHN
                Easy money.

        He whips it open, revealing a rack of keys.  But the VAULT-KEY is
        distinctive, a long steel rectangle on a neck-chain.  John grabs it
        and runs toward the lab.

150     INT. LAB

        Sarah and Terminator are working like a crack team, rigging the
        explosives.  She is taping the claymores to the gas cans with duct
        tape to create powerful incendiary bombs.  Terminator is attaching
        claymores and blocks of C-4 plastic explosive to the large MAINFRAME
        COMPUTER cabinets nearby.  All the claymores are wired back to one
        detonator with has a RADIO-CONTROL RELAY switch.

                                DYSON
                How do you set them off?

        Terminator shows him a REMOTE DETONATOR, a small transmitter with a
        red plunger.

                                TERMINATOR
                Radio remote.

        He makes a plunger-pushing motion with his thumb and an accompanying
        "click" sound.  Dyson nods.
        Just then John comes running in, holding up the key.

                                JOHN
                I got it.  Piece of cake.

                                SARAH
                        (to Dyson and Terminator)
                Go!  I'll finish here.

        They run out as the SOUND OF SIRENS grow louder outside.

                                TERMINATOR
                I'll deal with the police.

                                JOHN
                Remember what I said, you can't...

                                TERMINATOR
                Trust me.

151     EXT. CYBERDYNE BUILDING

        The security duo of Moshier and Gibbons cowers behind cars in the
        parking lot in front of the building.  They turns as L.A.P.D. BLACK-
        AND-WHITES pour into the lot, turn the area into a disco of whirling
        blue and red lights.

152     OMITTED

153     EXT. CYBERDYNE BUILDING

        The cops are jumping from their cars and ducking behind them.
        Emphasis on small arms here.  Behind them an ugly BLACK SWAT VAN
        screeches into the lot.

153A    We hear the THUMP OF ROTORS as a POLICE CHOPPER arrives and swings in
        close to the building.  It rakes its XENON SPOTLIGHT through the
        second floor offices.

154     INT./EXT. SECOND FLOOR OFFICE

        Terminator crosses the office toward the floor-to-ceiling windows.
        He is outlines starkly by the spotlight as it rakes through the dark
        offices.  Without breaking stride he kicks an executive desk toward
        the window.
154A    Glass explodes outward and the desk topples, falling to the sidewalk
        below.

154B    Terminator, standing at the edge, FIRES A LONG BURST with strafes the
        police cars lines up below.  Cops duck as glass flies.  Terminator,
        with his superb aim, hits no one.  But noticed is served.

154C    The cops (surprise) FIRE BACK.  Terminator turns and is walking
        calmly from the window as glass, office furniture, drapes etc. are
        riddled by return fire.  A few rounds hit his back, but he doesn't
        notice.  He reloads as he walks.

155     INT. VAULT ANTECHAMBER

        TIGHT ON A KEY inserted into one of the vault locks.

        WIDER as John and Dyson stand poised, hands on keys.

                                JOHN
                And let's see what's behind door number one.

        Dyson nods and they turns the keys together.  The vault grumbles to
        itself, withdrawing it locking bolts with a final KLONK!
        Together Dyson and John swing the door open.

156     EXT./INT. LOBBY

        The varsity takes the field as the SWAT TROOPERS sprint forward by
        squads.  They flank the lobby and work their way inside, deploying
        rapidly.  They move and freeze, behind cover, quivering with
        adrenaline.  They have all that great SWAT equipment:  body armor,
        gas-masks, M-16s, tear-gas launchers, ropes.  The works.  They make
        a lot of hand signals and keep their mouths shut.  They're well-
        trained and deadly.

157     OUTSIDE we see cops firing TEAR GAS grenades through the broken
        windows into second-floor offices.

158     INT. VAULT

        John and Dyson are isolated from the world in this silent steel womb.
        Dyson opens the cabinet containing the terminator relics.  It's John
        turn to stare with uneasy deja-vu as he sees the terminator hand and
        CPU.

        Then in one vicious move he sweeps his arm behind the inert-gas flasks
        and hurls them to the floor.  They SHATTER.  John snatches the CPU
        and the metal hand out of the broken glass.

                                JOHN
                Got ol' Skynet by the ball now, Miles.  Come
                on, let's book!

        Clutching the steel hand and pocketing the chip like it's a Mars bar
        he just bought, John runs out.  Dyson follows.

159     INT. FIRST FLOOR CORRIDOR/STAIRWELL

        We see the advance squad of SWATs make it to one of the stairwells.
        They start up, two at a time, covering each other ritualistically by
        the numbers.

160     INT. LAB/HALL

        John pelts into the lab with Dyson stumbling along behind him.
        Sarah is just finished wiring all the charges to the central
        detonator.

                                JOHN
                Ready to rock?

                                SARAH
                Ready.

        John tosses her the metal hand.  She catches it and bends to put the
        hand in her empty back-pack.  Sarah zips the pack and starts to shuck
        into it.

        Dyson's running out of steam.  The bandages at his shoulder are soaked
        with seeping blood.  He stands in the middle of the lab, saying
        goodbye in his mind, looking weak and empty.
        Terminator strides into the lab.

                                TERMINATOR
                Time to go.  Right now.

        He and John head back the way they came, through security.
        Sarah sees that in her work, she has set the detonator down twenty
        feet away, near where Dyson is standing.

                                SARAH
                Dyson, hand me the detonator.  Let's go --

        He gingerly picks up the detonator.  Starts toward her.  Then --
160A    CRASH!!  THE DOORS AT THE BACK END OF THE LAB ARE KICKED OPEN.
        SWAT LEADER  and two others OPEN FIRE.
        Their M-16s rake the room.  Sarah dives behind a computer cabinet.
        Dyson is HIT.  He is slammed to the floor by the impacts.

161     IN THE HALL, John hears the firing and spins to run back.

                                JOHN
                Mommm!!!

        Terminator grabs him as bullets slam into his broad back.  He makes
        it around the corner with John, out of the line of fire.

162     IN THE LAB, bullets rake over Sarah's head, smacking all around her,
        clanging into the machine protecting her.  She can see Dyson, slumped
        on the floor.  Debris and flying glass rain on her as the SWATs pour
        on the fire.  The detonator is clutched in his hand.  He rolls to face
        her, his eyes bulging from the pain of his torn-up guts.

                                DYSON
                Go.

162A    Sarah hesitates a split second.  Then she snap-rolls and fast-crawls
        through broken glass and debris into the hall where --

        TERMINATOR grabs her by the jacket and hauls her roughly to her feet.
        Bullets rake the walls behind them as they sprint forward.  They
        round the corner.  John does a fast take that she's not hit and they
        run together through the security checkpoint.

163     INT. SECURITY STATION/CORRIDOR

        John reaches the first door, and tries it.  Locked.
        Terminator unslings the M-79 blooper smoothly, opening the breach.

                                TERMINATOR
                Get back.

        He pulls a grenade from the bandolier over his shoulder, and slides
        it into the bore.  Flick his wrist.  The breech snaps shut.  Sarah
        and John have a split second to duck and cover.

                                TERMINATOR
                Cover you ears and open you mouth.

163A    They do.  KABOOM!!! Twenty feet away the door, and half the wall
        around it, EXPLODES outward.  The backblast hits Terminator full
        force, but he strides through the smoking hole before the debris has
        even hit the floor.

164     OMITTED

165     INT. LAB

        SWAT LEADER moves cautiously through the lab.  Cat-stepping, he
        circles around a desk which block Dyson's body from his view.  His
        M-16 is leveled crisply.  We look over his shoulder as he rounds the
        desk, revealing --

        MILES DYSON is not dead.  He will be very soon, but at this moment he
        is conscious.  He has propped himself up against the desk, and holds a
        BOOK in one hand.  A heavy technical manual.

        Below the book is the detonator, upright on the tile floor.
        The message is clear.  "Shoot me, the book drops on the plunger.
        Adios."  Dyson wheezes, trying to draw enough breath to talk.

                                DYSON
                I don't know... how much longer... I can...
                hold this thing...

        SWAT Leader seems to see the wires, the claymores, the gas cans all
        around him for the first time.  His eyes, visible through his gas-
        mask, go very wide.
        He spins and motions his squad back.

                                LEADER
                Fall back!!  Everybody out!  Move it!  OUT
                NOW!

        They retreat so fast they crash into the next group coming up the
        stairs.

166     INT. CORRIDOR

        Terminator reaches the main elevators.  Hits the button.  Sarah and
        John are coughing and stumbling in the choking darkness, buddy-
        breathing with the single mask.  The doors open.  They get in the
        elevator and head down.

167     INT. LAB

        Dyson is lying amid the ruins of his dreams.  Sprawled on the floor,
        he has his back propped up against the desk.  He is bathed in his own
        blood, which runs out in long fingers across the tiles.  His breathing
        is shallow and raspy.  He still holds the book, trembling, above the
        switch.

        In his lap is the picture from his desk.  He has pulled it from the
        debris next to him.  A tear trickles from his eye.  His wife and
        children smile up at him through broken glass.

168     OMITTED

169     CUT TO THE PUPIL OF HIS EYE, at the moment of death, the instant the
        light fade from his eyes and he is gone --
        His arm drops and the book his the switch --

170     EXT. BUILDING

        As the face of the building EXPLODES in an eruption of glass and fire.
        Remains of the second-floor windows shower the parking lot and a huge
        fireball rolls out, leaping into the sky.
        The cops look up, stunned.  The helicopter banks away from the heat.
        Burning debris falls among the cop cars and a number of officers 
        break ranks, pulling back.

171     ONLY ONE OF THEM seems to be moving with purpose.  A BIKE COP who has
        just arrived drives through the disorganized crowd, directly toward
        the building.

171A    T-1000 guns the bike up a ramp to a pedestrian bridge which crosses
        from a parking structure to the Cyberdyne building.  It enters on the
        second floor, which is now a burning maze.

172     INT. SECOND FLOOR/OFFICE/CORRIDOR

        T-1000 drives into the smoky wreckage.  It draws a Hoechler and Koch
        MPK machine pistol and cruises slowly into the firelit offices,
        scanning.

172A    IN THE CORRIDOR the bike skirts flaming wreckage as it idles forward.
        T-1000 scans the leaping shadows for its prey.

173     INT. GROUND FLOOR/ELEVATOR/LOBBY

        The elevator doors part and Terminator eases a look out into the
        corridor.  The walls on either side of him ERUPT WITH BULLET HITS.
        The SWATs have the lobby end of the corridor blocked off.  They're
        totally trapped, cut off and screwed.

                                JOHN
                        (to Sarah)
                Don't forget.  It's always darkness right
                before... you're totally fucked.

173A    The SWATs fire a tear-gas grenade toward the elevators.  It spews the
        vicious CS gas out in a swirling cloud which envelops Sarah and John,
        who are pressed against the back wall of the elevator.

                                TERMINATOR
                Keep your eyes closed.  Don't move.
                        (they nod, eyes squeezed shut)
                I'll be back.

        He slings the grenade launcher over his shoulder and walks out into
        the corridor.

173B    BLAM.  A tear-gas grenade ricochets from wall to wall as it flies down
        the corridor.  It skids to rest in front of Terminator, throwing out
        a white cloud which quickly fills the corridor.
173C    In the elevator, Sarah and John are choking, handing the breathing
        mask back and forth desperately.  They're scarred.  This looks like
        it.
173D    ANGLE ON THE SWAT TEAM, gripping their weapons at the mouth of the
        corridor.  They watch the boiling cloud, waiting.

173E    THEIR POV -- on the wall of boiling smoke.  A FIGURE APPEARS.  Walking
        Totally unaffected.  Terminator emerges from the smoke.  Not even
        misty-eyed.  Not what they expected.

                                LEADER
                        (through megaphone)
                Stop where you are.  Lie down on the floor,
                face down.  Down on floor, now!

        He continues to stride toward them.
        The SWATs tense up.  They've never seen anything like this.  They're
        not sure what to do.  Closer and closer.

                                LEADER
                Drop him.

        They OPEN FIRE.  The corridor is filled with CRACKING THUNDER.  The
        rounds tear into Terminator's chest.  Stomach.  Face.  Thighs.  His
        leather jacket leaps and jerks as the rounds hit him.  The SWATs
        think the guy's wearing body armor or something.  They keep firing.
        The rounds tear into him, staggering him slightly, but he keeps
        moving.

                                LEADER
                You're not hitting him!

                                SWAT #1
                        (getting scared)
                Yes I am!

        Terminator draws his .45 smoothly.  Unhurried.  He shoots the nearest
        man in the left thigh.  As he screams and drops, Terminator shoots
        him in the right thigh.  Terminator bends down and picks up the 
        shrieking man's weapon... the TEAR-GAS LAUNCHER.

        It is one of those new rotary jobs that hold 12 rounds in a big drum.
        Terminator shoots the next SWAT in the chest with the tear-gas
        launcher.  The gas canister hits the guy's body armor and doesn't
        penetrate.  But it's like getting slugged in the stomach with a full-
        swing from a baseball bat.  The SWAT fold double and hits the tiles,
        gasping.

        Terminator is an image from Hell, a tall figure in shredded black
        leather, streaked with blood.  One eye is a bloody socket, the metal
        eye-servo glistening.  The flesh of one cheek hangs down in tatters,
        revealing the chrome cheekbone beneath.  The whole front of his 
        jacket is blown open, revealing his metal armor chest.

        The remaining SWATs start to fall back.  One turns to run and --
        KPOW!  A gas canister nail him in the back, sending him sprawling.

173F    Terminator fires three gas canisters into the lobby.  It fills
        rapidly with the white gas, cutting the visibility to a few feet.  It
        is total pandemonium.  SWAT LEADER crouches in the fog, white-
        knuckling the rifle.  Terminator looms suddenly out of the mist right
        in front of him.  POOM!  Terminator drills him in the leg with the
        .45.  As the guy screams and drops rifle to clutch his leg, Terminator
        rips his gas mask off.  The SWAT leader drops writhing to the floor,
        choking and gagging, clutching his bleeding thigh.

        Terminator walks up to two SWATs at the front doors.  POW-POW.  Leg
        and leg.  He snatches their masks as they fall.  The gunfire has
        stopped.  Nobody an see anything.  Screams and whimpers echo in the
        smoke.

174     EXT. BUILDING

        Smoke boils out of the front door as a figure emerges.  Firing the
        tear-gas launcher with one hand, Terminator launches all remaining
        rounds among the cop vehicles.  Unprotected officers run, choking
        and half-blind, slamming into cars and tripping over each other.  It
        is a total rout.

175     AT THE SWAT VAN on of the SWATs is rapidly handing out the remaining
        masks to unprotected cops.  A FIGURE appears out of the smoke beside
        him.  He looks up.  His mask is ripped off and he is handed the empty
        launcher.  Instinctively he catches it.  Terminator grabs his flak
        vest with one hand and sails him out into the mist.

175A    INT. SWAT VAN

        Terminator strides the length of the van and climbs into the driver's
        seat.  No keys in the ignition.  He flips down the sun visor.  The
        keys fall into his hand.  He starts the van and slams it into gear.

176     INT./EXT. LOBBY

        The tear gas has cleared to a thin haze.  The uninjured SWATs are
        tending their wounded.  They look up at the sound of shouts and a
        roaring engine.

176A    THE SWAT VAN CRASHES INTO THE LOBBY in an explosion of glass and
        debris.  Cops scatter as the van screeches across the lobby in a 
        smoking one-eighty, sliding to a stop across the corridor which leads
        to the bank of elevators.  Terminator backs up until -- crunch -- he
        seals the corridor with the back of the van.

176B    Sarah and John stumble along the corridor, coughing.
        They leap into the back of the van and Terminator hits the throttle.
        The van roars across the lobby and exits through blown-out windows.

                                                CUT TO:

177     INT./EXT SECOND FLOOR

        T-1000, astride the Kawasaki, looks down from a second-floor office
        and sees the van tearing across the parking lot with the remaining
        cops firing at it.  It knows.  It looks around.  Analyzing options.
        It sees the helicopter hovering outside the building at the end of
        this corner office block...
        It twists full throttle on the powerful bike.
        Roars through the office, accelerating fast, straight at the
        windows --

178     T-1000 BLASTS OUT THROUGH THE GLASS, airborne on the motorcycle.  It
        rockets across the gap to the hovering chopper and --
178A    SLAMS into the canopy.  The impact of bike and rider pitches the
        chopper radically.  The startled PILOT fights to regain control as the
        bike tumbles to the pavement below.
178B    The T-1000 doesn't.  It clings to the shattered canopy.
        Nightmarishly, the pilot watches as the T-1000 smashes its head
        through the plexiglass canopy and rapidly POURS ITSELF through the
        jagged hole.  It reforms instantly into its previous self on the
        passenger seat.

178C    It hurls the pilot out of the chopper and slides into the driver's
        seat.
        The chopper is auto-rotating, spinning out of control.  It drops
        toward the parking lot.  T-1000 recovers control ten feet above the
        ground.

178D    Cops hits the deck as the tail-boom swings around, going over them by
        inches.
        The chopper lifts out in a power climb, roaring away across the
        parking lot toward the fleeing SWAT van.

        OKAY, BUCKLE YOUR SEATBELTS, HERE IT COMES...

179     INT./EXT. SWAT VAN/HIGHWAY - NIGHT

        Terminator looks back at his two passengers as he turns the boxy van
        onto a divided highway.  Sarah and John are catching their breath,
        still coughing from the CS gas.  Terminator look to the rear-view
        mirror.  He sees the xenon searchlight of the chopper behind them,
        gaining.

        Sarah looks around the inside of the SWAT van.  It is a rolling
        armory.  There are rifles, ballistic vests, all manner of equipment.

                                SARAH
                John, get under these.  Hurry!

        He sits against the front bulkhead of the van and she pile bullet-
        proof vests on top of him, completely covering him.  Then she grabs
        two M-16s from the wall-rack and loads them.  She starts on a shotgun
        as --

180     The SWAT van weaves through sparse traffic at high speed.
        Terminator slews the unstable van around cars and trucks which seem to
        be crawling.  The van hits it top speed of eighty.  They swerve to
        miss the back end of A WHITE 18-WHEEL TANKER.
180A    The chopper swings in behind them, closing fast.
180B    T-1000 reaches through the shattered canopy with the MPK machine
        pistol and FIRES.  The back of the can CLANGS WITH HITS.  The door
        windows are BLOWN IN.

        Terminator weaves the van, trying to throw off the T-1000's aim.
        The unstable vehicle screeches and wobbles on the edge of control.
        One of the doors is kicked open.  Sarah, wearing a ballistic vest,
        crouches in the doorway, whipping up the M-16.  SHE OPENS FIRE.

180C    Bullets riddle what's left of the chopper's canopy as the T-1000
        returns fire.
        The van is stitched with hits.

180D    INSIDE THE VAN holes are punched through the thin sheet-metal walls,
        ripping up the interior.  The vests covering John are hit repeatedly.
        We see that Sarah has hung two Kevlar vests on the inside of the back
        door and she ducks behind these as bullets hit around her.  She pops
        back out and fires in controlled bursts.  The M-16 empties and she
        grabs another.

180E    Terminator serves around a car which is changing lanes, hitting it
        and knocking it skidding.

181     OMITTED

181A    Sarah reloads and keeps firing.  The van swerves around a Toyota.  A
        moment later the helicopter passes it, the rotor just clearing the top
        of the car.

181B    T-1000 FIRES the machine pistol.
181C    Sarah has popped out to fire.  She takes a HIT in the thigh, and
        several rounds hammer into her Kevlar vest.  She is thrown back onto
        the floor of the van.  She lies there, an exposed target...

181D    Terminator sees the T-1000 preparing to fire again.
        He locks up the van's brakes.  Tires scream as the vehicle shimmies.
        Sarah is thrown forward, sliding up to the bulkhead next to John.
182     And the helicopter SLAMS RIGHT INTO THE BACK OF THE VAN.
        The rotor disintegrates.  The back doors of the van are crushed in as
        the canopy, the whole front of the fuselage is HAMMERED INTO JUNK,
        trapping the T-1000 inside the twisted metal.  The chopper hits the
        pavement, flips, sideways, and cartwheels... smashing itself into a
        shapeless mass of twisted metal.
        It falls away behind the van, tumbling end over end.

182A    Terminator fights to control the van, which is fishtailing violently
        from the impact.  It smashes up against the center divider, screeching
        along the concrete, and then pulls away.  Terminator puts the hammer
        down and the van accelerates.  He swerves to avoid an UGLY PICKUP
        crawling like a snail ahead.

        THE RIGHT FRONT FENDER of the van, crumpled by slamming the wall, is
        sawing into the tire.  The tire blows and peels off the clean rim.
        The steel wheel grinds across the pavement, striking trails of sparks,
        and the van slides sideways and topples --
        STEEL SCREAMS on pavement as the van grinds to a stop on its side.

182B    INSIDE THE VAN, John crawls to Sarah, who is groaning and holding her
        bleeding leg.  She is white and shocky.  Terminator starts to
        extricate himself from the crumpled driver's seat.

183     BACK DOWN THE ROAD, THE HELICOPTER wreckage is a crumpled ball of junk
        metal, unrecognizable.  Behind it, the TANKER TRUCK brakes hard, 
        shuddering and groaning, trying to stop.  The big tires lock up in
        clouds of tire-smoke.  The rig comes to a shuddering stop just short
        of the wrecked chopper.

183A    The shaken DRIVER jumps down.
        The behind the wreckage a cop emerges, walking toward him.

                                DRIVER
                Goddamn, are you alri --

183B    SSSHHCK!  T-1000 drives a blade through the man's abdomen and walks
        on past without slowing, or even looking at him.

183C    It climbs into the open cab of the tanker.  Releases the brake.
        As the truck bellows are rolls forward we see the large blue letters
        on the side which say "CRYOCO INC.  LIQUID NITROGEN SUPPLY'.

184     AT THE SWAT VAN John and Terminator are carrying Sarah out of the
        wreck.  Terminator has the M-79 slung over his shoulder, the
        bandolier of grenades, and his .45 stuck in his waistband.  John has
        borrowed a 12-GAUGE RIOT GUN from the SWATs.

184A    The pickup they passes seconds earlier pulls up to them.  The DRIVER,
        A Hispanic guy in his 50's, is getting out to help them.  Terminator
        and John hear a CRASH and look back as the
185     helicopter wreckage is knocked aside by the accelerating tanker truck.

186                             JOHN
                Holy shit.  Come on, Mom... we gotta keep
                moving... come on --

                                TERMINATOR
                        (to the pickup owner)
                We need your truck.

        The guy seems to know better than to try and stop him as Terminator
        slides Sarah into the front seat and climbs in behind the wheel.  John
        runs to the passenger side.

187     THE TANKER ROARS, spewing smoke from its chrome stacks as it shifts
        up through the gears.

188     Terminator slams the pickup in gear, checking the rear-view.  The
        tanker is a hundred feet behind them now, and really moving.
        Terminator puts the throttle down, but the pickup is and old slug
        loaded down by a heavy home-made wooden camper-shell.  It accelerates
        slowly.

189     THE TANKER slams into one end of the SWAT van, spinning it out of the
        way with a roar and screech of twisting metal.  The 18-wheeler shifts
        to a higher gear, still accelerating.

190     INT./EXT. PICKUP TRUCK

        With the tanker right behind them, Terminator cuts the wheel, swerving
        the pickup back and forth across the lanes.
        The big rig stays right on them, it tanker whiplashing violently.

                                JOHN
                Faster!  He's right on us!

        Terminator doesn't reply.  He rapidly unslings the blooper, still
        around his neck, and reaches for a grenade.

191     LOW ANGLE ON THE TRACTOR-TRAILER as it roars right up to the lens,
        filling frame with chrome and lights.

191A    K-WHAM!!  It rams the backs of the pickup, sending it skidding.

191B    Then the T-1000 pulls the tractor trailer up alongside the pickup and
        crabs over, sandwiching it against the center divider.  The spinning
        chrome hubs tear into the passenger side door and the guard rail
        screeches along the other side.

        The pickup bucks and shakes insanely.  It ricochets violently between
        the big-rig and the divider
        Horrible SCREECH of tortured steel.
        Sparks pour in sheets of fire from both sides.
        The windshield shatters as the door-posts buckle in.
        Metal and glass shower in through the side windows.
        The frame twists and buckles.  John feels like the fillings are being
        shaken right out of his teeth.
        The wooden camper disintegrates, falling away as kindling behind
        them.

191C    INT. TANKER CAB

        T-1000 holds the wheel hard over, mercilessly grinding the pickup.
        The whole rig jerks and shakes with the violence of the sustained
        hammering.

191D    INT./EXT. PICKUP

        Terminator slides toward the passenger side.  Keeping his foot on the
        gas he lifts John over him and puts him in the driver's seat.

                                TERMINATOR
                Drive for a minute.

                                JOHN
                Where you going?!

        Terminator slams the shattered windshield with the palm of his hand.
        Held together by the plastic laminate, the windshield flops out of its
        frame.  It flies over the top of the truck.

191E    Terminator pushes his upper body out over the dashboard and stands up.
        He turns and aims the M-79 one-handed.
191F    POOM!  The grenade misses the T-1000 by less than a foot.  It EXPLODES
        against the front bulkhead of the tanker, almost at the top.  Liquid
        nitrogen pours from the opening, swept back by the 60-mph windstream.

191G    The big-rig swerves as T-1000 regains control.  The tanker swings like
        a pendulum behind the cab.

191H    The pickup accelerates, getting back out in front by a few yards.
        Behind it the big-rig is trailing a swirling comet-tail of nitrogen
        vapor.  It is gaining again.

        Terminator, still standing, opens the breech and starts to reload.
191I    John cuts across the highway and takes an OFF RAMP.

191J    T-1000 swerves the smoking behemoth across the lanes and down the
        ramp after him, still accelerating.  It is twenty feet behind them
        and closing when Terminator closes the breech and FIRES.

191K    The grenade hits the front grill and EXPLODES.
        The radiator is destroyed, along with half the hood.  Steam blasts
        out, obscuring the whole front of the truck.

191L    The semi rams the back of the pickup again.  Spewing smoke and vapor
        like some demon locomotive, the tractor-trailer pounds into the back
        of the pickup.  Driving it right through the intersection at the
        bottom of the ramp, and straight toward --

        EXT. STEEL MILL

        The chase has led them to an area of heavy industry.

192     THE GATES are blasted off their hinges as the semi rams the pickup
        right through them.  Terminator struggles to reload amid the chaos
        and impacts.  He has THREE GRENADES LEFT on the bandolier.

        John isn't even steering.  They are just being pushed.  There's
        nothing he can do.  They are rocketing down the broad thoroughfare
        which leads directly to the MAIN BUILDING of the plant.

192A    Terminator pulls himself onto the roof of the pickup.
        He leaps to the bed, takes two powerful strides and --
        Leaps onto the semi.  He climbs rapidly onto the hood.
192B    And FIRES POINT BLANK THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.
        Right into T-1000's face.
        The EXPLOSION blows out all the glass and fills the cab with smoke
        and fire  Terminator grabs onto the air-horn as the truck starts to
        SHUDDER AND
192C    SCREAM.  IT IS JACK-KNIFING.
        Almost dream-slow the cab begins to swing sideways, until its tires
        are shrieking over the pavement.  The tractor is smashed back at
        right-angles to the tanker-trailer which begins to slide broadside.

192D    The juggernaut bucks and shudders as the tires and smoke sideways
        across the pavement.
        It begins to topple.
        Terminator hold on as the side of cab becomes the top.
        With an unholy scream, like the unoiled hubs of Hell, the whole rig
        slides on its side at 60 mph toward the steel mill.  A sheet of sparks
        sixty feet wide trails behind it on the pavement.

192E    John sees what's behind him, then snaps around to see the building
        looming right in front.  The huge rolling doors are partly open.
        No choice.
        He steers right through them into the mill, as --

192F    Terminator, with one second to go, leaps from the cab --
        He flies through the open doors as --
        The tanker hits the building and --

193     INT. STEEL MILL/MAIN AISLE

        Terminator slams to the floor of the mill and rolls, as --
        The tanker-trailer smashed into a massive concrete support at one side
        of the doors.  Thunderous carnage of twisting metal.              o
193A    It splits wide open.  A river of liquid nitrogen pours out at -230.

193B    John hits the brakes, sliding out of control.  He slows almost to a
        stop but hits a steel support column head-on.  He and Sarah are
        slammed forward, hard.

193C    Terminator, still clutching the M-79 blooper, rolls and slides across
        the floor.
        He smashes through a railing and slams up against the base of a
        massive machine.

193D    The semi cab swings about the trailer wreckage, into the building, and
        shudders to a stop.  Liquid nitrogen sprays over the cab, flooding out
        around it in a HISSING WAVEFRONT OF ULTRACOLD.
        Freezing vapor swirls everywhere, obscuring the wreck.

193E    TERMINATOR lies still.  A beat.  Then he rolls weakly, rising on one
        elbow to survey the scene.

193F    IN THE WRECKED PICKUP, John stirs.  He is stunned, and blood runs from
        his nose.  Dazed, he realizes he is in a steel mill.  There are
        sirens, and he can see men running... shouting.  He turns and sees
        what they are running from...

193G    The wall of nitrogen vapor spreads from the demolished tanker.  It is
        a strange vista of fire and ice.  The huge SMELTERS pour out orange
        light and fire from the sides of the huge galley, while the freezing
        vapor rolls down the center.

193H    TIGHT ON THE WRECK.  A billowing gray cloud.  Deep inside, the shape
        of the cab in visible.  A FIGURE emerges, pulling itself out.  It
        drops to the floor.  The hissing, boiling river of liquid nitrogen
        flows around its feet.

194     The T-1000 staggers, moving slowly, painfully.  It has finally been
        affected by something.  Its feet are freezing to the ground as it
        walks...

194A    CLINK!  One of its feet breaks off at a glassy angle.  It stumbles
        forward, and --
194B    Its other foot snaps off.  As it catches its balance on the stump of
        its other ankle,
194C    the whole lower leg shatters at the impact.  It topples forward to its
        knees.
        Catches itself on one hand.  Liquid nitrogen flows around the hand.

        Now the hand is stuck to the pavement.
194D    The T-1000 pulls and... CLINK!  The hand snaps off at the wrist.
        It looks stupidly at the glassy stump of a wrist.  For the first time
        we see an expression on its face we know to be a true one...
        The expression is pain.  Agony.  Its mouth opens in a soundless
        scream as the hoar-frost races up its legs, across its body.
194E    And that's the position it freezes in.
        It has become a statue, kneeling in the frozen vapor, that surprised
        look of agony frozen on its face.

        The liquid nitrogen stops flowing and begins to evaporate.
194F    Terminator, just beyond the boundary of the cold, can see the T-1000
        clearly.
        He draws his .45 and aims.

                                TERMINATOR
                Hasta la vista, baby.

194G    K-POW!  The single shot blows the T-1000 into a million diamonds
        spraying up into the air.  They shimmer across the ground for twenty
        feet in all directions.
        Terminator lowers the gun, satisfied.
        He looks like he needs a vacation.

195     JOHN AND SARAH have seen it from the pickup.  She is in bad shape.
        Conscious but very weak.  He tries the door.  It's jammed.  He kicks
        it open.

                                JOHN
                Okay, Mom, we gotta get out now, come on.
                That's it.

        He helps her slide down from the seat of the truck.  Her knees give
        way.  John has to take a lot of her weight.  He reaches in and picks
        up the riot gun off the seat.  They hobble toward --

195A    TERMINATOR.  On his knees, he looks into the dissipating cloud of
        vapor.  The heat of the furnaces has evaporated all the liquid
        nitrogen.

196     INSERT, TIGHT ON THE FLOOR - the T-1000 shards are melting,
        liquefying.  Hundreds of drops of mercury, spattered across the floor.
        Orange light of the enormous black-furnaces dances on liquid metal.

197     TERMINATOR struggles to rise.  One arm is shattered, the hand smashed
        and useless.  And some leg-servos are damaged.  He can barely stand.
        John and Sarah arrive.

                                TERMINATOR
                We don't have much time.

                                JOHN
                What?

        Terminator points.  John and Sarah watch as --

198     INSERT, T-1000 DROPLETS are creeping together.  Fusing into larger
        blobs.  These pools shiver and run together, soon forming a central
        mass.

199     ON JOHN AND SARAH, realizing it's not over.

                                JOHN
                Come on!  Let's go!

        Terminator gets one of Sarah's arms over his shoulder and they go.
        BEHIND THEM, something is moving.
200     A HEAD is forming up out of a pool mercury.  it rises, as shoulders
        form.  hunching up from the liquid mass.  Half-formed, it turns to 
        look straight at them.

        John looks back in new terror as --

        The T-1000 rises to man-height.  It is still in mercury form, but its
        features are forming rapidly.  It takes its first step after them.
        Sarah stumbles and they pull her up.
201     Terminator himself has a pronounces limp, dragging one leg with a
        shattered ankle joint.  John's the one pulling, straining, driving
        them forward.  They round a corner into --

202     INT. AISLE BETWEEN FURNACES

        It is a maze of monstrous machinery.  The heat is tremendous.
        The air shivers with a pounding roar.
        Sarah cries out in pain and stumbles again.

                                JOHN
                Come on, Mom, you can do it!  Come on!!

        They drag her up, and stagger on.  Her leg is bathed in blood and she
        is deathly pale.  He looks back.

203     INT, MAIN GALLERY

        The T-1000 steps INTO FRAME.  Fully formed.  The hell-fire light
        glints on its impassive cop face.  It walks forward.  At first it
        seems unaffected by its crystallization but --

203A    ANGLE ON ITS HAND as it touches a railing in passing.  The railing is
        covered with O.S.H.A. yellow-and-black safety tape.
        The hand turns yellow and black, the color fading to normal by about
        the elbow.  It rips the hand from the railing with difficulty.  There
        is a sound like adhesive tape ripping off a surface.

203B    The T-1000 looks at its yellow-and-black striped hand.  It wills the
        hand back to normal.  We see ripples of "static" or system noise
        moving subtly over the surface of its body.  It's starting to
        "glitch".

203C    TRACKING WITH THE T-1000'S FEET.  With each step, the pattern on the
        tile floor "invades" its lower legs.  Fades as the foot is lifted.
        Returns as it is set down.  The foot is trying to meld with the floor.
        The chameleonic function is out of control.
        The T-1000 is losing it.  It moves forward, searching.  It rounds the
        corner, entering the aisle between the furnaces.

204     INT. AISLE

        Terminator sees the SILHOUETTE closing on them through the smoky
        gleam.  The T-1000 breaks into loping run when it sees them,
        Terminator turns to Sarah over John.

                                TERMINATOR
                Keep going.

        John shakes his head no.  The T-1000 is almost on them.

                                TERMINATOR
                RUN!

        John runs, dragging, half-carrying Sarah as best he can.
        She can barely stay conscious.  Half-running, delirious, she stumbles
        and drops to her knees.  John pulls but she can't rise.

                                JOHN
                        (crying, shouting)
                Come on, you gotta try... please, Mom.  Get up!

        John looks back to see --

204A    TERMINATOR trying to load the M-79.  With his shattered hand, he can
        barely maneuver is last grenade into the breech.
        T-1000 smacks the weapon out of his hands.  It clatters to the floor.

        The grenade spins across the floor, rolling under some machinery.
        Terminator lunges, slamming the T-1000 against a wall with all his
        weight.  The battle is joined.

204B    JOHN AND SARAH have reached the back of the aisle.  It is a cul-de-
        sac, blocked on the end by the base of an IMMENSE SMELTER CRUCIBLE.
        They turn to watch the titans battle in silhouette, backlit by the
        molten sparks falling from the furnaces above.  The battle which will
        decide their fate.

204C    Terminator grabs the T-1000 and hurls it with awesome force against
        the opposite wall of the narrow alley.  In less time than it would
        take to turn, the
204D    T-1000 morphs trough itself, front to back... face emerging from the
        back of its head.
204E    It comes off the wall straight at Terminator, who smashes his good
        fist into its face.  The pile-driver blow buries Terminator's fist
        almost to the elbow.

204F    But the T-1000's head morphs in a split-second into a hand which grips
        Terminator's wrist, and the head "emerges" somewhere else, the
        geometry shifting faster than we can follow.
204G    The T-1000 slams Terminator into a large machine, jamming his arm into
        the moving works.  A massive sliding bar SCISSORS HIS ARM, smashing it
        into junk at the elbow, pinning him in the machine.

        Terminator strains against the machine pinning him.  We hear his
        servos whining with overload.  The T-1000 turns and lopes toward Sarah
        and John.

        Sarah screams and hurls John into a gap between the machines.  He
        falls into a maze of pipes and girders.

205     INT. MAZE OF MACHINES

        JOHN turns to see her in the entrance of the narrow gap.  She could
        follow him but she doesn't.  SUDDENLY a dark mass moves toward him.
        John gasps as a huge steel counterweight, driven by a chain 6 inches
        thick, slides toward him.  He rolls out of the way.  When he looks
        back, he cannot see the opening.

                                JOHN
                Mom!  MOMMM!!

206     INT. AISLE BETWEEN FURNACES

        TERMINATOR strains to reach a 6-foot steel bar lying near him.  Steel
        workers use them to move the red-hot ingots around.  He gets hold of
        the end and uses it as a lever.  With titanic effort he spreads the
        massive components which are holding him, and withdraws him arm, which
        is severed at the elbow.  Dangling junk hands from the crushed joint.

207     SARAH has lost sight of John.  It is much of a goodbye as they will
        have.
        She turns as the T-1000 closes on her.  She is half-slumped against
        the sooty machines, looking barely conscious.  She struggles to load
        a shell into the empty weapon.  At the last instant she whips up the
        RIOT GUN and FIRES.

A207    T-1000's face is blown open, but quickly reforms as it closes on her.
        She fumbles to get another shell into the magazine but --
A208    THUNK!  A steel needle slams through her shoulder, pinning her.
        The polymorphic killer cocks back its other hand.  The index finger
        extends as a gleaming needle, toward her eye --

                                T-1000
                Call to John.  Now.

207C    WHAM!!  SOMETHING whistles down on the T-1000 with such force that is
        cleaves it head and body in two down to the naval.  The 6-foot steel
        bar is imbedded in its body.  Terminator hurls the killer off Sarah.

207D    The T-1000 pulls the steel shaft out of itself and attacks him with
        fury.
        Swinging again and again.  Hammering Terminator back.  Terminator
        falls back against the wall.

        Behind the T-1000 is an enormous I-beam, hanging from two chains.  It
        is used to lift ingots into the smelters, and it runs on a linear
        track.
207E    The T-1000 grabs the I-beam and rolls it down the track.  Straight at
        Terminator.  The two-ton girder smashes into his chest, crushing the
        armor.
        The T-1000 pulls the I-beam back, and then heaves it forward again.
        Terminator turns and takes the second blow on the shoulder.  We hear
        metal crush and break inside him.  He sags, turning to grip the
        wall...
        The third blow slams into his back, smashing his spine and pelvis.  We
        hear servos ratcheting and failing.  He drops to his knees, crucified
        on a wall of machinery.
        The fourth blow is centered between his shoulder blades.  Sound of
        crushing metal.  His skull is partially caved in.
        He slides to the floor.

207F    ON THE T-1000, emotionless as it walks forward.

207G    TERMINATOR is a pathetic shape on the floor.  He is trying to crawl,
        feebly.
        Dragging his malfunctioning legs behind the crushed spine.  His arm
        stump screeches on the tile floor as he inches himself forward.  His
        exposed machine eye burns red with determination.

        We see his prize.  He has the M-79, with the breech still open, 
        cradled in the crook of his ruined arm.  He good hand, the exposed
        steel one, is reaching for the last grenade, which is visible under
        the skirt of the massive smelter base.  His metal fingers reach out
        for it as --

207H    The T-1000 raises the heavy steel bar over his head and stabs it down
        with unbelievable force.  It punches into Terminator's back, through a
        gap in the shattered armor.  The T-1000 levers it back and forth,
        widening the hole.  Then is raises the pointed bar again and slams it
        down.
        It punches right through.  Emerging from Terminator's chest.
        And into the floor.  He is pinioned.  The cyborg sags face down and
        stop moving.  The light goes out of his eye.

                                                CUT TO:

208     INT. MAZE OF MACHINERY

        John scuttles like a rat through the gut of the smelter.  Above him,
        vast machines churn untended.  He hears a voice... SARAH'S
        Calling low and urgent to him.

                                SARAH
                John?  John?  Can you hear me?  Where are you?

208A    He crawls out of the shadows.
        Onto a landing next to one of the SMELTER CRUCIBLES.  Molten steel
        glows bright orange in the crucible of the furnace.  Heat shimmers
        the air, giving everything a hallucinatory quality.

        John sees Sarah nearby, limping toward him.  She can barely move, her
        leg bathed in blood.  He runs toward her.

                                SARAH
                        (gasping)
                Help me, honey...

        TIGHT ON SARAH, her stoic face, as she hobbles forward, reaching out
        to him.  Something rises behind her, OUT OF FOCUS.

209     ANOTHER, IDENTICAL, SARAH... but this one has a shotgun.
        Aimed right at us.

209A    JOHN freezes.  Which is which?  He looks down.  The first Sarah's
        feet are melded with the floor, sucking and fusing with the tiles as
        she walks.  They have the color and pattern of the tiles up to the
        knee.

                                SARAH
                John, get out of the way!!

                                JOHN
                        (screaming)
                SHOOT!!!!

209B    John dives aside.  The Sarah-form spins, changing into you-know-who.
        Sarah starts unloading the shotgun into it.  BOOM!  It staggers back.
        K-CHAK.  She chambers another round.  BOOM!  It staggers again.
        K-CHAK.  BOOM!  And again.  And again.

209C    The T-1000 is blown back a step and Sarah advances with each shot.
        The craters in the T-1000's body "heal" slowly.  Its power is waning.
        She FIRES again.  And again.  Her eyes blazing with feral intensity.
        She walks it back, right to the edge of the pit of MOLTEN STEEL.

        K-CHAK... CLICK.  She's empty.  The T-1000 is right at the edge.  In a
        second it will recover its composure, as its crater hits close slowly.
        She has failed.  Now it will kill them both,
        Except...

210     CLOSEUP TERMINATOR, as the chain drive brings it into view.
        Half human flesh, half chrome steel.
        His red eye gazes right at us as he --
        FIRES.

210A    The T-1000 takes the round in the belly.  The grenade EXPLODES inside
        its body.  A huge hole is blown clean through it, and it is ripped
        open and peeled back, half inside-out.  It topples into the molten
        steel and --

211     The T-1000's head and upper body reappear above the molten steel.
        It is screaming.  A terrifying, inhuman siren of a scream.
        It is changing, morphing, transforming into anything and everything
        it's ever been so rapidly the eye can barely follow it --
        We catch a glimpse of Janelle Voight checkered with the linoleum tile
        colors, Lewis the Guard with knives exploding from his face, other
        faces, switching at a stroboscopic rate now... a face every two frames
        until they merge into one face --

        The T-1000 screams and slips beneath the surface of the molten steel.
        We see liquid silver running in dissipating whorls over the
        superheated surface... until it vanishes, swirling into nothing.

212     JOHN runs to Sarah.  She stands staring into the pit.  The empty
        shotgun slips from her fingers.  Clatters to the floor.  He sees that
        she's okay and he runs to the fallen Terminator.

212A    The crippled cyborg is trying to rise.  Its servos whine and stutter.
        It pathetically lifts itself to a kneeling position, collapses...
        tries again.
        John lifts for all he's worth.  Sarah joins them, helping.
        The help the crippled machine get on its feet.  It can barely stand.

                                TERMINATOR
                I need a vacation.

        They walk to the edge of the pit.  Terminator looks down and sees
        that it is over.

                                JOHN
                        (to Terminator)
                Is it dead?

                                TERMINATOR
                Terminated.

        John unzips Sarah's backpack and takes out the hand of the first
        terminator.

                                JOHN
                Will it melt in there?

                                TERMINATOR
                Yes.  Throw it in.
        
        He does.  It sinks into the lava.  Vanishes.

                                TERMINATOR
                And the chip.

        John takes it out of his pocket.  Looks at it.  Tosses it into the
        smelter.

                                SARAH
                It's finally over.

                                TERMINATOR
                No.  There is another chip.

        He touches a metal finger to the side of his head.

                                TERMINATOR
                And it must be destroyed also.

        John suddenly understands what he means.
        Terminator looks at Sarah.  They both know what must be done.
        John shakes his head.

                                JOHN
                No!

                                TERMINATOR
                I'm sorry, John.

                                JOHN
                No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!

                                TERMINATOR
                I have to go away, John.

                                JOHN
                Don't do it.  Please... don't go --

        Tears are streaming down his face.

        TIGHT CLOSEUP TERMINATOR, turning toward John.
        The human side of his face is in shadow, so we see mostly the chrome
        skull and the red eye.

                                TERMINATOR
                It must end here... or I am the future.

                                JOHN
                I order you not to!

        Terminator puts his hand on John's shoulder.  He moves slightly and
        the human side of his face comes into the light.
        He reaches toward John's face.  His metal finger touches the tear
        trickling down his cheek.

                                TERMINATOR
                I know now why you cry.  But it is something I
                can never do.
                        (to both of them)
                Goodbye.

        Sarah looks at Terminator.  Reaches out her hand to shake it.
        They lock eyes.  Warriors.  Comrades.

                                SARAH
                Are you afraid?

                                TERMINATOR
                Yes.

        He turns and steps off the edge.
213     They watch him sink into the lava.
        He disappears... the metal hand sinking last... at the last second it
        forms into a fist with the thumb extended... a final thumbs up.
        Then it is gone.

214     HOLD ON JOHN AND SARAH, watching through the heat ripples as we --

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

215     THE SUN, PURE IN A CLOUDLESS SKY
        Tilting down reveal that we are in a park, very green.  People are
        casually dressed, having fun.  Cycling, reading... children are
        playing in a playground.

        Beyond the line of tree we see the skyline of Washington, D.C., with
        the Capital Building and the Washington Monument.  The skyline is
        subtly changed, with a lot of new buildings, advanced high-rises.
        A CARD APPEARS

                                July 11, 2029

        WE BOOM DOWN AND TRACK LATERALLY through a playground in the
        foreground.  Children swinging on swings.  Sliding down slides.
        Timeless things that 4 decades of technical advancement will not
        change.  As we track we hear:

                                SARAH (V.O.)
                August 29th 1997 came and went.  Nothing much
                happened.  Michael Jackson turned forty.  There
                was no Judgment Day.  People went to work as
                they always do, laughed, complained, watched
                TV, made love.

        We pass a jungle gym, neither melted nor burned, but full of kids
        swinging and yelling raucously.  Past it we drop down to see a boy
        pumping the pedals of a tricycle.

                                SARAH (V.O.)
                I wanted to run down the street yelling... to
                grab them all and say "Every day form this day
                is a gift.  Use it well!"  Instead I got drunk.

        STILL TRACKING we come to rest on an elderly woman seated on a bench.
        It is SARAH, now 64 years old.  The world has aged her, but she seems
        at peace in this moment.  She speaks into a microcassette recorder.

                                SARAH (V.O.)
                That was thirty years ago.  But the dark future
                which never came still exists for me, and it
                always will, like the traces of a dream lingering
                in the morning light.  And the war against the
                machines goes on.  Or, to be more precise, the
                war against those who build the wrong machines.

        There is a man in is forties playing with two small children
        nearby.  He turns.  It is John Connor.  Through he has the same stern
        features in adulthood, there is no eye-patch, no scarring.  He is far
        from the haggard man on grim destiny we saw in the world that might
        have been.  But there is still penetrating intelligence, even wisdom,
        in his eyes.

                                SARAH (V.O.)
                John fights the war differently than it was
                foretold.  Here, on the battlefield of the
                Senate, the weapons are common sense... and
                hope.

        A FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL runs to her to have her shoelace tied.

                                GIRL
                Tie me, grandma.

        Grandma Sarah smiles.  It is the only time we have seen her smile so
        far.  She bends as the little girls puts her foot up on the bench.
        She ties as we hear:

                                SARAH (V.O.)
                The luxury of hope was given to me by the
                Terminator.  Because if a machine can learn
                the value of human life... maybe we can too.

        Sarah ruffles the kids's hair as she runs off to play with her dad.

          INT.   DEATH ROW/CELL - DAWN
          
          START TIGHT ON MARCUS WRIGHT. He's an intense, powerful man,
          20's-30's, his head shaven. Marcus stares INTO CAMERA with a
          resigned expression. We hear the voice of a PRIEST:
          
                               PRIEST
                     Yea, though I walk through the valley
                     of the shadow of death, I will fear
                     no evil: for thou art beside me; thy
                     rod and thy staff they comfort me...
          
          CAMERA PULLS BACK, straight up. MARCUS lies in his cot,
          staring at the ceiling. He's smoking a CIGARETTE. This
          OVERHEAD ANGLE reveals a PRIEST with a BIBLE, in a folding
          chair beside him. A CHESS SET, stacks of BOOKS, WRITING
          MATERIALS in the cell. TWO GUARDS wait, shackles in hand.
          
          MARCUS has no interest in scripture. He blows a cloud of
          SMOKE which drifts in the direction of the PRIEST, who blinks
          and shuts his bible.
          
          One of the GUARDS unlocks the cell door for--
          
          DR. SERENA KOGAN. She's in her 30's-50's, brilliant,
          attractive, but thin and pale, a scarf tied around her head.
          She carries a CLIPBOARD. The PRIEST backs off to give her
          some privacy with Marcus.
          
                               SERENA
                     Marcus-- I'm Doctor Serena Kogan, I'm
                     with Project Angel. You consented to
                     donate your body to science...

          CONTINUED:
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Yeah, I'm pretty much done with it.
          
                                 SERENA
                       You've been chosen for our research.
          
                                   MARCUS
                       Chosen?    Lucky me.
          
                                 SERENA
                       We just need a couple of signatures...
          
          Marcus sits up, she passes him the clipboard and pen-- he
          notes that her hands are SHAKING.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       You don't need to be scared.
          
                                   SERENA
                       I'm not.    It's nerve degeneration.
          
          MARCUS looks up from the form, takes in the scarf covering
          her sparse hair.
          
                                   MARCUS
                       Cancer?
          
                                  SERENA
                           (NODS)
                       You're not the only one with a
                       death sentence.
          
          MARCUS meets her eyes.      She studies him a beat.
          
                                 SERENA (cont'd)
                       What you're doing is important,
                       Marcus. Our work is still highly
                       experimental... but you may be
                       helping people in ways you can't
                       begin to imagine.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       I'm a regular hero.
          
          With that sarcastic comment, he SIGNS HIS NAME-- we see the
          words "PROJECT ANGEL" at the top of DENSE TYPE on the form.
          
          SERENA takes the clipboard, starts to rise.         She touches his
          hand for a moment.
                                                                   (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED: (2)
          
                                  SERENA
                     Thank you.     And... I'm sorry.
          
                               MARCUS
                     No one lives forever.
          
          THE GUARD sees SERENA out.
          
          
          INT.   DEATH ROW/CORRIDOR - NIGHT
          
          LOW ANGLE - MARCUS' CHAINED ANKLES clank as the GUARDS lead
          him down the corridor, past PRISONERS in their cells; some
          avert their eyes, others give a nod or raise a fist.
          
                               PRIEST (V.O.)
                     Marcus, this is your last
                     opportunity to make a confession...
          
          MARCUS stares straight ahead, taking deep, steady breaths,
          struggling not to succumb to fear.
          
                               PRIEST (V.O.) (cont'd)
                     Is there nothing you would say to
                     Officer Martinez' family?

          FOREARM... A NEEDLE punctures his skin.
          
                               MARCUS (V.O.)
                     What can I say. I was seventeen, I
                     was angry, I was stupid.
          
          FINGERS turn the VALVE to release the LETHAL CHEMICALS.
          
          CLOSE ON MARCUS' EYES, looking up toward--
          
          THE DEADLY I.V., running into his arm.
          
          From this, he looks toward--
          
          HIS REFLECTION in a one-way mirror, the dim shapes of
          WITNESSES beyond.

                                 MARCUS (V.O.) (cont'd)
                       Yeah... I'm sorry about it. I'm
                       sorry about everything. The whole
                       goddamn world...
          
          As the lethal injection takes hold, his POV moves to BRIGHT
          LIGHTS overhead, losing FOCUS and BLEACHING TO WHITE...
          
          From the WHITE SCREEN, a FACE emerges, backlit, blurred--
          it's SERENA. She's in focus for just a moment, leaning INTO
          CAMERA-- then moves OUT OF FRAME.
          
                                                           CUT TO BLACK.
          
          
          SUPER ON BLACK:
          
          SOUTH-CENTRAL SECTOR, NORTH AMERICA, 2018
          
          
          EXT.   CORNFIELD - DUSK
          
          CORNSTALKS as far as the eye can see, rustling in a summer
          breeze. FIGURES are moving within the FIELD. We only make
          them out in SILHOUETTE, but all carry HEAVY RIFLES.
          
          
          INT.   A-10 COCKPIT - DUSK
          
          A COMPUTER TARGETING SCREEN - the FIGURES are HIGHLIGHTED in
          this tactical display, as is an OCTAGONAL HATCH into the
          ground beneath the corn.
          
          
          EXT.   CORNFIELD - DUSK
          
          THE FIGURES in the corn look up-- we hear an AIRCRAFT
          APPROACH with a JET WHINE--
          
          FWOOM! A MASSIVE CONCUSSION as a BUNKER-BUSTING MISSILE
          BORES into the earth at high-velocity, burrowing deep--
          
          --then a HUGE BLAST - FLAME and DIRT are thrown high in the
          air, many of the FIGURES blown sky-high.
          
          A FLAMING BODY hits the ground IN FG, FACE TO CAMERA... we
          now see it was a STEEL TERMINATOR-- its METAL SKULL BLOWN
          OPEN and SCORCHED, its RED EYES SHATTERED.
          
                                                                (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          A-10 WARTHOGS-- stubby attack planes-- SCREAM from the sky,
          RAKING THE REMAINING FIGURES with CANNON FIRE, BLASTING THEM
          to bits. These aircraft no longer bear traditional U.S.
          insignia-- they're painted in WILD COLORS, graffiti lettering
          says things like: "BOT BLASTER," "KILL FOR CONNOR," "RAGE
          AGAINST THE MACHINES," etc... Resistance fighters.
          
          Motley military and civilian CHOPPERS LAND in the CORNFIELD,
          disgorging RESISTANCE SOLDIERS. These are human troops in
          high-tech HELMETS, carrying slightly futuristic conventional
          ASSAULT WEAPONS.
          
          THE WARTHOGS veer off, laying NAPALM in the distance behind
          the SOLDIERS. The troops run toward--
          
          --AN OPENING which has been blown into the ground, the
          remains of the octagonal hatch where the bunker-buster hit.
          
          A surviving TERMINATOR rises from the SINGED CORN, FIRES its
          PLASMA RIFLE--
          
          --DROPPING A SOLDIER. His comrades FIRE EXPLOSIVE BULLETS--
          and BLOW THE ROBOT APART. The LEADER of this assault group
          waves his soldiers to enter the dark hatchway.
          
          
          INT.   UNDERGROUND FACILITY/CORRIDOR - NIGHT
          
          COLLAPSED CEILINGS, FLAMES, a high-tech installation in
          ruins; RED LIGHTING, distinctive of Skynet environments.
          
          SOLDIERS flick on HELMET LAMPS and make their way carefully
          inside-- pretty deserted. They kick aside rubble to enter--
          
          
          INT.   UNDERGROUND FACILITY/ROBOTIC ROOM - NIGHT
          
          HELMET BEAMS play over BANKS OF ELECTRONICS and--
          
          --a dozen fixed, INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS-- not remotely HUMANOID--
          engaged in mysterious tasks, mechanical arms at work.
          
          THE SOLDIERS rake the room with GUNFIRE-- MACHINERY
          collapses, SPARKS from EXPLODING CIRCUITRY.
          
          
          INT.   UNDERGROUND FACILITY/CORRIDOR - NIGHT
          
          Deeper into the complex, A HEAVY DOOR BLOWS off its hinges.

                       Clear!
          
          SOLDIERS move from cover and through the blown door.
          
          
          INT.   UNDERGROUND FACILITY/STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT
          
          TUBES and FIBER-OPTIC CABLES run into DOZENS OF GLASS
          CYLINDERS filled with translucent PINK LIQUID. The SOLDIERS
          make their way in, alert-- but nothing's moving in here.
          
          THE TEAM LEADER peers into a cylinder, aims his HEADLAMP at--
          
          --A small MASS OF TISSUE floating inside, connected to a
          dense network of FIBER-OPTIC CABLES... it's a HUMAN BRAIN.
          
                                 TEAM LEADER
                       Oh God.
          
          THE TEAM LEADER recoils-- but before he can say more, the
          ROOM SHAKES with a DEAFENING ROAR.
          
          
          EXT.   CORNFIELD - NIGHT
          
          A huge ESCAPE SHIP rises straight up from an open HATCHWAY.
          Nearby TROOPS crouch and FIRE after it. THE SHIP PIVOTS in
          mid-air and ROARS OFF, SOLDIERS dodging the ENGINE BLAST.
          
          
          INT.   UNDERGROUND FACILITY/STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT
          
          THE TEAM LEADER speaks into his headset. The OTHER SOLDIERS
          inspect the many CYLINDERS, react in horror and shock.
          
                                 TEAM LEADER
                       You will not believe the shit we
                       found down here--
          
          As he speaks, CAMERA FINDS a GREEN LED on the ceiling-- which
          suddenly FLASHES RED and BLINKS RAPIDLY--
          
          
          EXT.   CORNFIELD - NIGHT
          
          WIDE - AN IMMENSE SUBTERRANEAN BLAST causes a few hundred
          yards square to SWELL and then COLLAPSE.

          A PANICKED PILOT on the radio:

                       --repeat, that was not us! A ship

          EXT.   CORNFIELD - NIGHT
          
          SOLDIERS above ground help the WOUNDED to EVAC CHOPPERS.
          
          IN FG, FIND the STEEL SKULL of the dead TERMINATOR.
          
                                                             DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          EXT.   CORNFIELD - DAY
          
          SAME ANGLE-- the TERMINATOR now half-sunk in mud. A FIELD
          MOUSE has nested in its skull cavity, seeking shelter from
          RAINDROPS.
          
          Months have passed, the season changed-- CORN long dead, a
          black stubble. RAIN falls.
          
          A PATCH OF MUD stirs-- something below is moving.       The MUD
          roils, seeming to assume a HUMAN SHAPE...
          
          EYES OPEN, looking around in shock, the naked FIGURE is so
          drenched in mud we can't recognize it at first. The figure
          rises, looks up at the sky, and FALLING RAIN washes away mud
          from his face... it's MARCUS WRIGHT. He opens his mouth,
          makes a few GUTTURAL NOISES... then SCREAMS.
          
          CAMERA PULLS UP from MARCUS' AGONIZED FACE...
          
                                                                 CUT TO:

          EXT.   PLATEAU - EVENING
          
          BARE FEET trudge through the dirt. MARCUS moves along a
          slight rise, wrapped in torn and filthy RAGS, mud caked on
          his body. Eerie silence. Reaching the edge of a rise, he
          sees in the distance--
          
          A DECIMATED CITY, buildings collapsed into rubble.
          
          
          EXT.   DEAD CITY - NIGHT
          
          MOONLIGHT. THE SKELETON of a large DOG lies on the ground,
          partially covered by a dusting of SNOW. It still bears a
          rotting COLLAR attached to a CHAIN.
          
          MOVE to a CHAIN-LINK FENCE, partially collapsed, a singed,
          faded sign: "BEWARE OF DOG."
          
          WIDER, we're in the low-rent district of this CITY IN RUINS--
          rubble, random walls still stand. Hulks of cars, rusted,
          windowless. It's been over a decade since the bombs fell.
          
          MARCUS is the only thing alive here. He moves down this
          block, picks up a handful of SNOW, brings it to his lips.
          
          A COLLAPSED NEWSSTAND. MARCUS walks past the racks, picks up
          a MAGAZINE which crumbles in his hands.
          
          A HUMAN SKELETON, clothes in tatters, is half-buried behind
          the collapsed counter. There's a bulge in its shirt pocket.
          
          MARCUS gingerly reaches into the pocket and fishes out a
          cellophane-wrapped PACK OF CIGARETTES and a butane LIGHTER.
          
          MARCUS sits on a piece of rubble by the skeleton. He tears
          open the packet and puts a dried-out, stale cigarette to his
          lips, tries the lighter a few times, finally gets a flame.
          He lights the cig, inhales deeply-- he waits for a rush,
          feels nothing. He takes a few more drags, increasingly
          disappointed, then flicks the cigarette away.
          
          He rises, looks toward a caved-in STOREFRONT, makes out a
          clothing store's TATTERED SIGN on the ground, amidst broken
          glass: "SALE! GOING OUT OF BUSINESS! EVERYTHING MUST GO!"
          
                                                                            9.
          
          
          INT.   RUINED CLOTHING STORE - NIGHT
          
          FALLEN RACKS, CLOTHES and SHOES covered in years of dust and
          rubble. MARCUS, grateful to be rid of the rags, has pulled
          on jeans and sneakers, using the CIGARETTE LIGHTER for
          illumination. He kicks away some FALLEN CEILING TILES from a
          RACK OF ARMY JACKETS. He holds one up-- looks good.
          
          
          INT.   RUINED BAR - NIGHT
          
          Partially collapsed, a downscale watering hole. Broken
          stools, booths, a dead pinball machine. MARCUS, dressed now,
          again using the LIGHTER to find his way, sorts through the
          broken glass and rubble behind the bar, comes up with--
          
          A DUSTY BOTTLE OF WHISKY.
          
                               MARCUS
                     Hallelujah.
          
          He unscrews the cap, raises the bottle to a SKELETON on the
          floor nearby. Marcus takes a long pull-- and CHOKES,
          instantly dizzy. He sinks to the floor, passing out.
          
                                                      CUT TO BLACK.

          --GRIDS OF LASER LIGHT scan rapidly INTO CAMERA.
          
          --DIGITAL DISPLAYS blink through murky LIQUID. SERENA moves
          INTO FRAME, a look of concentration on her face as she peers
          through the LIQUID, INTO CAMERA. She starts to smile.
          
                                                       DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          EXT.   DEAD CITY - DAY
          
          BLUE SKY. TILT DOWN to find MARCUS, who plods on through the
          dead city's outskirts. He pauses near a collapsed BUS KIOSK.
          A SMILING WOMAN stares out at him from a faded ADVERTISEMENT.
          
          MARCUS studies the woman. She's nothing like Serena, but her
          expression recalls the beckoning vision.
                                                              (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          He runs his hand over the image of her face, pulls away a
          chunk of cracked, graffitied GLASS over the poster. Then he
          carefully tears the poster to remove the woman's face, folds
          the paper, slips it in a pocket and continues on.
          
          
          EXT.   HIGHWAY - NIGHT
          
          Deserted, CAR HULKS about, crumbling SKELETONS at the wheels.
          MARCUS moves down the center of the freeway on this MOONLIT
          NIGHT, paying little attention to anything around him. We're
          in mostly flat, treeless plains.
          
          From the opposite direction, FIGURES approach, moving through
          the darkness. Marcus hurries excitedly toward them, the
          first living creatures he's seen. He waves.
          
                                  MARCUS
                       Hey!   Yo, over here!
          
          The FIGURES pause, turning toward him in unison.
          
                                 MARCUS (cont'd)
                       Damn it's good to see you guys, I felt
                       like I was the last man on...
          
          He freezes in his tracks. These aren't humans. They're T-
          400s-- PLASTIC-SKINNED TERMINATORS-- armed with PLASMA
          RIFLES. They wear a motley collection of found CLOTHING, but
          their male humanoid faces are identical, unnatural and
          motionless, like masks. Their EYES FLICKER RED as they scan
          him.
          
                                   MARCUS (cont'd)
                       Oh God...
          
          Marcus backs away, runs.      The T-400s stare after him-- but
          don't fire.
          
          ANGLE THROUGH BINOCULAR MASK - MARCUS running for all he's
          worth, heading toward the viewer. We hear a muttering VOICE:
          
                                 BOY
                       Hey mister, where you goin' in such
                       a hurry?
          
          ANGLE ON A BOY, scrawny and filthy, in his early to mid
          teens. He crouches on the supports of a FREEWAY SIGN.
          
                                                                (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                            11.
          CONTINUED:
          
          He wears layers of TATTERED, OVER-SIZED CLOTHING.     He
          scrambles quickly down from the sign.
          
          AT AN OFF-RAMP, Marcus' pace slows as he moves to get off the
          freeway, when--
          
          THE BOY emerges from behind some RUBBLE, holding a HANDGUN in
          one hand, a lit OIL LANTERN in the other.
          
                                 BOY (cont'd)
                       Whoah, whoah-- hang on there.   Got
                       any food?
          
          Marcus raises his hands, shakes his head.     The boy looks him
          over dubiously.
          
                                 BOY (cont'd)
                       You look like you been eating
                       pretty good.
          
          The boy moves closer, puts down the LANTERN, frisks Marcus
          with one hand while holding the gun on him with the other.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       You're human... you can see me, you
                       can touch me. This place is real.
          
          THE BOY makes a dubious face, yanks a handful of PAPER SCRAPS
          from Marcus' pocket.
          
                                 MARCUS (cont'd)
                       I thought I was in hell.
          
                                 BOY
                           (raises an eyebrow)
                       This sure ain't heaven.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Those things with masks, red eyes--
          
                                 BOY
                           (CASUALLY)
                       Terminators-- T-400s.   What is this stuff?
          
          THE BOY unfolds the paper scraps in the LANTERN LIGHT--
          
          ANGLE ON PAPER SCRAPS - the WOMAN'S FACE from the poster, a
          fragment of a MODEL'S PHOTO from a MAGAZINE AD, a painting of
          a FEMALE FACE from a PAPERBACK COVER.
                                                                (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED: (2)
          
          THE BOY looks puzzled, intrigued by the pictures. But with
          sudden speed, MARCUS GRABS THE BOY'S GUN HAND and wrenches it
          hard-- it FIRES into the air. MARCUS gets control of the
          gun, wraps one arm around the boy's throat.
          
                              MARCUS
                    If I'm not in hell, where am I?!
          
                              BOY
                        (CHOKING)
                    Texas!
          
          The NOISE of a SHOTGUN PUMPING close behind MARCUS--
          
          MARCUS spins to face his attacker, pressing the handgun into
          the boy's cheek. He's face to face with--
          
          A GIRL, a couple of years younger than the BOY, training the
          shotgun at Marcus' head-- she looks ready to shoot.
          
                              GIRL
                    Let him go!
          
                              MARCUS
                    First put down the shotgun.
          
          THE GIRL shakes her head angrily.   She wears an aged, beloved
          BASEBALL CAP with a STAR on it.
          
                              BOY
                    Do what he says.
          
                              GIRL
                    He'll kill us both!
          
                              MARCUS
                    I don't wanna kill anyone.
          
                              BOY
                    Do it, Star. Put it down.
          
          She shakes her head slightly, aiming carefully at Marcus'
          head, just a few feet away, a slight smile on her face.
          
                              GIRL
                    There was only one bullet in that gun.
          
          MARCUS hooks his foot around the oil lantern and deftly--
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED: (3)
          
          --BOOTS IT at the GIRL. BURNING OIL spills across her leg,
          she cries out and fumbles the shotgun. MARCUS tosses the BOY
          at her, the two of them SPRAWL on the ground, the shotgun
          falling to one side--
          
          MARCUS quickly snatches up the shotgun.
          
          Using SNOW, the BOY helps the GIRL extinguish the flames from
          her clothing.
          
          MARCUS stands over the kids with a gun in each hand.   He
          struggles to control anger, speaks quietly.
          
                              MARCUS
                    I don't like it when people point
                    guns at me.
          
                              GIRL
                    It wasn't loaded.
          
          MARCUS quickly checks the chambers of both the shotgun and
          handgun-- indeed, both are empty.
          
                              MARCUS
                    You took on a guy like me with one
                    bullet and an empty shotgun?
                        (studies them admiringly)
                    Pretty stupid.
          
          He shoves the handgun in his belt, puts the shotgun down and
          kneels to pick up fallen scraps of paper-- a few have caught
          FIRE and are incinerated.
          
          THE BOY and GIRL get to their feet, stare at Marcus.
          
                              GIRL
                    Can I have my gun back?
          
          MARCUS shrugs, gestures for her to pick it up.   He still
          looks at the PICTURES in his hands.
          
                              GIRL (cont'd)
                    Where'd you get those?
          
                              MARCUS
                    In the city.

                              BOY
                        (steps away from him)
                    The city? Oh man. That place is
                    red hot.
          
                              MARCUS
                        (a small smile)
                    Seemed kinda dead to me.
          
                              BOY
                    No-- radiation.
          
          A SPOTLIGHT appears in the distance-- a ROVING HUNTER-KILLER
          moving in their direction.
          
          Quickly, automatically, the kids dive for cover behind a WALL
          OF DEBRIS. MARCUS looks toward the LIGHT, unaware of danger.
          
          THE BOY bolts from behind cover, grabs MARCUS by the arm--
          
                              BOY (cont'd)
                    Get down, they've seen the light!
          
          He drags Marcus back behind the debris wall, just in time--
          
          As the H-K nears, the LIGHT FINDS the BURNING OIL. It FIRES
          BLUE PULSES, which CHEW up the asphalt nearby-- then it moves
          on, failing to pick out the humans. Marcus is dumbfounded.
          
                              MARCUS
                    That wasn't a helicopter...
          
                              BOY
                    It's an H-K-- hunter-killer.   Where
                    the hell have you been?
          
                              GIRL
                    Rads musta fried his brains.   Let's
                    go, Kyle.
          
          The H-K has vanished in the distance. The girl rises.   The
          boy-- KYLE-- shakes his head, stays at Marcus' side.
          
                              KYLE
                    What's your name?
          
                              MARCUS

                     She doesn't remember her name--
                         (re: her cap)
                     --so I call her Star.
          
          STAR gives Marcus a small, reluctant wave.
          
                               KYLE (cont'd)
                     Gonna be light soon, Marcus, better
                     find cover. We spotted some
                     buildings half a mile that way.
          
          KYLE points but gets no response. He shrugs, sets off with
          Star in that direction. Kyle calls over his shoulder:
          
                               KYLE (cont'd)
                     You can come if you want.
          
                               STAR
                         (hissing at him)
                     Why? We don't need him.

                         (a shrug, sotto)
                     I like him. He's funny.
          
          MARCUS looks around at the desolate world-- and the two teens
          receding ahead of him. After a beat, he follows.

          They drop down again.
          
          ONE AEROSTAT patrols the area. It's a surveillance drone the
          size of a softball, shiny steel, an inset camera lens with a
          RED GLOW. It flies in a geometric pattern, hovering every
          few seconds before continuing on. It vanishes around the
          corner of the fast-food joint, moving in the direction of the
          motel. STAR has been timing its moves.
          
                                 STAR
                       Now!
          
          KYLE and STAR dash for the fast-food entrance, MARCUS just
          behind. They round the doorway and--
          
          
          INT.   FAST FOOD JOINT - DAY
          
          --drop down inside behind an upended table in what was once a
          taco place, remnants of Mexican decor.
          
          THROUGH A DIRTY WINDOW, they see the AEROSTAT buzz past,
          flying its pattern. It moves on without spotting them, then
          takes off in a new direction.
          
          KYLE and STAR set to searching the place, something they've
          done many times. They go through trash cans, check behind
          the counters and in the kitchen. MARCUS gets up, still
          looking out the windows.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       That flying grapefruit, what was it?
          
                                 KYLE
                       Aerostat-- one of Skynet's eyes.
                       They patrol places like this,
                       looking for survivors.
          
                                 STAR
                       Yes!
          
          She's come up with some UNOPENED PACKETS OF CONDIMENTS from a
          bag of TRASH. KYLE trots over.
          
                                 KYLE
                       Any red ones?
          
          She nods excitedly, hands him a packet.    He tears it open,
          sucks down the contents eagerly.

          STAR discards one packet, sucks at another-- and immediately
          makes a pained face and tosses the packet aside.
          
                                    STAR
                       Yuk!
          
          MARCUS picks up the packet, looks at it.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Jalapeño sauce.
          
          STAR and KYLE pause in their eating, stare at him.
          
                                 STAR
                       You can read.
          
          MARCUS shrugs modestly.
          
                                 KYLE
                       So can I.
                           (off Star's look)
                       Well, sort of... a little.
          
          With obvious reluctance, STAR holds a packet of mustard
          toward Marcus.
          
                                    STAR
                       Want some?
          
          Marcus gallantly waves it away.
          
                                    MARCUS
                       No thanks.     Not hungry.
          
                                 KYLE
                       Never heard anyone say that before.

          STAR closes tattered curtains, plops on the bare bed, ready
          for sleep. The room's a mess, GRAFFITI here and there, trash
          scattered about; they're not the first squatters who've been
          here. THE GUNS and STAR'S WATCH lie on a dresser.
          
          KYLE sits before the TV-- he's scratching STICK FIGURES onto
          the screen with a rusted POCKETKNIFE. One is clearly meant
          to be him; the smaller one, wearing a baseball cap, is Star.
          
                                 KYLE
                       You ever watch television?
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Oh yeah. Was about all I ever had
                       to look forward to in the joint.

                       It was great.
          
          KYLE plops on the bed next to STAR, who's already out.
          MARCUS studies them.
          
                                 MARCUS

          MARCUS notices now that Kyle is asleep-- it's as if he's
          lulled him with a bedtime story. Marcus is oddly touched,
          pulls a cover over both the kids. KYLE starts, half-asleep--

          So saying, KYLE falls back asleep. MARCUS sighs, moves
          through the room, quietly opens a drawer or two and finds--

          closed, he's asleep.
          
          THE DOOR OPENS behind him, STAR peers out-- and looks
          relieved to see Marcus is still with them. As she takes a
          step toward him, he starts awake.

                       and fix stuff, or bring you food...

                    Guess people had it pretty good.
                        (FLIPS)
                    What else we got... movers,
                    mufflers, music--
          
                              STAR
                    Music?
          
                              MARCUS
                    You know, pianos, guitars...
          
                              STAR
                    I don't remember music.
          
                              MARCUS
                    Come on. You must...
                        (approximating the tune)
                    "I can't get no... satisfaction..."
                        (off her blank look)
                    "We are family... I got all my sisters
                    with me..." No, huh. How about...
                    "Twinkle twinkle little star..."
          
          Star's face lights up, she nods eagerly, sings along:
          
                              MARCUS & STAR
                    "How I wonder what you are... up
                    above the world so high, like a
                    diamond in the sky..."
          
          STAR is dizzy with emotion, wipes an eye, turning away.
          
                              MARCUS
                    You OK?
          
                              STAR
                        (shakes her head)
                    Somebody used to sing that to me.
          
          MARCUS puts the phonebook aside, puts a hand on her arm; and
          she leans into him for a hug, tears forming in her eyes.
          
                              STAR (cont'd)
                    Stay with us, Marcus. Please.

          AEROSTAT POV - a PIXELLATED ELECTRONIC IMAGE as it patrols
          the MOTEL AREA in its geometric pattern. It ZOOMS into the
          CARPORT, quickly scanning the abandoned VEHICLES, among which
          is an aged, open JEEP WRANGLER, its HOOD UP, parked beside a
          customized VAN. The cars are covered in DUST, the TIRES
          FLAT, they've been sitting here for a decade.
          
          OBJECTIVE ANGLE - the AEROSTAT zips off on its rounds. After
          a moment, the VAN DOOR slides open. MARCUS moves quickly
          back to the JEEP, KYLE and STAR behind him.
          
          STAR checks her WATCH while MARCUS goes back to work on the
          JEEP'S ENGINE. He's found some tools, already has removed
          and cleaned SPARK PLUGS, dismantled the DISTRIBUTOR. KYLE,
          meanwhile, returns to INFLATING one of the tires with a
          BICYCLE PUMP.
          
                               KYLE
                     If we get it to move, will you
                     teach me to make it go?
          
                               MARCUS
                     It's called driving.   Sure.
          
          STAR wipes DIRT off the side of the VAN, revealing air-
          brushed ARTWORK beneath...
          
                                STAR
                     Wow.   What were these like?
          
          MARCUS looks up from his work to see--
          
          A WHITE UNICORN in a FIELD OF FLOWERS.

          EXT.   MOTEL - NIGHT
          
          THE AEROSTAT zips past the CARPORT.   As soon as its gone--
          
                                 STAR
                     Now!
          
          THE JEEP is suddenly PUSHED from the carport, tires somewhat
          inflated. MARCUS is on one side of the rear, KYLE on the
          other, STAR behind the wheel, the seat moved all the way up.
          
          They get the vehicle to a slight SLOPE, it begins to roll on
          its own.
          
                               MARCUS
                     Pop the clutch! Let your foot up!
          
          ANGLE IN JEEP
          
          We see it's been hot-wired. STAR has her foot all the way
          down on the clutch, now lets up--
          
          THE JEEP BUCKS and SPUTTERS... but CATCHES. As soon as it
          does, MUSIC BLARES from the tape deck-- raucous HEAVY METAL,
          the aged cassette SPEEDS and SLOWS. MARCUS runs for the
          driver's side, but the JEEP is pulling ahead fast.
          
          ANGLE IN JEEP
          
          STAR is staring at the speaker, mesmerized at the sound of
          the MUSIC. When she looks out the windshield--
          
          --she's about to HIT A WALL, SQUEALS in terror--
          
          --MARCUS vaults in and pushes her aside, squeezing behind the
          wheel, hitting the brakes and throwing the Jeep into neutral.
          
                               KYLE
                     Aerostat's coming!
          
          KYLE hops in back as MARCUS adjusts the seat and FLOORS IT.
          THE KIDS are exhilarated as MARCUS zooms out of there,
          heading off-road across the plains, LIGHTS OFF, MUSIC LOUD.
          
                                 STAR

          CONTINUED:
          
          MARCUS turns the MUSIC DOWN.       He looks up to see--
          
          --THE AEROSTAT, right over their heads, keeping pace with the
          vehicle, RED LIGHTS FLASHING.
          
          KYLE rises in back, SWINGS at it with the SHOTGUN BUTT--
          
          THE AEROSTAT deftly dodges the blows.
          
                                 STAR
                       Oh no! It's gonna call a
                       Harvester, we're dead--
          
          MARCUS SLAMS on the brakes-- the AEROSTAT stops a few feet
          ahead of them, hovering in the air.
          
          MARCUS picks up an X-shaped LUG WRENCH from behind his seat,
          rises, taking aim--
          
          --and HURLS THE WRENCH with amazing speed and power--
          
          --it flies like a throwing star and SMASHES the AEROSTAT to
          BITS in a shower of SPARKS and METAL.
          
          The three of them stare breathlessly for a moment.
          
                                  KYLE
                       Wow.   You're good.
          
          MARCUS flexes his hand, startled at his own strength.

          The JEEP moves off-road, HEADLIGHTS OFF, traveling by
          MOONLIGHT. It SWERVES and BUCKS from time to time. MUSIC
          PLAYS from the TAPE DECK, something more melodic.
          
          ANGLE IN JEEP - KYLE behind the wheel, having the time of his
          life, MARCUS supervising, STAR enjoying the breeze and the
          unfamiliar sensation of a moving vehicle.
          
                                   STAR
                       Faster!
          
                                   MARCUS
                       No!    You're doing fine.
                                                                    (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          The SONG suddenly GARBLES, turning to NOISE. MARCUS ejects
          the tape, pulls it out-- it's unspooled, tangled in the
          stereo's guts. THE KIDS groan disappointedly. STATIC from
          the radio now... but a FAINT VOICE audible beneath it.
          
                                 MARCUS (cont'd)
                       Ssh.
          
          MARCUS FIDDLES with the dial. He can't get the SOUND clear,
          rolls through the dial. Varying levels of STATIC, then a
          relatively CLEAR VOICE:
          
                                 RADIO VOICE
                       --proper ratio of ammonium nitrate
                       to diesel fuel. A bomb of this
                       type can be contained in an
                       ordinary plastic garbage bag, and
                       will detonate on impact...

                       Stop the car.

          They SCREECH to a halt.
          
          IN THE DISTANCE - a RED GLOW of FLAMES far away. SILHOUETTED
          against this, strange FLYING VEHICLES and spindly, spider-

          TANKER on flat tires, the cab long gone.   MOVE TO FIND the
          JEEP approaching off-road.
          
          THE JEEP pulls to a stop, MARCUS gets out from behind the
          wheel and moves to the TANKER. STAR and KYLE, with his
          binocs, scan the area for signs of Skynet surveillance.
          
                               KYLE

          MARCUS pounds on the TANKER-- a deep echo.

                     Damn it.    Empty.

                     Food!
          
          They both hop out of the Jeep, running toward the GARAGE,

          KYLE and STAR slither under a partially open GARAGE DOOR.
          The space is dark, SMOKE-FILLED... STRIPS OF DRIED MEAT hang
          from the hydraulic lift. The two youths look amazed and
          delighted. Kyle shoves the gun into his waistband, moves to
          the closest strip and PEELS OFF A PIECE, takes a tentative
          bite, then gnaws ravenously. Star leans the shotgun against
          the wall and follows suit.
          
          MARCUS lifts the garage door and enters, DAWN LIGHT streaming
          in behind him.

                                KYLE
                         (mouth full)
                     Who cares?
          
          Marcus squints at something in the darkness.   He takes a step
          forward, then grabs Star's arm.
          
                               MARCUS
                     Spit it out!
          
                                STAR
                         (CHEWING)
                     It's good!
          
          Now KYLE reacts to what Marcus saw, GAGS and SPITS out meat.
          He's staring at--
          
          --a dried, severed HUMAN HAND, resting on a GRILLE in the
          sunken SERVICE PIT, where a CHARCOAL FIRE smolders.
          
          Star sees it too, turns and RETCHES, just as--
          
          --three animal-like CANNIBALS emerge from the back of the
          garage-- two burly, ugly, unshaven MEN and a wild-eyed,
          unhealthy-looking WOMAN with matted hair. We'll call them
          PIG, BULL and COW. PIG grabs the SHOTGUN, BULL grabs KYLE
          and yanks the HANDGUN from his waistband.
          
          COW grabs STAR, shoves her into the center of the garage,
          beside Kyle and Bull. Bull tosses the handgun to COW who
          keeps it trained on the kids, sizing them up.
          
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                          30.
          CONTINUED:
          
                                 COW
                       Not much meat on `em.
          
          PIG eyes Marcus, points the shotgun in his face.
          
                                 PIG
                       This one's fi-i-ine--
          
          MARCUS raises two fingers like a peace sign-- then shoves
          them into the barrels of the shotgun. PIG snorts and PULLS
          THE TRIGGER-- CLICK.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Oops.
          
          MARCUS yanks the gun away and tosses it aside, HEAD-BUTTS
          Pig, who staggers backward, BLOOD SPRAYING from his nose.
          
          COW points the unloaded HANDGUN at Marcus-- CLICK CLICK.
          
          KYLE and STAR get free of BULL and dash for the exit, they're
          out of there in a flash.
          
          BULL CHARGES MARCUS, who dodges him, grabs the man and--
          
          --HURLS HIM HEAD FIRST into the CHARCOAL PIT-- his BODY
          SIZZLES against the coals, he SCREAMS and WRITHES.
          
          COW picks up an AXE with two hands and SWINGS it at MARCUS
          who GRABS the HANDLE with one hand and YANKS it away.
          
          COW knows she's met her match, turns and flees, heading out
          the way Kyle and Star went.
          
          MARCUS advances on PIG and BULL, brandishing the AXE. Pig
          squirms back across the floor, wiping BLOOD from his face.
          
                                 PIG
                       We didn't kill `em! I swear to
                       God, they was dead already, we
                       wasn't gonna let `em rot--
          
          BULL has scrambled out of the coal pit, but is in too much
          pain to rise.
          
                                 BULL
                       Go `head, take as much as you want,
                       we're on the same side here--
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED: (2)
          
          Marcus looks ready to finish them off-- but reacts to CRIES
          from outside, a loud MECHANICAL RUMBLE.
          
          
          EXT.   SERVICE STATION - DAY
          
          A HARVESTER-- a GIANT INSECT-LIKE TERMINATOR-- is outside the
          station. Many times the size of a human being, MULTIPLE ARMS
          and LEGS sprout from its thorax, it has multiple CAMERA EYES
          on long, swiveling stalks-- it carries KYLE and STAR, the
          kids struggle frantically, caught in the harvester's jointed
          steel appendages.
          
          One unblinking EYE SCANS KYLE, another STAR; the harvester
          produces a NEEDLE from one of its arms, INJECTS the boy-- who
          instantly goes limp, unconscious. It does the same to STAR.
          
          As COW emerges--
          
          --THE HARVESTER SPRINGS on her, with startling speed. She
          SCREAMS as the enormous terminator hoists her into the air
          with the others, INJECTS her and begins moving toward--
          
          --A TRANSPORT. This consists of CONTAINER resembling a semi-
          trailer or wheeled dumpster, attached within a FRAMEWORK that
          features movable ENGINE PODS and a mysterious ARMATURE at the
          front. A STEEL LID in the top of the container OPENS
          hydraulically, the Harvester DEPOSITS the HUMAN CAPTIVES
          inside, and the LID SLAMS SHUT.
          
          MARCUS has emerged from the garage, still carrying the AXE.
          He stays low, hidden behind the tanker, watching as--
          
          --PIG and BULL flee through a back entrance to the garage,
          immediately attracting the attention of--
          
          --the Harvester, which sets off in pursuit.
          
          Marcus comes to a decision.    He SPRINTS into the open, toward
          the TRANSPORT, and--
          
          --CLAMBERS up the side, hitting the thing at full speed,
          using an engine pod to boost himself higher. He's still
          short but swings the AXE and--
          
          --hooks the AXE HEAD over the top of the container, like a
          grappling hook. He pulls himself up and--
          
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                          32.
          CONTINUED:
          
          --crawls across the roof, to the LID. There's a barred,
          reinforced MESH PANEL here, through which he can see--
          
          ANGLE IN TRANSPORT
          
          --about TWENTY HUMAN PRISONERS, unconscious on the steel
          floor. Among them are KYLE and STAR. Star MOANS, opens her
          eyes briefly and sees--
          
          --MARCUS' SILHOUETTE above her.
          
          Her eyes flutter shut again.
          
          MARCUS struggles to raise the sealed lid, but there's no
          purchase available, just a smooth seam. Suddenly--
          
          --the TRANSPORT JERKS. MARCUS nearly loses his footing as
          the TRANSPORT STARTS ROLLING forward. He drops to his belly,
          seeing that the transport is approaching--
          
          --the HARVESTER, which now carries PIG and BULL, both
          unconscious. THE LID OPENS and the Harvester DROPS the two
          men INSIDE-- but its camera eyes fail to register Marcus, who
          crouches behind the open lid. As the lid BEGINS TO CLOSE,
          the Harvester attaches to the armature at the front of the
          transport, making itself an aerodynamic part of the machine.
          
          MARCUS THRUSTS THE HEAD OF THE AXE under the closing LID in
          order to prevent it from sealing. THE LID grinds against it,
          but remains ajar. A moment later--
          
          --THE ENGINE PODS ROTATE DOWNWARD, FIRE and--
          
          --THE TRANSPORT LIFTS OFF THE GROUND. Within moments, the
          airborne dumpster has risen hundreds of feet in the air.
          
          
          EXT.   AERIAL - DAY
          
          MARCUS moves to the edge, looks down in astonishment at the
          fallow plains far below. Looking to the side, he sees--
          
          --A PAIR OF HUNTER KILLERS, swooping in quickly to provide an
          escort for the slower moving transport.
          
          WIND buffets Marcus, he hangs on for dear life. Clinging to
          the top of the transport, he slowly makes his way back toward
          the LID. As the transport BANKS, he almost loses his grasp,
          dangling for a moment before the craft rights itself.
                                                            (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                          33.
          CONTINUED:
          
          MARCUS reaches under the jammed lid and pulls with all his
          might. This thing is really heavy, plus he's fighting the
          WIND BLAST. MARCUS hears something behind him--
          
          THE HARVESTER has spotted him and is now prying itself loose
          from the armature. Also buffeted by the wind, it starts to
          move gingerly down the length of the transport toward Marcus.
          
          MARCUS must let the LID CLOSE. He snatches up the AXE, takes
          a couple of WHACKS at the thing, DENTING the metal, but doing
          no serious damage. The Harvester KNOCKS the weapon out of
          his hand, Marcus has no choice but to keep backing away.
          
          MARCUS is driven to the back of the transport. Struggling
          for handholds, he lowers himself out of sight, down the
          framework along the side, getting out of the wind. Suddenly--
          
          --STEEL CLAWS WRAP around him FROM BELOW, YANK him downward.
          
          THE HARVESTER has crawled around the SIDE of the TRANSPORT,
          and under the BOTTOM, in order to GRAB HIM. The hideous
          machine now holds him in its clutches, hundreds of feet in
          the air, its CAMERA EYES fixed on him.
          
          THE HARVESTER produces its needle, it's coming at his face--
          but MARCUS frees one hand, grabs the syringe, managing to
          hold it back, inches from his skin. His strength is
          weakening, but as the Harvester makes its final thrust--
          
          --he JERKS the NEEDLE to one side and it BENDS against one of
          the Harvester's own steel limbs.
          
          Undaunted, the creature crawls up the side of the transport,
          Marcus still in its clutches. It moves to the lid, which
          OPENS. It lets go of Marcus to drop him inside when--
          
          --MARCUS seizes two of its appendages and swings up onto the
          harvester's back, where he--
          
          --GRABS a couple of EYE STALKS, trying to RIP them from the
          harvester's thorax, LOOSE WIRES SPARK. The Harvester twists
          and thrashes, it's like he's a rodeo rider. A LIMB wraps
          around him, starting to CRUSH him in a vise-like grip, when
          SUDDENLY--
          
          --CANNON FIRE RIPS through the towering HARVESTER, blowing
          its thorax to PIECES, barely MISSING MARCUS.
          
          
                                                            (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                          34.
          CONTINUED: (2)
          
          A PAIR OF A-10 WARTHOGS-- the same colorful ground attack
          aircraft we saw in the first battle-- ROAR PAST on either
          side of the transport.
          
          THE CRIPPLED HARVESTER topples off the side of the transport,
          still clutching MARCUS and--
          
          --CATCHES on an ENGINE POD, the creature and Marcus both
          suspended in the air. THE HARVESTER ROASTS in the ENGINE
          BLAST, its CPU finally dies. Marcus is suspended below the
          engine, the steel limb RELEASES HIM, he has to cling to it
          now, to keep from falling.
          
          The HUNTER-KILLERS peel out in pursuit of the two Resistance
          planes.
          
          A DOGFIGHT ensues between the much larger, more heavily
          armored H-Ks, and the smaller, more maneuverable WARTHOGS.
          CANNON FIRE CATCHES an H-K but has no effect. The H-Ks' BLUE
          PLASMA PULSES barely miss the planes, which loop and bank.
          
          An AIR-TO-AIR MISSILE STREAKS from a WARTHOG and BLASTS the
          ENGINE of an H-K. AN EXPLOSION, the thing starts flying
          erratically, heading downward and--
          
          --CRASHING to earth in a glorious FIREBALL.
          
          
          EXT.   AERIAL & RIVER - DAY
          
          The planes are nearing a RIVER, bordered by sickly TREES. On
          the far banks, even from above, we see ominous MILITARY
          FORTIFICATIONS-- CONCRETE BUNKERS, ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUNS, etc.
          
          MARCUS meanwhile, is trying to climb up the dead Harvester,
          avoid the ENGINE BLAST and find a handhold on the transport.
          
          THE A-10 that shot down the H-K comes around for another pass
          at the transport, but--
          
          --ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUNS at the far side of the river let out a
          VOLLEY of BLUE PLASMA-FIRE. The BURSTS arc toward the A-10,
          which swerves and climbs, but--
          
          --PLASMA FIRE destroys a wing, the A-10 SPINS out of control.
          
          THE OTHER A-10 breaks off its dogfight with its H-K and
          speeds away from the river.
          
                                                            (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          MARCUS is tantalizingly close to the upper lip of the
          transport, he reaches out and--
          
          --THE FRIED HARVESTER suddenly dislodges from the ENGINE POD,
          taking Marcus with it, into FREEFALL.
          
          WITH MARCUS, plummeting downward toward earth, a hundred feet
          below, the transport continuing on its way above, crossing
          the river.
          
          MARCUS' POV - the ground and treetops getting closer. At the
          last moment, his continuing forward momentum takes him OVER
          THE RIVER and--
          
          MARCUS and the DEAD HARVESTER HIT THE WATER, hard, vanishing
          below the surface with enormous SPLASHES.
          
          The surviving H-K and the TRANSPORT continue across the river
          into Skynet territory, vanishing in the distance.
          
          CAMERA MOVES to FIND a PARACHUTE, drifting earthward on the
          unfortified side of the river.
          
          
          EXT.   RIVERBANK - DUSK
          
          HOLD ON LAPPING WATER for a beat.      Then--
          
          --MARCUS breaks the surface, staggering toward shore, he
          drops to his knees in the shallows.
          
          WAKES APPEAR behind him. Hearing the water stir, Marcus
          turns to see numerous DARK SHAPES moving rapidly in on him,
          from different directions, FLASHES OF METAL visible beneath
          the surface. These are HYDROBOTS-- AQUATIC TERMINATORS-- but
          we don't get a good look at them (yet) and Marcus isn't
          sticking around. He scrambles for the riverbank and makes
          his way into the leafless trees.
          
          
          EXT.   TREES - EVENING
          
          MARCUS moves past the trunks of bare trees, pauses, looks
          over the water in the direction the transport took.
          
                                  BLAIR (O.S.)
                       Yo!   Up here!

          CONTINUED:
          
          BLAIR WILLIAMS, the helmeted pilot who ejected, hangs from
          the tangled remains of her parachute, caught in the trees
          about fifteen feet in the air above Marcus.
          
          MARCUS moves closer.    Blair struggles to saw through her
          lines with a KNIFE.
          
                                 BLAIR (cont'd)
                       Who are you--
          
          The LINES suddenly SNAP, Blair FALLS from the tree.
          
          Marcus' reflexes are fast as ever, he's beneath her in an
          instant and CATCHES HER. He holds her in his arms:
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Name's Marcus.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       You can put me down now, Marcus.
          
          He does so. Blair pulls off her helmet, her hair is short.
          She's in her 20s, pretty, petite but strong, a no-nonsense,
          battle-hardened member of the Resistance. She pulls a
          COMPASS from her flight suit, consults it briefly as she
          orients herself.
          
                                 BLAIR (cont'd)
                       I've got an ELT, but I can't call
                       for a rescue here. There's an
                       outpost a few miles upriver-- not
                       my favorite people in the world,
                       but it's safe. Let's move.
          
          Blair is already moving, Marcus hesitates, then points across
          the water.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       I'm heading that way.
          
                                 BLAIR
                           (a short laugh)
                       The hot zone? No you're not.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       I've got to get to my friends--
          
                                 BLAIR
                       What friends?

                              MARCUS
                    Couple of kids. They were in that
                    flying dumpster--
          
                              BLAIR
                    The Skynet transport? It was
                    carrying people?
                        (off his nod)
                    Christ, we almost shot it down.
                    There've been rumors about a
                    concentration camp, but...
          
          She shakes her head, gestures toward the river.
          
                              BLAIR (cont'd)
                    You can't get across-- river's
                    fulla hydrobots--
          
                                 MARCUS
                    Hydrobots?
          
                              BLAIR
                    They can't see, but they have killer
                    sonar. They'll attack anything that
                    moves or makes a sound. Even if you
                    get past them, you'd be dead before
                    you covered a hundred yards. If the
                    terminators don't get you, the fallout
                    will-- heavy rads all the way to the
                    Gulf coast, nothing can live there.
          
          Marcus absorbs this, starts walking with her.
          
                              MARCUS
                    You're with the Resistance.
          
                              BLAIR
                    Lt. Blair Williams, I fly for what
                    used to be the Air National Guard.
          
          She puts a hand out, listening.   She signals for him to lay
          low, behind a fallen tree.
          
          NEARBY-- a pair of T-1s on patrol rumble into view. They
          pause, scanning the area, chain-guns at the ready. They
          start to move toward BLAIR and MARCUS' hiding place.
          
          BLAIR quickly grabs a STONE and, staying down, hurls it as
          far away as she can--
                                                             (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED: (3)
          
          THE STONE strikes a few BRANCHES--
          
          THE T-1s suddenly turn in that direction, GUNS BLAZING--
          
          THE WOODS in the immediate vicinity are torn to pieces by the
          GUNFIRE, small FIRES erupt from the incendiary bullets-- it's
          definitely overkill.
          
          THE T-1s roll over to inspect the damage, out of view.
          
          BLAIR whispers:
          
                               BLAIR (cont'd)
                     Stupid bastards. Come on.
          
          She and Marcus move away quickly, away from the trees.    When
          they're a safe distance from the robots--
          
                               MARCUS
                     I don't know... this has gotta be
                     some kind of, like, dream or
                     hallucination. Like what happens
                     to people right before they die...
          
          Blair SLUGS him hard, in the arm.     He doesn't flinch, but he
          looks surprised.
          
                               BLAIR
                     That snap you out of it?
          
          MARCUS shakes his head.   They keep walking.
          
                               BLAIR (cont'd)
                     Well hell, maybe you are dreaming. Do
                     us all a favor and wake up already.
          
                                                               CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT.   MUTANT FOREST - NIGHT
          
          THE MOON over a scrubby forest, trees just a few feet high.
          BLAIR and MARCUS seem like giants as they move among them.
          They've been talking a while, Blair's absorbing something.
          
                               BLAIR
                     So let me get this straight, Marcus.
                     There you are on death row, they stick
                     a needle in your arm...

                       and the next thing you know, you're
                       here.
                           (off his nod)
                       Since this ain't the resurrection,
                       there's only one possibility.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Let's hear it.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       Whatever they pumped into your veins just
                       knocked you out. This Angel Project you
                       signed up for-- there was a lotta
                       cryogenic stuff going on before the bombs
                       fell, they musta froze your ass.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       What the hell for?
          
                                 BLAIR
                       Drug tests, medical experiments, organ
                       harvesting, who knows? You said you
                       had no family, no friends-- why let a
                       body like yours go to waste?
          
          She's looking him over as she says this, it almost sounds
          flirtatious. Marcus changes the subject.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       I've never seen trees like these.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       We're in a mutation zone. I saw a
                       two-headed squirrel here once--
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Freaky.

                           (SHRUGS)
                       Tasted like chicken.
          
          BLAIR pauses, checking a small GEIGER COUNTER she carries--
          it CLICKS a bit.
          
                                 BLAIR (cont'd)
                       Levels are tolerable now, but just.
                       We can't spend the night here.

          CONTINUED: (2)
          
          They start moving again.   Marcus pauses, listens:
          
                              MARCUS
                    What was that?
          
                              BLAIR
                    I didn't hear anything--
          
          Now they both hear an eerie HOWL, changing in pitch-- like a
          coyote on crack. More than one picks up the CHORUS.
          
                                BLAIR (cont'd)
                    Skindogs.
          
          She pulls a SIDEARM, holds it at the ready as she starts
          running, away from the direction of the noise. Marcus keeps
          up at her side, looking behind them.
          
          WITH THE DOGS
          
          We don't get a good look at them, but there's a pack of large
          BEASTS moving quickly through the undergrowth, gaining on the
          fleeing humans.
          
          BLAIR sees they won't outrun them. She spins, FIRES in the
          direction of the approaching PACK. Suddenly it's quiet-- the
          animals fan out, forming a circle around Blair and Marcus.
          
                              MARCUS
                    They're surrounding us.
          
          QUICK SHOTS of MUTANT EYES, glowing in the dark-- ENLARGED
          TEETH-- DARK, MASSIVE FORMS moving through the brush.
          
                              BLAIR
                    They're smart. And they don't
                    scare easy.
          
          After a few tense beats, from the foliage--
          
          A SKINDOG leaps at BLAIR from behind-- it's hideous, the size
          of a Great Dane, hairless, with veiny, wrinkled skin and
          long, catlike CLAWS. Before Blair can react, MARCUS leaps
          between her and the dog, grabs the slavering creature by the
          throat. It SNAPS its ELONGATED TEETH at him, but he manages
          to BREAK its neck and hurl it toward--
          
          TWO MORE SKINDOGS moving in for an attack.

          CONTINUED: (3)
          
          BLAIR FIRES a few SHOTS at the encroaching pack, we hear a
          few YELPS--
          
          MARCUS protects her, effortlessly tosses a few more SKINDOGS
          aside, ignoring vicious bites and scratches.
          
          The other SKINDOGS turn on dead and injured pack members,
          begin TEARING INTO THEM. There's an opening now, the two
          humans make a run for it.
          
          BLAIR catches her breath, looking him over, seriously
          impressed by his strength and calm.
          
                               BLAIR (cont'd)
                     You saved my ass. Thanks.
          
          MARCUS shrugs, turns back to see the feeding frenzy.
          
                               MARCUS
                     Dog eat dog world.
          
          
                                                         DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          EXT.   NORMAL FOREST - NIGHT
          
          It's darker now, the moon is down. MARCUS and BLAIR move
          gingerly-- she TRIPS, he catches her before she falls.
          
                                BLAIR
                     Thanks.
          
          BLAIR sighs, yawns, sits against a tree.
          
                               BLAIR (cont'd)
                     It's not far, but we'll never get
                     across the mine field at night.
                     Might as well STAF till morning.
          
          MARCUS nods, sits a few feet away from her.
          
                               BLAIR (cont'd)
                     C'mere, it's cold. I don't bite.
          
          MARCUS slides toward her, she nestles against him.
          
                                MARCUS
                     Staf?   What's that mean?

                       and fuck.
          
          Soon they're kissing passionately.      But MARCUS pulls away,
          rolls onto his back.

                       Lingerie? Or am I not your... type?
          
                                 MARCUS
                       I'm not gay. In prison, I thought
                       about puss-- women all the time. But
                       now... it's not working. Who knows,
                       all those years on ice...
          
                                 BLAIR
                       Maybe it's just gonna take some time.
                       Before you're completely thawed out.
          
          She's slipped a hand inside his pocket for warmth... now she
          pulls out the SCRAPS of paper, with women's faces. She
          squints at these in the dark.
          
                                 BLAIR (cont'd)
                       What are these?
          
                                 MARCUS
                       I dunno. They just... sorta
                       reminded me of her.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       Who?
          
          MARCUS speaks carefully, unsure how to articulate this.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       There's a woman, the last woman I
                       saw before... when I was under, the
                       dead time-- she kept coming to me.
                       I think she must've saved me.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       I can't compete with that.

          She closes her eyes, settling against him, her head against
          his chest. Marcus stares up into the darkness.

          DARKNESS. We just make out KYLE and STAR among the other
          PRISONERS, most of whom are awake now in the steel container.
          Star still wears her baseball cap. The prisoners are JOSTLED
          as the transport touches down.
          
                               KYLE
                     We've landed.
          
          
          EXT.   LOADING ZONE - NIGHT
          
          The TRANSPORT has landed amongst numerous CONTAINERS, CRANES
          and VEHICLES-- all is dimly lit, enveloped in a vague reddish
          HAZE. THE FLYING FRAMEWORK and ARMATURE detach from the
          TRANSPORT, and TAKE OFF into the air again-- leaving the
          trailer-like wheeled CONTAINER. Something resembling the CAB
          of a semi-truck backs into position, latching onto attachment
          points on the container.
          
          
          INT.   TRANSPORT - NIGHT
          
          --A SMALL PANEL SLIDES OPEN   at the front of the transport,
          and a half-dozen PROCESSING   AEROSTATS buzz inside from the
          cab. These are larger than    the spy drones, with attached
          PINCERS that can encircle a   person's arm.
          
          PRISONERS duck, try to dodge these things. But they quickly
          buzz from captive to captive, latching onto their arms-- we
          hear SCREAMS, see FLASHES OF LIGHT from the aerostats.
          
          KYLE tries to bat away an AEROSTAT, but its PINCERS latch
          onto his forearm. A SIZZLING SOUND-- Kyle CRIES OUT with the
          pain, a flash of RED LIGHT-- then the aerostat DETACHES and
          moves to its next victim.
          
          STAR gets the same treatment from a different AEROSTAT.   She
          moves to Kyle's side, tears in her eyes, sucking on her
          burned wrist to ease the pain.

                                 KYLE
                       I don't know...
          
          KYLE looks grimly down at--
          
          --a fresh BAR CODE seared into his arm.
          
          
          EXT.   LOADING ZONE/HIGHWAY - NIGHT
          
          THE CAB and CONTAINER, now resembling a semi, pulls out of
          the loading area. Digitally controlled, it needs no
          headlights as it rolls in the near-darkness.
          
          OVERHEAD ANGLE as the vehicle moves onto a cloverleaf access
          ramp leading to a HIGH SPEED SUNKEN HIGHWAY, a river of fast-
          moving TRAFFIC heading in both directions-- unlit vehicles
          moving close together at 120 mph through the reddish gloom.

          CLOSE - BLAIR and MARCUS's feet trudge through low brush,
          step over undergrowth. CAMERA MOVES to find a STRAND OF
          BARBED WIRE, emerging from the dirt a few feet away.
          
          MARCUS pauses, almost having stepped on a WATERMELON.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       We're in somebody's garden.
          
          BLAIR stops walking, alarmed, a few feet away from him.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       Christ... there's supposed to be
                       barbed wire along the edge.
          
          MARCUS looks around them, points.

          A few yards away, STRINGS OF BARBED WIRE... CAMERA MOVES to
          reveal it's behind as well as ahead of them. They've come
          through a gap where the wire had fallen.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       Whatever you do, don't move.
                           (SHOUTS)
                       Yo! Morrison, Barnes! Can anybody
                       hear me?!
                           (to Marcus)
                       We're in the middle of the mine field.

          INT.   OUTPOST/BARRACKS & COMMUNICATIONS AREA - DAY
          
          DARK. We hear BABIES CRYING from nearby, FUMBLING in the
          dark, muttered CURSES-- then a MATCH lights a CANDLE.
          BARNES, 20-ish, good-looking and cocky, yawns and sneers,
          annoyed at being awakened. TWO WOMEN share his mattress.
          
                                 BARNES
                       Somebody feed those things!
          
                                 MORRISON
                       Start up the generator, Barnes.
          
          MORRISON is bearded, long-haired, bleary-eyed, a middle-aged
          man in charge here. He sits up in bed, also beside A COUPLE
          OF WOMEN. This place has become an underground crash pad,
          communal living for about a dozen people-- Morrison and
          Barnes the only men, four or five WOMEN and quite a few
          CHILDREN of varying age.
          
          BARNES grunts, yanks the blanket off his bedmates, who CRY
          OUT in protest. He wraps it around himself, carries the
          candle as he steps around other SLEEPING FIGURES, makes his
          way toward a METAL STAIRCASE winding downward. Moments
          later, we hear a GAS ENGINE start up-- LIGHTS flicker on.
          
          The place is pretty grimy and run-down, but it was once a
          military environment. There's a BANK OF TV MONITORS against
          one wall, which COME TO LIFE. A couple of the WOMEN move
          toward the adjacent NURSERY AREA to tend to the babies-- one
          of them, LISA, moves to the TV MONITORS. She squints at one.
          
                                 LISA
                       We got company!

          BARNES pokes his head up from a concealed TRAPDOOR thirty
          yards from BLAIR and MARCUS, who are hoarse from shouting.
          
                                 BARNES
                       Blair? Good to see you.
                           (off her glare)
                       What's the password?

                                 BARNES
                       Close enough. Who's your friend?
          
                                 BLAIR
                       Could you get us outta here please?
          
                                 BARNES
                       Kinda dumb-ass, wandering around in
                       a mine field.

                                 BARNES
                       It's too early for that military crap.
          
          BARNES consults a MAP, turning it to orient himself.
          
                                 BARNES (cont'd)
                       OK, if you keep walking straight
                       you're gonna get blown all to
                       hell... turn to your left and take,
                       oh... five steps.
          
          BLAIR and MARCUS obey, moving cautiously.
          
                                 BARNES (cont'd)
                       OK, face me now. Three steps.

                       and take another five steps...
          
          They slowly pace five steps.      On the fifth one, there's a
          CLICK beneath Marcus' foot--
          
          A horrified moment of eye contact between him and Blair-- she
          DIVES TO THE GROUND, away from him as--
          
          BOOM!   MARCUS is thrown through the air by the EXPLOSION--
          
          MARCUS' BODY lands a few feet from the trap door.

          corridor from the open trap door by BARNES, MORRISON and a
          couple of women, NANCY and LISA. BLAIR, bleeding from
          shrapnel injuries, assists. She yells at BARNES:

          MARCUS is deposited gingerly on a METAL TABLE in this crude
          MEDICAL AREA. Numerous INFANTS and TODDLERS about.
          
          JANE, a doctor, moves toward MARCUS with scissors and other
          medical tools, cuts away a tattered pants leg, the shreds of
          his sneaker. She stops and stares, palpates a BLACKENED LEG
          briefly. She looks up in alarm.
          
                                 JANE

                       I don't think so.
          
          JANE opens Marcus' shrapnel-torn shirt, takes the scalpel and
          gingerly pulls it across the flesh of his chest. No effect.

          --a detached, fleshless metal framework for a ROBOTIC HAND is
          suspended by wires-- it FLEXES, forming a FIST.

          head. METALLIC ATTACHMENT POINTS await these missing parts.
          
          --the inside of MARCUS' FACE, a thin membrane of artificial
          skin with eye, nose and mouth holes, is lowered through an
          AQUEOUS environment TOWARD CAMERA.
          
          THROUGH AN EYEHOLE we see SERENA, face distorted by the
          LIQUID. She looks worried. We hear her MUFFLED VOICE:
          
                                 SERENA
                       Why isn't he conscious?
                       Something's wrong, he should be
                       coming out of it by now...

          START TIGHT ON MARCUS as he opens his eyes, a beam of bright
          SUNLIGHT in his face. CAMERA PULLS BACK and ROTATES to
          reveal that he is suspended UPSIDE-DOWN from a winch by a two-
          inch thick STEEL CABLE.
          
          MARCUS thrashes, trying to free himself, then looks up and
          sees that--
          
          --the CABLES are strung through HEAVY STEEL BOLTS which have
          been DRILLED THROUGH HIS CALVES, locking them together. His
          FOREARMS have been immobilized in the same grotesque fashion.
          
          From above, the BEAM OF SUNLIGHT shines through the narrow
          crack between an enormous pair of SLIDING STEEL PANELS.
          
          MARCUS twists his neck to look downward--
          
          MARCUS' POV-- a circular pit below, the dark bottom invisible
          to him-- he's hanging near the top of an empty MISSILE SILO,
          its ICBM launched years ago.
          
          At one edge of the silo pit, near scaffolding and tool carts,
          SMALL CHILDREN have gathered to stare. Also there is BARNES--
          he leans back, eyes closed, in a folding chair, with an RPG
          in his lap. One of the KIDS taps Barnes' leg and he jerks
          upright. He immediately trains his weapon on MARCUS, clearly
          nervous now that the terminator is conscious.
          
          MARCUS stares at Barnes, deadpan, for a beat.
          
                               MARCUS

                     of aeration and hydration system,
                     function unclear at this point. Valves
                     and what looks like an access panel

          MATTRESSES have been piled to one side, we now see framed,
          cracked and yellowing POSTERS of MILITARY EQUIPMENT-- AIR
          FORCE JETS, ATLAS ROCKETS, etc. These are interspersed with
          crude CHILDREN'S DRAWINGS on the walls.
          
          BLAIR sits at a battered dining table, surrounded by angry
          outpost RESIDENTS, including JANE and MORRISON.

          BLAIR is first to reach the edge of the silo, horrified at
          the sight of the dangling MARCUS. BARNES keeps the RPG
          trained on him, they shout over each other.
          
                               MARCUS

                       even his appearance is kept secret.
          
          LISA makes a connection, we hear CONNOR'S VOICE, the same one
          we heard on the car radio.
          
                                 CONNOR'S VOICE
                       --hello-- standing by--
          
                                 LISA
                       Sir, we can hear you, sir, working
                       on a visual, sir...
          
          
          INT.   COMMAND CENTER/CONFERENCE AREA - DAY
          
          MARCUS' FACE pops to life on a VIDEO MONITOR. We're in a
          Spartan, windowless space, it feels like it's underground.
          
                                 CONNOR
                       Not what I expected...
          
          JOHN CONNOR leans INTO FRAME, studies the screen. He wears a
          dark sweater, nothing like a uniform. Connor is 40ish now,
          but looks older, prematurely grey, years of war have taken a
          toll. There's an ever-present sadness in his eyes.

          MARCUS listens to the disembodied VOICE, unimpressed.    The
          OTHERS almost stand at attention.

                                 CONNOR'S VOICE
                       It does seem lifelike-- is the face
                       able to mimic emotions--?
          
          MARCUS rolls his eyes, makes an angry FACE at the CAMERA.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       This shit is ridiculous. What the
                       hell do you want from me?
          
                                 CONNOR
                           (STUNNED)
                       I-- I need to know what you are.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       So do I! I don't know what I am, what
                       I'm doing here, I don't know shit--
                       maybe I never did, but-- I'm sick of it!
                       Just blow my head off or let me go.
          
                                 CONNOR
                       This isn't right. I can't be
                       having a conversation with a
                       terminator, Skynet isn't that
                       sophisticated yet. Unless... were
                       you sent here from the future?
          
                                 MARCUS
                           (very confused)
                       What?
          
                                 CONNOR
                       Skynet's developing a time
                       displacement field, we've decrypted
                       recent data transmissions.
                           (SADLY)
                       I know for a fact that soon machines
                       will be travelling back decades. To
                       try and stop us from winning this war
                       before it begins...
          
          Marcus takes this in for a sober moment.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       You're out of your mind, aren't you?
          
          This earns outraged glares from the others, but Blair stifles
          a smile. Barnes moves to strike him, Morrison stops him.
          
                                                                  (CONTINUED)

          Densely marked MAPS on a CONFERENCE TABLE. CONNOR is now
          flanked by a couple of SENIOR ADVISORS, older military men--
          along with KATE BREWSTER, late 30s, now his wife-- and
          visibly PREGNANT. She's poring over FAXES of the X-RAY
          IMAGES. (Like Connor, all military personnel here favor
          casual dress, at most pins or patches to indicate rank.)
          
                               KATE
                     He's not a cyborg-- no blood, no
                     human tissue over the endoskeleton.
          
                               CONNOR
                     Besides, the first T-800s won't be
                     manufactured until `26.
          
                               ADVISOR #1
                     Maybe he's a one-off, an experiment.
          
                               ADVISOR #2
                     Let's hope. If there are more out there
                     like him, we're in serious trouble.
                     Christ, a terminator with attitude...
          
                               KATE
                     Where did they find him?
          
                               ADVISOR #1
                     East-central Texas, near an area of
                     heavy Skynet concentration. The
                     outpost where they're holding him is
                     reasonably secure, but it's not much
                     more than a commune.
          
                               CONNOR
                     I want him extracted.
          
                                ADVISOR #1
                     Done.   What then?
          
          CONNOR picks up the FAXES, disturbed by them.

                       Get him to our best people for
                       disassembly, find out what makes him
                       tick. We need to get into that metal
                       skull, crack his CPU at all costs.
          
          THE ADVISORS nod, pick up their papers and exit. As soon as
          they're gone, Connor sits wearily in a chair, tosses the X-
          rays and papers onto the table, his authoritative mask
          slipping. Kate touches his arm. He leans his head against
          her pregnant belly.
          
                                 CONNOR (cont'd)
                       Kate, why did I become leader of
                       the Resistance?
          
                                 KATE
                       Because people trust you... you
                       give them faith--
          
                                 CONNOR
                       No. Because I knew I would be, I
                       was told. I know when and where the
                       major battles are going to take
                       place. I know I'm going to send my
                       own father back through time to save
                       my mother-- even though I haven't
                       met him yet. Christ, I even know
                       the year I'm going to die...
          
                                 KATE

                                 CONNOR
                       So how could I not know about this?!
          
          He BANGS HIS FIST on the table atop the PAPERS.

          INT.   OUTPOST/CORRIDOR & LAUNCH TUBE - DAY
          
          MARCUS is marched down the corridor to the launch tube,
          Frankenstein-like, MORRISON holding the chains, keeping a
          safe distance from him, while BARNES keeps the RPG trained at
          Marcus' head.

          CONTINUED:
          
          Marcus shuffles awkwardly, the bolts hampering his ankles.
          It's reminiscent of his death walk at film's opening.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Feels like I been here before...
                       what are you gonna do to me?
          
                                 MORRISON
                       Nothing. Los Angeles is sending a
                       chopper-- seems you're some kind of VIP.
          
          They reach the edge of the SILO PIT-- a long drop, smooth
          walls, a long METAL LADDER leading down into darkness.
          MARCUS pauses by the ladder, holds up his bolted arms
          questioningly-- "now what?"
          
          At a look from Morrison, he and Barnes BODY-CHECK MARCUS at
          once, sending him flying over the edge--
          
          MARCUS FALLS the thirty feet or so, strikes the concrete
          FLOOR of the launch tube with a sickening THUD, the CHAINS
          clattering down around him.
          
          MARCUS is stunned, barely conscious as the LADDER is PULLED
          UPWARD. It's like the bottom of a well, twenty feet in
          diameter, sheer concrete walls, the floor BLACKENED from a
          rocket blast.
          
          ANGLE UP - his captors look down at him for a moment, then
          move out of view.
          
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          
          INT.   TRANSPORT - NIGHT
          
          CAMERA MOVES past the PRISONERS, a couple dozen total... An
          HISPANIC COUPLE huddle against one wall, whispering to each
          other IN SPANISH... COW rocks in despair, head in her hands,
          BULL and PIG mutter to each other nearby... an OLDER WOMAN
          prays, going through rosary beads... FIND STAR and KYLE.
          She's watching as KYLE uses his pocket knife to CARVE an
          image in the wall of the transport. He looks up.
          
                                 KYLE
                       We're stopping.

          The BACK PANEL rolls upward. CONTROL ROBOTS-- reminiscent of
          the treaded T-1s but without the heavy weaponry-- flank a
          path from the rear of the transport towards BRIGHT LIGHT up a
          RAMP a short distance away.
          
          THE PRISONERS instinctively move away from the robots, moving
          to the front of the container... until ZZZAP! BLUE ENERGY
          crackles across the floor. THE PRISONERS CRY OUT in pain at
          the electrified surface, and dash toward the opening at the
          rear, leaping out of the container.
          
          LOW ANGLE, as the prisoners run by, we hold a moment on
          Kyle's graffiti-- it's the STICK FIGURE IMAGES of KYLE and
          STAR we saw before, they both hold hands with a LARGER STICK
          FIGURE who stands between them, meant to be MARCUS.
          
          
          INT.   UNDERGROUND GARAGE - NIGHT
          
          THE CONTAINER has stopped in a large subterranean space.
          There are numerous FUTURISTIC VEHICLES here-- hydrogen CARS,
          three-wheeled ATVs, electric BUSES. CONTROL `BOTS closest to
          the container start to close in on the huddling PRISONERS.
          
          A ROBOT BUMPS into BULL, sending another JOLT OF ELECTRICITY
          through his body, like a cattle prod. Everyone gets the
          picture, starts hurrying down the line, the ROBOTS closing
          around them.
          
          COW looks around nervously, clearly freaking out.   Spotting a
          gap between the robots, she bolts--
          
          --a ROBOT SWIVELS and CUTS HER DOWN with an ENERGY BLAST.
          She lies still, SMOKE rising from her body.
          
          The other PRISONERS pick up the pace.
          
                                 STAR
                       I'm scared.

                           (hugging her)
                       Whatever happens, we stick together.
          
          The LIGHT emanates from FROSTED WINDOWS at the top of the
          RAMP, through which we make out the SILHOUETTES of human
          figures.

          GLASS DOORS part ahead of the prisoners-- a stark white,
          sterile environment beyond. THE ROBOTS stop here. THE
          PRISONERS disappear inside... and the DOORS CLOSE.

          BARNES remains on guard duty with the RPG, propped up on some
          cushions, a LANTERN by his side-- it's pretty late, the
          generator's shut down. He's reading an old, yellowed COMIC
          BOOK, he has a small stack at his side.
          
          MARCUS' VOICE echoes up from below, startling him.
          
                                  MARCUS
                       Hello? Anyone there?
                           (BEAT)
                       I'm thirsty.
          
                                 BARNES
                           (SNICKERING)
                       Want some motor oil?
          
                                 MARCUS
                       I need water.
          
                                   BARNES
                       Bullshit.    Machines don't drink.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Please, I'm--
          
                                 BARNES
                       Shut up, robot!
          
          BARNES returns to his reading. He reacts to FOOTSTEPS from
          the long corridor into the living area behind him.
          
          BLAIR approaches with a FLASHLIGHT, her manner conciliatory.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       How's it going, Barnes? Thought
                       you might like a late-night snack.
          
          She pulls a crumpled plastic PACKAGE out of a pocket of her
          flight suit-- ancient Hostess snack cakes. BARNES' eyes
          light up as he puts the RPG aside and grabs it.

                                 BARNES
                       Where in hell'd you get these?
          
                                 BLAIR
                       We got a stash back at the base.
          
          BARNES tears open the package hungrily, takes a bite.       He
          grins, but as he chews, his expression darkens.
          
                                 BARNES
                       Kinda stale.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       You need something to wash it down.
          
          From another pocket, she produces a plastic water bottle
          filled with a murky gray liquid.
          
                                 BARNES
                       I'm on duty, you know.
          
          So saying, he takes the bottle, unscrews the cap and takes a
          long pull. It's powerful hootch, he gasps for air, passes
          her the bottle as she sits beside him. She doesn't drink.
          
                                 BARNES (cont'd)
                       Twinkies and moonshine. You trying
                       to seduce me again?
          
                                 BLAIR
                       You know I always liked you, Barnes.   I
                       just didn't want to join the harem.
          
                                 BARNES
                       What can I say? It's our duty to
                       repopulate the planet.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       Noble of you to make the sacrifice.
          
                                 BARNES
                       C'mere.
          
          He pulls her close to him for a kiss. After a moment, she
          pulls away and moves to the corridor entrance. There's a
          large SLIDING STEEL DOOR here.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       I prefer a little privacy.
                                                                  (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED: (2)
          
          With some effort, she pulls the door CLOSED. BARNES rises
          with a grin, undoing his shirt, coming close to her. He's
          already unsteady on his feet.
          
                              BARNES
                    You're so twentieth century...
          
          He puts his arms around her for a full body embrace--
          
                              BARNES (cont'd)
                    Admit it, I'm the best you ever had...
          
          His words are slurring. He slides to the floor, slowly
          losing his grip. He rolls onto his back with a drugged-out
          expression of bliss on his unconscious face.
          
                               BLAIR
                    Men.   You're all talk.
          
          IN THE BOTTOM OF THE PIT
          
          MARCUS leans against the wall in the dark, rolls out of the
          way as the LADDER drops. BLAIR descends quickly, the
          FLASHLIGHT in her belt, a battery BLADE SAW in one hand. She
          sets the flashlight on the ground and moves to his side--
          
                              BLAIR (cont'd)
                    I used up the last of my Valium for
                    you... Hold out your arms.
          
          He does, she fires up the SAW, moves it carefully to the bolt
          joining his forearms. SPARKS fly from the BUZZING BLADE as
          it digs into the metal-- it's going to take some time.
          
                              MARCUS
                    Why are you doing this?
          
                              BLAIR
                    I don't believe you're a terminator.
          
                              MARCUS
                    So what am I...?
          
                              BLAIR
                    Whatever you are-- I owe you one.
                    Once you're free, I'll lie down
                    next to Barnes-- they'll assume you
                    escaped while we were passed out--
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)

                               MARCUS
                     You think they'll buy that?
          
                               BLAIR
                     Worth a shot.
                         (looking at him)
                     Marcus, Command wants to take you
                     apart, cut open your head. One
                     thing I know, you're alive-- and
                     you've got a right to live.
          
          THE BUZZING SAW BLADE sound-bridges to:
          
          
          EXT.   FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT
          
          THE WHIR OF CHOPPER BLADES. A SPOTLIGHT shines over the low
          growth in the minefield as a BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER circles,
          coming in for a landing. WEAPONS RACKS are jury-rigged
          beside the spotlight, the chopper bristles with AUTOMATED
          CANNONS, MISSILES and NAPALM TANKS.
          
          THE SPOTLIGHT picks out the CONCRETE and STEEL CAP of the
          LAUNCH TUBE.
          
          
          INT.   OUTPOST/LAUNCH TUBE - NIGHT
          
          THE SAW finishes cutting the BOLT between Marcus' legs; his
          arms are already free. The BUZZING cuts out, but now they
          hear the CHOPPER LANDING directly overhead.
          
                               BLAIR
                     They're already here for you--
          
          MARCUS slides the BOLTS out of his legs, freeing himself from
          the chains.
          
                               BLAIR (cont'd)
                     Hide in the forest, then aim west
                     for open country--
          
                               MARCUS
                     I'm heading across the river.
          
                               BLAIR
                     No human being can survive there--

                                 BLAIR
                       You're gonna try and save those kids.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       It's the only thing I can think of
                       that makes any sense...
          
                                 BLAIR
                       Marcus, for all you know, they're
                       dead already--
          
                                 MARCUS
                       For all I know, they're the reason
                       I'm back from the dead.
          
          BLAIR studies him a moment, no changing his mind. But she
          admires him. She starts up the ladder, MARCUS following.
          
          BARNES is still passed out as BLAIR and MARCUS ascend to the
          platform around the pit. They move to the sliding door--
          
          BLAIR starts to open it, but sees a LIGHT and hears VOICES
          and FOOTSTEPS at the far end, SLIDES IT SHUT again.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       Damn it, we're too late--
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Where's that go?
          
          MARCUS points to a LARGE VENTILATION FAN behind STEEL
          GRATING, eight feet above them, on the far side of the pit.
          It's not running, but there's no way to get through it.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       Should lead out, but there's no way
                       past the fan--
          
          MARCUS is already picking up the RPG-- but he points it
          backwards, has no idea how to shoot it--
          
          BLAIR grins, grabs the RPG from him-- then braces herself,
          takes aim and FIRES--
          
          KABOOM!   The EXPLOSION rips OPEN the GRATE, destroys the FAN.
          
                                                                            65.
          
          
          INT.   OUTPOST/CORRIDOR - NIGHT
          
          MORRISON escorts a pair of powerful UNIFORMED SOLDIERS armed
          with HIGH-TECH RIFLES with explosive shells-- they react to
          the EXPLOSION beyond the closed door-- and break into a run,
          the soldiers readying their weapons.
          
          
          INT.   OUTPOST/LAUNCH TUBE - NIGHT
          
          MARCUS and BLAIR have moved around the narrow walkway to the
          far end of the pit, beneath the SMOKING HOLE. Blair thinks
          of something, pulls a small DEVICE from her flight suit, the
          size of a pack of cigarettes, holds it toward Marcus.
          
                               BLAIR
                     Here. My ELT-- emergency locator
                     transmitter. If you find the camp,
                     activate it like this. It could
                     really help the Resistance.
          
          She indicates a button.     MARCUS takes the device--
          
          --then grabs her, KISSES HER hard on the mouth-- she's
          startled-- it felt very human.
          
                                  MARCUS
                     Thank you.
          
          MARCUS grabs the sharp, still smoking STEEL projecting from
          the hole and pulls himself upward as--
          
          THE DOOR SLIDES OPEN and the SOLDIERS open FIRE at MARCUS--
          
          BLAIR hits the deck as EXPLOSIVE SHELLS tear HOLES in the
          CONCRETE--
          
          --SHRAPNEL hits MARCUS in the back, he's thrown into the
          ventilation shaft--
          
          
          INT.   VENTILATION SHAFT - NIGHT
          
          MARCUS has a CHUNK OF REBAR lodged in his left SHOULDER, but
          he doesn't even notice this yet. He picks himself up and
          moves quickly in the darkness, crouching in this cramped
          tube. There's a TURN up ahead, he just makes it as--
          
          An EXPLOSIVE SHELL rockets through the shaft behind him--
                                                                  (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          BOOM! THE BLAST TEARS through the metal tube, DIRT POURS IN,
          blocking the tunnel from his pursuers.
          
          
          EXT.   FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT
          
          Near the edge of the clearing, a low STEEL VENT with a peaked
          CAP. DENTS appear in it from within--
          
          MARCUS finally PUNCHES his way out, pulls himself up and
          rolls onto the dirt-- for a moment he seems safe, laying low
          in the grass. Then--
          
          --he registers the REBAR in his shoulder. It goes right
          through him, emerging from his chest. Marcus is stunned.
          With some effort, he YANKS OUT the REBAR and tosses it aside.
          TORN METAL of his steel endoskeleton is now exposed, along
          with a glimpse of circuitry. Marcus reels, puts a hand over
          the hole in his chest where a heart should be; he really
          isn't human. He doesn't have much time to deal with this as--
          
          --THE CHOPPER emerges from behind the treeline, the SPOTLIGHT
          picks him out and AUTOMATIC FIRE erupts--
          
          MARCUS runs a few yards and throws himself to the ground as--
          
          GUNFIRE STRAFES around and ahead of him-- setting off several
          MINES which send up clouds of dirt.
          
          MARCUS picks himself up and runs for the trees, leaping over
          the barbed wire.
          
          
          EXT.   FOREST - NIGHT
          
          MORE GUNFIRE rips apart the trees around Marcus as he sprints
          and weaves, making his way toward the river. The SPOTLIGHT
          picks him up and loses him again-- it's tough for the chopper
          to get a clear shot at him here.
          
          
          EXT.   RIVERBANK - NIGHT
          
          MARCUS has reached the edge of the trees, he can see the
          river just beyond. He starts to move for it, when--
          
          --FWOOM! The forest around him ERUPTS INTO FLAME, the
          chopper has laid NAPALM along the river's edge.
          
                                                            (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                          67.
          CONTINUED:
          
          MARCUS reels from the intense heat, bats out FLAMES on his
          clothes, but his skin remains undamaged. Realizing he can
          keep on moving--
          
          --MARCUS DASHES through the dense FIRE to--
          
          
          EXT.   RIVER - DAWN
          
          --the RIVER, where the sky is just starting to LIGHTEN.
          MARCUS SPLASHES into the shallows, extinguishing the FLAMES.
          He fills his hands with water and sucks it down gratefully.
          
          ANGLE ON THE WATER - A GLIMMER of METAL below the surface,
          heading for the source of the splashing. Suddenly--
          
          --the BLACKHAWK CHOPPER drops down directly in front of
          Marcus, hovering a few feet above the water, the GUNNER
          pointing his weapon directly at Marcus (he's one of the two
          soldiers we saw before). The BLADE WASH swirls the water in
          a whirlpool and beats back the FIRE behind Marcus. As the
          GUNNER OPENS FIRE--
          
          --MARCUS DIVES below the surface, BULLETS ZINGING through the
          murky water.
          
          UNDERWATER - MARCUS is winged by a couple of shots, his
          thermoplastic flesh getting torn apart--
          
          WITH THE GUNNER - He pauses a moment, squinting into the
          WATER for a glimpse of Marcus, but failing to register that--
          
          --BELOW THE CHOPPER, right beneath him, the WATER ROILS as if
          teeming with piranha. Suddenly--
          
          --HYDROBOTS ERUPT from the RIVER with a hideous BUZZING
          SOUND. Hydrobots resemble segmented serpents, eyeless, but
          with razor-sharp heads that DRILL into their victims-- they
          respond to sound and vibrations. About a dozen of these four-
          foot long, glistening steel snakes shoot from the water to
          attack the chopper.
          
          INSIDE THE CHOPPER - HYDROBOTS PIERCE the aluminum FLOOR, and
          shoot into the cabin, the PILOT and the two SOLDIERS CRY OUT.
          
          The GUNNER tumbles out of the chopper and FALLS in the water.
          
          THE PILOT attempts to maintain control, but the hydraulics
          are damaged and the steel serpents thrash about in the cabin.
                                                            (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                          68.
          CONTINUED:
          
          THE GUNNER surfaces, trying frantically to swim to shore.
          But the hydrobots are upon him, he SHRIEKS and disappears
          beneath the bubbling surface, which now boils with BLOOD.
          
          IN THE CHOPPER - A WHIRRING HYDROBOT penetrates the other
          soldier's leg. He SCREAMS and wrenches the thing back out,
          tossing it from the chopper just before--
          
          --THE CHOPPER CRASHES INTO THE SHALLOWS.
          
          THE PILOT leaps from the cabin and makes it to shore, where
          he collapses. But the remaining, wounded SOLDIER can't get
          out of the hip-deep water before the HYDROBOTS are upon him.
          
          Suddenly, HANDS BURST from the water, grabbing the soldier.
          A second later, MARCUS SURFACES, slinging the man over his
          shoulder. He strides to shore, as if rescuing the man from
          enemy fire, hydrobots thrashing and bubbling at his waist.
          
          MARCUS reaches the amazed pilot, lays the wounded soldier
          down beside him, then tears a whirring, writhing HYDROBOT
          from the soldier's belly and WHIPS its head against a ROCK--
          it SPARKS, micro-machine parts fly. The pilot and wounded
          soldier stare at him, astonished.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Don't mention it.
          
          He tosses the dead robo-snake aside, then turns and moves
          back into the water, quickly vanishing below the surface.
          
          UNDERWATER - MARCUS moves steadily across the silty river
          bottom. He doesn't need air. HYDROBOTS come at him, he
          swats them away as if they were mosquitoes, CRUSHING in his
          hand those that linger too long. Those which make contact
          with his artificial skin can't get far, turn and swim off.
          
          
          EXT.   FAR RIVERBANK - DAY
          
          MARCUS emerges, the FLAMES still visible on the other side of
          the river, behind him. He doesn't look back, as he moves
          into Skynet turf. This side of the river isn't wooded,
          everything has a concrete, industrial feel. Marcus is a
          mess, both clothing and skin are shredded and charred.
          
          He nearly bumps into a SKELETAL STEEL TERMINATOR, which
          emerges from behind a concrete wall. The terminator trains
          its PLASMA RIFLE on MARCUS, scans him, RED EYES glowing...
                                                            (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          TERMINATOR'S POV - RED FILTER, MARCUS' FORM is TARGETED.
          READ-OUTS on the side, the HIGHLIGHTED WORDS "NON-ORGANIC -
          DO NOT TERMINATE."
          
          THE TERMINATOR turns from MARCUS, no longer interested,
          moving off on its preprogrammed patrol.
          
          MARCUS moves up a sloping, CONCRETE EMBANKMENT.   At the top
          of the rise, he sees, spread out before him--
          
          
          EXT.   SKYNET TERRITORY - DAY
          
          --a hideous industrial sprawl, OPEN GAS FLAMES, SMOKING
          FACTORIES, rumbling VEHICLES, H-Ks, TERMINATOR TROOPS on
          patrol. Nothing green, a GREY HAZE hangs over the landscape.
          
          After a moment, MARCUS shakes his head and gamely soldiers
          on, moving along the edge of the elevated embankment.
          
          
          EXT.   SKYNET PERIPHERY - DAY
          
          MARCUS moves past banks of ANTI-AIRCRAFT guns and MISSILE
          LAUNCHERS, interspersed with slowly rotating RADAR TRACKING
          DISHES-- the first line of defense. From this fortress-like
          wall he descends into the nightmarish environment beyond.
          
          MARCUS reacts to a CAWING SOUND above, looks up to see--
          
          --A CROW perching on an overhead WIRE.   A second later--
          
          ZAP! A BLUE PLASMA PULSE blasts the thing to smithereens, a
          few BLACK FEATHERS drift down as--
          
          --a T-400 (same mask-like face we saw earlier) lowers its
          plasma weapon and strolls on. Target practice.
          
          MARCUS stays out of the way of the TERMINATOR LEGIONS
          patrolling near the riverside.
          
          
          EXT.   DEMOLITION SITE - DAY
          
          MARCUS heads inland, past the ruins of a CHURCH-- WALLS with
          the remains of stained glass WINDOWS, STATUES OF SAINTS.
          Hearing RUMBLING NOISES, Marcus hurries out of the way as--
          
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          A WALL collapses, pushed down by an automated SKYNET
          BULLDOZER. This gigantic, self-operated construction machine
          has a swivelling CAMERA HEAD instead of a cab. Its giant
          TREADS roll over the STONE STATUES, crushing them to dust.
          
          
          EXT.   CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY
          
          MARCUS keeps moving into Skynet's turf. The demolition gives
          way to massive CONSTRUCTION, as the robots remake the human
          world in their own image.
          
          CONSTRUCTION ROBOTS erect a low-slung STEEL FRAME structure,
          automated CRANES and SUPPLY TRUCKS about. These robots are
          oversized versions of the steel terminators we know, but with
          multiple limbs bearing WELDING TOOLS, and TREADS instead of
          legs. Marcus watches as BEAMS are quickly welded into place
          by telescoping steel arms.
          
          
          EXT.   SKYNET STREET - DAY
          
          MARCUS continues into the completed robot city. Skynet's
          ARCHITECTURE is featureless, bland, purely practical: single-
          story, windowless CONCRETE or STEEL structures with massive
          open DOORWAYS to accommodate their largest machines. A RED
          GLOW emanates from the interiors, the robots' preferred
          lighting scheme. No sidewalks or signs, just thick GRIDS of
          POWER LINES and PIPES overhead. Constant NOISE of BUZZING
          POWER, RATTLING MACHINES, etc.
          
          MARCUS steps inside one of these buildings--
          
          
          INT.   TERMINATOR FACTORY - DAY
          
          This TERMINATOR ASSEMBLY PLANT is an intricate, multi-leveled
          clockwork maze of moving CONVEYORS and INDUSTRIAL ROBOTICS.
          
          ELECTRONICS and HYDRAULICS are ROBOTICALLY SOLDERED in place.
          STEEL PRESSES stamp out TERMINATOR PARTS-- TORSOS, FACE
          PLATES, SPINAL COLUMNS, LIMBS.
          
          Partially-completed PARTS are moved by CONVEYOR to ASSEMBLY
          STATIONS, where LIMBS and HEADS are JOINED to TORSOS,
          elaborate OPERATIONS carried out by INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS, like
          the ones in present-day factories.
          
          
                                                            (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                          71.
          CONTINUED:
          
          SYNTHETIC SKIN is SPRAYED OVER a METAL ENDOSKELETON in
          precise amounts, building up to create human features... this
          is a T-400.
          
          An INDUSTRIAL ROBOT ARM picks up a CPU from a DRY-ICE
          CONTAINER. The CPU features the distinctive, linked
          rectangles familiar from the earlier films. The arm lifts
          this gingerly to a TERMINATOR SKELETON and INSERTS IT into
          the STEEL SKULL, SCREWING A SEAL over the hole.
          
          THE RED EYES flicker to life, and THE ARMATURE releases the
          TERMINATOR, which moves away under its own power. It removes
          a PLASMA WEAPON from a WALL RACK, moving past--
          
          --the dumbfounded MARCUS.
          
          THE TERMINATOR joins a dozen identical robots, who ride on a
          treaded SKYNET TANK with a PLASMA CANNON and FLAMETHROWER.
          There are numerous TANKS here, awaiting deployment.
          
          
          EXT.   SKYNET STREET - DAY
          
          Rounding a corner on a straight, narrow street, MARCUS sees
          all the ROBOTS and SMALL VEHICLES clearing into small NICHES
          built into the walls on either side, as if clearing a path
          for him. It takes him a moment to realize it's not him
          they're responding to-- a RUMBLE BUILDS...
          
          A convoy of GIGANTIC SKYNET TRUCKS-- a half-dozen modified
          SEMIS now driven by CPUS-- bear down on MARCUS at extremely
          high speed. They carry construction supplies: massive STEEL
          BEAMS, CONCRETE PIPES, etc. And there's barely inches of
          clearance on either side.
          
          These things aren't slowing down. There's nowhere for Marcus
          to duck out of the way. He has no choice but to RUN, as fast
          as he can, the lead vehicle gaining on him rapidly.
          
          MARCUS THROWS HIMSELF to the concrete in the middle of the
          street, pressing his body flat as the LEAD TRUCK passes over
          him, the wheels missing him by inches.
          
          But he has only a moment's respite. THE NEXT TRUCK has a
          lower undercarriage, a steel CROSSMEMBER catches his back--
          
          --and DRAGS MARCUS beneath the vehicle, ripping off chunks of
          flesh.
          
                                                            (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          Marcus CRIES OUT, crawls ahead and clings to a forward
          portion of the undercarriage, keeping himself just above the
          pavement. His LEFT LEG, twisted and damaged, still drags on
          the asphalt, throwing up SPARKS.
          
          OVERHEAD ANGLE ON THE TRUCK - CAMERA PULLS BACK straight
          above the MOVING VEHICLE, amidst the convoy speeding down
          this sunken artery. CAMERA KEEPS MOVING UPWARD to reveal an
          AERIAL VIEW of Skynet's city. Seen from above, the
          rectilinear STRUCTURES, criss-crossing POWER LINES and
          SPEEDING VEHICLES strongly resemble a PULSING CIRCUIT BOARD.
          
                                                               CUT TO:
          
          
          INT.   COMMAND CENTER/CORRIDOR - DAY
          
          JOHN CONNOR moves grimly down a narrow, steel passageway,
          FOOTSTEPS ECHOING. He reaches the MP, outside the door.
          
                                 CONNOR
                       I need to talk to the prisoner.
          
          The MP looks a little surprised, but says nothing.    He undoes
          the LATCH on the door and opens it for Connor.
          
          
          INT.   COMMAND CENTER/INTERROGATION CELL - DAY
          
          A bare, windowless space with only a cot, a metal chair and a
          bedpan. BLAIR looks up, bleary-eyed, exhausted and scared.
          CONNOR gestures for the MP to close the door behind him.
          
                                 CONNOR
                       Lieutenant Williams. I'm sorry
                       about the way you've been treated,
                       but we're forced to take every
                       precaution. I'm John Connor.
          
          Blair's mighty impressed, in spite of the circumstances.       She
          leaps to her feet, stands at attention and salutes.
          
                                  BLAIR
                       Sir.
          
                                  CONNOR
                       At ease.   Please, sit.
          
          
                                                               (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          CONNOR pulls up the chair, close to Blair, who sits on the
          bed. His tone is careful, controlled.
          
                                  CONNOR (cont'd)
                       I've gone over your record,
                       lieutenant. You're a good soldier,
                       flown a lot of missions...
                           (BEAT)
                       Why in God's name would you help a
                       terminator escape?
          
                                 BLAIR
                       Sir-- he isn't a terminator.     He's
                       human.
          
                                  CONNOR
                       We know he's crossed into Skynet
                       territory, why would he do that if
                       he isn't--
          
                                 BLAIR
                       He's trying to find his friends.
          
                                 CONNOR
                       What friends?
          
                                 BLAIR
                       A couple of kids. They were taken
                       in a Skynet transport, probably to
                       some kind of prison camp-- he said
                       their names were Star and Kyle.
          
          Connor blinks at this, alert.
          
                                    CONNOR
                       Kyle.
          
          Blair picks up on his interest, but doesn't understand it.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       Mm... Kyle something.    With an `R.'
          
                                    CONNOR
                       Reese.
          
                                    BLAIR
                       That's it.     How did you...?

          CONNOR is already on his feet, BANGING on the door-- the MP
          unlatches it to let him out--
          
          
          INT.   COMMAND CENTER/CORRIDOR - DAY
          
          Partway down the hallway, CONNOR encounters KATE, who walks
          with him, takes in his expression.
          
                               KATE
                     What is it, John?
          
                               CONNOR
                     I always knew I'd have to find him
                     someday. I just didn't know how.
          
                                KATE
                     What?   Find who?
          
                                  CONNOR
                     My father.

          INT.   LABORATORY - DAY
          
          START CLOSE on KYLE'S HAND, clutching STAR'S tightly.   We
          hear them SINGING faintly, together:
          
                               KYLE AND STAR
                     Twinkle, twinkle, little star...
          
          WIDER, their heads, feet and chests are clamped onto SLIDING
          TRAYS, a long row of these hold OTHER PRISONERS as well.
          Kyle and Star must reach across a gap between the trays to
          hold hands. (It's the first time we've seen her hatless.)
          
          The trays are all poised before panel-covered SEMI-CIRCULAR
          OPENINGS built into the wall, in a sterile, hospital-like
          environment. Above each opening is a MONITOR SCREEN. An
          ominous HUM is building.
          
          IN AN ADJACENT OPERATING THEATER, visible through GLASS
          WALLS, MEDICAL LASERS mounted on ROBOTIC ARMS work on
          anesthetized patients (we needn't see the grisly details).
          
          BEHIND STAR and KYLE, the PANELS OPEN, the trays slowly SLIDE
          into the OPENINGS. SCREAMS and SOBS from other prisoners.

                                 KYLE
                       Shh, keep singing.
          
          Kyle and Star hold hands for as long as possible, then
          release their grip as their bodies enter the chambers and the
          panels slide shut.
          
          
          INT.   STAR'S TESTING CHAMBER - DAY
          
          Immobilized in this small, tubular chamber, like an MRI, STAR
          closes her eyes as she's bathed in BRIGHT LIGHT, LASER GRIDS
          projecting over her skull. The HUMMING is LOUDER.
          
                                 STAR
                       Up above the world so high, like a
                       diamond in the sky...
          
          
          INT.   KYLE'S TESTING CHAMBER - DAY
          
          The same thing is happening to Kyle.    He's no longer singing.
          
                                 KYLE
                       Stop it stop it STOP IT!

          EXT.   SKYNET HIGHWAY - DAY
          
          WITH MARCUS beneath the truck. He's moved to the edge of the
          chassis, near a WHEEL, moving slowly, carefully. There's a
          bit more clearance at the sides of the sunken highway now,
          but they're still moving awfully fast.
          
          THE WHEEL TURNS, the vehicle suddenly SLOWS to negotiate a
          turn, braking downhill. Marcus seizes this opportunity.
          
          ANOTHER ANGLE as MARCUS LAUNCHES himself from below the
          vehicle, rolling into the GAP between the convoy and the
          concrete wall. The remaining vehicles RUMBLE PAST, as MARCUS
          presses himself against the wall.
          
          
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          When they're gone, he gets to his feet, limping down the
          highway on foot for a short distance, dragging his damaged
          leg behind him. He hears ANOTHER CONVOY approaching.
          
          Just in time, he finds a SEAM in the poured concrete, it's
          enough to give him purchase-- he struggles to climb up the
          eight feet of freeway wall.
          
          MARCUS makes it over the top, TRUCKS RUMBLING past below.
          This is desolate, hilly country.
          
          ANGLE DOWN - among the vehicles below is a CONTAINER, like
          the one that held Kyle and Star. We glimpse the anguished
          FACES and REACHING HANDS of CAPTIVES within.
          
          MARCUS reacts, moves as fast as he can alongside the trucks
          for a short distance until--
          
          THE VEHICLES shoot ahead around a curve and out of sight.      In
          the distance is a COMPLEX OF BUILDINGS, clearly the
          destination.
          
          Marcus begins moving along the edge of the freeway, heading
          for the complex. He reaches the edge of a plateau, looks
          down, his expression changing. This is the last thing he
          expected to see. CAMERA MOVES to reveal--
          
          
          EXT.   COASTAL VALLEY - DAY
          
          --a panoramic view of a GORGEOUS COASTAL COMMUNITY. The
          place is lush, green, with well-maintained, lovely HOMES in
          the distance, a BLUE SEA beyond. The complex of buildings
          stands a few miles away, at the far end of the valley.
          
          MARCUS, amazed, limps down a gentle slope leading to this
          seeming paradise.
          
          
          EXT.   GOLF COURSE - DAY
          
          MARCUS emerges from a small stand of trees and finds himself
          looking at a groomed FAIRWAY. Marcus hears a NOISE nearby--
          
          --a GOLF BALL bouncing on the ground not far away.    MARCUS
          turns in the direction it came from.

          CONTINUED:
          
          An electric GOLF CART approaches, driven by a handsome,
          middle-aged golfer-- JEREMY-- who wears casual country club
          attire, eating from a clear BAG OF TRAIL MIX. Jeremy comes
          to a stop beside Marcus.
          
                                 JEREMY
                       Are you all right?
          
          Marcus slowly shakes his head, as Jeremy climbs out of the
          cart, looking him over carefully, taking in the exposed metal
          at his shoulder and leg.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       What the hell is this?
          
                                 JEREMY
                       You look like you've been hit by a truck--
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Among other things. Look, I'm
                       trying to find some friends-- a
                       couple of kids. They were taken
                       here, I saw some buildings--
          
          JEREMY eyes him, a little surprised at his ignorance.
          
                                 JEREMY
                       The facility, sure.   Hop in, I'll
                       take you there.
          
          Marcus hesitates a beat, can he trust this guy? But Jeremy
          simply seems eager to help, as he guides him to the passenger
          seat, then gets behind the wheel. With a smile:
          
                                 JEREMY (cont'd)
                       This round was gonna blow my
                       handicap anyway. I'm Jeremy.
          
          He extends a hand.     After a beat, Marcus reaches toward it--
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Marcus.
          
          Jeremy clutches Marcus' hand tightly.     Marcus blinks, Jeremy
          cocks his head, then lets go.

                     I can't connect with you at all...
                     your interface must've been
                     damaged. Don't worry, soon they'll
                     have you as good as new.
          
          With that, he hits the gas.
          
          
          EXT.   RESIDENTIAL STREET - EVENING
          
          JEREMY drives the cart down the road, past well-kept homes
          with generous lawns-- it's a beautiful, upscale community at
          MAGIC HOUR. BICYCLISTS and FUTURISTIC CARS pass, Jeremy
          waves to NEIGHBORS. Marcus takes it all in with disbelief.
          
                               MARCUS
                     I didn't think there was-- anything
                     like this left... anywhere.
          
                                JEREMY
                     Yes.   We're very lucky.   Want some?
          
          He holds the plastic bag out to Marcus, who obligingly takes
          a handful of trail mix, pops it in his mouth. After a beat,
          he spits it back out in his hand, stares at it.
          
                               MARCUS
                     This isn't food.
          
                               JEREMY
                     Well, of course not. Seems you got
                     a little memory loss going on.
          
          Marcus stares at him, confused. Jeremy is starting to
          realize just how out of it he is, speaks as if to a child.
          
                                JEREMY (cont'd)
                     It's a foam resin. It can taste like
                     anything you want it to-- but of
                     course, we don't really need to eat.
                         (BEAT)
                     Our brains are powered by fuel cells,
                     remember?
          
          Marcus just stares, Jeremy gestures at the world around them.

                       We're in a transitional phase.
                       Most of us need the comfort of the
                       familiar a little while longer--
                       food, shelter, sex. Until we
                       forget the old life.
          
          As he speaks, he notices his BAG is nearly empty. He
          casually lifts his sport shirt and CLICKS OPEN a PANEL
          beneath his rib cage. We glimpse CIRCUITS, FIBER-OPTICS.
          
                                 JEREMY (cont'd)
                       Eating-- well, chewing-- it's one of
                       the hardest habits to break... but
                       before long, none of this will be
                       necessary. We won't even need these
                       bodies.
          
          From within he removes an identical BAG FILLED with TRAIL MIX
          (the stuff he just ate), and replaces it with the empty bag.
          He clicks the panel shut again, pops a NUT in his mouth.
          
          Marcus stares at this, appalled, then blinks and looks away.
          He reacts to the sound of PIANO MUSIC, a difficult piece
          being played expertly-- PASSING a PICTURE WINDOW, he sees a
          PIANIST practicing.
          
          In front of this home, a GARDENER and WINDOW WASHER are hard
          at work. They're both T-400s, with the eerie mask-like
          faces. Marcus reacts.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Terminators!
          
          Jeremy winces, as if at a racial epithet. He's starting to
          regret giving Marcus a lift, his manner is careful, as if
          he'd picked up some homeless guy.

                       We don't call them that here.
          
          Marcus grabs Jeremy, who pulls back a bit, alarmed.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       What are you?
          
                                   JEREMY
                       A hybrid.    The same as you.

                               MARCUS
                     A hybrid-- human and machine?
          
                               JEREMY
                     Of course. That's what this community
                     is for-- people like us.
          
                               MARCUS
                     Jesus... why?
          
                               JEREMY
                     You should be grateful to have been
                     chosen.
          
                               MARCUS
                     What about the ones who weren't?
          
                               JEREMY
                     You mean like Janet and the kids.
          
          For a moment, Jeremy's expression darkens.     Then he shuts his
          eyes, and his features relax.
          
                               MARCUS
                     Your family. You lost them?
          
          Jeremy nods and SMILES, looking at him once more.
          
                               MARCUS (cont'd)
                     Why are you smiling?
          
                               JEREMY
                     `Cause I feel good. The interface
                     recognizes negative emotions-- rage,
                     grief, despair-- and stimulates
                     positive endorphins in response. Thank
                     God, life would be pretty unbearable
                     otherwise, don't you think?
          
          
          EXT.   PARK - DUSK
          
          They've left the main street now, driving down a WOODED PATH
          leading to the "facility." There are lawns, fountains, etc.
          Marcus SLAMS ON the brakes, then clutches Jeremy by the
          throat-- the man looks more annoyed than frightened.

                       people get here?
          
                                 JEREMY
                       Most of us worked at NASA or DARPA.
                       I was an engineer on Project Angel--
          
          Marcus drags the man from the cart by his throat, squeezing
          harder.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Angel-- what is it?

                       You can stop choking me, it's not
                       like I need to breathe.
          
          Marcus releases him, but remains in his face.       Jeremy takes a
          moment to recover his composure.

                       We replaced the body's hydrocarbons
                       with plastinated compounds while
                       maintaining cellular structure--
                       analog neural impulses were converted
                       to wireless digital signals,
                       controlling the micro-tech chassis--

                       The goal was a superior support
                       system for the human brain-- to go
                       anywhere, do anything-- explore
                       deep space, the bottom of the sea.
                       I specialized in optics.
          
          He taps his own eye with an audible CLICK, not flinching.
          Marcus takes a couple steps away, looking at his own hands.
          
          Jeremy points to nearby BUILDINGS, a little peevish.

                     The facility is just ahead. I'll
                     let them know you're coming.
          
          So saying, he's back in the cart, pulling away in a hurry.   A
          moment later, Marcus moves off amongst the trees.
          
          Nearing the complex, Marcus reacts to BIRDSONG above.   He
          looks up, stops as he sees--
          
          --a TINY SPEAKER, concealed amongst the LEAVES.
          
          MARCUS moves to this tree, touches it-- the bark feels
          unnatural. He RAPS it with his FIST-- it sounds hollow, made
          of FIBERGLAS. He fingers a LEAF, tries to bend it-- PLASTIC.
          
          He crouches, studying the GRASS. After a moment, he finds a
          SEAM in the pristine lawn. He starts to peel it up... it's
          ASTROTURF. Beneath it is SANDY DIRT.
          
          Marcus KEEPS PEELING the plastic covering back... more dirt--
          and BITS OF BONE. As he continues to uncover the ground we
          see recognizable CHUNKS of SKULLS, LEGBONES, etc.
          
          By now he's rolled back a few square yards, numb with horror.
          Marcus moves on toward the complex with new determination,
          trying to stay out of sight.

          ON THE MONITORS above the long row of chambers-- colorful 3-D
          IMAGES of the prisoner's BRAINS are being constructed, like
          PET scans. DENSE DIGITAL READ-OUTS BELOW, as data is
          analyzed. (Levels of seratonin, endorphins, etc.) Beside
          these are BARCODES and small INSET PHOTOS taken within the
          chamber, the subjects looking frightened.
          
          IN THE OPERATING THEATER, the LASERS are still now, their
          grisly work done for the moment, awaiting the next batch.
          
          An ENGINEER, a nice-looking, well-built young man in loose
          black clothing, moves down the row of chambers, studying
          results. He speaks into a subtle HEAD-SET:

                       32580 - eh, this one shouldn't have
                       even been brought here...
          
          As he speaks, the BARCODES on the monitors in question turn
          either RED or GREEN in response to his judgments.
          
          He reaches KYLE'S CHAMBER, we see Kyle's anguished FACE on
          the monitor photograph.

          On STAR'S MONITOR-- RED BARCODE.
          
          The engineer KICKS something on the floor, bends down to pick
          it up-- STAR'S BASEBALL CAP. He flings it expertly into--
          
          --a nearby TRASH RECEPTACLE.

          He sets his jaw, removes something from his pocket, fiddles
          with it and places it carefully in the bushes. He moves on.
          
          Nearing an entrance, he hears a familiar voice from nearby.
          
                                 SERENA

          SERENA takes in his anger, adopts a regretful tone.
          
                                 SERENA
                       There was no choice-- the old
                       civilization had to be eliminated.
                       To make way for a new world... a
                       world without death or suffering.
          
          SERENA puts her arms around him. He doesn't return the
          embrace, but he doesn't resist her.

                       You were the first... I'm sorry.
          
          So saying, she presses a small, taser-like device at the base
          of his skull-- ZAP! MARCUS SPASMS and goes limp in her arms.
          SERENA lets him down gently on the ground.

                       All to find one teenage boy...?
                       John, you really think this can work?

                       must have worked. We will find him.
          
          He turns back to the OTHERS, holding their gaze.

          EXT.   UNDERWATER - NIGHT
          
          We see now that Connor's on board a NUCLEAR ATTACK SUB, with
          TWO MORE SUBS moving in tandem behind it.
          
          HOLD ON the LEAD SUB and MOVE IN ON the STENCILLED NAME as it
          PASSES CAMERA: "LOS ANGELES SSN-688."

          START ON MARCUS' DAMAGED LEG. It has been DETACHED from his
          body, halfway down the thigh. Elaborate CIRCUITS are
          exposed, as SURGICAL MACHINES perform repairs with LASERS,
          MECHANICAL ARMS replacing damaged parts.
          
          NEARBY, MARCUS opens his eyes, coming to. He's CLAMPED onto
          an elaborate, mobile SURGICAL TABLE, the stump exposed. His
          body and head are secured within its framework. MORE
          MACHINES swiftly repair the damage to his chest and shoulder.
          
          MARCUS twitches, freaking out, struggling in his bonds--
          
          THE DETACHED LEG twitches as well.
          
                                 SERENA
                       Calm down, Marcus.   It's all right.
          
          SERENA is on the other side of a GLASS PANEL, operating
          computer controls. This is an automated surgical
          environment, the work on Marcus carried out by various
          MACHINES and MICROTOOLS-- busy HYDRAULIC ARMS, LASERS, etc.

                       Listen to me. Skynet was designed to
                       detect threats, make projections and
                       implement solutions. As soon as it
                       came on line, it factored in war,
                       disease, environmental destruction--
                       and calculated a high probability of
                       total human extinction within two
                       hundred years. The human race was
                       doomed... unless we were transformed.
          
          THE SURGICAL TABLE swivels, bringing MARCUS into alignment
          with the repaired leg. In moments it's reattached, the
          plastic skin thermosealed at the joint.
          
                                 MARCUS

                       Skynet had access to the entire
                       defense web-- including Project
                       Angel. It determined hybrids were
                       the only path to salvation.

          THE LASER TOOLS and HYDRAULIC ARMS now move on their ceiling
          racks, coming close to MARCUS' FACE. The TABLE INVERTS,
          exposing the back of his head.

                     you with us, but we thought you
                     were in a permanent coma...
          
          THE LASERS start cutting into the back of Marcus' head,
          BURNING through the plastic SKIN. MARCUS lets out a CRY of
          rage, strains at his bonds.

          INT.   NEURAL NET CHAMBER - NIGHT
          
          CAMERA MOVES over TUBES and FIBER-OPTIC CABLES, which run
          into multiple GLASS CYLINDERS filled with translucent PINK
          LIQUID. These contain HUMAN BRAINS... there are hundreds of
          them hooked up in here.
          
                               SERENA
                     A boy and a girl-- in the last day
                     or two?
          
                               MARCUS
                     Yes... what is this place?
          
                               SERENA
                     Part of the neural net-- human minds
                     linked directly with artificial
                     intelligence. The processing power
                     of the human brain is still beyond
                     anything Skynet can manufacture.
          
          SERENA has moved to a COMPUTER TERMINAL, one of a few here.
          
                               SERENA (cont'd)
                     Display recent arrivals for processing.
          
          IMAGES begin to appear on the screen-- small inset PHOTOS,
          each with a BARCODE. They quickly fill the screen. MARCUS
          leans forward, squinting.
          
          ON SCREEN - dozens of FACES, PHOTOS taken inside the TUBES,
          mostly looking terrified.
          
          MARCUS shakes his head.

          ON SCREEN - a new SET OF FACES appears one by one on the
          screen. This time, STAR and KYLE are among them, next to
          each other.
          
                               MARCUS
                     That's them.
          
          MARCUS touches the screen, two fingers, one on each of the
          kid's faces. THEIR IMAGES expand to fill the screen, side by
          side, KYLE on the left.

          KYLE'S IMAGE, the date 10.16.18... the time, 22:19:23.      The
          word, in green: PROCESSED.
          
          SERENA smiles.
          
                                 SERENA
                       Good news. He'll soon be part of
                       the network-- you'll be able to
                       connect with him.
          
          Move to STAR'S IMAGE.       10.15.18... 22:20:49... and the word,
          in red: TERMINATED.
          
                                 SERENA (cont'd)
                       I'm sorry about the girl, Marcus.
                       She didn't suffer.
          
          Marcus takes this in, his face shows pain. Then SERENA
          grasps his hand-- in moments, he's smiling.
          
                                    MARCUS
                       Of course.     I... I understand.
          
          Suddenly the building SHAKES, the sound of a distant
          EXPLOSION. SERENA releases MARCUS, listens in her earpiece.
          
                                 MARCUS (cont'd)
                       What is it?
          
                                 SERENA
                       I don't know-- I have to go.    Will
                       you be all right?
                           (off his smile and nod)
                       Of course you will.
          
          She touches him once more and moves off, leaving him alone
          here. We'll hear other far off EXPLOSIONS from time to time
          during the following. MARCUS stares at--
          
          HIS FRIENDS' FACES, which slowly FADE TO BLACK, replaced by
          his own REFLECTION. Seeing his own face, his smile vanishes.
          
          MARCUS is going through a terrible internal struggle, the
          interface fighting his own natural emotions. He backs away
          from the machine, looks around at the brains, all the lives
          destroyed.
          
          Hurrying past the wall of brains, he moves a hand to the base
          of his skull... with an ANGRY CRY--
                                                                 (CONTINUED)

          --his FINGERS dig into the plastic skin at the back of his
          HEAD--
          
          MARCUS grits his teeth, this is incredibly hard to do, but--
          
          --he RIPS THE INTERFACE MODULE from his skull-- CONNECTIONS
          SPARK, we glimpse STEEL SKULL and the encased BRAIN beneath.
          
          MARCUS hurls the DEVICE to the floor, its elaborate CIRCUITRY
          SHATTERS. He reels with momentary anguish at what he's just
          given up-- then he moves out of there with determination.
          
          
          EXT.   OFFICE PARK FACILITY - NIGHT
          
          FIRE and SMOKE in the distance, VEHICLES MOVING fast amidst
          the destruction. It looks like the place is under attack.
          
          MARCUS moves purposefully across the campus-- suddenly
          HEADLIGHTS illuminate him. He dives out of the way as--
          
          A FUTURISTIC ATV roars past at high speed.   It's followed
          moments later by a massive SKYNET TANK.
          
          MARCUS scrambles to his feet, continues on his way.
          
          
          INT.   TIME DISPLACEMENT CHAMBER - NIGHT
          
          THE PHYSICIST is SLAMMED against a wall. He never loses his
          unperturbed expression as MARCUS manhandles him. THE CLOCK
          reads 01:05.
          
                               MARCUS
                     I need to go back!
          
                               PHYSICIST
                     The wormholing fluctuates, right
                     now it's oscillating between three
                     and six hours--
          
                               MARCUS
                     What do I do?
          
                               PHYSICIST
                     Just breach the sphere. But you
                     could materialize anywhere in a
                     mile radius--

          CONTINUED:
          
          MARCUS tosses the man aside, regards the GLOWING, CRACKLING
          TIME SPHERE-- it doesn't look too inviting.
          
          THE DOOR bursts open. SKELETAL TERMINATORS storm in,
          wielding PLASMA RIFLES-- they mean business--
          
          THE PHYSICIST finally looks alarmed, getting in front of
          MARCUS as he yells--
          
                                 PHYSICIST (cont'd)
                       No, don't shoot in here--!
          
          A TERMINATOR FIRES anyway, BLOWING A HUGE HOLE through the
          center of the Physicist's chest and throwing him backward to
          the floor-- the man looks down and shakes his head at the
          damage to his plastinated body.
          
                                 PHYSICIST (cont'd)
                       Idiots.
          
          A SECOND TERMINATOR spins his weapon on--
          
          --MARCUS, who LEAPS into the center of the sphere just as THE
          ROBOT FIRES and HITS nearby MACHINERY which EXPLODES--
          
          ENERGY ERUPTS around MARCUS, the CRACKLING BLUE LIGHT of the
          time sphere surrounds him. We experience this from--
          
          --INSIDE THE SPHERE. Marcus instinctively crouches in a
          FETAL POSITION. An instant later, his CLOTHING BURNS OFF HIS
          FLESH. The HIGH TECH ENVIRONMENT around him TRANSFORMS into--
          
          
          EXT.   PARK - DUSK
          
          STAY WITH MARCUS-- FOLIAGE APPEARS around the SPHERE. The
          BLUE ENERGY fades, leaving him naked, 20 FEET IN THE AIR--
          
          MARCUS PLUNGES to the ground and rolls.     He looks up--
          
          THE PLASTIC TREE has been melted with the heat like a candle,
          DRIPPING down around him.
          
          MARCUS tries to get his bearings-- he's in the park area, the
          FACILITY not too far off. He moves in that direction.
          
                                                                          96.
          
          
          EXT.   OFFICE PARK FACILITY - NIGHT
          
          THE GATE to the garage OPENS, an empty HUMAN TRANSPORT
          emerges... FIND MARCUS, concealed, still unclothed. He dives
          under the GATE as it rolls shut.
          
          
          INT.   UNDERGROUND GARAGE - NIGHT
          
          MARCUS moves stealthily through the space where the prisoners
          were off-loaded, keeping out of sight behind parked vehicles.
          He starts at the sight of--
          
          THE CONTROL ROBOTS, hooked to CHARGING POSTS along one wall.
          
          MARCUS makes his way to the GLASS DOORS.   Using all his
          strength, he manages to PRY THEM OPEN.
          
          
          INT.   LABORATORY - NIGHT
          
          The ENGINEER as we saw him before, consulting the MONITORS
          above the CHAMBERS.
          
                               ENGINEER
                     32581 looks good... 32582... hm,
                     borderline. May not be emotionally
                     compatible. Pass.
          
          The engineer picks up STAR'S BASEBALL CAP and flings it into
          the TRASH...
          
          Just then he hears SHATTERING GLASS behind him.   He spins--
          
          MARCUS trains a ripped-off ROBOTIC LASER ARM at him like a
          weapon. The arm trails heavy CABLES and CIRCUITS, linking it
          to the operating theater we saw earlier. (These also
          artfully conceal Marcus' nakedness.)
          
                               MARCUS
                     Let them go.
          
                                ENGINEER
                     What?   Who are you?
          
          MARCUS takes a step closer.
          
                               MARCUS
                     I said, let them go!

          CONTINUED:
          
          THE ENGINEER moves to a RED ALARM BUTTON on a COMMUNICATION
          PANEL mounted in the wall, extending a hand--
          
          MARCUS connects two wires to FIRE UP the LASER and--
          
          A RED BEAM neatly SEVERS the ENGINEER'S HAND at his WRIST.
          
          THE ENGINEER studies the metal STUMP of his severed hand with
          a blank expression.
          
                                 ENGINEER
                       You can't hurt me.
          
          The ENGINEER smirks and WHACKS the ALARM BUTTON with his
          other hand. An ELECTRONIC KLAXON sounds.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Now you're pissing me off.
          
          MARCUS FIRES OFF THE LASER again--
          
          --THE ENGINEER stares at him-- we see a flaming STRIP in the
          wall behind his head. He takes a step toward Marcus and--
          
          --his HEAD TUMBLES OFF, bounces on the ground, and rolls to
          MARCUS' FEET. (There's no blood, just laser-severed
          electronic connections).
          
          MARCUS picks up the ENGINEER'S HEAD by the hair.   The man's
          brain is unharmed.
          
                                 MARCUS (cont'd)
                       How'd that feel?
          
          THE MAN'S MOUTH twists and grimaces, making ELECTRONIC STATIC
          from the FRIED VOICEBOX. MARCUS is taken by surprise when--
          
          --THE DECAPITATED BODY lunges at him, knocks the LASER from
          his grasp. After a brief STRUGGLE, MARCUS spins the
          engineer's HEAD to face his body. He grabs the INTERFACE at
          the base of his neck.
          
                                 MARCUS (cont'd)
                       I pull this off and you'll be in a
                       world of pain!
          
          THE ENGINEER'S FACE suddenly shows fear-- his body FREEZES.

          AT A CONTROL TERMINAL, the one-handed, headless BODY taps
          keys and controls. MARCUS holds the Engineer's HEAD so that
          he can see over his own shoulder. Moments later--
          
          --the MACHINE HUM winds down. THE MONITORS flash the word
          "ABORT," the PANELS begin to OPEN.
          
          MARCUS addresses the HEAD in his hand.
          
                              MARCUS (cont'd)
                    I'm gonna need your clothes.
          
          THE HEADLESS BODY begins to unbutton its shirt.
          
          MOMENTS LATER - CLOSE as KYLE'S TRAY slides out of his
          CHAMBER. The RESTRAINTS retract automatically. He sits up,
          looking toward--
          
          --STAR, on the next tray.   She hasn't moved, her eyes closed.
          
                              KYLE
                    No!
          
          He climbs off his tray, takes her in his arms.    She starts
          awake.
          
                              STAR
                    What?
          
          Around them, the dozen OTHER PRISONERS are getting to their
          feet, surprised at their sudden freedom.
          
          MARCUS approaches KYLE, buttoning his new shirt.
          
                              KYLE
                    Marcus!
          
          The two kids hurry to him, Marcus hands Star her BASEBALL
          CAP, rescued from the trash. As she puts it on:
          
                              STAR
                    I knew you'd come.
          
          THE PRISONERS are already on the move, frantically dashing
          out of the lab ahead of our heros.

                               MARCUS
                     We've gotta get out of here.
          
          He leads the kids out the way he came, passing...
          
          THE ENGINEER, in underwear, sitting in a corner, cradling his
          head in his lap. His remaining hand strokes his interface,
          his eyes closed in a blissful expression.
          
          
          INT.   UNDERGROUND GARAGE - NIGHT
          
          THE PRISONERS smash the GLASS DOORS off their hinges, and
          charge past--
          
          THE CONTROL ROBOTS, which are now coming to life. ELECTRIC
          BURSTS drop a couple of slow-moving ESCAPEES as they dash
          into the garage and make for--
          
          --ANY AVAILABLE VEHICLE. Former PRISONERS hijack BUSES,
          HYDROGEN CARS. Pure chaos, it feels like a prison riot.
          
          MARCUS, STAR and KYLE weave amidst the robots and humans.
          
                                  MARCUS
                     Stay down!
          
          KYLE and STAR take cover behind a concrete post just as--
          
          --PLASMA BURSTS explode around them.
          
          SKELETAL TERMINATORS armed with PLASMA RIFLES are pouring in
          through the OPENING GARAGE GATE.
          
          A STOLEN BUS heads for the exit, KNOCKING a couple of
          TERMINATORS aside and SMASHING through the rising GATE,
          clearing a path for others to follow.
          
          A SKELETAL TERMINATOR sets its sights on a MOVING HYDROGEN
          CAR, which follows the bus--
          
          TERMINATOR POV - RED FILTER, HIGHLIGHTING BULL, the DRIVER.
          "TARGET ACQUIRED - TERMINATE."
          
          THE TERMINATOR SHOOTS HIS RIFLE through the car's windshield--
          it EXPLODES, close to KYLE and STAR, the building SHAKES.
          
          
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          KYLE and STAR flee the flames, THE TERMINATOR'S HEAD swivels
          quickly, taking them in. It starts to pursue, but MARCUS
          gets in front of it. Before it can fire--
          
                                 MARCUS (cont'd)
                       It's OK, I'm not human!
          
          The Terminator pauses, looks him over.
          
          TERMINATOR POV - MARCUS is quickly scanned, comes up "NON-
          ORGANIC - DO NOT TERMINATE."
          
          THE   TERMINATOR starts to move past Marcus, who LEAPS on it
          and   WRENCHES THE RIFLE from its grasp. As the robot spins on
          him   he BLOWS ITS HEAD OFF, then looks around frantically for
          the   kids. A moment later--
          
          --KYLE ROARS up at the controls of a futuristic ATV, STAR
          clinging to him.
          
                                 MARCUS (cont'd)
                       You can't drive!
          
                                   KYLE
                       Watch me!
          
          No time to argue, MARCUS leaps into the back beside STAR and
          KYLE GUNS IT out of there, careening off walls and other
          vehicles, he's still not much of a driver. MARCUS meanwhile
          PICKS OFF potential threats with the PLASMA RIFLE.
          
          
          EXT.   OFFICE PARK FACILITY - NIGHT
          
          KYLE has to swerve to avoid the stolen BUS, which is now on
          its side, IN FLAMES. It was taken out by--
          
          --an automated SKYNET TANK, one of THREE TANKS here. They're
          positioned to take out escaping vehicles. But the ATV is a
          small, maneuverable target, swerving and speeding crazily. A
          TANK FIRES and MISSES, the BLAST taking out a chunk of wall.
          
          KYLE WHOOPS, heading across the campus--
          
          --ONE TANK pursues, it moves surprisingly fast, capable of
          flattening anything in its path. MARCUS FIRES at it, but the
          PLASMA RIFLE BLASTS don't have much effect on the ARMOR.
          
          THE TANK FIRES again, but--
                                                             (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          --KYLE ROARS around a corner, just in time.   However, in so
          doing, he nearly runs over--
          
          --MARCUS, from earlier, on his way to the time sphere,
          visible in the HEADLIGHTS for only an instant before he LEAPS
          OUT OF THE WAY.
          
          KYLE, focused on the pursuing tank, didn't even see this.
          But STAR did. She looks wide-eyed at MARCUS beside her.
          
                                 STAR
                       That looked like--
          
                                  MARCUS
                       I know.   Long story.
          
          PLAY THE CHASE, as the TANK pursues the ATV through the
          facility.
          
          KYLE takes his vehicle through a large FOUNTAIN, which the
          TANK SMASHES to bits.
          
          KYLE OVERSTEERS, putting them up on two wheels, then
          recovers, narrowly avoiding--
          
          --PLASMA BLASTS, which obliterate the FACADE of a building.
          
          SKELETAL TERMINATORS appear in their HEADLIGHTS, weapons
          raised.
          
          MARCUS stands and FIRES over KYLE'S HEAD, BLOWING them out of
          the way.
          
          NEAR THE PARK, MARCUS points.
          
                                 MARCUS (cont'd)
                       Take that path!
          
          
          EXT.   PARK/WOODS - NIGHT
          
          THE TANK is gaining on them, KYLE steers around a GAZEBO, the
          tank SMASHES right through it, turning it to splinters.
          
                                    MARCUS
                       The trees!

          CONTINUED:
          
          Kyle steers toward THE WOODS, dodging between the thick
          TREES. Too many obstacles for the TANK here, it SCREECHES TO
          A HALT and lets off a JET OF FLAME.
          
          THE TREES behind the ATV all IGNITE, turning to acrid pools
          of MELTING PLASTIC. KYLE barely stays ahead of the FIRE.
          
          THE TANK backs up and takes a new route, around the woods.
          
          IN THE WOODS, KYLE strikes a GLANCING BLOW against a tree
          trunk, and the ATV TOPPLES on its side, spilling its
          passengers. After a beat, they rise, shaken.
          
                                 MARCUS (cont'd)
                       You two all right?
          
                                 STAR
                           (NODDING)
                       Why don't you drive?
          
                                 KYLE
                       Come on I was doing good!
          
          MARCUS rights the vehicle, taking the wheel, the kids climb
          in back.
          
          
          EXT.   RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT
          
          THE ATV comes rocketing down the main street, MARCUS driving
          now. Suddenly, directly in front of them--
          
          --THE TANK APPEARS, moving swiftly around a corner, GUN
          TURRET SWIVELING at them.
          
          AS IT FIRES, MARCUS SWERVES onto a LAWN and--
          
          --CRASHES THROUGH a PICTURE WINDOW.
          
          
          INT.   LUXURY HOME - NIGHT
          
          A handsome HYBRID COUPLE, in pajamas in front of a BIG SCREEN
          TV. They turn and react as the ATV skitters through the room
          and down a hallway. The ATV is followed a moment later by--
          
          --THE TANK, which TAKES OUT THE ENTIRE WALL, BARRELLING
          through the living room and BURYING the HYBRIDS in RUBBLE.

          CONTINUED:
          
          MARCUS takes the ATV UP A FLIGHT OF STAIRS.
          
          THE TANK keeps SMASHING through the house, as its TURRET
          SWIVELS upward and BLASTS AWAY.
          
          UPSTAIRS - THE PLASMA BLAST COMES THROUGH the FLOOR, just
          missing the ATV as it rockets through a MASTER BEDROOM,
          toward a BALCONY.
          
          DOWNSTAIRS - THE TANK tears through an upscale RECREATION
          ROOM, splintering a POOL TABLE, smashing through PINBALL
          MACHINES.
          
          UPSTAIRS - MARCUS takes the ATV straight out onto the
          BALCONY, THROUGH THE RAILING and INTO THE AIR.
          
          DOWNSTAIRS - THE TANK BLASTS THROUGH a KITCHEN and BATHROOM
          on its way out the other side of the house.
          
          
          EXT.   LUXURY HOME/BACK YARD - NIGHT
          
          THE ATV JUST CLEARS an enormous SWIMMING POOL, landing hard
          on the far deck and moving on, fast.
          
          THE TANK SMASHES THROUGH THE BACK WALL and--
          
          --TAKES A NOSEDIVE into the pool, out of commission.
          
          
          INT.   LUXURY HOME - NIGHT
          
          THE RUBBLE in the living room shifts and the HYBRID COUPLE
          extract themselves, taking in their destroyed home with
          placid expressions.
          
          
          EXT.   RESIDENTIAL SIDESTREET - NIGHT
          
          A moment's breather. Marcus slows the vehicle, which WOBBLES
          and SMOKES from all it's been through. He looks around.
          
                                 KYLE
                       Where are we going?
          
                                 MARCUS
                       There.

          CONTINUED:
          
          He points toward the COAST, we see a MARINA in the distance,
          a BOAT moored at a DOCK.
          
          MARCUS steers the ATV down a slope toward the shoreline.
          
          
          EXT.   COASTLINE/DOCK - NIGHT/DAWN
          
          MARCUS, KYLE and STAR leap off the ATV and sprint for a
          MOTORBOAT. Kyle carries the rifle now.
          
          As they near the boat, MARCUS reacts to the sight of--
          
          --RED EYES FLICKERING in the darkness at the END OF THE DOCK,
          the BLUE GLOW of a RIFLE CHARGING.
          
          MARCUS leaps in front of KYLE and STAR shielding them with
          his BODY. The PLASMA BLAST envelops him, MARCUS is blown--
          
          --INTO THE WATER. KYLE and STAR are flattened by the force
          of the blast, lie motionless on the dock. Their PLASMA RIFLE
          lies a few feet away.
          
          THE SKELETAL TERMINATOR who shot Marcus moves swiftly down
          the dock, its PLASMA RIFLE trained on the water now. It
          moves past Kyle and Star, who remain motionless on the
          ground, and goes to the edge of the dock--
          
          --BLAM! STAR snatches up their own PLASMA WEAPON, and BLASTS
          the thing in the back, knocking it INTO THE WATER, which is
          only a few feet deep here. As it rises, SHE FIRES again,
          taking the Terminator's head off. It goes under.
          
          THE SKY is beginning to LIGHTEN now as, a moment later,
          MARCUS EMERGES. As he climbs from the shallow water back
          onto the dock, Kyle and Star stare at him with astonishment.
          
          Seeing their expressions, he checks himself for damage--
          there's METAL exposed at his shoulder, arm and hand, his FACE
          partially TORN AWAY, ONE EYE MISSING. He tries to speak, but
          can only manage an ELECTRONIC CROAK.
          
          Kyle and Star back away from him.
          
                                 KYLE
                       He's not real.
          
          Marcus shakes his head, starts to move toward them.   STAR
          raises the rifle, points it at him.
                                                            (CONTINUED)

                                 STAR
                       Don't come any closer!
          
          They hear a WHISTLING SOUND from shore, hit the deck as--
          
          --a MISSILE BLAST TAKES OUT THE BOAT and a large chunk of
          DOCK.
          
          Laying low, they look up to see--
          
          --a small army of TANKS and TERMINATORS approaching... even a
          HUNTER-KILLER moving in from the horizon, swinging its
          SPOTLIGHT in all directions. It looks like the last stand.
          
          MARCUS turns back to KYLE and STAR.   His voice is a distorted
          WHISPER.
          
                                    MARCUS
                       I'm sorry.
          
          Star puts the rifle aside, with an apologetic expression.
          She moves to Marcus, gingerly touches his exposed metal--
          then hugs him tightly.
          
          Kyle, more stoical, looks out to sea.   His expression
          changes, becomes almost hopeful as--
          
          --IN THE DISTANCE, a HUGE, BLACK SHAPE rises to the surface
          of the water, just visible against the dawn horizon.
          
          FIREWORKS! MISSILES blast the H-K... NAPALM erupts around
          the TANKS and TERMINATOR ARMY as--
          
          --A SQUAD OF A-10s SCREAM IN from over the land, FIRING
          CANNONS, launching AIR-TO GROUND MISSILES to take out the
          TANKS. ONE A-10 flies low overhead and WAGS ITS WINGS.

          BLAIR at the controls, helmeted with her face exposed, lets
          out a VICTORY WHOOP as she looks out her canopy at the
          huddled humans below.
          
          
          EXT.   COASTLINE - DAY
          
          KYLE points to the dark shape on the water-- now visible as a
          huge SUBMARINE with the RISING SUN behind it.

          HIGH ANGLE as ZODIAC BOATS reach land. HAZ-MAT SUITED
          SOLDIERS leap out and run to our heroes at what remains of
          the dock, others head inland to provide covering FIRE.
          
          MARCUS addresses a TEAM LEADER, who's taken aback at his
          frightening appearance and distorted voice:
          
                                 MARCUS
                       There are more prisoners, a complex
                       about a mile in--
          
          As MARCUS gives the man a few more directions--
          
          --ONE HAZ-MAT FIGURE, standing a few feet off, studies Kyle
          and approaches.
          
                                 HAZ-MAT MAN
                       What's your name, son?
          
                                 KYLE
                       Kyle Reese.
          
          The figure pulls off a glove and unzips his mask, extends a
          hand. It's JOHN CONNOR.
          
                                 CONNOR
                       John Connor. I'm glad you made it.
          
          KYLE is amazed to be meeting the man face-to-face. He shakes
          hands, wide-eyed and speechless. It's a strange moment for
          Connor, too, for different reasons.
          
          CONNOR turns away from his first meeting with his father to
          be, a bit dizzy at the experience. He addresses Marcus.
          
                                 CONNOR (cont'd)
                       Seems I owe you an apology.
          
          MARCUS smiles as best he can, given his ruined face.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Yeah, well. Get in line.
          
          WIDER, as CONNOR replaces his mask, moves to direct his
          troops. MARCUS, KYLE and STAR stay close together.
          
                                                             DISSOLVE TO:

          INT.   SUBMARINE/HATCH AREA - DAY
          
          Near the ENGINE ROOM, a couple dozen RESCUED PRISONERS are
          being treated by unarmed MEDICAL PERSONNEL, others huddle
          under blankets with food and drink. KATE is among those
          helping the former prisoners.
          
          KYLE and STAR eat ravenously, he finishes one MRE and grabs
          up another. A few feet away, MARCUS leans against a wall,
          plasma RIFLE at his side. A DOCTOR examines him warily,
          prodding his injured face.
          
                               DOCTOR
                     Does this hurt?
          
                               MARCUS
                     I don't feel a thing.    Help
                     somebody else.
          
          The doctor moves on as a couple of HAZ-MAT SUITED FIGURES
          come down the ladder from the hatch, FACE-MASKS removed.
          Among them is CONNOR. KATE moves to his side as more dazed
          HUMANS come down. She speaks quietly, eying KYLE nearby.
          
                               KATE
                     Your dad-- he seems like a nice kid.
          
          Connor can't deal with that at the moment, speaks loudly.
          
                               CONNOR
                     The last boatload is right behind
                     me. Skynet's pouring in
                     reinforcements, we can't hold this
                     place. And the people in the
                     houses, they won't leave--
          
                               MARCUS
                     They're not people anymore...
          
          He trails off, reacting to the sight of--
          
          A FAMILIAR FIGURE descending the ladder, in a long coat, head
          down. She looks up to make eye contact... SERENA.
          
                               MARCUS (cont'd)
                     No!
          
          SLO-MO:   seeing Marcus, Serena reaches into her coat--
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          MARCUS moves at the same time, to grab his PLASMA RIFLE--
          
          SERENA leaps off the ladder, aiming a small, powerful PLASMA
          WEAPON.
          
          SERENA fires first--
          
          BLAM! THE PLASMA BLAST catches MARCUS in the shoulder and
          BLOWS his GUN ARM clean off. His PLASMA RIFLE discharges,
          BLOWING a HOLE in the side of the sub, near the floor-- WATER
          gushes in like a FIREHOSE.
          
          LEAVE SLO-MO. Spun around by the force of the blast, MARCUS
          lands on his back, SPARKS and SEVERED CABLES protruding from
          his damaged shoulder. An ALARM KLAXON SOUNDS.
          
          PRISONERS and DOCTORS SCREAM and scramble for cover--
          
          CONNOR steps in front of KATE to shield her, they back away
          through the WATER BLAST, CONNOR FIRING at SERENA--
          
          SERENA takes numerous HITS from the EXPLOSIVE BULLETS, which
          take off PIECES of her, but she keeps coming, FIRES again--
          
          --HITTING CONNOR in the lower abdomen. He's thrown backward,
          KATE cries out and throws herself on top of him. His gun has
          gone flying.
          
          SERENA turns her attention to MARCUS, standing over him,
          plasma weapon aimed point-blank at his head.
          
                                 SERENA
                       Why, Marcus? You were immortal...
          
          MARCUS manages a smile as he shakes his head.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       No one lives forever.
          
          BLAM! MULTIPLE PLASMA BLASTS from behind RIDDLE SERENA'S
          TORSO, the BLUE PULSES burning right through her-- her HEAD
          takes a hit, the STEEL is RUPTURED.
          
          THE PLASMA WEAPON flies out of her arms, she COLLAPSES.
          
          TIGHT ON HER FACE, as she turns to see who got her--
          
          There's no one there.    But ON THE FLOOR lies--
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED: (2)
          
          --MARCUS' SEVERED ARM, still holding his PLASMA RIFLE.     The
          hand RELEASES the weapon.
          
          SERENA'S HEAD tilts, her eyes go blank-- she's dead.
          
          MEDICAL PERSONNEL are doing what they can to help CONNOR,
          blood at his lips, KATE and KYLE at his side.
          
                               CONNOR
                     This... this can't happen...

          THE SUBMARINE "LOS ANGELES" moves TOWARD CAMERA as it slowly
          SINKS deeper beneath the water's surface. We see a makeshift
          STEEL PATCH welded near the hatch.

          INT.   SUBMARINE/CORRIDOR - DAY
          
          MARCUS waits outside the entrance to the SICKBAY. He's
          cleaned up a bit, wears fresh clothes (one sleeve pinned up).
          He seems weary, wrung out, his systems damaged. He'll move
          stiffly through the following scene, like a stroke victim.
          
          STAR sits beside him, a hand on his arm.   BLAIR approaches
          from down the corridor.
          
                               BLAIR
                     Marcus... I need to head back to my
                     unit.
          
          MARCUS nods, keeps his head bowed.
          
                               BLAIR (cont'd)
                     What about you?
          
          His voice is still WEAK.
          
                               MARCUS
                     I have no idea. I should be dead...
          
                               STAR
                     But you're alive.

                           (a half-smile)
                       So to speak.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       We've been ordered not to talk
                       about it-- the hybrids, everything
                       about that place is top secret...
          
                                 MARCUS
                       Yeah, simpler to keep it man versus
                       machine.
          
          Star gingerly reaches up to touch the torn plastic at the
          back of Marcus' head, where the interface was.
          
                                  STAR
                           (BEAT)
                       What did it feel like?   To be...
                       one of them?
          
                                 MARCUS
                           (thoughtful beat)
                       Better than anything. Everything made
                       sense. For the first time in my life,
                       I felt... right. It was heaven.
          
                                 BLAIR
                       How could you give that up?
          
          He turns to her, exposing his mangled face, one eye gone.
          
                                 MARCUS
                       I never really believed in heaven.
          
          BLAIR takes this in, fishes in a pocket.
          
                                  BLAIR
                       Here.   You need these more than I do.
          
          She holds out a PAIR OF SUNGLASSES.     MARCUS, a bit amused,
          slips them on.
          
          THE DOOR opens nearby and an ashen-faced KATE emerges.
          
                                 KATE
                       He wants to see you.
          
          BLAIR gives MARCUS a farewell hug.
          
                                                                         111.
          
          
          INT.   SUBMARINE SICKBAY - DAY
          
          CONNOR has a PRIVATE MEDICAL AREA set aside. He's not
          looking good-- pale, weak, only semi-conscious. I.V.s and
          MONITORS, other LIFE-SUPPORT EQUIPMENT. KYLE is with Connor,
          staring at a small POLAROID PHOTO in his hand. CONNOR can
          barely speak above a whisper.
          
                                CONNOR
                     Her name was Sarah... she was...
                     amazing...
          
                               KYLE
                     I don't remember my mother.
          
          KYLE starts to hand the photo back, CONNOR waves it away.
          
                                CONNOR
                     Keep it.
          
          KYLE is a bit puzzled, but obediently keeps the snapshot.
          KATE enters with MARCUS, touches the boy's shoulder.
          
                               KATE
                     Kyle, could you give us a minute?
          
          KYLE reluctantly leaves, still looking at the photo, with a
          nod to MARCUS on the way out. He joins STAR in the doorway,
          they go off together.
          
          KATE, CONNOR and MARCUS are alone now. Throughout scene,
          Kate fights to maintain a steely control-- but she's clearly
          not far from tears.
          
                               KATE (cont'd)
                     Marcus... you're going to need to
                     be rebuilt. Your face, your body,
                     your voice...
                         (off his shrug)
                     We have people who can do it.
          
          She pulls some MEDICAL DIAGRAMS out of a drawer, lays them
          before Marcus. He examines--
          
          --a SCANNED IMAGE of his FACE, various elements HIGHLIGHTED.
          
                               KATE (cont'd)
                     But you won't be the same...

          CONTINUED:
          
          MARCUS moves to the NEXT IMAGE-- it shows his features
          TRANSFORMED into another's-- something closer to JOHN
          CONNOR'S FACE, with a JAGGED SCAR over part of his features.
          
                                 KATE (cont'd)
                       The scar will help hide the change.
          
          Marcus lowers the papers, absorbing this.
          
                                  MARCUS
                       You're asking me to become...
                            (gesturing at Connor)
                       Him?
          
          Connor can barely speak above a whisper:
          
                                   CONNOR
                       You must.
          
                                 KATE
                           (QUIETLY)
                       We can't keep him alive much longer.
                           (shakes her head, swallows)
                       Very few people know what John
                       actually looks like. Only the
                       technicians and our closest advisors
                       need ever know the truth.
          
                                   MARCUS
                       Why me?
          
                                 KATE
                       Who else? Only you know the enemy
                       from the inside. You liberated a
                       Skynet camp... you're a hero.
          
          Connor gestures for Marcus to move closer, he speaks with
          great effort:
          
                                 CONNOR
                       I never knew how I was supposed to
                       win this war. But I finally
                       understand: the idea of John Connor
                       is more important than the person.
                           (sinks back, spent)
                       I can die. He cannot.
          
          Kate leans toward Marcus, who's lost in thought.
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED: (2)
          
                                KATE
                     Please.   We need you.
          
          MARCUS bows his head for a long beat, as if seeking an answer
          from within. Then he looks up again with resolve.
          
          He lifts his hand-- the SKIN TATTERED, METAL exposed at
          finger joints-- and moves to take CONNOR'S TREMBLING HAND.
          
                                                             CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT.   MOUNTAIN WAR - NIGHT
          
          SLOW-MOTION, MOS - a SNOWY, MOUNTAINOUS ENVIRONMENT...
          
          STEEL TERMINATORS go down in HAILS OF BULLETS.   We hear
          Marcus' VO, his voice strong and assured:
          
                               MARCUS (V.O.)
                     Yea, though I walk through the
                     valley of the shadow of death...
          
          AN ARMY of HUMAN RESISTANCE FIGHTERS marches through the
          SNOW, GUNS BLAZING.
          
                               MARCUS (V.O.) (cont'd)
                     ...I shall fear no evil...
          
          AN H-K goes down IN FLAMES, SMASHES in the MOUNTAINSIDE.
          
          THE GOLDEN EXPLOSION silhouettes a single FIGURE, who stands
          on a PROMONTORY, surveying the battle below. AIDES and
          SOLDIERS surround him, but he towers over them, giving
          orders, in complete control. MOVE IN SLOWLY on him.
          
                               MARCUS (V.O.) (cont'd)
                     I died, and was reborn. I wear
                     another man's face, lead another
                     man's life... yet only now do I
                     have a reason for living. I once
                     was lost, but now I'm found...
          
          ANOTHER BLAST illuminates his face for an instant-- scarred,
          craggy, a blend of Marcus and Connor-- but fierce, determined
          and proud. [Perhaps shoot this with both actors.]
          
                               MARCUS (V.O.) (cont'd)
                     ...was blind, but now I see.

                                                      13 FEBRUARY 1998
                         

                         
          "I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
          That would save you dear lady from going insane"

          BLACK

          MUSIC UP: Slow, sad, ethereal.
          Perhaps even eerie.

          FADE IN:

          On a sea of red, filling the frame. A crimson ocean without
          waves or ripples.

          A thick housepainter's BRUSH dips in, revealing its paint.
          The BRUSH is extracted, paint dripping like congealing blood.
          FOLLOW THE BRUSH to reveal...

          INT. A HOUSE - NIGHT

          A white wall, where the BRUSH is moved horizontally, leaving
          a thick continuous stripe, until the paint thins out.
          A WOMAN'S HAND plunges the BRUSH back into the paint can,
          then takes up creating the stripe again, painting the wall:
          until it reaches &pleated drape --
          -- and doesn't stop. A window and another drape receive the
          same treatment before the BRUSH is re-dipped.

          A PUPPY,
          a sad-eyed basset hound, sits on the floor watching, a bit
          perplexed. This is WALTER and even he knows this is weird.
          The dog looks over to...

          A FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL
          standing next to him, also watching. This is RACHEL. Dark
          haired, in a plain dress. Her large eyes are welling on the
          verge of tears.

          The BRUSH is dragged across the wall, hits a wooden picture
          frame, moves across a cheap oil painting of a pastoral,
          forest scene, and over the other edge of the frame.

          Another ANGLE takes in the red line, five feet high, parallel
          to the floor, extending around a modest living room.

          Painting the line is BARBARA LANG, in her thirties, yet worn,
          haggard- She hasn't slept in a while.

          The precision of her work, her concentration, her focus, as
          the line runs across a wall and into a corner, is more than a
          little frightening.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         RACHEL

                         Mommy

          BARBARA hears nothing, says nothing, just wipes a paint drip.
          This is a very careful line.

                         RACHEL
          Momma, come play with me. In my room.
          But her mother keeps painting across a door.

                         RACHEL
          Right now, mommy, okay?
          BARBARA looks at her, or rather through her. And continues
          her task. RACHEL steps forward, tugs on her mom's

                         RACHEL
          I got a idea, we could--
          -- and gets , , splat, right-in the face with the brush

                         THE KITCHEN
           A TOY AMBULANCE sits on the floor. RACHEL's tiny hand
           deliberately presses a button on it. The TOY responds with a
          wheep whe ep siren, then:

                         AMBULANCE VOICE

                         (CANNED; TINNY)
          If you need help, dial nine one one.
          If you need help, dial nine one one.

          A WALL-MOUNTED PHONE
          RACHEL's HAND struggles to reach the buttons to dial 9-1-1.
          BARBARA's still painting the wall in the background.

          RACHEL (O.S.)
          Hello? It's my mom. She's doing
          some... some wrong things. She's
          doing wrong things, so, and, you
          should come.

          EXT. THE STREET - FROM ABOVE - NIGHT

          A light rain falls on an AMBULANCE sitting next to a POLICE
          Its dashing red lights
          CRUISER with its doors flung open.
          splash over the umbrella carrying NEIGHBORS, in pajamas and
          robes, watching...

                         

                         

                         

                         
          TWO E.M.S. WORKERS drag a struggling BARBARA across a lawn,
          her hands in plastic restraining cuffs.
          A wet RACHEL stands by a kneeling POLICE OFFICER holding a
          poncho over her head.

                         POLICEMAN
          Rachel? Rachel, are you okay?
          She keeps staring off, watching her mother being stuffed into
          the ambulance.

                         RACHEL
          Momma!
          She starts towards her, but the OFFICER holds her back.

                         POLICEMAN
          Honey, she just has to go somewhere,
          to get some rest, so she'll feel
          better.
          As the AMBULANCE pulls away, RACHEL catches a glimpse of her
          mother in the rear windows, watching her.

                         POLICEMAN
          is your dad around? When's he get
          home from work?
          I don't have a dad.
          The POLICEMAN collects himself.

                         POLICEMAN
          Okay. Then we're going to take you
          someplace nice, with a family, a
          really nice family, till we get all
          this sorted out.

                         (QUIETLY)
          No.

                         POLICMIAN

                         WE'LL JUS

                         RACHEL
          She breaks free, races into.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

          INT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT

          Where she runs down the entrance hall. Behind her, outside,
          as the POLICEMAN runs toward the front door, it --
          SLAMS by itself, right in his face.
          FOLLOW RACHEL as she rushes through the living room and down
          a hall. Another door slams shut behind her.

                         HER ROOM
          She spins, frightened by the door that closed behind her. To
          her left...
          A WINDOW crashes shut, startling her. Then, like a wave
          moving in a circle around her, another WINDOW bangs down, a
          DOOR slams shut, another WINDOW. Scared, RACHEL backs into

                         A CLOSET
          where she finds WALTER huddling and cradles him in her arms.
          The CLOSET DOOR swings shut, sealing her off from the world.

                         FROM ABOVE
          In the dark, RACHEL is in a fetal position on the floor, dry
          eyed, in shock, curled around her puppy.
          There's the far-off sound of POUNDING on a door.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          NT. A DARKENED BEDROOM - DAWN
          RACHEL, now 17, is curled in bed around WALTER, also now a
          far more senior dog. She's enmeshed in tangled white
          Small TATTOOS come into view -- A delicate angel with broken
          wings on her ankle. A small EGYPTIAN ANKH is etched on her
          shoulder blade.
          Wrapped around her upper arm is an elegant THORN BAND
          encircling a HEART, either protecting or imprisoning it.
          There's a knock on her bedroom door.

          WOMAN (O.S.)
          Rachel. c et up. You're gonna be late
          again.
          She rolls over, blinks awake. She's beautiful, with sensual
          lips framed by raven black hair.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         RACHEL
          joy.

                         CUT TO
          BLACK. A SUPER burns in:

           M. O N D A Y

                          FADE INTO:

          A PAN AROUND RACHEL'S ROOM
          the usual teenage mess, clothes strewn everywhere. A POSTER
          of Jim Morrison reads: "No One Here Gets Out Alive."
          RACHEL stands before her dresser mirror, in a ratty bathrobe,
          putting on a small nose stud. She dons her daily armor --
          -- Slipping on multiple earrings.
          -- Applying Kohl around her eyes.
          -- Shrugging on a T-shirt with a photo of Sharon Tate
          captioned "Manson Sucks".
          -- Disheveling her long black hair.
          Scooping up WALTER, she kisses him, takes him to an open
          ground floor window.
          Sorry, Walt.
          And gently lowers him outside.

          EXT. A HOUSE - MORNING

          It's not the home RACHEL lived in with BARBARA. This one is
          run down and in the section of town where people have cars in
          their yards they've abandoned tinkering with. The lawn is
          overgrown, there's broken glass on the street.

          INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

          The crammed eat-in-kitchen of the WALLACE house. EMILYN,
          40's, is ironing a waitress uniform on the counter. A groggy
          BOYD, 40's, enters, he's a trucker and looks like one. He
          goes straight for the refrigerator.
          BOYD and his wife EMILYN have taken in RACHEL as a foster kid
          to augment their income.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.
           RACHEL is alone at a formica table, eating cereal. BOYD
          looks at his ..rife.

                         BOYD

                         (YAWNS)
          Working tonight?

                         EMILYN
          Graveyard shift, again.

                         (TO RACHEL)
          Was the dog in the house last night?
          He's allowed in the morning.

                         BOYD
          (head in refrigerator)
          Daytime, yes; nighttime, no. We've
          been over this ground.
          I only brought him in this morning.
          No juice?

                         EMILYN
          We're out of a lot of things.

                         (TO RACHEL)
          I heard dog noises last night.
          When I was trying to sleep.

                         (LOUDER)
          Walter was not in the house last
          night.

                         BOYD
          (shoots Rachel a look)
          You watch that voice in this house.
          While you're here, you'll respect her
          as your mother, and treat her as such.

                         RACHEL
          (lowers her eyes, mumbles)
          Sorry.
          She picks through her cold cereal in silence.

                         EMILYN
          Your mom's making progress isn't she,
          on the new medicacions, the
          tricyclics?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.

                         RACHEL
          Yes, ma'am.

                         (BEAT)
          May I be excused?
          Without waiting for a reply, she stands and gathers the bowl.
          (casually, a routine)
          And you should take that thing outta
          your nose. Don't you have enough
          holes in your head?
          As she turns away, RACHEL makes a face, but replies.

                         RACHEL
          Yes, sir.

          EXT. HOUSE - MORNING

          RACHEL stands outside, clad in a long dark overcoat, with a
          black backpack. WALTER sits next to her, behind a fence.
          A YELLOW SCHOOL BUS pulls up.

                         RACHEL
          Later, Walt.
          On WALTER, bummed.

          WITHIN THE SCHOOL BUS
          A gaggle of young KIDS in faded denims and pastels. RACHEL
          moves to the back, sits with LISA PARKER, who could be her
          younger sister, also dressed Goth, black lace and metal.
          LISA has a HEART-THORN TATTOO around her arm, like RACHEL's.

                         LISA

                         (SMILES)
          Well, hullo.

                         RACHEL
          She speaks. She opens her mouth
          and sounds come out. The sounds
          are words.
          LTA gives her a Cheshire cat grin.

                         LISA
          What's wrong, fcscer-dad bein' a
          pain again?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.

                         RACHEL
          Why are you so weiz.ly happy?

                         LISA
          o I look any different?

                         RACHEL
          Do you look any...

                         (GETTING IT)
          Oh, my gawd. You did it.

                         LISA
          Yep.
          With who?

                         LISA
          You'd never believe me if I told you.
          I'm bringing him to lunch.

                         RACHEL
          C'mon. ' 1 Fess up.

                         LISA
          All will be revealed in due time.
          RACHEL pulls out a worn Anne Rice paperback from her ba
          gives it to LISA.

                         RACHEL
          You suck.

                         LISA
          I love you too.
          Simultaneously, they bite their thumbs, then press them
          together; a pantomime of blood sisters.

                         LISA / RACHEL
          Best Blood. / Best Blood.
          ARNIE, a skinny, pimply stoner, plops into the seat behind
          them, sticks his head on their seatback, smiles full braces.

                         ARNIE
          Hi there gruesome twosome, how 'bout
          a threesome?

                         LISA
          (ignoring him, to Rachel)
          Lunch. Meet me in the parking lot.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

          EXT. BERGEN HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING

          A modern, windowless school, shrouded in mist. It's
          beautiful in an eerie "Fall of the House of Usher" way.

          E SCHOOL ENTRANCE - MORNING
          Hung over the concrete entrance is a large bedsheet BANNER
          with oversized red lettering:

          CRUSH CARLIN FRIDAY!
          The school mascot, a scrappy BULLDOG wearing a CROWN tilted
          at a rakish angle, is also drawn on the banner.
          FADE IN -- KNOTS of STUDENTS, like spectral figures.
          The two major school cliques are...
          on the front steps. Land of burnouts, step-kids, Metalheat s
          skateboard junkiei-and other lost souls.
          A STONER KID kicks his skateboard up and catches it. HIS
          BUDDY follows suit and misses, suffering the embarrassment of
          watching his board shoot down the steps whose metal rail
          separates Freak Hall and..,

                         THE PATIO
          a courtyard with concrete tables where the school's royalty
          hold court. The cleancut "Patio People" are the jocks,
          student government types and others who have no idea what it
          is to be alone on a Saturday night.
          At the patio is a pack of muscular jocks in football letter
          jackets reading "Bulldogs", some sport caps marked "Dawgs:
          There's JESSE RYAN, handsome, longish hair, a young Eddie
          Vedor if Eddie ever played football. Next to him is...
          MARK BING, good looking, with a body like a fist.
          Behind them, arrayed around a concrete table are the large,
          doltish BRAD, hearty rich boy CHUCK, and the arrogant ERIC.
          CHUCKS looks over a plain looking GIRL on the Patio.

                         CHUCK
          (aside, low)
          Hey, Mark, the girl over there,
          how many if I do her?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.
          Six.

                         BRAD

                         (MIFFED)
          Hold it. I did her last week,
          I only got five.

                         MARK
          She was having a bad hairday.
          A group of PATIO GIRLS sit at another table. Among them is
          MONICA, a stunning brunette, AMY a cute redhead and TRACY, an
          icy BLONDE who could spend all day checking her makeup.
          JESSE looks over. TRACY graces him with a smile and turns
          away. MARK leans in to JESSE.

                         MARK
          Hey, Jess. Tracy, she wants you, man.
          Jump her bones.

                         I JESSE
          Yeah, whatever.

                         CHUCK
          What's the matter with you, she's got
          an ass stamped "Made in Heaven

                         JESSE
          I don't know, you ever have a
          conversation with her? It's like
          talking down a well. She only wants
          me cause I'm on the football team.

                         MARK
          So what? You want her to want you
          cause of your dazzling personality?
          Look, you want someone to talk to,
          you got us. H, you screw.

          THE SCHOOL BUS
          RACHEL and LISA hop off and walk past the Patio. CHUCK
          watches LISA pass.

                         CHUCK

                         (ASIDE)
          Woof- Coyote date.

                         JESSE
          That's harsh, man, keep it down.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         11

                         ERIC
          What's a coyote date?

                         MARK
          When you wake up in the morning, and
          she's sleeping on your arm, and the
          only way to get up is to wake her.
          So you gnaw your arm off instead.
          BRAD snorts a laugh.
          A goatee'd ENGLISH TEACHER nods to both camps as he passes.

                         ENGLISH TEACHER
          Hello Montagues, hello Capulets.
          A BELL goes off and the STUDENTS start filing into school.
          LISA waves the tips of her fingers to RACHEL, bye-bye.
          RACHEL looks over, catches a glimpse of JESSE, across the
          line of demarcation. For a piece of a second it seems as if
          he's looking back. She drops her head, walks away.

          INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY

          The ENGLISH TEACHER strolls among the student's desk. RACHEL
          is in social Siberia, sitting in the back.

                         ENGLISH TEACHER
          Okay, then how many saw the movie?
          A show of hands, all the girls, some of the boys.

                         ENGLISH TEACHER
          Now, how many read the play?

                         AS ASSIGN
          A few tentative hands, including JESSE.

                         ENGLISH TEACHER
          I thank you for your honesty, but I am
          saddened. I'd like to think we're
          here to study William Shakespeare, not
          worship at the altar of Leo DiCaprio.
          Scattered laughs.

                         ENGLISH TEACHER
          I was going to calk about the
          language. But since you haven't Z&&d
          the language, let's talk about the
          plot.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.
          Sighs of relief

                         ENGLISH TEACHER
          Romeo and Juliet, a tale of two lovers
          meant for each other, pulled apart by
          their families, society, and, some
          might say, by fate.

                         (BEAT)
          Why is it that we are so moved by love
          stories that end with separation?
          The STUDENT' s faces are blank.

                         ENGLISH TEACHER
          What are some other stories with this
          theme?

                         (NO RESPONSES)
          How about, Dr. Zhivago? Casablanca?
          Still blank. AMY timidly raises her hand.

                         AMY
          You meair like in Dumb and
          when the girl's husband showed up?
          The TEACHER surrenders to the inevitable.

                         ENGLISH TEACHER
          Okay, well. Perhaps at some level
          we know that Lauren Holly's husband
          AIM to show up? What say? Anyone?

                         (BEAT)
          Rachel?
          I don't know that I believe in it.

                         ENGLISH TEACHER
          Believe in what?

                         RACHEL
          Love.
          JESSE looks at her, pensive.

                         ENGLISH TEACHER

                         (SYMPATHETIC)
          Well, then you've got bigger problems
          than passing this crass.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

                         ARNIE
          (raises his hand)
          Love is fifteen seconds of squishing
          noises. Unquote. Johnny Rotten.
          Scattered laughs. JESSE overhears TRACY as she nods at
          RACHEL, whispers to AMY...

                         TRACY
          Who would love her?

                         ENGLISH TEACHER
          Do you think that all love stories are
          tragedies? I mean, unless they die at
          the same time, all lovers are
          eventually separated by death.

                         JESSE
          Well, then Romeo and Juliet isn't a
          tragedy, because the only way they
          could really be together was in death.

                         ENGLISH TEACHER
          Very good.
          (nods at Rachel)
          A foul cynic, most cliche.
          (turns to Jesse)
          A true romantic, how refreshing.
          Kids scoff at JESSE, but RACHEL eyes JESSE, struck by this
          side of him.
          The BELL rings and ARNIE leads the exodus.

                         ARNIE
          Food!

                         ENGLISH TEACHER
          Next assignment, Brave New World, the
          book, not the TV movie.

          INT, HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
          A stone-faced LISA folds a NOTE, places it within her hallway
          locker, jammed to the brim with books; a photo of Fiona Apple
          and a Nine Inch Nails sticker are plastered on its door.

          EXT. ICE SCHOOL. THE REAR PARKING LOT - LUNCHTIME

          STUDENTS pour out the doors, some heading to a row of outside
          lockers. RACHEL appears, searching for LISA.

                         BACK TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.

          THE SCHOOL HALLWAY
          LISA walks as if moving through extremely dense air, hugging
          the wall as STUDENTS pass without acknowledging her.

                         HACK TO:

          THE PARKING LOT
          RACHEL looks around the students, sees a GIRL's HEAD from
          behind, realizes it isn't LISA.

                         BACK TO:

                         A STAIRWELL
          LISA ascends several flights, still brushing the wall,
          exiting onto the...

                         SCHOOL'S ROOF
          She walks past a TRIO OF STUDENTS smoking near the roof's
          edge. Without slowing or blinking an eyelash LISA simply..

          DROPS OUT OF FRAME.
          A GIRL turns in the direction of LISA's disappearance.

                         SMOKING GIRL
          Did you see that?

          SHOCK CUT TO:

          WITHIN A PARKED CAR
          LISA'S FACE smashes into the windshield which cracks in a
          spider web pattern. Blood fills the web. The sound of a
          droplet hitting car vinyl, then drops SPLATTER RED on our

          P.Q.V.

          EXT. THE SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

          Standing in the lot is RACHEL. She stares in horror at --
          LISA sprawled on the dented hood of a parked car, her head a
          bloody mass nestled in the shattered windshield.
          -- and RACHEL opens her mouth, but the SCREAM BOTTLED inside
          catches in her throat, which causes --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

          A ROW OF OUTDOOR LOCKERS
          to "ULQ open, behind her, like dominoes, banging in a wave
          away from her, startling KIDS near them.

          INT. SCHOOL - DAY

          BANG as a door marked "GUIDANCE COUNSELOR" swings open and..
          SUE SNELL whips around in her seat, late 30's, but with the
          eyes of someone who's been to hell and back. A YOUNG GIRL is
          seated before her for counseling.
          in her doorway is the SCHOOL PRINCIPAL, chaos in the hall
          behind him.

                         PRINCIPAL
          You'd better come with me, a girl just
          killed herself in the lot.

          EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY.

          More chaos. KIDS'rush in to see, others move away.
          Next to the car with LISA's body is RACHEL. Slowly,
          tentatively, without knowing what she's doing, RACHEL runs
          her hand along the car's hood, coating her thumb with blood.

                         RACHEL

                         (TO HERSELF)
          Best blood.
          SUE pushes her way through the crowd, sees a stunned RACHEL,
          puts an arm around her shoulder.

                         SUE
          Corns. Come with me. Let's back off.
          One step. Good. Let's back away.
          PULL BACK to see the widening circles of shock as the
          students of Bergen High realize what's just occurred.

          INT. GUIDANCE OFFICE - DAY

          better. I feel so good on the inside,

          and well adjusted today.

                         RACHEL
          Things are really great. Last night
          I, um, I had this slumber party, with
          some girlfriends. And this morning,
          Mrs. Wallace made us all pancakes
          before school.

                         BARBARA
          The Wallaces sure are a nice family.

                         RACHEL
          (her smile falters)
          Oh, they are. A nice family.

                         BARBARA
          What's wrong?

                         RACHEL
          Nothing, I just... I miss those crepes
          you used to make me.

                         BARBARA
          Oh, honey, those.crepes weren't
          nothing but watered down pancakes.
          (holds out her arms)
          Come here baby.
          She gives her daughter a big hug.

                         BARBARA
          Now you listen to me, the doctors say
          I'm doing well. You know what that
          means? That means someday, soon, you
          and I are gonna be eating crepes for
          breakfast, lunch and dinner.
          For the first time, RACHEL's smile is genuine.

                         RACHEL
          That would be so great.

                         BARBARA
          (holds her at arm's length)
          Oh, I look at you, remembering what
          you were like at five, at ten...
          (decides not to go down a sad path)
          All I need is a little Loving Care for
          these grey hairs and we'll make up for

          RACHEL's finger tenderly slides along LISA's face.
          She's shocked to find a picture of --
          LISA AND ERIC -- his arm draped around her in the backseat of

          You're... Rachel, right?
          She nods, surprised he knows she's alive, much less knows her
          name.

                         JESSE

          MARK leans over JESSE, his voice low now, intimate.

                         MARK
          So, Rachel, there were some pictures
          Lisa took. They have, what you might
          call sentimental value.
          She just stares at him. MARK pulls a twenty from his wallet.

                         MARK
          Twenty bucks cover it?

                         RACHEL
          No.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.

                         MARK
          What do you mean? I'll go thirty.

                         RACHEL
          They're not your pictures.

                         MARK
          Well it's not like she's gonna be
          picking them up, is it?
          RACHEL turns away. JESSE glares at MARK.

                         JESSE
          Hey, cool. it.

                         MARK
          (tries a different tack)
          Rachel, why don't I come by when you get
          off and, you know, take you for a ride?
          JESSE cocks an ear for her reply, but she doesn't answer.

                         T MARK
          C'mon, I don't bite... not unless you
          want me to.

                         RACHEL
          I don't think so.

                         MARK
          Why not?

                         RACHEL

                         (TURNS)
          Cause I'm a dyke.
          JESSE laughs. MARK doesn't. He knows she's putting him on
          and bores holes into her.

                         MARK
          Let's go, Jess.
          The car pulls away, MARK glances in the REARVIEW MIRROR at
          RACHEL, framed like a target.

                         MARK
          (low to himself)
          Bitch. I'll show you funny.
          ON RACHEL -- watching them go.
          Seconds later, a SHERIFF'S CRUISER pulls up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

                         KELTON
          Hi.
          He holds out Lisa's PHOTO STUB. RACHEL takes it, sees the
          name, her eyes widen.

          EXT. A HILL - NIGHT

          A star-filled sky hangs above the town's makeout spot, a hill
          overlooking Bergen. MARK and CHUCK stand outside a car
          sipping beers. JESSE's CAR, a blue G.T.Â©, is several yards
          away, with foggy windows.

          WITHIN JESSE'S CAR
          The backseat. JESSE's on top of TRACY. He pulls away from
          her. She pulls her top down, sits up.

                         JESSE
          I'm sorry, it's not you. its me.

                         TRACY
          It's okay. You should save your
          energy for the game anyway.
          JESSE opens the door, stands outside, tucking in his shirt.
          MARK and CHUCK make a crude humping gesture to JESSE. He
          hesitates, then nods at them.
          MARK pulls out the SCOREBOARD and enters JESSE's name with
          TRACY's and the number 10.

                         MARK
          He shoots, he scores.
          ON TRACY -- in the front seat, using the rearview to adjust
          her makeup, pleased with what she sees. She glances at JESSE
          as he re-enters on the driver's side.

                         TRACY
          What are you thinking about?

                         JESSE
          Nobody.

                         TRACY
          I asked what, not who.

                         JESSE
          Oh. Nothing.

                         (PAUSE)

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.

                         JESSE (CONT'D)
          Doesn't it bother you that a girl
          offed herself today?

                         TRACY
          Why? She wasn't anybody.

                         JESSE
          What?

                         TRACY
          I mean, I didn't know her.

                         (SMILES)
          You know, I still don't have a date to
          Mark's party Friday. Hint, hint.
          She leans over and nibbles on JESSE's ear. He pulls away,
          forces a smile and turns the ignition.

          INT. RACHEL'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

          SMASH as a dish drops onto the floor. RACHEL is at the sink,
          doing dishes. She crouches to retrieve the broken plate.
          WE PAN along the chorus line of dishes, glasses, and
          silverware on the counter as the metronome of the sink
          faucet's DRIP, DRIP, DRIP and the micro-explosions of the
          soap bubbles in the water intensify to deafening levels.
          TIGHT ON a SPOON atop the counter which suddenly begins
          dancing. Pots and pans on a hanging rack start rattling.
          A RUMBLE as more dishes and utensils vibrate and rattle, as
          if by a paranormal force.
          But as RACHEL casually straightens up and looks out the
          window, it's revealed it's only...

          EXT. RACHEL' S HOUSE - NIGHT

          BOYD driving a large SEMI-TRUCK pulling alongside the tiny
          house. Its engine shuts off..,

                         THE KITCHEN
          .and the spoons and dishes stop vibrating.

                         RACHEL
          (singsong, to herself)
          Daddy's home.
          She walks to her bedroom and closes the door.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.

          EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT

          BOYD goes to shut the open fence and WALTER, the basset
          hound, scurries past him and into the street.

                         BOYD
          Come back here, mutt.

                         (WHISTLES LOUDLY)
          Aw, good riddance.
          And he closes the gate.

          INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          RACHEL lays in bed, staring at the ceiling. BOYD knocks on
          her door.

          BOYD (0.S.)
          Your dog got out. Better get'im.

          INT. JESSE'S CAR - NIGHT

          JESSE's driving alone, wiping Tracy's lipstick from his
          cheek.

          EXT. THE STREET -NIGHT

          's in her overcoat over her longjohns. She looks down
          the road and blanches as she sees WALTER trotting towards...
          The road in front of him, a two-lane blacktop with CARS and
          TRUCKS streaming by at high speed.

                         RACHEL
          Walter!
          And she breaks into a run. WALTER looks back, starts
          running, this is all fun for him.
          There's the low BLEAT of a TRUCK'S HORN and then...
          The high, piercing SQUEAL of a wounded animal.
          In the road, WALTER, laying flat, keening in pain.
          She runs to him and in one continuous motion SCOOPS him into
          her arms.
          RACHEL, in the middle of the two lanes. She turns as.__

                         HEADLIGHTS
          approach, fast.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.
          She stumbles under the dog's weight, tries flagging down a
          car.

                         RACHEL
          Help me! Please!
          It speeds past, dangerously close. Another set of LIGHTS.

                         RACHEL
          Stop! Please, stop!
          But the CAR passes, blaring its horn. She spins,around.
          is bearing down on her. She holds her ground.

                         RACHEL
          THE CAR'S WINDSHIELD -- CRACKS, crazes, as if it hit with a
          sharp, fierce projectile.
          THE CAR -- lays down rubber as it screeches to a halt.
          JESSE is at the wheel. Sees through the crazed windshield:
          RACHEL, splattered with dog's blood.
          He gets out, stares at his'windshield, shaken-up, groping for
          some explanation.

                         JESSE
          Damn. What... damn.
          RACHEL staggers up to him, holding a shivering mass of fur.

                         RACHEL

                         PLEASE--

                         JESSE
          Oh, my god.

          . JESSE'S CAR - NIGHT
          JESSE driving. RACHEL sits next to him, hugging the dog.

                         RACHEL
          It's my fault. He should have been in
          bed with me.

                         JESSE
          Everything's gonna be all right.
          His voice is not entirely convincing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.
          Through the spidered windshield: The car's headlights pierce
          the night.

          INT. THE VET'S PET CLINIC - NIGHT

          A craftsman bungalow which serves as a vet's hospital. The
          only light is over a FEMALE VET in her bathrobe, tending to
          WALTER on a shiny examining table. There are runnels on both
          sides of the table, for the blood.
          RACHEL and JESSE stand nearby.

                         RACHEL
          His name's Walter. will he be
          all right?
          The VET's intensely focused on inserting an I.V. into the
          dog.

                         VET
          You two had best wait outside.

                         JESSE
          Let's go. Best thing's to let her
          do her work.
          JESSE gently guides RACHEL away, who keeps looking back at
          her dog.

          THE WAITING ROOM - NIGHT
          RACHEL and JESSE on a couch in the darkened room. She's
          rocking herself, caked with blood. He tries to comfort her.

                         JESSE
          Your dog's gonna be okay.
          She nods, unconvinced.

                         JESSE
          God, I almost roadkilled you.
          Are you sure you're all right?
          She nods. They hear a muffled, "pmt", from the VET in the
          examining room. JESSE tries to take RACHEL's mind off it.

                         JESSE
          That tattoo on your arm, its pretty.
          Hurt a lot when you got it?

                         RACHEL
          some.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.

                         JESSE
          Yeah?

                         RACHEL
          But it's... you know, like the song
          says, you hurt yourself to see if
          you can still feel.

                         (BEAT)
          I'm sorry.

                         JESSE
          For what?

                         RACHEL
          For making you--

                         JESSE
          No problem. Glad to help, you know.

                         RACHEL
          And I'm sorry about your windshield,
          about your car.

                         JESSE
          How bizarre was that,, huh? Anyway,
          wasn't your fault.

                         RACHEL
          You can be sorry for things that
          aren't your fault.
          The VET enters, drying her hands. RACHEL sits up, bracing
          herself for the bad news. JESSE puts an arm around her seat
          back, getting ready to hold her.

                         VET
          Walter's banged up pretty bad, lost
          quite a bit of blood, but he's gonna
          make it.

                         RACHEL
          Can I see him?

                         VET
          Come back tomorrow, any time after
          eight.

          EXT. HOUSE OF BREAKFAST - NIGHT

          Your typical I.H.O.P. JESSE's CAR is parked in the lot.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.

          INT. BATHROOM, HOUSE OF BREAKFAST - NIGHT

          RACHEL's at the sink, washing the dog's blood from her arms.
          A WOMAN walks in, sees her. Looks alarmed.
          INT. HOUSE OF BREAKFAST - NIGi4T
          As RACHEL moves through the restaurant, THREE PATRONS stare,
          stare, stare at the blood stains on her coat.
          She slides into a booth with JESSE. He's eating eggs.

                         JESSE
          Better. You don't look like a mass-
          murderer now.
          She smiles, sips a coffee. A country song comes on the
          jukebox.

                         JESSE
          Wow, this music. Guess we should just
          count ourselves lucky it ain't Hanson.

                         RACHEL
          (a weak smile)
          Lisa hLUd them.

                         JESSE
          She was a friend of yours?
          She nods.

                         JESSE
          really sorry.

                         RACHEL
          Sometimes I'd see someone, from
          behind, and I'd know, I'd just know,
          it was Lisa. And then she'd turn
          ound, and it wasn't. But sometimes,
          you know, it was. And now...

                         (PAUSES)
          Whenever I see someone who looks like
          her, and she turns around...
          it won't be... ever.
          They both go quiet, not knowing what to say.

                         JESSE
          (looks at his latch)
          Wow. It's late. "ve got football
          practice tomorrow.

                         RACHEL
          I know. I hope I didn't ru;.n

                         JESSE
          No, if it wasn't for you I wouldn't
          have had this nutritious medl,

                         RACHEL
          You're very polite, for a jock.

                         JESSE
          The compliments, they just keep on
          comin'.
          He drops some money on the table.

                         RACHEL
          I don't have any--

                         JESSE
          's cool, I got it. Can I give you a
          Et home or something?
          I can walk

                         JESSE
          Yeah, right.

                         RACHEL
          Or hitchhike.

                         JESSE
          Right.

                         RACHEL

                         (SMILES)
          or I could wait for my limo,

                         JESSE

                         (SMILES)
          You could. You could just wait fo
          that limo.

          He pulls up in front of RACHEL's house and kills

                         JESSE

                         WEL

                         RACHEL
          Thank you. For everything.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

                         JESSE
          I guess I'll see you in school
          tomorrow?

                         RACHEL
          Sure.

                         JESSE
          You'll let me know how Walter's doing?

                         RACHEL
          Yeah.

                         JESSE
          Good night.
          He extends his hand. She takes it.
          3i2!
          The SHOCK of static electricity. Their words are
          simultaneous.

                         RACHEL
          Dry weather.

          Acrylic sweater.
          They both laugh. Then go quiet. Then just stare at each
          other. Then the moment is gone.
          RACHEL gets out of the car, through the gate, back inside her
          house. JESSE watches her go. Starts his engine, and his car

          WIPES THE FRAME TO:

          EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

          RACHEL crossing the lot. Her HEARTBEAT can be heard. She
          looks up, sees LISA approaching the roof's edge. RACHEL's
          heart sounds like its bursting from her chest.

                         RACHEL
          Lisa don't! Somebody stop her! Stop!
          SLOW MOTION -- LISA falls through the air towards the car,
          arms outstretched, hair trailing like black flames.
          SMASH -- she goes through the windshield, but the face is

          RACHEL'S.

          SLAM CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

          NT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          RACHEL's eyes pop open as her body jerks awake, heart,
          pounding. She looks around, realizes where she is.

          FADE TO BLACK:

                         A SUPER:

          T U E S D
          Under which is heard:

          KELTON (V.O.)
          "For a moment, I thought someone was
          actually seeing me. But it was all a
          lie..."

          INT. GUIDANCE OFFICE - DAY

          SHERIFF KELTON is reading from a photocopy of Lisa's
          SUE and RACHEL sit-,in chairs.

                         KELTON
          "Eric lied when he said I was special.
          And I guess I was lying to myself when
          I believed him."
          He folds the note.

                         SUE
          Rachel, is there anything in there
          that strikes a chord for you? Do you
          know what Lisa was referring to?

                         RACHEL
          (after a moment)
          Yesterday morning, she told me she'd,
          uh, lost her virginity.
          KELTON looks at SUE, produces the photo of LISA with ERIC.

                         KELTON
          You recognize this boy?

                         RACHEL
          Sure. Eric Stark. He's on the team.
          KELTON gestures to SUE and they step out into...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

                         THE HALLWAY
          with another "Heat Carlin!" banner in the background.

                         KELTON
          What do you think?

                         SUE
          Robbie, I had a Freshman crying in the
          hall last week. I couldn't get
          anything out of her, but her friend
          told me a football player slept with
          her, then dumped her.

                         KELTON
          Nothing illegal about breaking a
          girl's heart.

                         SUE
          Eric's 18. Lisa was 15. That's
          statutory rape.

                         KELTON
          That's a stretch.

                         SUE
          Then let's make it. I don't know
          what's going on around here, but if
          that's what it takes to stop it, let's
          stop it, before someone else's
          daughter kills herself.

                         KELTON
          All right. I'll look into it.

                         THE OFFICE
          SUE sits behind her desk, with RACHEL before her.

                         SUE
          How are you feeling?

                         RACHEL
          okay. Fine. Can I go no
          SUE opens a file on her desk.

                         SUE
          I was looking at chic last night.
          it says here your mom's in Arkham.

                         (BEAT)
          How's your mom doing?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

                         RACHEL
          She's gonna be fine.

                         SUE
          I spent some time up there.
          As a patient.
          RACHEL looks surprised.

                         SUE
          Does that surprise you?

                         RACHEL
          I guess. I mean, you seem pretty
          normal.

                         SUE
          Thanks. i try. You visit your moat
          often?

                         SUE
          Is that scary for you?

                         RACHEL
          Why?

                         SUE
          Well, children of schizophrenics
          sometimes live with the fear of it
          happening to them. At your age,
          it's perfectly normal to be afraid
          of turning out like your parents.

                         RACHEL
          Normal, huh? Get real, I know I'm
          ten times more likely to get it
          than most people.

                         SUE
          You're right. I'm sorry. So.
          You've been in a series of foster
          homes since you were, what, four?

                         RACHEL N

                         SUE
          How's your foster family?

                         RACHEL
          They're happy, - 'z-rig as they get
           their check every month.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

                         SUE
          What about your real father?

                         RACHEL
          Never met the gentleman. My mom
          won't even tell me his name.
          RACHEL stares at a ceramic MUG of coffee, very close o the
          edge of the desk.

                         SUE
          Rachel, in a way, you've lost your
          mother. And now you've lost a friend.
          Losing someone can be a very lonely,
          painful place to be.

                         RACHEL

                         (QUIETLY)
          You're right, I.lost my mom, I lost my,
          friend, the people who cared about me.
          But you only get paid to care.

                         SUE
          I really do care. How can I show you
          that I do?
          RACHEL is silent, staring at the MUG.

                         SUE
          Rachel?
          But RACHEL's shut off, pushing down a storm of emotions.

                         SUE
          You know, this room is a place where
          if you have feelings, you can talk
          about them. You can let them out.
          RACHEL shifts. SUE sees RACHEL's forearm near the coffee
          MUG. And, as if by proximity alone, it EDGES off the end of
          the desk --
          And FALLS --
          RACHEL catches it in one smooth motion just before it hits.

                         RACHEL
          sorry. I must've knocked it.
          SUE, the color draining from her face.

                         SUE
          I didn't... see you knock it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.
          The DOOR swings open and the PRINCIPAL walks in, lays a
          computer printout on her desk.

                         PRINCIPAL
          Sue, could you update the absentee
          lists, see who we have to call?

                         SUE

                         (DAZED)
          ure... sure.
          She turns, and RACHEL is gone.

          NT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
          ERIC is at his locker, wearing his BULLDOG letter jacket. He
          closes his locker to find RACHEL approaching him,
          intimidated, but determined. She looks him in the eyes.

                         RACHEL

                         (LOW)
          know. I know what you did.
          A chill goes through him. Not saying a word, he turns, walks
          through the crowd, looks back.
          She's still rooted, staring him down.

          EXT. FREAK HALL - LUNCH

          ARNIE plays hackey-sack behind RACHEL, who sits on the steps.
          She looks up, sees a BULLDOG letter jacket standing over her.
          It's JESSE.

                         JESSE
          Hi. How's Walter?

                         RACHEL

                         (COLD)
          Good. I'm picking him up today. Why
          aren't you hanging out with your
          friends over there?

                         JESSE

                         (TAKEN ABACK)
          What's up? What's wrong?
          She sees the hurt look in his eyes and softens.

                         RACHEL
          What do you wane from me?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.

                         JESSE
          I just wanted to, you know, see
          how you're doing.
          Over his shoulder she can see the stir his presence aC Freak
          Hall is causing among...

          THE PATIO GIRLS
          MONICA taps TRACY on the shoulder, who's checking her makeup
          in a compact mirror.

                         MONICA
          Look at Jesse, talking to a burnout.
          TRACY turns, slips on a stylish pair of DKNY glasses.

                         TRACY
          She's not very good in daylight is
          she? wonder where she keeps her
          coffin.

                         BACK ON:

                         JESSE
          So you'll meet me tonight, at the

                         PIZZA PLACE--

                         RACHEL
          --yeah. Okay.

                         JESSE
          (smiles, as he backs away)
          Okay. See you. Tonight.
          ARNIE sees the Patio Girls glancing at RACHEL. She sits an
          ARNIE nudges her.

                         ARNIE
          What'd he want?

                         RACHEL
          He asked me out.

                         ARNIE
          What'd you say?

                         RACHEL
          I said, "Okay, its your funeral."

                         ARNIE
          Pardon me, but is hanging out with
          jockboy such a hot idea? I mean,

                         ARNIE (CONT'D)
          I heard he's dating Tracy Campbell,
          who is giving you the look of a
          thousand deaths right now.
          RACHEL casually turns to take in TRACY, then turns away. Her
          heart sinks.

                         RACHEL
          She's beautiful.

                         ARNIE
          Duh.

          INT. FOOTBALL LOCKER ROOM - DAY

          CLOSE ON a TV SET showing game highlights of last year's
          Bulldog game against the Carlin Cougars.

          WALSH (O.S.)
          All right, as you can see from last
          year's tape, the Carlin Cougars are a
          tough, physical team. So Friday,
          it's gonna be kill or be killed.
          COACH WALSH, a charmless John Wayne, stands near the TV. The
          BULLDOGS sit on benches before him.
          On the VIDEO -.- MARK misses an easy block. WALSH points.

                         WALSH
          Here, we can see mark Sing kissing an
          opposing player good-bye.
          There are hoots of derision from the other PLAYERS. MARK
          nods. ERIC leans into MARK, speaks low.

                         ERIC
          You didn't get the picture?

                         MARK
          Bitch wouldn't give it to me. Stay
          frosty, no one else knows anything.
          It's still at the photomat, I'll
          get it.

          WALSH (O.S.)
          You two ladies back there gossiping?
          No, sir.

          WALSH (O.S. )
          Excellent. Then you can give me fifty
          when we hit the field.

          EXT. FOOTBALL PRACTICE - DAY

          JESSE and BRAD rest on a bench in their uniforms as MARK an
          ERIC do push-ups. The COACH stands on a blocking sled with
          PLAYERS Pounding into it.

                         WALSH
          C'mon girls, those are love taps!
          (sees Chuck give a weak block)
          Potter, show me you're a dog.

                         CHUCK
          Aww, coach.

                         WALSH
          You know the drill.
          The other PLAYERS begin a BARKING CHANT. CHUCK strips off
          his helmet, jogs to the bench and opens a styrofoam cooler,
          within it are slabs of raw steak on blood soaked ice..

                         WALSH
          Show me you're a dog, Potter.
          The barking rises as the PLAYERS psyche up CHUCK, who chews
          off a bite of the raw meat. JESSE whispers to MARK...

                         JESSE
          I hate this bullshit.

                         MARK
          Not me. I love it.
          MARK pops up, grabs a steak, rips off a bite, and runs full
          tilt at the, blocking tackle, smashing into it with meaning.

                         WALSH
          You're a piece of work, Bing.
          MARK takes a bow as he jogs away, chewing. He spots the
          SHERIFF's CRUISER pulling --p to the practice field.

          INT. A BUS - DAY

          RACHEL hugs her dog, who 'Looks a mess; hind legs bandaged, a
          funny cone around his head.
          TWO OLD LADIES are staring at RACHEL, unsure if they're more
          appalled by her appearance or the doge.
          WALSH c `1.O . )

          EXT. FOOTBALL PRACTICE- LATER

          WALSH drill sergeants over MARK and the other PLAYERS as they
          do drills. The CHEERLEADERS run their practice in the'
          background.
          on the sideline, SHERIFF KELTON is talking to ERIC, who's
          sweating bullets as he fiddles with his helmet.
          MARK watches ERIC, so intent he bobbles a ball thrown to him.

                         KELTON
          So, you're saying you never met or
          talked to Lisa Parker?

                         ERIC
          No, sir. Never.
          KELTON produces the photo of LISA and ERIC.

                         N
          Eric, who's this you're hanging onto,
          a ghost?
          ERIC blanches.
          MARK watches KELTON leading ERIC away with WALSH.

          KENNEL - DAY
          A pinball machine as MARK plays, applying some body English
          to it. A wired ERIC enters, a bundle of violent energy.

                         MARK
          What happened?

                         ERIC

                         (ANGRY)
          Kelton, man, with that sheriff's badge
          he pulled out of a cereal box.
          Somebody told him I did Lisa. He
          nails me with a picture of me and her,
          starts talking statutory rape.

                         MARK
          Relax, that's bullshit. Your dad's a
          lawyer, he'll kill that talk dead.

                         ERIC
          So I'm suspended. And Coach, Coach he
          up and does this scene where he says,
          "give me your helmet."

                         MARK
          What about Carlin?

                         ERIC
          What about Carlin? Game of the year,
          football scouts are gonna be there and
          I'm gonna be sittin' on the bench with
          my thumb up my...
          (shoves the machine in anger)
          You said you were gonna get the
          pictures.

                         MARK
          I tried. That Rachel bitch wouldn't
          give'em to me..

                         ERIC
          She's the one who put me and Lisa
          together. Shit. what are we gonna
          do, Mark?

          EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

          BRAD and CHUCK are throwing unfurling TOILET PAPER rolls onto
          the trees in front of someone's middle-class house.

                         BRAD
          Who's place is this, again?

                         CHUCK
          Nimrod. It's Carlin's quarterback.
          MARK and ERIC pull up in Mark's Mustang convertible.

                         MARK

                         (WHISTLES LOUDLY)
          Hey, dogs! C'mon, we got a mission.
          BRAD and CHUCK run to MARK's car, jump over and into the back
          as MARK peels out.

          'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
          A HAND WIPES shower steam off a mirror, revealing a wet
          RACHEL, a towel wrapped around her.

                         RACHEL
          jy are going to be late.
          She hears her doorbell go off.

          THE FRONT DOOR
          as RACHEL opens the door.

                         RACHEL
          What'd you forget your--
          There's nobody there.

                         (WEAKLY)
          --keys?
          She looks around, closes the door, locks it, wraps her towel
          tighter.

                         LIVING ROOM
          As she crosses back to her room. There's a KNOCKING on the
          kitchen back door. She frowns, goes to the back door, looks
          through the glass. No one there either. Now she's worried.

          . ' RACHEL
          (calls through the door)
          Boyd? Emilyn?
          She turns when the DOOR HANDLE on the front door JIGGLES
          once. She stops dead. Spins as...
          The BACK DOOR handle starts JIGGLING.
          She backs into the living room and spins as--
          Something starts TAPPING on one of the living room WINDOWS.
          Like a wave moving around her, a WINDOW on the other side
          starts TAPPING.
          RACHEL turns a full circle, scared, surrounded by TAPPING and
          JIGGLING, which grow increasingly loud r.
          She puts her palms against her temples, as if struggling to
          keep something bottled inside:

                         RACHEL
          Oh, god, oh, god. Not now. Stop
          Suddenly all goes silent. She jumps as...
          The PHONE RINGS near her. She scoops up the cordless. Beat.

                         RACHEL
          Hello?

          There's a long pause on the other end.

          MALE VOICE (V.0.)

          EXT. RACHEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          MARK on a CELL-PHONE. BRAD starts laughing next to him as
          MARK covers the receiver, gestures to ERIC and CHUCK, who
          scurry around Rachel's house.

          RACHEL (V.O.)
          Who is this?

          WITHIN THE HOUSE
          sees a SHADOW run past a window.

          MARK (V.O.)
          who is Wig?

                         RACHEL
          Knock it off. Is this you, Arnie?

          MARK (V.0)
          Ding, ding, ding. Wrgnq, guess again.

                         RACHEL
          What do you want?

          MARK (V.0.)
          (a menacing pause)
          You.
          The JIGGLING and the TAPPING starts up again, loud. The BOYS
          VOICES are heard outside chanting...

                         BULLDOGS
          Rachel! Rachel! Rachel!
          MARK (V.o.)
          Rachel, come out and play now.
          RACHEL grabs a knife from the kitchen, backs into...

                         HER BEDROOM
          where a bandaged WALTER is on the bed, looking alarmed.
          RACHEL keeps backing up, nearing her open closet door.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         RACHEL
          I'm calling the police.
          She hangs up, dials 911, fumbling with the knife.

                         UT TO:

          INT. PIZZA PARLOR - NIGHT

           A beer-and-slice emporium. JESSE'S at a payphone, hearing a
          bus y sianal on RACHEL Is line. He hangs up.

           INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          A horror-movie-moment as RACHEL waits for 911 to pick-up.
          Behind her, a HAND is reaching through the open sash window,
          pulling it up to gain entrance.

          RACHEI.

                         (INTO PHONE)
          I have an emergency. Now, right now!
          Yes, 3366 Elm Street...
          She turns, sees the HAND at the window.

                         RACHEL
          No!
          The WINDOW SMASHES down on the intruder's HAND. There's a
          muffled YELL outside and the HAND is extracted.

          EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT

          Headlights light up MARK's face as BOYD and EMILYN's beat-up
          STATION WAGON approaches the house.
          MARK whistles loudly.
          And takes off, joined by ERIC, clutching his injured hand.

          â¢ SE - NIGHT
           RACHEL, still stunned by what just happened. The cordless in
          her hand speaks:

           911 OPERATOR (V.O. )
           Hello? Hello, :Ma'am, you still there?
          RACHEL slowly moves to tier bedroom doorway. BOYD comes in
          the front door.

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Yes. It's okay. Things are fine.
          She hangs up as a clueless BOYD takes in her freaked-out
          appearance.

                         BOYD
          What's wrong?

                         RACHEL
          Nothing.
          She retreats into her bedroom, looks at the Window. The
          PHONE RINGS in her hand. She answers.

          MARK (V.0.)
          Don't go tellin' stories about my
          Eric.
          Click and the line goes dead. She hangs up. The PHONE RINGS
          again. She doesn't answer.

          THE LIVING ROOM
          The PHONE RINGS on another extension. EMI, swers.

                         EMILYN
          Hello... just a second. Rachel?

                         RACHEL
          curled on her bed with WALTER, calls out:

          I'm not here.

          EXT. SCHOOL ENTRANCE - DAY

          A SCREAMING DEVIL fills the frame.
          The bed of a speeding PICK-UP TRUCK is jammed with kneeling
          TEENAGE BOYS wearing children's Halloween masks. They're
          screaming bloody murder as they fire RAW EGGS at...
          The BERGEN STUDENTS gathered at the entrance.
          The PICK-UP speeds off as STUDENTS recover, straightening up
          from their ducking positions. MARK and his cohorts go
          running after the truck.

                         TRACY
          Carlin creeps!
          At Freak Hall, ARNIE rises, wipes egg yolk from his hair.

          RACHEL looks up, sees JESSE approaching. Her eyes flare.

                         JESSE
          Hey, what happened to you last night?
          I waited.

                         RACHEL
          You tell me what happened last night.

                         JESSE
          What?
          ON RACHEL and JESSE as she tells him what happened last
          night. He gets more and more agitated.
          TRACY is wearing her glasses as she and MONICA watch JESSE
          from the Patio.

                         TRACY
          What is wrong with this movie:
          does he see in her?

          No, don't... maybe all this isn't such
          a good idea.

                         JESSE
          All what?

                         RACHEL
          I mean, guys like you are supposed to
          date girls like Tracy.

                         JESSE
          I'm picking you up tonight. We're
          gonna have a nice, mellow date.
          RACHEL stands, silent, torn. The BELL RINGS, everybody
          starts filing in.. She moves, he smiles, blocks her way.

                         JESSE
          I'm not going anywhere till you
          say yes.

                         RACHEL

          All right. Okay.
          (he doesn't move a muscle)
          Yes.
          JESSE lets her pass, with a chivalrous after-you sweep of his
          hand, then falls in next to her. RACHEL'S arm is grabbed
          by...

          RACHEL crossing and uncrossing her legs, it's the last place

          What was that? 'hat are you, Miss
          Manners? Show me you're a dog, Ryan.
          JESSE looks at the styrofoam cooler on the bench.
          A few of the nearby PLAYERS begin their barking chant.

                         WALSH
          Say what?
          The barking trails off. The other boys are stunned.

                         BRAD
          Oh, shit.

                         JESSE
          Well, I'm not a dog today, Coach,
          I'm a vegetarian.

                         WALSH
          Since when? Don't give me that.
          Show me you're a dog, Ryan.

                         JESSE
          Sorry, Coach. No can do.

          Your attitude sucks. Hit the showers.
          Get outta my sight.
          JESSE doffs his helmet, jogs to the bench. He douses his
          head with water, sits there, looking angry.

          INT. LOCKER ROOM -

          PLAYERS goof around, snap towels at each other. Clanking
          steel and grunts from the boys at the weight machines.

          LOCKER ROOM SHOWERS
          The mist in a shower, through which are glimpses of a lean
          male figure with rippling stomach muscles. It's JESSE. MARK
          and BRAD enter the showers.

                         BRAD

                         (TO JESSE)
          Yo, lover boy, whatsa matter? Didn't

          Twenty, no, thirty.
          They fingertip high-five each other.

          Jess, you score the skank yet?
          JESSE just glares at him, walks away.

                         MARK
          What's with him?

                         BRAD
          Must be that time of the month.

          THE LOCKER ROOM
          JESSE finishes dressing between the lockers. MARK, wearing a
          towel, approaches him.

                         MARK
          Jess, what's the matter?

                         JESSE
          You. What's with the stunt you pulled
          last night?

                         MARK
          What? Papering McCabe's house?
          I asked you if you--

                         JESSE
          What you did at Rachel's.

                         MARK
          what? We were just sendin' her
          a message.
          JESSE slams his locker closed.

                         JESSE
          Tell me, I'll pass it on.

                         MARK
          Look, man. She's getting Eric in all
          kinds a shit. I mean, if he gets
          charged with rape, there goes any

                         CHANCE OF--

                         JESSE
          Screw Eric, he's a big boy. He made
          his own decisions, he's gotta live
          with 'em. And stay away from Rachel,
          or deal with me.

                         MARK
          What are you getting bent for? She's
          just a burnout, a slut--
          BANG as JESSE shoves MARK against a locker. MARK shoves him
          back. The rest of the PLAYERS in the background go quiet.

                         JESSE
          (low, intense)
          Don't call her a skank, don't call
          her a slut.

                         MARK
          What's wrong with you?

                         JESSE
          We screw with girls, use them, because
          it makes us feel like big men--

                         MARK
          Get to the bad part.

          ' - JESSE
          I'm tired. I'm tired of all of it.

                         MARK
          What are you talking about? We're
          friends, we're all friends.

                         JESSE
          No. We just grew up together.
          And he walks away. On MARK. Pissed. He sees JESSE left his
          letter jacket behind, hanging on the locker.

          Well, first, I thought I saw the devil

          people's faces looking... deformed,
          like they'd had plastic surgery, or the
          bones were moving under their skin.

                         (LAUGHS)
          For a while, I thought I had this bi

          There is something different about

          I heard about the good work you're
          doing at the high school.
          The PATIENT turns and softly starts thudding his forehead

          She has a... a disease, a genetic
          disorder I think her father passed on
          to her. I need to know so I can help
          her. Who was her father, Mrs. Lang?
          es SUE, then goes quiet, lost in her memories.

                         (SMILES)
          I did tell Rachel how I met him. He
          said it was love at first sight.
          I was his waitress. I insisted he try
          the cherry pie, 'cause I'd baked it
          myself. He said, with every bite of
          that pie, he could see our future
          together. By the time he got to the
          crust, he could see what I would look
          like, all old and saggy... and he
          still loved me.
          (her smile fades, then)
          He left me after Rachel was born.
          I never told her because, people
          around here aren't too fond of Carrie
          White, for what she did. I didn't
          want her having to grow up with that.
          His name was Ralph. Ralph White.

          So they are half-sisters.

          EXT. MINIATURE GOLF COURSE - NIGHT

          A castle, a windmill, and yards of worn astroturf. One of
          those places you go for fun if you're young and the city's
          too far away.
          MONTAGE -- of RACHEL and JESSE on their date, playing,
          laughing.
          -- JESSE takes a swing, muffs a shot, tosses his club.
          -- A tricky par-four hole, featuring a dogleg and a slope to
          the cup. RACHEL hits the ball. And it rolls a hole-in-one.
          -- She leaps in the air with joy. Behind her, JESSE feigns
          dropping dead.

          EXT. MONARCH MOTORS - NIGHT

          A sign reads: MONARCH MOTORS, below it are a row of USED
          CARS for sale, hoods open, like circus animals begging for
          peanuts.

          JESSE (V.O.)
          That's my dad's dealership. Y
          all that will be mine.

          EXT. WITHIN JESSE'S CAR - NIGHT

          JESSE driving. RACHEL has her hand on the big HURST
          stickshift between the two bucket seats. He accelerates and
          RACHEL expertly shifts the gear.

                         JESSE
          You are good. I'm impressed.

                         RACHEL
          My foster-dad taught me on his semi
          truck. Where we going?

          EXT. THE HILL - NIGHT

          The twinkling lights of Bergen below. Stars above. RACH
          and JESSE lay on the hood of his car, leaning against the
          windshield.

                         JESSE
          Before he sold cars, my dad wanted to
          write this book: One Hundred Senators
          Pick Their Favorite Restaurants.' So,
          he wrote, to all of them.

                         RACHEL
          All of them?

                         JESSE
          Dear Senator So-and-so, I am writing
          a book.

                         RACHEL
          Anybody answer?

                         JESSE
          Yes. No. Sort of.
          She laughs.

                         JESSE
          He got two letters back. one was a
          form letter which said, 'Thank you
          for your support.'

                         RACHEL
          And the other?

                         JESSE
          The other was from Hubert Humphrey.

                         RACHEL
          Who?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

                         JESSE
          He was the vice-President once.
          He wrote back a three page letter,
          raving about a place called Wally's
          Burger Hut. My dad was knocked-out.

                         RACHEL
          So your dad wrote a book, color me
          impressed.

                         JESSE
          He never wrote it. Or he was going
          to, and then my sister was born, and
          then I was born. And there was this
          car dealership, and it was security.
          So your dad wanted to be a writer.
          How'd his kid end up being this sweaty
          armpit jock?

                         JESSE

                         (BEAT)
          Sometimes when they throw me the ball,
          it feels like time just slows down.
          And I know where to be and how to get
          there. When I have that feeling I
          catch it. Always. Every time.

                         RACHEL
          And you like that.

                         JESSE
          Yeah, I love it. Except. My dad.
          He's got my life all mapped out. He
          wants me to take over the business.

                         RACHEL
          What's wrong with that? Sounds like a
          nice life.

                         JESSE
          Selling used cars is not what I want.
          And, unless I nail that football
          scholarship,' that's what I'll get.

                         (EXHALES)
          Wow. I can't believe I'm telling you
          all this. I've never said any of this
          out loud to anyone before.
          (takes a long look at her)
          Must be great not having to be like
          anyone else.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

                         RACHEL
          It's not so great. Sometimes I wish I
          could just be one of the shiny, happy
          people. Does that surprise you?

                         JESSE
          Everything about you surprises me.
          There's the soft pops of rain hitting the car as it begins to
          drizzle, then it comes down hard.

          WITHIN THE CAR
          RACHEL and JESSE are in front, facing each other, leaning
          against the doors as rain streams against the windows.

                         RACHEL

                         (SITS FORWARD)
          I used to know this guy, could suck a
          strand of spaghetti through his mouth
          and out his nose. He called it Brain
          Flossing.
          JESSE smiles.

                         RACHEL
          He had a talent. You. You got
          football. It'll get you outta this
          place. You can make your own path
          after that. Write your own book.

                         JESSE
          Yeah? Want to come with me?
          She smiles. He leans forward. And she pulls away-, afraid,
          then decides to let him. They kiss. Then she pulls away.

                         JESSE
          What?

                         HEL
          This...
          She indicates the gear shift.

                         HEL
          is poking me right in the ribs.
          JE55E's eyes flicker to the back seat.

                         RACHEL
          Um, I don't know how to say this.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

                         JESSE
          Yeah?

                         RACHEL
          But I've never...

                         JESSE
          Oh.

                         RACHEL
          And, I'd want it to be special. Like
          you ring the doorbell, with flowers
          in your hand.

                         JESSE
          Right. So... what's your favorite
          flower?

                         RACHEL

                         (SMILES)
          Daisies.

          in his car. The street's wet, but it's stopped raining.
          RACHEL gives him a quick kiss goodnight.

                         RACHEL

                         SEE YOU--

                         JESSE
          --later.
          She pulls away, exits, closes the door for the--

                         CUT TO:

          INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          RASE sleeps fitfully, tangled in her sheets.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. THE WOODS - NIGHT

          A massive GOTHIC BED sits incongruously in a clearing.

          RACHEL AND JESSE
          are making love. She's on top, her hands on his chest.
          Their glistening bodies catch the light of a RING OF FLAMES
          bursting around the bed.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

                         RACHEL'S HANDS
          suddenly sink into the flesh of JESSE's chest.
          She SCREAMS as she tries to extract them,. but strips of his
          flesh stick to her like flypaper.
          RACHEL twists violently as her torso melds into his.
          Their bodies fuse, a grotesque apparition with four legs and
          two heads.
          Her mouth presses into his as their faces merge.
          The ring of fire leaps inward, consuming the bed.

          EXT. FREAK HALL - MORNING

          RACHEL sits, lost in thought. JESSE nears. She stands up.

                         JESSE
          So, you're coming to the game, right?

                         RACHEL
          I don't really get football.

                         JESSE
          C'mon. I need you, for good luck.

                         RACHEL
          All right. I'll be there.

                         JESSE
          Good. I have practice today, but I
          can pick you up later, seven thirty?

                         RACHEL
          Sure, go practice. Go be great.
          Live the life you want.

                         JESSE
          What kind of life do you want?

          I don't know. I have a hard time
          picturing it.

                         JESSE
          Well if you can't, I'll do it for you.

                         RACHEL
          What do you mean?

                         JESSE
          I will predict your future.

                         RACHEL
          Uh-huh. Can I get a hint?

                         JESSE
          'm in it.
          ON THE PATIO -- are TRACY, MARK and MONICA, watching the.

                         TRACY
          If he's gonna do it, you know, be seen
          talking in public with someone else,
          he should show some respect.
          (a slow boil)
          He should show me the respect, at
          least, to be seen with someone pretty.
          Someone cool. Someone who counts.
          Amy or you, you know, ate.
          Instead, it's Its. And I feel...

                         MONICA
          Disrespected?

                         TRACY
          That's right. I wish there was
          something I could do to make him come
          to his senses.
          On MARK's face, a slow, insidious grin that seems to spread
          into eternity appears.

                         TRACY
          What?

                         MARK
          Let's nail the bitch. Plan
          a way to screw her like she's
          screwing us.

          RACHEL watches SUE at the door, speaking to her TEACHER.
          SUE points to RACHEL, who looks less than thrilled.

          EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

          A dark smudge is spread on the empty parking space where LISA
          died. No one parks there anymore.
          SUE is escorting RACHEL to her VOLVO.

          RACHEL (V.0.)
          Where are you taking me?

          SUE (V.0.)
          There's something you have to see.

          EXT. THE WOODS - DAY

          A DREAM-LIKE GLIDE past SUE's VOLVO, parked on the roadside,
          and through the trees.

          SUE (V.0.)
          This used to be the school for the
          whole district. Chamberlain High.
          It was closed down in 1976.

          SUE (V.0.)
          There was a fire here that year.
          The night of the prom. Seventy-three
          people died. A few of us survived.

          INT. THE DESTROYED GYM - DAY

          Dark; full of exposed wires, metal rods and pipes, countless
          empty beer cans. Two mattresses are laid out amid the
          debris.
          SUE stands on a pile of rubble, next to RACHEL. There's a
          haunted look on SUE's face.

          STROBING IMAGES of CARRIE WHITE, drenched in pig's blood.
          Sounds of horrible SCREAMING.
          Flashes of.KIDS stampeding. Burning. Dying.
          A fire rages behind CARRIE as she steps off a platform, turns
          and looks at us with the face of an avenging angel.

          BACK TO.

          THE DESTROYED GYM,
          present day, as SUE flinches.

                         SUE
          I haven't really been here in over
          twenty years. But it feels like I've
          been back here every day since.

                         RACHEL
          Happy homecoming. Can we go? This
          place is spooky. Gives me the creeps.

                         SUE
          Do you know what happened here?

                         RACHEL
          You just said. A fire.

                         SUE
          What caused it?

                         RACHEL
          They think a boiler blew up, okay?
          Am I gonna be graded on this?

          Come on, you've heard of Carrie White.

                         RACHEL
          (kicks a can)
          Everybody has.

                         SUE
          And?

                         RACHEL

                         (SIGHS)
          Supposedly, she set the fire, as part

          of a revenge-suicide thing. Elvis was
          her date and they escaped in a U.F.O.
          I know what happened to that
          snow dome, on my desk.

                         RACHEL

                         (BEAT)
          It fell.

                         SUE
          We both saw it.
          RACHEL looks at her, isn't going to talk about this.

                         SUE
          I know everything there is to know
          about Carrie White. She did this.
          It began with what you did, with
          the snow dome. Then it got out
          of control.

                         RACHEL

                         (TURNS)
          I'm cold. Let's go.

                         SUE
          It's a genetic recessive trait. The
          male is the carrier, when he combines
          with the right female, the trait
          surfaces in their offspring, usually
          in women. Like King's Disease,
          hemophilia.

                         RACHEL
          What are you saying I have?

                         SUE
          Its a trait, Rachel, you inherited.
          Telekinesis.

                         RACHEL
          With all respect, lady, you're
          seriously bat-shit. I'm walking,
          back to the real world.
          SUE's voice is low, quiet.

                         SUE
          Your mother told me your father was
          Ralph White. Carrie's father.
          It stops RACHEL in her tracks.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

                         RACHEL
          I don't believe you. She never told
          me, why would she tell you?

                         SUE
          You need help--
          Like what? Like they helped you?

                         SUE
          Yes. No.

                         RACHEL
          So then it's Arkham for me?

                         SUE
          No. I can help you, get it under
          control.

                         RACHEL
          You want to know what I'm feeling
          today? `Happy. Happier than I've
          ever been. So I don't want or need
          your help.
          RACHEL runs off. SUE follows, trips on the rubble, falls.

                         SUE

          INT. FOOTBALL LOCKER ROOM - DAY

          JESSE stands at his locker, dressing. MARK approaches.

                         MARK
          Hey.
          (no response from Jesse)
          Just wanted to say two things.
          I'm sorry. Maybe I overreacted.

                         JESSE
          Don't play with me.

                         MARK
          I'm not. We've been friends since
          we could both pee standing up. And I
          thought we'd be best friends forever.

                         (BEAT)
          Never thought some girl could come
          between that. Look, I know I'm scum.
          I'm lower than scum, I'm smegma, I'm
          butt lint.

          I'm sorry.

                         JESSE
          I'm not the one you should be
          apologizing to.

                         MARK
          You're right. I'll come up with a way

          Light streams in through the slatted blinds. The young D.A.
          is at his desk. MR. STARK, Eric's attorney father, sits
          across from him with ERIC. SHERIFF KELTON and COACH WALSH:
          also sit in chair's.

                         STARK
          You're not really thinking of pressing
          charges against my son.

          D.A.
          We're doing more than just thinking.

                         WALSH
          I need the boy for the game.

                         STARK
          Robbie, we've known each other a long
          time, since you were a Bulldog.

                         KELTON
          Save it, Lou. Sue Snell told me there
          were other girls--

                         WALSH
          Those kinds of girls know what they're
          getting in to. Eric's a good kid, he
          may be guilty of some youthful

                         TRANSGRESSIONS--

                         KELTON
          Youthful transgressions? A girl
          killed herself.

          The door opens and the town's MAYOR walks in, grey-haired,
          distinguished, with an air of authority.

          D.A.

                         (NODS)
          Mr. Mayor.

                         MAYOR
          Sit, everybody, sit, 'm just
          listening in.
          He leans against the desk, arms folded..

                         STARK

                         (BEAT)
          Okay. Cards on the table. My boy
          isn't going down alone then.

          D.A.
          Go on.

                         STARK
          He hasn't done anything other boys on
          the team haven't done. Eric can even
          get proof of it. Mark Bing, Jesse
          Ryan, Chuck Potter, Brad Winters.

                         (PAUSES)
          Now, there will be college scouts at
          the game Friday. Eric takes a fall,
          I'll make sure they all do. You want
          to be responsible for tarnishing all
          these boys lives?

                         MAYOR
          Well. I think that about sums it up.
          He looks at the D.A., as if to give him his cue.

          D.A.
          Robbie, I just don't think I have
          enough evidence to ruin this boy's
          reputation.

                         KELTON

                         BUT--

          D.A.
          That's it, Robbie. That's all.

                         MAYOR
          Lou, thank you for coming in.
          I'll walk you out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.
          They all stand and shakes hands.
          KELTON sits; seething as he realizes the fix was in before
          ever entered this room. he
          He looks across at ERIC, sitting, a smug look on his face.

          MARK intercepts JESSE as he nears his car.

                         MARK
          Hey, man, I got it. This girl, this
          Rachel, is special to you, huh?

                         JESSE
          Yeah.
          MARK extracts a KEY RING from his jacket, pulls a KEY off.

                         MARK
          The cabin. My folks aren't there.
          Get away from all of us idiots.
          Go have a romantic time.
          JESSE looks at him. MARK tosses the key, JESSE catches it.
          MARK smiles.

                         MARK
          And bring her to my party. I'll show
          you we can be one big, happy family.

          TRACY driving with MONICA as they follow a walking RACHEL.
          RACHEL crosses the street.

                         MONICA
          Finally, she's going into the mall.

                         TRACY
          (an evil smile)
          Perfect. We have the homefield
          advantage.

          INT. SHOPPING MALL, DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

          The cosmetics department of an upscale store, mirrors on
          every counter. A SALESwoMAN sprays perfume samples on
          passing shoppers. She pulls up short as she encounters...
          RACHEL wandering by, out-of-place in her street urchin wear.
          The PERFUME WOMAN watches RACHEL pass.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.
          Stopping at a counter, RACHEL takes in the vast array of
          makeup, the models on the displays. She sees a YOUNG COUPLE
          go by, very J. Crew, very much in love.
          She turns to her own visage reflected in several mirrors on
          the counter.

                         RACHEL
          (under her breath)
          You're normal.
          At the end of the counter, the PERFUME WOMAN approaches a
          SALESWOMAN helping MONICA.

                         PERFUME
          Karen, watch the girl in black, make
          sure she doesn't pocket anything.
          MONICA turns around to see...
          RACHEL -- staring at a row of-lipsticks. She's startled

                         BY-

                         SALESWOMAN
          Can I help you?

                         RACHEL
          Uh, just looking.
          The woman gives her a smile of devastating insincerity,
          crosses her arms and just stands there. RACHEL gets her
          drift.
          MONICA walks up behind RA

                         MONICA
          Oh, hi. Karen, this is a friend
          of mine from school.
          The SALESWOMAN nods, moves away.

                         RACHEL
          Thought she was gonna frisk me.

                         MONICA
          She does Step Class with my mom.

                         (SMILES)
          You should see the scars from her
          liposuction.
          RACHEL edges way, checking out the lipsticks, but MONICA
          trails her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.

                         MONICA
          What are you looking for?

                         RACHEL
          Nothing. Just lookin'.

                         MONICA
          Is it perhaps, something to wear on a
          date? Perhaps with a certain jock-
          hunk we all know?

                         RACHEL
          (smiles, nervous, nailed)
          No.

                         MONICA
          You know, Tracy isn't universally
          loved.

                         RACHEL
          There's a shock.

                         MONICA
          Exhibit A. I think she's a Melrose
          Place superbitch.
          RACHEL cracks a hint of a smile.

                         MONICA
          You have great lips.

                         (BEAT)
          No, really. Look, this shade would
          look very kissable on you. Soft.
          MONICA goes to apply the lipstick on her. RACHEL pulls away.

                         MONICA
          Trust me. See, Tracy tried to steal
          Brad from me. Now hold still.
          And RACHEL does.

                         MONICA
          So, he invite you to the game? Just
          nod.
          RACHEL nods.

                         MONICA
          Well, there's a big party after. I
          hope you can go. I know it would mean
          a lot to Jesse if we all got along.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

                         RACHEL
          Uh-huh.

                         MONICA
          Good. See?
          Checking in a mirror, RACHEL sees she's right.

                         MONICA
          Here, these two would also rock
          on you.
          The SALESWOMAN reappears.

                         SALESWOMAN
          Can I ring those up?

                         RACHEL
          Um, sure. How much are these?

                         SALESWOMAN
          Twenty-two fifty. Each.
          RACHEL sets the lipsticks down. MONICA smiles at the

          SALESWOMAN.

                         MONICA
          Maybe next time. Bye.
          She pulls RACHEL away. As they walk the SALESWOMAN keeps
          looking at RACHEL with distaste.

                         MONICA
          (a conspiratorial smile)
          Here, I kleptoed it for you.
          She slips RACHEL the lipstick.

          INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          RACHEL before the mirror, applying the lipstick. A P.J.
          HARVEY song plays under, slow, insistent, seductive:

          P.J. HARVEY
          She's burst/ dropped off! picked the
          fruit! realize! I'm naked / I'm naked
          too./ So cover rrry body/ dress it fine/
          hide my linen and lace.
          She pulls on a silver, thrift-shop SLIP DRESS, moves a slee ve
          to cover her tattoo.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.
          P.J. HARVEY (cont'd)
          So fruit flower myself inside out/ I'm
          happy and bleeding for you / fruit
          flower myself inside out / I'm tired
          and bleeding for you...
          She slips off her nose stud.

          EXT. RACHEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          JESSE waiting in his car. He looks up --
          RACHEL stands under the porch light in her dress. A lanky
          gangster girl, with. one leg planted on a step like a cocked
          gun. She's bone-chillingly beautiful.
          He gets out, opens the car door for her.

                         JESSE
          What happened to that little thing you
          wear, that, uh...
          He gestures to hib'nose, indicating her stud.

                         RACHEL
          Took it off.

                         JESSE
          Too bad. I like it. It's different.
          RACHEL looks at the car seat. On it are DAISIES.

                         JESSE

                         (SMILES)
          Just, you know, throw'em in the back.

          EXT. A CABIN - NIGHT

          A small cabin in the woods. Fire light in the window.
          JESSE's CAR is parked in t;^.e gravel alongside.

          INT. THE CABIN - NIGHT

          JESSE is stoking a fire in the fireplace. There's a MOOSE
          HEAD TROPHY on the wall. RACHEL's sitting on a bed, draped
          with a chenille spread.

                         JESSE
          It was nice of mark to lend us the
          place. He's really tryin' to make
          peace. Invited .s to his party. But
          we won't go if y;,u,d be uncomfortable.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.
          He moves to the bed.

                         RACHEL
          No. Let's go.

                         JESSE
          Great.
          (looks at her)
          What's wrong?

                         RACHEL
          I feel like.., we're being watched.
          She looks up at the MOOSE HEAD's MARBLE EYES, reflecting
          firelight. JESSE drapes his jacket over the MOOSE HEAD.

                         JESSE
          Sorry, Bullwinkle, lights out.
          (sits on the bed)
          Feel better?

                         RACHEL
          Feel scared.

                         JESSE
          Funny. He too.,
          He leans in to her. She backs away, like a skittish doe.

                         RACHEL
          I'm sorry, I just feel... weird.
          I don't know. Oh, wow, I am really
          losing my mind here.

                         JESSE
          It's okay. Rachel, it's okay. It
          doesn't have to be tonight. Whenever
          you're ready. And, hey, you know
          what, you're the sanest person I know.
          And that's exactly what she needed to hear. She cups the
          back of his neck and pulls his lips to hers. They kiss; a
          deep, healing kiss.

                         HER HAND
          brushes aside one of the straps to her dress,, which slips off
          her shoulder.
          JESSE tenderly runs his hand over her HEART-THORN TATTOO.

          CLOSEUPS OF RACHEL AND JESSE
          in the bed, making love. Firelight playing over their skin.
          It's beautiful. what we all wanted our first time to be.
          They move slowly, as if all the pain in the world could be
          erased, ï¿½f only they could become one. JESSE watches RACHEL
          Her face open, vulnerable.

                         RACHEL ASLEEP
          seems peaceful, holding on to JESSE like a child, they're
          covered by the chenille spread. Their sweat clings to them
          like the softest of prisons. He's awake, studying her. He
          gently runs his fingertips across her brow.

                         E

          FOLLOW the MICROPHONE CORD to a closed WINDOW where it snakes
          out.
          There's the gaping lens of a VIDEO CAMERA visible in the

          And the round BLACK PUPIL of WALTER'S EYE.
          He lays on the bed watching'RACHEL sneaking in through her
          window. trying to be mouse quiet. She gets safely inside
          when her bedroom door opens.
          BOYD stands in the doorway. She's busted.

                         BOYD
          You were out all night.
          RACHEL nods, defiantly. He walks over to her and, without
          warning, slaps her.

                         BOYD
          You're grounded. No school today.
          You don't move from this room.
          He turns on his heel, walks out. The dog looks as stricken
          as she does.

          A SERIES OF DISSOLVES:
          Of RACHEL in her bedroom, as the day passes.
          The sun moves across the floor as a ghostly RACHEL and her
          dog FADE IN-AND-OUT around the room. She lays in bed,
          staring at the ceiling. Paces her room like a prisoner.
          FINALLY -- It's nightfall.
          RACHEL slips out her window.

                         SUE
          Rachel needs help. She doesn't
          believe me and I'm afraid for her.
          I want you to tell her who her
          father was.
          Why?

                         SUE
          She'll believe it from your lips.
          Mrs. Lang, I really need your help,
          before it's too late. I can take you
          to her. Will you help me?
          BARBARA slowly nods, yes.

          EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM, STANDS - NIGHT

          The entire town has showed for this traditional rivalry and
          there's Bulldog paraphernalia galore. RACHEL appears in the
          stands, looking a bit lost. Down front sit MONICA and AMY.
          On the field are TRACY and her fellow CHEERLEADERS.
          MONICA nudges AMY and waves to

                         MONICA
          Rachel, Rach, over here.
          Hey. Grab a seat.
          Looking around, RACHEL sees she's surrounded by Patio People.

                         RACHEL
          Thanks, but...

                         MONICA
          Oh, please, you're.not gonna sit by
          your lonesome. There's plenty of room,
          if Amy;here slides her bubble butt.

                         (DRY)
          Very witty, Ms. Bulimia.
          But she moves over. RACHEL tentatively sits.

          INT. FOOTBALL LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

          JESSE enters, mounds of hair are at his feet. He looks up.
          MARK and most of the BULLDOGS have shaved their heads and are
          working on the last players. They turn to him in unison.
          CHUCK grins, runs his hand over his scalp.

                         CHUCK
          We did it for the big game.

                         MARK
          C'mon, Jess, you're up.
          JESSE stares in horror at how identical they all look now.
          Then he starts to... giggle, then breaks into laughter, turns
          and walks away.

                         A P-ALN
          Man, he'll ruin the whole effect.

          MONICA and RACHEL.

                         MONICA
          No, no, it's an extra point when
          you score the kick after the touchdown.
          A safety is when you get tackled with
          the ball in your own end zone.

                         RACHEL
          Thought that was a bunt.
          What?

                         RACHEL
          I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

                         MONICA
          Okay, listen. Here's what Brad told me
          to say, doesn't matter if something good
          or bad happens, just say "You. gotta be
          fuckin' kiddin' mel" No matter what,
          just say that. It'll sound like you know
          what's going on.

          INT. STADIUM TUNNEL - NIGHT

          JESSE and the team move through a dark tunnel and onto...

          THE FOOTBALL FIELD
          with all the pageantry and sheer rush of a hometown crowd.
          The school band plays like they're going to bust a gut.
          Hysteria and bloodlust fill the air as the crowd starts a
          barking chant.

                         JESSE
          on the sideline bench. He scans the crowd behind him,
          sees.
          A NOTRE DAME SCOUT, wearing a "Fighting Irish jacket, toting
          a clipboard.
          JESSE then spots RACHEL in the stands, gives her a reassuring
          grin. She glances at the SCOUT, smiles back at JESSE.
          TRACY sees them, is none too happy.
          SLOW MOTION -- A whistle sounds as a FOOTBALL is kicked to
          start the game. The BALL spins end over end until...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.
          It's caught by a BULLDOG receiver who starts his return, then
          is popped hard and FUMBLES. An OPPOSING PLAYER leaps onto
          the ball on the muddy quagmire of a field.
          n the stands...

          RACHEL, MONICA, AMY
          (in accidental unison)
          You gotta be fuckin' kiddie' me!
          They turn to each other, burst into laughter.
          MONTAGE -- of the punishing game. Epic warfare with
          grunting, spitting and cursing as LINEMAN butt heads and.
          -- A CARLIN RUNNING BACK steamrolls through the BULLDOGS for
          a touchdown.
          -- RACHEL, MONICA and AMY do their You gotta be fuckin'
          kiddin' me routine.
          JESSE catches a pass, and is immediately slammed hard

          CARLIN PLAYER.
          RACHEL looks like she's been kicked in the gut.

                         RACHEL
          Do they have to hit him that hard?

                         MONICA
          Amy, Rachel's worried about Jesse.

                         AMY
          Don't worry, i always looks worse
          than it really

          TRACY and the other CHEERLEADERS leading a cheer as...

          SCOUT watches him, writing notes on his clipboard.

                         DOCTOR
          Well... I understand you need to take
          out Mrs. Lang, to do a drug-abuse
          intervention with her daughter. But
          while she's doing well, her condition
          may be fragile.

                         (BEAT)
          In good conscience, I could only
          release her in your custody for
          two hours.

                         0
          Thank you.
          SUE jumps to her feet to leave.

                         DOCTOR
          Hold on. You have a bunch of release
          forms to sign. I'll go get them.
          On SUE, sitting, knowing she-may be running out of time.

          EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

          The BULLDOGS prove their worth with brutal play as they cream
          the CARLIN QUARTERBACK for a big loss.
          THE FOURTH QUARTER SCOREBOARD -- the BULLDOGS trail 7-3.
          RACHEL sees...
          The Notre Dame FOOTBALL SCOUT writing notes as he watches...
          JESSE cutting across the middle of the field.
          He catches a pass, but two DEFENSIVE BACKS converge on him
          and he gets bone-jarringly plastered.
          JESSE hits the ground with such force his helmet flies off.
          For a moment, it looks like he's been decapitated.

                         RACHEL

                         (STANDS)
          Jess!
          THE HOMETOWN CROWD rises to their feet as...
          JESSE stays down, hurt.

                         RACHEL
          Oh, no.
          RACHEL strains to see him as the team circles around JESSE.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.
          FOUR PHOTOGRAPHERS rush along the sideline to snap shots,
          their cameras flashing.
          JESSE sits up, stands, shakes his head to clear it as he jogs
          to the sideline.

                         RACHEL
          Thank, God. He's okay.

          JESSE -- running. He looks up to...
          THE NIGHT SKY -- A FOOTBALL silently arches up, spinning an
          achingly beautiful spiral in SLOW MOTION.
          THE SCOREBOARD CLOCK -- a booming TICK from 0:05 to 0:04.
          JESSE makes a spectacular one-handed catch on the run,
          streaking along the sideline.
          Ahead of him, a monstrous CARLIN LINEBACKER closes in on him
          with murder in his eyes.

                         RA
          Look out !

          THE LINEBACKER'S P.O.V. --
          All the PHOTOGRAPHERS on the sideline have their CAM g
          FLASHES flare in unison, without their snapping them!
          The blinded LINEBACKER plows into the SIDELINE PHOTOGRAPHER
          JESSE scores a touchdown.
          And the CROWD goes berserk as the BULLDOGS throw their
          helmets in the air.

          You gotta be... wow.
          RACHEL stands there, open-mouthed, relieved, but unsure if
          she had anything to do with what just happened.

          INT. LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

          The Bulldogs are still whooping it up as COACH WALSH
          approaches JESSE.

          JESSE nods, turns to BRAD.

                         JESSE
          Brad, can you tell Rachel I'll be
          out soon? Have her wait for me.

          INT. STADIUM CORRIDOR - N

          RACHEL and MONICA stand in the hoard waiting for the players.
          TRACY passes, soggy, muddy, yet still radiating a cool
          confidence in her beauty. She gives RACHEL, a shark's smile.
          BRAD exits the locker room, goes to RACHEL's side.

                         BRAD
          It's gonna be a while, Jess is talkin'
          to the scout, he said for you to go
          ahead to the party.

                         (WARMLY)
          Rachel, did you hear that, Jesse's
          talking to the scout, isn't that great?

                         RACHEL
          Yeah.

          SUE drives up with BARBARA to RACHEL's tiny, run-down house.

                         BARBARA
          No, this couldn't be it. Rachel said
          it was a real nice house, surrounded
          by trees, with a pool in the back.

                         SUE
          I guess she didn't want to worry you.

          INT. RACHEL' BEDROOM - NIGHT

          The bedroom door is opened by EMILYN. SUE and BARBARA stand
          behind her.
          They find WALTER, alone on the bed, blinking awake.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.

          MARK BING'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          An upper-class home built in the international style of
          fieldstone and gray-stained wood. The house is set back from
          the road, surrounded by trees, with a pool in the back.
          A herd of parked cars and throbbing music indicate MARK's
          party is at full tilt.

          INT. MARK BING'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON -- a 36-INCH TV playing psychedelic music videos and
          Japanese anima.
          WIDEN -- to reveal a DANCING'CROWD in a dimly lit, split-
          level living room with exposed wooden beams.
          There's a large, roaring fireplace and a Jackson Pollock
          splatter PAINTING hangs opposite. Sliding glass doors
          overlook the backyard patio and swimming pool.
          CHUCK cuts through, sees someone jostle a table lamp.

                         CHUCK
          Careful! Don't break anything, or
          Mark'll have my head on,a plate.

          EXT. MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          MONICA leads RACHEL up the walkway to the front door where a
          BEEFY BOY plays doorman. ARNIE and two geeky YOUNGER BOYS
          mill outside the door, trying their damndest to look cool.

                         ARNIE
          Hey, Monica, can ya get us into the
          party?

                         MONICA
          Sure, Arnie, wait here. I'll come
          back for ya.. .
          And she waltzes past him.

                         MONICA (CONT'D)
          . in two or three years.
          ARNIE points at a passing RACHEL.

                         APISI E
          How come she gets to go in?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         MONICA
          (rais6s a toast)
          To new friends.
          They raise their glasses and RACHEL joins in with a hesitant
          smile. Their glasses clink together for the...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. STADIUM PARKING LOT - NIGHT

          JESSE crosses the near empty lot, hair wet from his shower.
          He stops dead.

                         JESSE
          Damn it.
          Under a pool of lamplight -- HIS CAR has had its tires
          slashed and someone has sprayed in red Carlin uies!â 
          across the door.
          TRACY pulls up in. her BMW, wearing her cheerleading outfit.

                         TRACY
          Oh, wow, that sucks. Further proof
          Carlin guys are gravy sucking pigs.

                         JESSE
          Yeah.

                         TRACY
          Need a ride?

                         JESSE
          You goin' to Mark's?

                         TRACY
          Wouldn't miss it. Hop in.
          As he gets into her car, TRACY has one hand on the wheel, the
          other hanging out her window. She drops something as JESSE
          closes the door.
          REVEAL a CAN of red spray paint TRACY dropped onto the
          parking lot's tarmac.

                         TRACY
          Just a quick stop at my house,
          want to change my outfit.
          Her car pulls off...

          WIPING THE FRAME TO,

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

          INT. MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          RACHEL and MONICA chat with AMY and two other PATIO GIRLS.
          AMY takes RACHEL 's hand.

                         AMY
          I really like your nail color.

                         MONICA
          Check out the tattoo on her arm
          wild huh?

                         AMY
          Yeah. Did that hurt?

                         RACHEL
          No. Well, yeah, actually some.

                         AMY
          Oh, it's just too cool.

                         MONICA
          I'm dying to get one, but my mom
          would have a shit fit.

                         AMY
          So would mine. She says I'm not
          that type of gi rl.

                         RACHEL
          What type is that?
          There's an awkward pause which MONICA breaks.

                         MONICA
          A slut.
          (throws an arm around Rachel)
          That's why you should take all
          of us in for tattoos!
          AMY and the other GIRLS laugh. RACHEL softens, joining in.
          She looks around at everyone at the party, laughing, dancing.
          The shiny, happy people. it feels weird, but here she is.
          She smiles, takes a sip of her drink.
          By the stereo, MARK cranks up the music as CHUCK dances over
          to AMY, pulls her into the dancing CROWD. BRAD grabs MONICA.

                         BRAD
          C'mon, wench, let's dance.
          He pulls MONICA into the crowd, and she gestures for RACHEL
          to join them.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

                         RACHEL
          No, I'd rather wait for Jesse.

                         MONICA
          Oh, c'mon, Rachel. He'd want you
          to have fun.

                         AMY
          Yeah, c'mon, Rach.
          There's a chorus of "C'mon, Rachel" from the guys and some of
          the other DANCERS join in. An embarrassed RACHEL surrenders,
          sets down her drink and enters the dancing group.

                         MONICA
          All right, girl.
          RACHEL smiles. BRAD starts dancing before RACHEL.
          SLOW MOTION -- CLOSE on RACHEL's face, dancing, beaming. For
          a few moments, everything seems perfect. And she throws her
          head back and laughs.
          MARK dances into the group.

                         MARK
          Hey, Chuckzilla, why don't you
          put on the highlights tape?

                         CHUCK
          You mean tonight's game?
          MARK shares a laugh and a glance with MONICA and B

                         MARK
          Yeah, tonight's game.

                         CHUCK
          Okay. Let's go to the videotape:
          He dances out of the group over to the VCR where he pops out
          a tape and inserts a tape marked "Bulldogs Highlights".
          RACHEL turns around, sees the large screen TV PLAYING images
          of the Bulldogs playing football.

                         RACHEL
          Is that tonight's game?

                         MARK
          No, it's the other game.
          Still dancing, she turns back to the group.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

                         RACHEL
          What other game?

                         MARK
          The game you were in.
          The others laugh. She smiles, confused.

                         RACHEL
          What?

                         BRAD
          The one you played.

                         MARK
          Yeah, yeah, what was the score?
          Chuckie, pass me the scoreboard,
          I wanna show Rachel how she helped
          Jesse win the game.
          CHUCK pulls the BLACK NOTEBOOK next to the CD's off a shelf,
          pretends he's a quarterback hiking a ball.
          Twenty-four, twenty-six, hut, hut,
          hut.
          He drops back to pass the NOTEBOOK.

                         CHUCK
          Go long, Bradzilla.
          MARK laughs as BRAD circles around RACHEL, twists between
          other dancers. CHUCK tosses the NOTEBOOK over RACHEL and
          BRAD leaps up to catch it.

                         BRAD
          Post-pattern, Mark!
          Ducking around DANCERS, MARK raises his hands for the pass.
          KIDS start to notice their antics and start laughing.
          BRAD passes the book over to MARK who catches it, mimes
          spiking it for a touchdown and does a silly victory dance.
          MONICA laughs and turns to RACHEL, who laughs, even though
          she still looks a bit befuddled.

                         MARK
          Rachel, catch!
          He throws the NOTEBOOK through the air, where it tumbles end
          over end for a few slow beats, then is caught by her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

          BEHIND RACHEL --
           THE TV SET -- keeps playing football highlights, but suddenly
          there's an almost subliminal --
          FLASH of TWO INTERTWINED BODIES.
          RACHEL holds the NOTEBOOK, unsure of what to do with it. The
          boys are a little out of breath, but still grinning and
          dancing.

                         MARK
          Open it. Go 'head, read off the
          scores.

                         BRAD
          Start with Eric.

                         CHUCK
          Yeah, start with poor Eric.
          She opens the book, looks at the pages with a quizzical
          expression. She sees the Bulldog names across the top of the
          page with lists of girls beneath each one. Every girl has a
          number next to her with a total at the bottom.

                         MARK
          What's Eric's score?

                         RACHEL
          Twenty-two?
          RACHEL stops dancing as she spots LISA PARKER's name at the
          bottom of ERIC's column with the number four next to it.

                         MARK
          What's up, Rach? You know someone on
          that list?

                         RACHEL
          (under her breath)
          Lisa.

                         MARK
          Oh, yeah, Lisa, forgot about her.

                         CHUCK
          How many points was she?

                         BRAD
          Four. But maybe he shoulda lost
          those when she offed herself.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

                         MARK
          Rach, look under Jesses's name, how
          many points you get?

                         MONICA

                         (CHEERLEADING)
          Two, four, six, eight--

                         AMY
          Who do we appreciate!
          RACHEL looks down JESSES's column sees-her name with thirty
          points next to it, then, above hers, sees TRACY with ten.

                         MARK
          No, more than that, remember, we
          thought Rach was a dyke. He got
          extra-points for the conversion.

                         BRAD
          points?
          Try thirty.
          RACHEL stares at the book, stunned, trying to make sense of
          it.

                         MONICA
          Look at her face, this is priceless.
          At the front door, JESSE walks in, TRACY behind him. He
          looks around, hasn't seen what's going on yet. ERIC
          intercepts him, turning JESSE away from the TV.

                         ERIC
          Hey, man, what did the scout say?
          Behind Rte...
          THE TV SET -- between shots of players grunting, tackling
          and smashing into each other, longer and longer segments
          appear of...

          A COUPLE MAKING LOVE --
          from the waist up, with thick scan lines that almost make it
          look surreal. It's obvious that the girl is RACHEL, and the
          boy is JESSE.
          DANCING KIDS notice what's on the TV and start to point and
          laugh at the set. RACHEL is completely unaware of what's
          going on behind her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         9

                         MARK
          See, we didn't think Jess could do i
          so he offered to get evidence, proof
          that he'd scored you.

                         MONICA
          Here comes Jesse's big play!

                         MARK
          Lookie, lookie, Rachel.
          RACHEL realizes people are watching something behind her,
          then laughing at her. She turns and sees...
          The IMAGES of her and JESSE on the TV.
          Her face goes slack with horror.

                         RACHEL
          Oh, God
          MARK leans in to RACHEL, who hasn't noticed JESSE.

                         MARK
          Jess was disappointed with the picture
          quality, but I told him it was better
          than Pam and Tommy Lee's tape.

                         CK
          Rach, was it good for you too?
          Sure looks like it, don't it?

                         MARK
          Why don't we ask Jesse?
          He turns and calls out.

                         MARK (CONT'D)
          Hey, Jesse! Over here!
          JESSE looks over and his eyes meet RACHEL's, but she just
          stares back, horrified. Then he sees the TV set behind her

                         JESSE
          What...
          JESSE pushes his way through the crowd, trying to get to
          RACHEL. TRACY throws an arm around him, kisses his neck.

                         TRACY
          He told me he was thinking of me
          when he fucked you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.
          Seeing MARK laughing, JESSE realizes what's going on.

                         JESSE
          Rachel...
          He tries to shrug off TRACY, but ERIC and CHUCK grab his arms
          and pull him back into the crowd.

                         JESSE
          Rachel!
          MARK pushes RACHEL towards BRAD.

                         MARK
          Rachel! Rachel!
          She tries to get away, but BRAD pushes her into MONICA who
          shoves her to AMY as they join in the chanting.
          Rachel!

                         MONICA
          Rachel!
          Rachel!
          Drowning out JESSE's cries.
          RACHEL's P.Q.V. -- spinning around. A NIGHTMARISH GALLERY of
          dancing, jostling torsos, TWISTED FACES and LAUGHING MOUTHS,
          smirking and pointing at her.

                         INTERCUT WITH:

                         FAST CLOSE-UPS
          of RACHEL and JESSE making love. The assault of music,
          chanting and images crescendo with...
          BRAD grabbing RACHEL's bare arm below her HEART-THORN TATTOO
          forcing her to face the TV screen.

                         BRAD
          Hey, is that a zit on your ass?
          RACHEL has tears streaming down her face for the first time
          since she was four years old.
          She bows her head.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

          A LAUGHING BRAD
          glances down at RACHEL's arm.
          The THORN VINE around the HEART TATTOO looks bigger, edging
          up her arm.
          He looks away, shares a laugh with MARK, looks back and...

          THE HEART TATTOO
          on RACHEL's upper arm is growing, etched from within, the
          thorn covered vine snaking like a tendril up her arm.

                         BRAD
          Holy shit.
          He releases her.
          RACHEL raises her head, eyes glowing with pain and rage, her
          broken heart turned to stone.,
          The delicate THORN VINE has grown across her chin, cheekbone
          and forehead, swirling around to end on her other cheek.
          A stunned BRAD backs away from her.
          JESSE breaks free of ERIC's grip, slugs CHUCK and pushes his
          way towards RACHEL.
          Her HEART POUNDS at an alarming rate as she slowly turns and
          sees JESSE coming at her, his arms out to take her in his
          embrace.

                         A KNIFE
          on the bar dances and rattles, then...
          A WHIP PAN finds...
          JESSE, as his back arches in pain and he screams. The KNIFE
          embedded in his open palm, nailing his hand to the wall.
          MARK and the other boys stare in shock.

                         MARK
          What the fuck?
          ON JESSE -- as he screams again.
          A CORKSCREW has pierced his other hand, at waist level. The
          SCREW spins around, burrowing into his flesh.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.
          Everyone on that side of the room stops dead, taking in the
          bizarre sight.
          RACHEL straightens up and...
          The kitchen door CLOSES...
          The glass doors to the back yard slide SHUT...
          The front door SLAMS.

                         TRACY

                         (LOOKING AROUND)
          What's going on Mark?
          I dunno.
          The floor starts to shake like a small earthquake. All the
          PARTYGOERS go still, looking around at each other. The room
          is frozen, even though the music keeps pounding.
          MARK looks at RACHEL, her disheveled hair partially obscures
          her features, but her eyes are glowing.

          THE GLASS WINDOWS
          surrounding the room, begin to RATTLE, then CRACK in a spider-
          web pattern. Then...
          THE WINDOWS BURST inward.
          FOLLOW the deadly hail of shards as they cut through the

          CROWD.
          FROM ABOVE -- The outer edge of the CROWD are mowed down as
          if by a machine gun and...
          A WHIP PAN -- Finds a BOY impaled by a large, jagged shard.

                         TWISTED SHADOWS
          are splayed across a wall of KIDS falling to the ground. The
          hard-edged music keeps playing while...
          CHUCK's decapitated head rolls across the floor and onto...
          A plate.
          The BEEFY BOY spins around, clutcning at a shard protruding
          from his neck, his carotid artery spewing blood like a lawn
          sprinkler.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.
          On a GIRL as his blood sprays across her face and...
          The BOY turns, arcing blood across...
          The Jackson Pollock PAINTING, which blends into the multi-
          colored canvas.
          Reeling into the stereo, the BOY scatters CDs everywhere.
          On RACHEL, clothes spattered red, tears streaming down her
          cheeks.
          TRACY straightens up, having been protected by MONICA, who`s
          screaming, her face a lacerated pulp with glass, shards
          sticking out of it like a pincushion.
          Surviving PARTYGOERS panic as they struggle to their feet and
          try to flee, stampeding over each other.
          , TRACY, ERIC and BRAD shove their way through the crowd.

          EXT. MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          As SUE and BAR.BA k leap from the Volvo.. SUE hears the
          screams from within the house, takes in the shattered
          windows.

                         SUE BARBARA
          Oh, not Rachel!
          They race to the door as...

          WITHIN THE HOUSE
          BRAD runs to the front door.
          An IRON FIREPLACE POKER lifts up one end, then flies like a
          javelin towards BRAD's back as...

          DOOR - N
          BARBARA and SUE approach the door when the end of the
          bursts from the center of it, nearly spearing a surprised
          BARBARA in the face as it sticks out about a foot.
          She jerks back, then pushes the door open with an effort.

          WITHIN THE HOUSE --
          They enter and freeze as the door slams shut behind them,
          revealing a dead BRAD speared through the throat, pinned to
          the door.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.
          Oai, my god. Where's Rachel?
          They see JESSE, then RACHEL covered in tattoos.
          A panicked itMY smashes into BARBARA, then runs toward a
          window.
          RACHEL sees AMY and her eyes narrow...
          MUSIC CDs fly off a shelf and...
          Spin through the air at high velocity.
          One of the deadly frisbees buries itself in AMY's back,
          spinning her around. More CDs embed in her stomach, chest
          and throat.
          MARK and ERIC smash their way through the chaos as MARK's
          eyes flash from a collapsing AMY to RACHEL

                         MARK
          God, it'ls her! She's doing it!
          SUE moves towards RACHEL.

                         SUE
          Stop! Stop it!
          RACHEL has her gaze locked on...
          MARK, who realizes he's a dead man. He moves toward a
          shattered window, through which some PEOPLE escape.
          But RACHEL turns her head slightly and...
          A TELEKINETIC PULSE travels across the row of LIQUOR BOTTLES
          at the bar, exploding them one-by-one, spraying alcohol which
          douses SUE.
          A FLAMING LOG erupts from the fireplace...
          Striking the alcohol-drenched BAR, setting a blazing trail
          and lighting the curtains on fire, creating a wall of FLAMES
          before the windows.

                         SUE
          Stop it! You don't want to--
           And RACHEL snaps her head around, launching another LOG from
           the fireplace which strikes SUE in the back, whose alcohol
          drenched clothes catch flames... and she , A.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.
          A screaming SUE pitches forward, rolls on the floor to put
          out the flames, but caly succeeds in lighting another trail
          of liquor which creates a barrier to the backyard windows.
          In the eye of the storm is BARBARA, shaking her head in
          denial, muttering, as her mental state rapidly deteriorates.

                         BARBARA
          No, this isn't happening. It isn't
          happening, isn't happening...
          MARK pulls ERIC by the shirt collar and they careen down...

                         A HALLWAY
          where each of the DOORS ahead of them SLAM SHUT as they
          approach.
          Utter CHAOS, but RACHEL calmly turns into the hallway,
          following MARK, as if in a trance.

                         I

                         MARK
          lowers his shoulder, crashes through a closing door into.

                         A DEN
          where the walls are decorated with deer heads and hunting
          trophies. MARK and ERIC are smashing a standing glass case
          containing pistols and rifles.
          TRACY leans panting against the wall.
          MARK slips a HANDGUN into his belt.

                         TRACY
          Screw that, get the shotguns!
          Shaking, freaked out, they gather weapons.

                         THE HALL
          d ERIC see RACHEL the end of the hall, silhouetted
          from behind. They take off in the other direction, TRACY
          bringing up the re
          Barrelling shoulders first into a door, the boys burst
          through and into...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.

          EXTâ¢ THE BACK YARD - NIGHT
          Where they almost stumble into the swimming pool.
          Toting their rifles, MARK, ERIC and TRACY turn to find
          RACHEL, at a gunfighter's distance, coming towards them.
          TRACY and BRAD cock their weapons and bring them to their
          shoulders. TRACY slips on her glasses.

                         MARK
          Wait till she's closer.
          TRACY tightens her finger on the trigger.
          RACHEL's eyes narrow and...
          TRACY's glasses shatter into her eyes, spewing blood
          milky fluid.
          Aaaaa...
          She staggers, fires her shotgun into ERIC's groin and he
          lands sitting next to the pool. A dying ERIC stares at his
          shredded lap, then falls over.
          MARK looks at his dead friend.
          Oh, shit.
          .recovers, and swings his aim back at RACHEL. But his
          rifle goes sailing over his head and into the grass twenty
          feet behind him.
          He makes eye-contact with a grim RACHEL advancing toward him,
          and hauls ass.
          RACHEL glances at a coiled GARDEN HOSE and it springs to
          life, slithering through the grass and across the concrete at
          high speed to wrap around MARK's ankle and trip him up.
          He hits the ground hard and rolls over to find the hose
          twisting around his legs and up his waist like a python.

                         HIS HAND
          grasps for the rifle, but falls short as the hose pins his
          other arm to his side, then curls around his windpipe in a
          stranglehold.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.
          His eyes widen as the life is squeezed from him and he sees
          RACHEL standing over him.
          He gropes for the shotgun again... and finally grabs it.
          RACHEL looks at the rifle and it flies from his hold,
          splashing into the pool.
          But she jolts on two...

                         GUNSHOTS
          RACHEL looks down. MARK had pulled the handgun from his belt
          with his pinned hand and fired.
          She's holding her belly, gutshot, staggers and falls into the
          pool, disappearing amid a swirl of blood.
          MARK yanks the hose from his neck as it goes slack. He
          gasps, points the gun into the pool and FIRES until it's
          silent and he's left pulling the trigger on empty chambers.
          He gets his breatking under control, leans over to look into
          the water of the deep end. He Aar on the sound of a
          mechanical whirring, and turns.
          A POOL COVER starts to unfold.
          At that moment...

          RACHEL'S BLOODY ARM
          bursts from the water and grips his neck. MARK grabs her
          forearm as her other arm yanks him into the pool.

                         UNDERWATER --
          As RACHEL drags MARK down, he kicks and pummels her, but she
          holds on. The POOL COVER steadily closes over them, shutting
          out the light from above.
          MARK finally frees himself and lunges for the surface, but
          the POOL COVER blocks his escape.
          He desperately pushes at it, eyes bulging, lungs burning, as
          his feet kick to keep him afloat.

          ON THE SURFACE --
          The POOL COYER closing as RACHEI, hauls herself from the
          water, barely making it out. MARK'S HAND, grabs her leg,
          slides, then clutches at the edge of the pool. His fingers
          slip under as the cover completely shuts.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.
          M RX's head bulges the POOL COVER, then his hands punch
          feebly at it a few times. Then... nothing.

          BARBARA (O.S.)
          Rachel!
          A weakened RACHEL lays by the pool. She seems to be snapping
          out of her trance as she rolls over and sees BARBARA.
          RACHEL shudders and suddenly just looks like a wet, scared
          little girl reaching for her mother.

                         RACHEL
          Mama. Maury?
          BARBARA'S P.O.V. o
          but it's a FOUR-YEAR-OLD RACHEL, pristine, without tattoos.
          BARBARA blinks and her P.O.V. is of a TEN-YEAR-OLD RACHEL,
          reaching for her.
          Mama, please.
          BARBARA blinks and it's now...
          The 17-YEAR-OLD RACHEL, covered in blood and tattoos.
          She looks her daughter in the eyes, backs away in terror.

                         BARBARA
          What are you? You're not my little
          girl. No. The devil's in you.

                         RACHEL

                         (CRYING)
          Don't leave me, mama.
          But her mother disappears into the shadows.

                         RACHEL
          Please, I don't have... anyone.
          She rolls onto her back, looks up at the STARRY NIGHT.

                         RACHEL
          Please, God, let me die...
          And she tightly shuts her eyes.

          DISSOLVE BACK TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.

          THE LIVING ROOM
          A vision of hell -- crimson-stained walls and piled bodies.
          The fire is spreading, licking its way across the burning
          SCOREBOARD NOTEBOOK, and along the floor toward...
          JESSE, in pain, still pinned to the wall. He raises his head
          and starts in fear as...
          o the center of the room, facing him.
          He sees the gunshot wounds in her stomach, then follows her
          gaze to...

          THE TV SET
          with a cracked screen, but still playing the tape of their
          intimate moment at the cabin, with a sleeping RACHEL laying

                         ON JESS
          He looks back at her.

                         JESSE
          Rachel, listen. I swear, d
          know they were taping us. d
          never hurt you.
          She looks at his pleading eyes.

                         JESSE

                         I LOVE--
          The TV SET now has the video footage of...

          INT. THE CABIN - NIGHT

          JESSE looks at RACHEL clinging to him, asleep, peaceful. He
          gently runs his fingers across her brow.

                         JESSE

                         (SOFTLY)
          I love you .
          And oulls her closer.

          HACK TO -- -
          RACHEL staring at the TV. And the VCR rewinds and replays..
          ON TV -- the moment of JESSE saying 'I love you" to her while
          she was asleep.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.
          RACHEL falls to her knees, tears running down her face. She
          turns back to JESSE, amazed.
          A BLAZING CHUNK of ceiling falls near her.

                         JESSE

                         (COUGHS)
          Rachel. Gat out, now. Go.
          And the KNIFE and the CORKSCREW drop away, releasing him.
          He falls to the floor, drags himself over... and takes RACHEL
          in his arms. He cradles her. She whispers and he bends over
          to hear. She whispers again...

                         RACHEL
          .love you.
          JESSE tenderly kisses her lips.
          And all the TATTOOS fade from her face and body
          Love.
          Her face is serene.
          JESSE traces his fingers across her brow, embraces her, the
          flames start to encircle them, just like in RACHEL's
          nightmare.
          JESSE pulls RACHEL over the debris ridden floor toward the
          back windows, but stumbles and goes down. Her eyes flutter
          open.

                         RACHEL
          Leave. Get out
          Instead of leaving her, JESSE hugs RACHEL closer. The sleeve
          of his jacket catches flames. And he accepts his fate.
          RACHEL shuts her eyes, gives one last TELEKINETIC PUSH...

          EXT. THE BACKYARD - NIGHT

          And a BODY is flung out the back window like a rag doll,
          clothes in flames.
          The BODY goes fifteen feet and falls onto the pool cover, its
          weight bowing the cover enough for water to rush over it.

          109.

          INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

          JESSE is slumped over, asleep on a desk layered in textbooks
          and a notebook. An all-night study session.
          His hair is shor., he's wearing a beard. His face is more
          mature, sadder. The beard largely hides some burn scars on
          one side of his face.
          Over the desk is a MIRROR and a "Fighting Irish" pennant.
          The only light comes from his desk lamp.
          He jerks awake with a spasm, glances at a digital clock
          glowing on his desk: 11:S$ A.M.

                         JESSE
          (rubs his eyes)
          Jesus.
          WALTER, Rachel's dog, hops on his lap, licks at.his face.
          The sad-eyed DOG whimpers'and,JESSE scratches him.
          In the distance the CLOCK TOWER BELL can be heard CHIMING
          MIDNIGHT: One, two...
          As JESSE looks down and his eyes widen in surprise:
          Somehow, he's scrawled on the notebook paper on the desk in
          front of him:
          kINg of HELL
          Or, if you only look at the capitalized letters, it reads:
          Around it, the same phrase is written over and over again:
          kINg of HELL kINg of HELL kINg of HELL
          kINg of HELL kINg of HELL kINg of HELL
          kINg of HELL kINg of HELL
          JESSE lowers the dog
          How did...
          Trails off as he stares at the page.
          The CLOCK BELL in the background is still CHIMING: give, six,
          seven and...

          It's the wind. The DOG starts barkin

                         JESSE
          (shushes the dog)
          Ssshhhh. Relax, boy.
          He takes a-deep breath, flips the page on the notebook,
          resumes his cram session.
          On the floor, the DOG looks at the open French doors, then
          scurries under the bed.
          JESSE is writing, in the MIRROR above h
          A WOMAN' s FIGURE
          anding in the French doors, her face hidden
          up, sees the WOMAN reflected, spins to watch
          her stop forward into the light.
          It's RACHEL, in hAk slip dress.

                         JESSE

                         (STUNNED)
          Rachel?
          RACHEL smiles. She lifts her arms to him.

                         JESSE
          (with growing joy)
          Rachel.
          He rises, envelops her in his arms, and kisses her.
          He pulls back to take her in.
          T!!s two of thaw are reflected in ANOTHER MIRROR behind the
          r 's door.
          opens her mouth to speak --

          A LARGE SNAKE
          FLIES out and jams itself into JESSE's mouth, throwing him

          INT . DORM ROOM, NOTRE DAME - NIGH a'
          A LOUD SCREAM as JESSE jerks awake at his desk. His heart
          FATIM like it's about to explode from his mouth.
          He looks down at the paper in front of him. Filled only with
          his study notes.
          The dog, WALTER, is awake on the bed, blinking, having been
          stirred by the scream.

                         JOS
          He recovers, runs his hands through his hair. Starts
          reading.
          The DIGITAL CLOCK reads: 11:59 A.M.
          In the distance, the CLOCK BELL begins'chiming midnight: One,
          three...
          JESSE reads, but in his ayes he's waiting for the savant
          chime.
          The BELL CHIMES: Four
          The FRENCH DOORSNinat
          JESSE spins. The wind. Nobody there.
          He turns back to his reading, his heart BEATING WILDLY again.
          Glances up at the mirror. Nothing.
          His HEARTBEATS and the BELL CHIMES get increasingly LQ=
          as,.. .
          He reads, glances up at the mirror, shivers, and it isn't
          in the cold.

          Move, to ANOTHER ANGLE :
          Where his image is MULTIPLIED TO INFINITY in the two mirror!
          Fear is written on his face.
          And we know he'll be looking over his shoulder...
          Until the day he dies.

               In the winter of 1982 these men were commissioned by the 
               United States National Science Foundation to gather data 
               concerning the physical and natural sciences on the continent 
               of Antarctica.

                          THE MAIN COMPOUND OF U.S. OUTPOST #31

               The interior is a cramped and never ending maze of hallways, 
               passageways and doors which connect the many rooms and 
               compartments within the compound. Sturdy, but prefabricated 
               materials have been used in its construction.

               There is a laboratory. An infirmary. A kitchen and mess hall. 
               A communications room and sleeping quarters. Other cubicles 
               are for storage and supplies.

               The most spacious area of the building, and the main center 
               of activity, is the Rec Room. Of the many entrance ways to 
               this room can be seen the small work chambers with their 
               sophisticated computers and other scientific equipment.

               The below quarter houses the generator and still other 
               compartments for storage.

               A long underground tunnel connects the main compound to the 
               dog kennel.

               FADE IN:

               A STARRY BLACKNESS

               From out of the billions, the smallest of specks drives slowly 
               forward. It closes; getting larger; its features becoming 
               more identifiable: a vessel. Flip-flopping; out of control. 
               Its stern roaring with flame. It passes; its blue fire surging 
               into the screen.

                                       "THE THING"

               A thundering...

                                                                   FADE TO:

               BLIND AND FERAL WHITENESS

               ...Glacial desert... gusts of snow... superimpose:

                                  ANTARCTICA 1982 WINTER

               A SOUND

               Loud and strident. A helicopter streaks across frame. It 
               travels precariously close to the ground; its chassis battered 
               and swayed by the wind.

               INT. COPTER

               Red dials beam on the faces of two men. One carries a rifle 
               and searches the horizon with binoculars. The other pilots. 
               Their unkempt faces, their blazing eyes notate a wildness. 
               They bark at each other in some Scandinavian tongue. Two men 
               arguing like mad and desperate children.

               The man with the binoculars sights something.

               EXT. HORIZON - BINOCULARS' POV - A DOG

               It turns and snarls at the craft some fifteen hundred yards 
               to its rear. Then whirls and gallops off. A gun blast kicks 
               up snow at its heels.

               INT. COPTER

               Another blast of rifle fire as the man takes issue with his 
               prey. The pilot slams a fist into his gunman friend and 
               implores for better aim. The craft swoops lower and the engine 
               is put into full throttle.

               EXT. HILL - THE DOG

               running feverishly up and over a hill of ice. A weather- 
               beaten, wooden sign sticks up on the other side:

                     U.S. NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION -- OUTPOST #31

               A rifle blast kicks up more snow.

               EXT. COMPOUND OF U.S. OUTPOST #31

               A large, almost snow-covered building. Not far from that a 
               tall, meteorological balloon tower.

               A scattering of several small shacks at varying distances 
               from the main compound. The smaller hovels are connected by 
               wooden planked walkways and steadying ropes. Multicolored 
               pennants stick put of the snow marking pathways and directions 
               to outdoor experiments.

               A tractor and two helicopters sit idle, covered with mounds 
               of continuously mounting snow.

               TWO MEN, NORRIS AND BENNINGS

               standing some thirty yards from the main building are in the 
               process of letting up a large red balloon. Childs, a hefty 
               black man, is twenty yards away tinkering with a snowmobile. 
               Their beards are caked with ice. It is winter and it is harsh.

               The faint sound of the copter turns their attention.

               THE COPTER

               flying ever lower now. The man with the gun leans dangerously 
               outside and fires away at the dog as it nears the outpost.

               THE MEN

               outside the compound look to one another, incredulous.

               THE COPTER

               much too low now, and chastised by the wind, attempts a high-
               speed landing, directly on the heels of the sprinting dog.  
               It bounces violently on the hard-packed surface.

               Once. Twice. Passing the dog.

               A third bounce sends it skidding. It flips; its blades 
               snapping off like toothpicks. It lands belly-up, soundless 
               except for the whine of its engine.

               The man with the gun rolls out before the explosion.

               INT. MAIN COMPOUND

               The half a dozen men, playing cards, monitoring equipment, 
               listening to music -- spring to their feet, startled.

               EXT. COMPOUND

               The dog reaches Norris and Bennings, as they awkwardly wade 
               through the snow, toward the downed copter.

               THE SURVIVOR

               of the crash, his eyes crazed with determination, struggles 
               to his feet. Heedless of his companion, he double-times his 
               way to the men and the dog. He reloads his gun and bellows 
               in his Scandinavian tongue.

               Norris and Bennings have no idea what he is saying.

               The survivor waves his arms as if shooting them off, screaming 
               as he does so; his face now caked with blood.

               The two men are bewildered. The dog jumps up, licking and 
               pawing them, imploring for safety.

               Blam!! The visitor fires. The men jump back in disbelief.

                                     NORRIS
                         What the fu...

               Blam! Blam! The crazed visitor screams and fires as he stalks 
               after them. His countenance ablaze, mad. Ice and snow kick 
               up about the terrified Americans. A bullet smacks into the 
               dog's hip, sending it skidding and howling in pain.

               Childs, the black man by the snowmobile, takes cover, diving 
               behind his machine.

               Bennings is hit. Norris pulls, drags him back toward the 
               compound. The dog crawls along beside them.

               The intruder is relentless in his assail. He runs, screaming, 
               firing, screaming, reloading and firing.

               INT. COMPOUND

               Total confusion. Some watch helplessly through the small, 
               fogged-up and translucent windows. Others try to mobilize 
               grabbing for their heavy jackets.

               CLOSE ON A .357 MAGNUM

               as it efficiently breaks through a windowpane and into the 
               cold. A steady hand grips it firmly.

               THE SCANDINAVIAN

               getting closer. Kablam! Suddenly, his head jerks back. He 
               falls to his knees and then face down into the snow.

               NORRIS AND BENNINGS

               stare blankly, but relievedly at the fallen man. The dog 
               whimpers in pain.

               CHILDS

               pokes his head out from under the snowmobile.

               INT. MAIN COMPOUND - REC ROOM

               The rumbling of voices fades. The men adjust their eyes to 
               station manager Garry, as he extracts his gun from the broken 
               window, relieves it of its spent shell and puts it away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BURNING COPTER

               Several men spray snow on the burning wreckage. There is no 
               hope for the pilot.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COMPOUND

               CLOSE ON THE PALLID FACE OF THE SCANDINAVIAN INTRUDER

               A neat round hole is set in the middle of his forehead.

               Station manager Garry holds up something akin to an ID.

                                     GARRY
                         Norwegian... Jans Bolen.

               Fuchs, a young and sensitive-looking biologist, stands closest 
               to the large area map of Antarctica. Several men sit and 
               stand around viewing the body that lies on two brought-
               together card-tables.

                                     FUCHS
                         Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.

                                     GARRY
                         How far's that?

                                     FUCHS
                         'Bout eighty kilos southwest.

                                     GARRY
                              (surprised)
                         That far?

               Garry directs his attention to Childs, the large black man 
               who had been working on the snowmobile. Next to him sits 
               Norris, the rugged-looking, fortyish, geophysicist, who was 
               one of the men being shot at.

                                     GARRY
                         You catch anything he was saying?

                                     CHILDS
                         Am I starting to look Norwegian to 
                         you, Bwana?

               Garry motions inquiringly to Norris.

                                     NORRIS
                         Yeah. I caught that he wanted the 
                         better part of my ass to come apart.

               INT. INFIRMARY

               Dr. Cooper, mid-forties, works on the outstretched leg of 
               Bennings, the meteorologist. Clark, the dog handler, is 
               mending the hip of the wounded dog off in the corner.

               Bennings lets out with an ouch.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Don't "ouch" me. Two stitches. It 
                         just grazed you.

               He helps a shaken Bennings up off the table.

                                     BENNINGS
                         What in the hell were they doing...?  
                         Flying that low... shooting at a 
                         dog... at us...

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Stir crazy. Cabin fever... Who knows.

               The dog yelps and whimpers as Clark tries to calm him.

                                     CLARK
                         I'll be here a while. Shell's pretty 
                         deep.

               INT. RADIO ROOM

               Blair, senior biologist, fifty, balding, leans against the 
               entrance door.

               He looks on as the young, bored-looking radio operator, 
               Sanchez, attends to his equipment. Bursts of static.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         It's no go.

                                     BLAIR
                         Well, get to somebody. Anybody. We've 
                         got to report this mess.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         Look, I haven't been able to reach 
                         shit in two weeks. Doubt if anybody's 
                         talked to anybody on the whole 
                         continent.

               INT. HALLWAY

               Nauls, the cook, glides along on his roller stakes down one 
               of the many narrow hallways that connect the various 
               compartments of the main compound. He is black, a little 
               mischievous, about twenty-two.

               He comes to a flashy skidding stop at one of the entrances 
               to the rec room area, where the men are gathered with the 
               dead Norwegian.

                                     NAULS
                         Maybe we at war with Norway.

               Palmer, a spacy, twenty-seven year old, novice pilot and 
               mechanic, grins as he lights a joint. He directs a remark to 
               station manager Garry.

                                     PALMER
                         Was wondering when "El Capitan" was 
                         going to get a chance to use his pop 
                         gun.

               Garry rebukes him with a stern look and then turns to Fuchs.

                                     GARRY
                         How long have they been stationed 
                         there?

               Fuchs leafing through a pile of papers.

                                     FUCHS
                         Says here about eight weeks.

               Dr. Copper enters the room. Bennings limping after him 
               slightly.

                                     GARRY
                              (shaking his head)
                         That's not enough time for guys to 
                         go bonkers.

                                     NAULS
                         Bullshit, Bwana, sweetheart. Five 
                         minutes is enough to put a man over 
                         down here.

                                     PALMER
                         Damn straight.

                                     NAULS
                         I mean Palmer been the way he is 
                         since the first day.

               Palmer smiles and flips the cook the bird.

                                     GARRY
                         How many in their party?

                                     FUCHS
                              (referring)
                         Started with six. There'd be four 
                         others left.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         How do you know?

               The men's attention turn to Copper.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         ...Guys as crazy as that could have 
                         done a lot of damage to their own 
                         before they got to us.

                                     GARRY
                         Nothing we can do about that.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Yes, there is. I'd like to go up.

                                     GARRY
                         In this weather?

                                     DR. COPPER
                              (turns to)
                         Bennings?

                                     BENNINGS
                         Winds are going to let up a tad, 
                         next couple of hours.

                                     GARRY
                         A tad?

                                     BENNINGS
                         Can't condone it myself. But it is a 
                         short haul. Hour there, hour back.

               Garry still does not much like the idea. Palmer takes another 
               hit off his joint.

                                     PALMER
                         Shit, Doc, I'll give you the lift 
                         if...

                                     GARRY
                         Forget it, Palmer. Doc, you're a 
                         pain in the ass.

                                     GARRY
                              (turns)
                         Norris, go get MacReady.

               Slight laughter from some of the men.

                                     NORRIS
                              (grins)
                         MacReady ain't going nowhere. Bunkered 
                         in till spring.

                                     GARRY
                         Just go get him.

                                     NORRIS
                              (stands)
                         Anyway, he's probably ripped.

               EXT. U.S. OUTPOST #31

               Norris, bundled in his sixty-five pounds of clothing, exits 
               the main compound. He walks the prefab wooden planks up the 
               precipice; his destination is someone a hundred yards up the 
               slope -- to a shack. He grabs onto the steadying ropes and 
               pulls himself against the wind and blowing sleet.

               INT. MACREADY'S SHACK - CLOSE ON ICE CUBES

               being dumped into a glass, followed by the pouring of whiskey.  
               An electronic Voice is heard.

                                     VOICE
                         Bishop to knight four.

               MacReady takes a sip of his drink; makes his way over to his 
               electronic chess game. A large Mexican sombrero hangs on his 
               back. He is tall; about thirty-five. His shack is sparse but 
               unkempt. A few centerfolds on the wall are interspersed by 
               an occasional poster of some Mediterranean or South American 
               paradise.

               The chess game is of larger than normal size. The pieces 
               move automatically with the press of a button. He sits down 
               and chuckles over his opponent's bad move.

                                     MACREADY
                         Poor little son of a bitch. You're 
                         starting to lose it, aren't you?

               He confidently taps out his move. His companion's response 
               is immediate.

                                     VOICE
                         Pawn takes queen at knight four.

               MacReady's grin slowly fades as he examines the board. There 
               is a pounding at his door. MacReady broods for a bit, heedless 
               of his visitor and makes his next move.

                                     VOICE
                         Rook to knight six. Check.

               More impatient pounding. MacReady glares at his opponent for 
               a beat. He bends forward, opens up a flap containing the 
               chess game's circuitry and pours in his drink. There ensues 
               a snapping, popping sound as smoke and sparks rise from the 
               machine; followed by a flush of chess gibberish.

               MacReady gets up from his seat, mumbling on his way to the 
               door.

                                     MACREADY
                         ...Cheating bastard...

               He opens the door. Norris steps in followed by a flurry of 
               snow and wind.

                                     NORRIS
                         You jerking off or just pissed?

                                     MACREADY
                         We got any more of those electronic 
                         chess things down in supply?

                                     NORRIS
                         Get your gear on.

                                     MACREADY
                         What for?

               EXT. OUTPOST

               One of the grounded choppers is being readied for take-off. 
               Childs holds a huge industrial torch to the engine, warming 
               it up.

               INT. MAIN COMPOUND - CORRIDOR

               Garry, Bennings, Dr. Copper, Palmer and MacReady wind their 
               way through the slender corridors on their way to the chopper. 
               Dr. Copper carries a satchel of medicine supplies. MacReady, 
               going over his flight chart, looks mad as hell. Dialogue 
               overlaps.

                         MACREADY
                 ...Craziness... This 
                 is goddamn insane...

                                                       GARRY
                                               ...Quit the griping 
                                               MacReady. Sooner you're 
                                               there -- sooner you're 
                                               back.

                                     MACREADY
                         It's against regulations to go up 
                         this time of year!

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Screw regulations! Four guys could 
                         be crawling around on their bellies 
                         out there!

                                     MACREADY
                         So, I don't want to end up crawling 
                         around with them when we go down.

                                     GARRY
                         Look, if you're going to keep 
                         bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered 
                         to take him up...

                                     MACREADY
                         What are you talking?! He's had two 
                         months training in those choppers!

                                     PALMER
                              (defiant)
                         Four!

                                     MACREADY
                              (to Bennings)
                         What is it out there, anyway? Forty-
                         five knots?

                                     BENNINGS
                         Sixteen.

                                     MACREADY
                              (disgusted)
                         And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen 
                         for how long?! You can't predict 
                         this time of year...

               INT./ EXT. CHOPPER

               Dr. Copper sits next to MacReady, who is at the controls.

               MacReady tightens the string of his sombrero around his neck 
               and starts up its choking engine.

               MacReady fights violently with the controls as he struggles 
               to get the craft into the air. It finally rights itself and 
               moves up and off into the grey-white sky.

               INT. MAIN COMPOUND

               A couple of the men mingle in the area. Clark, the dog 
               handler, looks out the window.

                                     CLARK
                         Mac's really taking it up, huh?

               The dog, a large bandage on his hip, wades through the room. 
               Under tables. Past men's legs. It hobbles slightly. No one 
               takes notice.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE CHOPPER

               moves over a ridge of ice. Columns of smoke can be seen rising 
               ominously from a quarter mile off.

               INT. CHOPPER - POINT OF VIEW

               As they near, the smoke looms thicker. A black, tar-like 
               gush; billowing up into the grey sky from the whiteness below.

               EXT. NORWEGIAN CAMP

               Smoke climbs upward in the f.g. MacReady sets his craft down. 
               Pull back to reveal the camp itself: resembling the aftermath 
               of a western fort, sacked and ravaged by Indians.

               Small fires and debris are strewn everywhere. The prefab 
               Administration Building exposes gaping holes. Smoke rises 
               from the almost entirely snow-buried Quonset huts. Embers 
               swirl in every direction.

               INT. CHOPPER

               The two men look at each other in silence. They get out.

               CLOSE ON A LARGE, MAKESHIFT FUNERAL PYRE

               smoldering to a close. A hastily conceived crematorium. Wood, 
               books, furniture, tires, anything that will burn has been 
               mixed together with the charred remains of several dogs and 
               the body of a man.

               Curious mounds of a melted and blackened goo are heaped within 
               the mess.

               A small can of gasoline lies nearby. A large oil drum not 
               far off.

               MACREADY AND COPPER

               their faces ashen as they take in this grotesque sight.

               MacReady turns to view the Norwegian compound. He then 
               exchanges a look with Copper. MacReady heads back toward the 
               chopper.

               THE CHOPPER

               MacReady unhinges the shotgun that is latched to the panel 
               behind the seats.

               EXT. THE MAIN BUILDING - THE DOOR

               MacReady and Dr. Copper stand hesitantly amidst the wisps of 
               snow and embers. MacReady tries the door. It is unlocked. He 
               slowly pushes it open with his gun. A creaking. A long pitch-
               black corridor. Copper shines a flashlight.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Anybody there?!

               No answer. Just wind. They exchange a look and enter.

               INT. NARROW CORRIDOR

               The two men move slowly. It is dank and cold. Their breath, 
               bleating like exhaust. A soft, steady wind howls overhead.  
               The flashlight is not much help.

               Further down, they hear a faint hissing sound. As they get 
               closer it more resembles static. The flashlight finds a door 
               at the end of the corridor. The sputtering static comes from 
               within.

               The face of the door has been shredded. An ax sticks out 
               from its middle. MacReady wrenches out the ax. There is blood 
               on it. The men acknowledge this for a beat.

               MacReady tries the knob. It opens slightly. Something is 
               blocking it from the other side.

                                     MACREADY
                         Anybody in there?!

               Nothing.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         We're Americans!

               Nothing.

                                     MACREADY
                         Come to help you!!

               MacReady pushes against the door.

                                     MACREADY
                         Give me a hand.

               They push, shove, grunt. The door gives a bit. Finally more. 
               It widens enough for MacReady to see that a large computer-
               like machine is blocking their path. MacReady wedges in and 
               shines the flashlight.

               It is the communications room. Holes in its roof have allowed 
               in the freezing cold. The flashlight exposes the back of the 
               radio chair. One more nudge allows them into the room.

               A beat as they catch their breath. MacReady spots a Coleman 
               lantern. He lights it with a match. Holds it up. The brighter 
               light exposes the top of a man's head sitting in the radio 
               chair.

                                     MACREADY
                         Hey, Sweden...! You okay?

               The chair rocks slightly with the gentle breeze. They inch 
               closer. A yard from the chair, MacReady stops the Doctor.  
               He pokes his gun at the chair's back.

                                     MACREADY
                         Sweden?!

               Dr. Copper spots something. From the man's wrist on the 
               armrest, he follows a long, yarn-thick, red line, ending in 
               a pool of frozen blood on the floor.

               The two men step around the chair. The Norwegian stares up 
               in blanched death. A gaping black hole for a mouth.

               His throat and wrists slit. An old-fashioned straight razor 
               in his lap.

               MacReady turns off the hissing radio, and marches to the 
               other door. It is locked and barricaded.

                                     DR. COPPER
                              (more to himself)
                         My God, what in hell happened here?

                                     MACREADY
                         Come on, Copper.

               The two men free a machine-like obstacle from the other exit. 
               MacReady opens a lock and pushes the door open.

               More blackness. Stronger wind. Copper holds the lantern high 
               as they make their way down a row of wooden steps and into a 
               cavernous, underground causeway.

                                     MACREADY
                         Hey, Sweden!!!

                                     DR. COPPER
                              (irritated)
                         They're not Swedish, goddamn it, 
                         they're Norwegian, MacRe --

               Whap!! Something slaps into the Doctor's face from the 
               darkness. The lantern crashes to the ground. The Doctor 
               stumbles, falls. MacReady grabs the flashlight and whirls in 
               different directions. A panting beat. Silence.

               Dr. Copper holds up what hit him. A thick centerfold, buffeted 
               by the wind. MacReady takes it.

                                     MACREADY
                         Norwegian of the Month, Doc. Harmless.

               MacReady pockets it for further viewing.

               INT. THE NARROWEST OF CORRIDORS

               The supporting beams have long since buckled and cracked 
               from the constantly moving ice underneath. The evidence of 
               fire has further weakened the foundations. The wood creaks 
               overhead. Bits of ice and silt trickle down.

               The two men walk hunched, cautious. MacReady gingerly tries 
               to make his way around a broken and smoldering beam. He 
               brushes it gently sending a shower of debris from the yawning 
               roof.

               The two men wait until it subsides and then moves on.

               Further down. MacReady's knee bumps into something along the 
               wall, causing him to stumble slightly. He shines his light 
               on it.

               An arm is sticking out of a steel door about three feet off 
               the ground. The door has been slammed shut. The arm pinned, 
               its fist still gripping a small welding torch.

               The flame long since gone out.

                                     MACREADY
                              (wincing)
                         Holy shit...

               He tries the door. Unlocked. It opens. The arm drops to the 
               ground. It has been severed by the force of the slam.

               Its owner is nowhere to be seen.

               MacReady, sickened, coughs. Dr. Copper mumbles.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Christ...

               They step over the arm and into another slim passageway.

               Moving along they come to rest in front of a door with 
               Norwegian lettering on it.

               MacReady pushes it open with his foot. Dozens of papers fly 
               about, flailed by the holes in the Quonset hut-style roof. 
               The place is a wreck. They enter. MacReady surveying the 
               small room with his flashlight.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         ...Laboratory.

               Broken beakers, test tubes, a microscope are illuminated.

               MacReady notices a video camera.

                                     MACREADY
                         Portable video unit.

               Copper makes his way over to the main work table. He shuffles 
               through papers, glancing at the writing.

                                     MACREADY
                         Anything?

                                     DR. COPPER
                         All in Norwegian.

               Dr. Copper bends down and begins gathering the papers, strewn 
               about the room.

                                     MACREADY
                         What are you doing?

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Could be important work. Might as 
                         well bring it back.

                                     MACREADY
                         It's getting late. Hurry it. I'm 
                         going to check the last few rooms.

               He exits. Amongst the rubble, Dr. Copper finds a pocket tape 
               recorder and several cassettes. He selects a tape and is 
               about to pop it in when he senses something to his rear. He 
               turns. Looks. A beat. Nothing.

               INT. HALLWAY

               MacReady shoves himself into another room.

               INT. ROOM

               Debris and wood flush down on him. The receding ceiling had 
               been blocking the door from above. He brushes his coat and 
               shines the light upwards.

               The ceiling is a shambles. He then shines the light deeper 
               into the room.

               INT. NORWEGIAN LAB

               Dr. Copper is playing the small tape recorder. A casual 
               Norwegian voice drones on as if making notes. He fast 
               forwards. The same casual drone.

                                     MACREADY (O.S.)
                         Copper, come here!!

               INT. ROOM

               Dr. Copper enters, squeezing in, through the door. The wood 
               cracks overhead. More debris comes falling down.

                                     MACREADY
                         Careful. It's about to go.

               Copper dusts himself. MacReady stands before a huge block of 
               ice. Fifteen feet long. Six feet wide. Four feet tall.

               It has partially melted, but its thawing process has been 
               stopped by the now freezing temperatures within the outpost.

               Its one curious feature: the middle has been thawed and 
               scooped out. Giving it the appearance of a large bathtub. 
               The two men study it uncomprehendingly.

               MacReady's gaze turns to a large metal cabinet at his left. 
               He moves for a closer look. Several photographs are pasted 
               to its door. Small snapshots of the Norwegians at work and 
               play.

               He tries to open it. Stuck. The partially caved-in ceiling 
               is slightly blocking the top of the door. He tries again, 
               careful not to dislodge the wood and plaster above. Bits of 
               dust float down.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Watch it.

               His grip is too strong. It gives suddenly, unexpectedly. The 
               large metal door flies open.

               Large chunks splash from the ceiling. They come thumping to 
               the floor, behind and in front of the open cabinet door. 
               MacReady coughs and waves away the dust. He peers inside. 
               Nothing much. Some empty shelves. Some small scientific gear.

               His flashlight then locates a large photograph taped to the 
               inside of the cabinet door.

               It is a picture of five Norwegians, arm in arm, all smiles, 
               toasting each other. They are on either side of the frozen 
               block of ice, pridefully displaying it for the camera. The 
               block looks much thicker. Its interior opaque.

               MacReady looks to the block of ice and then back to the 
               photograph. He untapes it, pockets it and shuts the door.

               An armless corpse swings into his face from behind the closing 
               door. Dislodged from the ceiling, the body and MacReady go 
               crashing to the floor.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. U.S. OUTPOST - RECREATION ROOM

               The loud beat of Warren Zevon's song, "The Werewolves of 
               London," can be heard throughout the compound. The room is 
               empty. Close on a video pong game, its ball of light lazily 
               traveling back and forth. The dog, its tail wagging, its 
               bandage on, walks by.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Zevon's record is blasting from Nauls' stereo. He skates 
               from the big walk-in freezer and plunks down a large side of 
               beef on the wood-cutting table to thaw. He skates from pot 
               to pan keeping time with his sounds.

               He smells. Tastes. Adds a little something here, a touch 
               there. He clearly enjoys his work.

               Station Manager Garry stops past the open door.

                                     GARRY
                         Turn that crap down, Nauls. You can 
                         hear it all over the camp!

                                     NAULS
                         Oui, Bwana. Can do.

               He skates over and turns it down, but not much.

               INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM

               Garry enters and sees that Sanchez has nodded off in front 
               of his receiver. His headgear is still on. Garry walks over 
               and turns up the volume, the static jolting Sanchez awake.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         Hey, man...!

                                     GARRY
                         You reach anybody yet?

                                     SANCHEZ
                         We're a thousand miles from anybody 
                         else, man. It's going to get a hell 
                         of a lot worse before it gets better.

                                     GARRY
                         Well, stick to it.

               INT. COMPOUND CORRIDOR

               An empty hallway. Larger than most. Doors to several sleeping 
               quarters on either side. The dog slowly walks through.

               One of the doors is open up ahead of his left. The dog stops 
               in front of it and looks in. Someone is inside.

               Inside the small cubicle, a slight portion of a man's back 
               can be seen as he sits bent over a chair; his large shadow 
               displayed on the wall.

               Back in the corridor. The dog looks up the hall once and 
               casually to the other end. No one. He enters the room. The 
               sound of a man's voice, too indistinct to tell whose, mumbles:

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                         Hello boy.

               A beat.

               The sound of a glass breaking. A muffled scuffling. The door 
               is slammed shut from the inside. And then silence.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COMPOUND

               Fuchs, the young biologist, is finishing up his daily jog 
               around the compound. He stops at the end of a long Quonset 
               hut almost completely buried in the snow. The hut is fifty 
               yards long and connects to the main compound. He enters a 
               tunnel from a latch door up top.

               INT. TUNNEL

               He jogs down the steps, passing the underground dog kennel 
               and trots toward the compound through the long narrow tunnel. 
               He passes and waves to Clark, who rolls along a wheelbarrow 
               of dog food.

               CLARK

               opens the door to the small kennel and serves up the dinner.  
               The dogs, about seven of them, yelp and bark eagerly.

               INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGEWAY

               near the fuel supply bladders. Older and more rickety than 
               the quarters above.

               Childs waltzes through, humming, a big smile on his face.

               He stops at a door with six locks on it. Different kinds.

               Combination locks, key locks, etc. He opens each one 
               separately.

               INT. STORAGE ROOM

               Inside are several marijuana plants. Sun lamps beam down on 
               them. Childs inspects them with a wide grin.

                                     CHILDS
                         How my brothers and sister doing 
                         today? Doin' fine.

               He moves over to a tape deck, selects a cassette, grins back 
               at the plants and turns it on.

                                     CHILDS
                         What say to some nice Al Green for 
                         my babies, huh?

               He waters them carefully, as Al Green sings softly. He hears 
               a panting and turns around to see the dog. His bandage is 
               gone.

                                     CHILDS
                         What you...? You get the hell on out 
                         of here.

               The dog is shooed off. Childs turns back grumbling.

                                     CHILDS
                         ...Comin' in here... goin' to urinate 
                         on my babies.

               INT. MAIN COMPOUND - HALLWAY

               Blair passing through, holding a chart and carrying a rack 
               of test tubes, notices a large bandage on the floor. He picks 
               it up, inquiringly. It is mangled and shredded.

               INT. GENERATOR ROOM

               Palmer works on the generator. He hears the sound of 
               approaching propeller blades from outside. And then the sound 
               of his tool box crashing to the floor. He turns to see what 
               caused the ruckus.

               The dog, who has entered the shed, has jumped on the work 
               table and upended the tool box on its eagerness to look out 
               of the above window. Palmer curses under his breath and calls 
               out.

                                     PALMER
                         Clark! Will you kennel this goddamn 
                         dog?
                              (bangs wrench against 
                              pipe)
                         Hey, Clark?!

               THE DOG

               It paws at the window and watches as the chopper, carrying 
               MacReady and Dr. Copper, fights against the newly arrived 
               heavy winds and lands safely.

               INT. STATION MANAGER GARRY'S QUARTERS

               Garry, MacReady, Dr. Copper, Norris, Bennings, Blair and his 
               assistant, Fuchs, are present. The small Norwegian video 
               unit has been set up and its contents are being viewed on a 
               TV screen. Grainy, home movie-ish, no sound.

               The proceedings are grim.

               Shots of the Norwegian's at work. Others of them playing 
               soccer on ice. Generally the footage is a prosaic record of 
               their day-to-day life.

               Norris shuffles the bundle of notes Dr. Copper brought back 
               with him.

                                     NORRIS
                         ...Seems they were spending a lot of 
                         time at a place four miles northeast 
                         of their camp.

                                     GARRY
                         What were they involved in?

               MacReady, working on the video machine, answers.

                                     MACREADY
                         Little ice core drilling... some 
                         seismology... glaciology... same old 
                         shit we do.

               The present footage is a shot of them all naked and probably 
               drunk, holding a sign across their waists as they stand 
               outdoors in super-freezing weather.

                                     BENNINGS
                         How much more of this crap is there?

                                     DR. COPPER
                         About nine more hours.

                                     BENNINGS
                         We can't learn anything from this.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Probably right.

               MacReady turns on the light and shuts off the video machine. 
               He then slides the portable tape deck across the table to 
               Dr. Copper. They exchange a look.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         MacReady and I were listening to 
                         some of these cassettes on the way 
                         back.
                              (somberly)
                         Like you gentlemen to hear it.

               A Norwegian voice drones on calmly, making verbal notes.

               Norris shrugs.

                                     BENNINGS
                         What do you want from us?

                                     MACREADY
                              (flat)
                         Just listen.

               Dr. Copper fast forwards. The calm voice continues. And then 
               a loud blast, followed by pounding. The sounds of confusion. 
               Voices. Loud. Frenetic. Men's feet running up and down wooden 
               floorboards. A gurgling. A hissing.

               Screams. And then a screeching. More blasts mixed with the 
               din of wild, carnage-wrought cries. And then more screeching. 
               A screeching unlike anything these men have ever heard.

               The men look from one another in silence as they listen.

               Dr. Copper turns it off.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Goes on like that quite awhile.
                              (beat)
                         What do you gentlemen make of it?

                                     GARRY
                         Could be anything... Men in 
                         isolation... some beef that 
                         snowballed... got out of hand...

                                     NORRIS
                         Maybe the whole camp got bent...  
                         Something they ate. What about food 
                         poisoning, Doc?

               Dr. Copper taps the tape deck pensively.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Maybe.

               He glances at MacReady, and then back to the others.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         There's something else we want you 
                         to see.

               INT. INFIRMARY

               Dr. Copper and MacReady begin dumping the heavy contents of 
               a large plastic trash bag onto the slab.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         We found this.

               Displayed on the slab is what appears to be the corpse of a 
               man. Badly charred. What is left of the trousers and shoes 
               of the bottom torso are ripped and split, as if his legs and 
               feet had burst from the inside. His upper body is an almost 
               undecipherable gnarled mass of protoplasmic mush.

               The head is strangely disfigured and looks larger than normal. 
               It is situated not on its shoulders but near the abdomen. 
               Tendon-like appendages are wrapped around the carcass and 
               sticking up and out in odd postures. One is wrapped around 
               the body's left leg.

               The shirt has been ripped and lies shredded in the tar-like 
               mess.

               The men grimace.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         I know he's pretty badly burned... 
                         but could fire have done this?

               Blair, sickened but fascinated, pokes at the tendon-like 
               things and the tarry goo.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Blair, I'd like you and Fuchs to 
                         help me with autopsies on this one 
                         and the one Garry shot this morning.

               INT. REC ROOM - LATER - CLOSE ON A TABLE HOCKEY GAME

               Sanchez sits off in a corner thumbing through an old issue 
               of Photoplay.

               Bennings, Norris and Garry are engaged in a card game. 
               Bennings is about to play a card when he feels something 
               under the table. He looks. It is the dog.

                                     BENNINGS
                         Clark, will you put this mutt with 
                         the others where he belong?!

               larger than most of the other rooms and well-equipped.

               Dr. Copper is performing an autopsy on the Norwegian intruder, 
               killed early that morning.

               Blair sits over his microscope, while Fuchs prepares slides. 
               The other body is draped with a sheet, waiting its turn. Dr. 
               Copper pulls off his gloves.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Nothing wrong with this one.  
                         Physiologically, anyway.
                              (to Blair)
                         Find anything toxic?

                                     BLAIR
                         No drugs... alcohol. Nothing.

               Clark leads the dog through the long, cold tunnel toward the 
               kennel. A new dressing has been placed on its hip.

               He unlatches the door to the kennel and leads him in.

               INT. KENNEL

               About twenty feet long, five feet wide. Poorly lit.

               Cramped with dogs. Some of them sleeping. Others pacing around 
               and curious, greet their new companion, sniffing, panting 
               and rubbing up against him. Clark pats the dog and several 
               others, then leaves, latching the door behind him.

               INT. SLEEPING CUBICLE

               Childs lies in his cot watching a small television. The show 
               is a tape of an American TV game show. He has seen this one 
               too many times, extracts the cassette and injects another 
               game show.

               Palmer is stretched out in the other cot, reading a comic 
               book and smoking a joint. Childs beckons for it and takes a 
               hit.

               Blair, hovering over the microscope, lays in a slide, focuses 
               and motions for Dr. Copper to take a look.

               Copper is confused as he examines. He shrugs.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         I don't understand.

               Fuchs takes the opportunity to look. Blair moves over to the 
               disfigured corpse and indicates one of the fibrous, tendon-
               like appendages.

                                     BLAIR
                         It's tissue from one of these sinewy 
                         rods.

               Fuchs is befuddled as he examines.

                                     FUCHS
                         What in the world kind of cell 
                         structure is this?

                                     BLAIR
                         That's the point.

                                     DR. COPPER
                              (tired)
                         I don't get you, Blair.

                                     BLAIR
                         I'm not sure it is any kind of cell 
                         structure. Biologically speaking.

                                     DR. COPPER
                              (sighing)
                         This really isn't my field, Blair. 
                         Let's wrap for the day.

               Dr. Copper undoes his lab coat and lays it over a chair as 
               he exits. Blair stares down ominously at the mutilated body.

               EXT. COMPOUND - NIGHT

               A steady stream of sleet pounds the compound and small 
               surrounding shacks.

               INT. REC ROOM

               Vacant. The wall clock reads four-thirty.

               INT. HALLWAY

               Sleeping cubicles on either side. The sound of snoring.

               INT. PUB

               Bleary-eyed, MacReady is in the process of blowing up some 
               strange inflatable object. As he puffs away, he still keeps 
               an eye on the Norwegian video tapes. His balloon begins to 
               take shape. It blossoms into a life-size replica of a full-
               breasted woman. Something on the tape catches his eye. He 
               rewinds, then starts it forward again.

               The screen shows the Norwegians on the surface of what appears 
               to be an enormous, flat glacier. They are spread out on the 
               ice around a large odd oval shape; their arms outstretched.

               It fades to black and then a Norwegian comes on mugging 
               childishly in front of the camera, apparently quite pleased 
               with something.

               The tape fades to black again and the picture reappears.

               This time they have marked off the large oval area with flag 
               sticks.

               Closer shots show three of the men digging a deep hole into 
               the ice. There is a small patch of something dark and metallic 
               at the bottom.

               MacReady leans forward, intrigued.

               The men are now sinking something deep into the ice at various 
               points around the markings. MacReady squints and mumbles to 
               himself.

                                     MACREADY
                         Decanite...? Thermite charges...?

               The tape jump cuts again showing a long shot of the markings. 
               No Norwegian in sight. An explosion kicks up the ice. A beat 
               as the ice sprays to the ground. Then the camera appears to 
               shake as the ground beneath it quivers.

               Another immense explosion follows. An earthquake-like force 
               throws the camera to the ground.

                                     MACREADY
                         What in...

               The tape continues, distorted, unviewable. A distinct crack 
               in the lens. MacReady lets go of his companion and quickly 
               rewinds. The deflating mannequin is sent sputtering around 
               the room.

               INT. KENNEL - NIGHT

               Most of the dogs are sleeping or lounging. The new dog watches 
               them calmly, silently.

               He takes several steps towards a group of about five dogs 
               and sits upright. Completely still. He stares at them. A 
               beat. The dogs are aware of something. They begin to seem a 
               bit confused, uncomfortable.

               The new dog continues to stare. Sitting rigidly, unnaturally 
               still. His eyes dead, lusterless black spheres.

               Bewildered, a few dogs start to pace. As if sensing something:  
               a portent. A danger. But so odd. They begin a soft, purring 
               growl.

               The new dog remains a statue. The growling builds. More dogs 
               begin to pace. Nervously. Faster, encircling.

               Emitting hisses, snarls. The lack of response driving them 
               into a frenzy.

               Barks. Growls. More frenetic pacing. The din escalating. 
               Three dogs start to close in on the stranger.

               They attack.

               THE SHADOW OF THE NEW DOG

               against the kennel wall. The shadow suddenly lurches upward, 
               seeming larger.

               The kennel roars.

               INT. PUB

               MacReady is still going over bits of the same footage, 
               fascinated. He hears the far-off clamor of the dogs.

               INT. NAULS' QUARTERS

               He, too, bothered by the noise, tosses and turns in his sleep.

               INT. CLARK'S QUARTERS

               Clark snores. MacReady has entered.

                                     MACREADY
                         Clark.

               No response. MacReady nudges him. Clark rolls away, annoyed.

               MacReady pinches his snoring nose, cutting off the air.

               Clark sits up, groggy.

                                     MACREADY
                         Dogtown's going nuts. Take care of 
                         it.

               INT. TUNNEL

               Clark, sleepy, irritated, makes his way down the freezing 
               corridor. The wind soughing loudly overhead.

               CLARK

               reaches the kennel door. The savage outpouring of noise from 
               within baffles and angers him. He unlatches the door.

                                     CLARK
                         What's got into...

               Smack! Just as he opens the door, two dogs, as if jettisoned 
               from a cannon, knock him off his feet. Growls, barks, snarls. 
               And a screeching from within.

               INT. KITCHEN

               MacReady is fetching himself a beer. The sound of the far-
               off screeching. He freezes. A beat. He turns and sprints.

               HIS BEER CAN

               as it smashes the glass of the fire alarm. He pulls the lever.

               INT. TUNNEL

               The alarm is blaring throughout the camp. MacReady, Garry, 
               Norris run through the narrow tunnel led by Clark.

               MacReady carries a shotgun. Garry, half-dressed, has his 
               .44. Clark, a fire ax.

                                     CLARK
                         I don't know what the hell's in there, 
                         but it's weird and pissed off, 
                         whatever it is.

               INT. HALLWAY

               Chaos. Men, half-naked, bounce from their cubicle.

               Pulling on their pants, digging into shoes.

               INT. CHILDS' CUBICLE

               Childs is grappling with his belt buckle.

                                     CHILDS
                         Mac wants the what?!

                                     BENNINGS
                              (at the doorway)
                         That's what he said. Now! Move!

               Bennings is off.

               INT. TUNNEL

               as the men approach the locked kennel door. The two dogs, 
               thrown into Clark, back ferociously and scratch at the door 
               trying to get back in. One is badly bloodied.

               The fight inside rages on. MacReady and Clark brace themselves 
               by the narrow door. Norris and Garry hold back the two 
               hysterical dogs. Clark undoes the latch and he and MacReady 
               enter the kennel.

               The light has been broken and it is pitch black. MacReady 
               snaps on his flashlight. Norris and Garry can't contain their 
               animals and the dogs burst into the room. They smash into 
               MacReady and send him sprawling. Total confusion: the dogs; 
               the men; the screeching; the blackness.

                                     CLARK
                         Mac, where are you?

               MacReady gropes for his flashlight and rights himself. He 
               finds Clark. Then shines it around the cramped room trying 
               to get his bearings.

               The light finds a mass of dogs in a wild melee in the corner.

               Barking mixed with hissing, a gurgling, a screeching.

               Dogs being hurled about and then charging back into the fray 
               with a vengeance.

               The flashlight illuminates parts of some "thing." A dog.

               But not quite. Impossible to tell. It struggles powerfully.  
               Garry pokes his head into the blackness.

                                     GARRY
                         What's going on, damn it?

               MacReady aims his shotgun at the entire pack.

                                     MACREADY
                         I'm going to shoot.

                                     CLARK
                         No! Wait!!

               Clark wades into the pack, grabs at dogs' hides and throws 
               them back. He then wields his ax into the fray, chopping and 
               hacking away at the gurgling, hissing silhouette.

               From out of nowhere, a large, bristly, arachnid-like leg 
               springs up and wraps around Clark's ax. It sends Clark 
               smashing violently into the wall.

               OUTSIDE

               More men running, nearing the kennel. Several squeezing in 
               with Garry, trying to get a look.

               INSIDE

               MacReady fires several rounds. A dog is flung at him, knocking 
               him and his flashlight once more to the ground.

               Garry squeezes in and begins blasting away in the direction 
               of the hissing and screeching. A dog is hit. MacReady crawls 
               for his flashlight.

                                     MACREADY
                         Clark? Where are you? Clark!

               Blam. Blam. Garry continues firing at the silhouette.

               INT. TUNNEL

               Childs, huffing and puffing, lugs the huge industrial torch 
               toward the crowded kennel doorway.

                                     CHILDS
                         What's happening?

                                     MACREADY (O.S.)
                         Childs, you got the torch? You get 
                         your ass in here!!

               INT. KENNEL

               Childs scrunches in, disoriented by the blackness, and bumps 
               into Garry, knocking him off balance.

                                     CHILDS
                         Where are you?

               MacReady signals with his flashlight and then points it at 
               the gathering of snarling dogs.

                                     MACREADY
                         Torch it over there!

                                     CHILDS
                         The dogs?

                                     MACREADY
                         Screw the dogs!! Torch it!!

               Childs lets loose with a burst of blue flame. A mewing, a 
               screeching.

               Part of the kennel starts to burn.

                                     GARRY
                              (panic)
                         We're on fire!

                                     MACREADY
                         Don't let up, Childs!

                                     GARRY
                              (to outside)
                         Extinguishers.

               Childs moves closer, continuing his assault on the hissing, 
               gurgling presence.

               Men charge into the room and begin spraying dogs and burning 
               walls. Dogs and men choke and cough amidst the smoke and 
               CO2.

               The screeching lessens. The hissing and gurgling fade. Childs 
               turns off his torch.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. REC ROOM - NEXT MORNING

               Those of the men that have gathered exhibit a pale and quiet 
               uneasiness.

               Blair, in silent awe, stands over the badly burned corpses 
               of two interlocking dogs, that lie before him on a table.

               They are connected as if they were one animal. Though, the 
               one wearing the remnants of Clark's bandage is much larger 
               and appears less dog-like. Its entire torso is cracked and 
               peeled, as if its innards were trying to burst out.

               Odd appendages, recoiled and withered by the flame, are 
               wrapped grotesquely about both bodies.

               Clark, his eyes set in glassy stare, sits in shock. Nauls 
               comforts him. Childs stands nearby smoking a joint and staring 
               at the floor.

               Blair, transfixed, continues hovering over the united 
               cadavers. Weighing. Thinking. A very worried look on his 
               face.

               The dead bodies of two other dogs from the kennel are not 
               far off.

               INT. INFIRMARY

               Fuchs is attending to the shredded bodies of three other 
               badly wounded dogs.

               INT. REC ROOM

               Nauls pats Clark on the shoulder and grins, trying to pick 
               up his spirits.

                                     NAULS
                         It's okay now, man. It's dead. It's 
                         over.
                              (beat)
                         You see.

               Clark turns to him with a childlike smile.

                                     CLARK
                         I know. Mr. Childs killed it. I saw.

                                     NAULS
                         Right, man. Right.

               INT. SMALL WORKROOM

               Norris is going through some maps. MacReady is bent over his 
               shoulder. Norris finds the one he's looking for.

                                     NORRIS
                         Here. This is where they were spending 
                         most of their time.

               Bennings pokes his head in the room.

                                     BENNINGS
                         Pretty nasty out, Mac. Thirty-five 
                         knots.

                                     MACREADY
                         Screw it, I'm going up anyway.

               INT. MAIN COMPOUND - MORNING

               Station Manager Garry has joined Blair by the stuck-together 
               bodies. Blair motions to the bandage.

                                     BLAIR
                         Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?

                                     GARRY
                         I just can't comprehend any of this. 
                         It was just a dog.

                                     CHILDS
                              (evenly)
                         "tweren't no dog, Bwana.

                                     BLAIR
                         That tape MacReady showed us this 
                         morning...

                                     GARRY
                         Couldn't make much of it myself.

                                     BLAIR
                         I've asked him to try and locate the 
                         site. Okay with you?

                                     GARRY
                         Sure. You think there's a connection?

                                     BLAIR
                         Maybe.

               EXT. CHOPPER

               high above the Antarctic expanse.

               INT. CHOPPER

               MacReady pilots. Young Palmer and Norris are with him.

               It is clear but the winds are troublesome. The ride is a 
               shaky one. Norris refers to their map. He points.

                                     NORRIS
                         One of their sites would be directly 
                         over here.

               They aim for a large mountainous wall. As they go up and 
               over... they see:

               FLAT, GLACIAL EXPANSE

               On the surface, an enormous blackened oval shape.

               INT. U.S. OUTPOST #31 - LAB

               All the bodies of the dogs have been brought in. Fuchs stands 
               by as Blair studies through his microscope.

               INSERT - A MICROSCOPIC SAMPLING

               of two cells. They appear to be much different from each 
               other. They are joined at the ends but are completing the 
               process of breaking off from each other.

               ON BLAIR

               A disturbed look on his face. He checks his watch, as if 
               timing the procedure.

               EXT. GLACIER - TRACKING WITH MACREADY, NORRIS AND PALMER

               as they walk along the ice. They come to a stop at the edge 
               of a sharp drop.

               Pull back to reveal -- the massive black hole about fifteen 
               feet beneath the ice. Charred, gnarled and mangled metal are 
               all that is left of what was once an enormous sphere.

               MacReady's and Norris' eyes meet each other in silence.

               Palmer is in awe.

                                     PALMER
                         Wow...

               MacReady finds a burst thermite canister. He and Norris climb 
               down.

               They move along amongst the wreck. Almost everything but the 
               skeletal superstructure has disintegrated into a fine ashy 
               powder.

               Norris digs for ice samples at the perimeter of the wreckage, 
               while MacReady browses through the center.

               Palmer continues to marvel, as he walks around the oval, 
               atop the ice.

               MacReady returns and kneels down next to Norris as the latter 
               examines a piece of metal.

                                     NORRIS
                         Magnesium of some type... or some 
                         kind of strange alloy.
                              (looks out at debris 
                              in disgust)
                         And those poor dumb bastards had to 
                         go and blow the hell out of it.

                                     MACREADY
                         So what do you make of it?

                                     NORRIS
                         You know damn well what we both make 
                         of it.

                                     MACREADY
                         No chance it could have been some 
                         new kind of test craft?

               Norris shakes his head no.

                                     NORRIS
                         Seismic activity has been pushing 
                         this are up from way down for a long 
                         time...
                              (holds up ice sample)
                         ...This ice it was buried in...  
                         It's over a hundred thousand years 
                         old.

               Palmer calls out, waving them over.

               EXT. GLACIER

               The two men join Palmer about fifty yards from the oval.

               A large rectangular chunk has been cut out of the ice. It is 
               fifteen feet long, six feet wide and eight feet deep.

               MacReady kneels down to observe. A beat.

               A gust of wind picks up the snow at their feet.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. REC ROOM - NIGHT

               Fascinated, a few of the men are reviewing the Norwegian 
               video tapes of the finding of the mysterious craft.

               MacReady sits quietly by his chess set contemplating a large 
               glass of Scotch. Clark, less interested than the others, is 
               flipping through the Norwegian nudie magazine.

               Blair, looking worried, sits off in a corner, pondering the 
               photo of the block of ice and fingering a piece of crumbled-
               up metal brought back from the site.

               Childs, viewing the tapes, can't quite believe it all.

                                     CHILDS
                         Okay now, Mac, run this by me again. 
                         Thousands of years ago this rocket 
                         ship crashes, right...? And the...

               MacReady is not listening.

                                     CHILDS
                         MacReady!

                                     MACREADY
                         Look, I'm just guessing...

                                     CHILDS
                         Well, go on.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Nauls, about to prepare dinner, scowls as he rummages through 
               his many cabinets.

                                     NAULS
                         Where's that big ol' steel pot of 
                         mine?! Damn!

               He turns to examine the cabinets above the large stove. He 
               spots something in the nearby kitchen trash can.

               Disgusted, he pulls out a torn and shredded pair of long 
               johns.

               INT. REC ROOM

               MacReady theorizes.

                                     MACREADY
                         ...So it crashes, and this guy, 
                         whoever he is, gets thrown out, or 
                         walks out, and ends up freezing.

                                     CHILDS
                         I just can't believe this voodoo 
                         bullshit. You believe this voodoo 
                         bullshit, Blair?

               Blair says nothing, lost in thought.

               Palmer, stoned, a joint dangling from his mouth, is searching 
               for information through stacks of old issues of The National 
               Enquirer and The Star.

                                     PALMER
                              (rambling)
                         Happens all the time, man. They're 
                         falling out of the skies like flies. 
                         Government knows all about it...  
                         Chariots of the Gods, man... They 
                         practically own South America. I 
                         mean they taught the Incas everything 
                         they knew...

                                     CHILDS
                         Cool it, Palmer!!

               Palmer shakes a magazine at him adamantly.

                                     PALMER
                         Read von Daniken! Have you read von 
                         Daniken? Get your facts straight!

               Clark marvels at a particular photo.

                                     CLARK
                         Jesus, why would those guys ever 
                         want to leave Norway...?

               Nauls skates into the room. He shakes the crumpled-up pair 
               of long johns in his fist.

                                     NAULS
                         Which one you muthers been tossing 
                         his dirty underwear in the kitchen 
                         trash?!

               He flings it across the room. It lands on MacReady's chess 
               set.

                                     NAULS
                         I want my kitchen clean. Germ free!

               Nauls spins on his skates and storms off. MacReady fetches 
               the strangely shredded underwear and rolls it up, while Childs 
               paces.

                                     CHILDS
                         So, MacReady, come on now. These 
                         Norwegian dudes come by... find him 
                         and dig him up...

               MacReady tosses the ball of cloth across the room into a 
               trash bin.

                                     MACREADY
                         Yeah, they dig him up and cart him 
                         back. He gets thawed out, wakes up 
                         and scares the shit out of them. And 
                         they get into one hell of a brawl...

                                     CHILDS
                         Now how's this motherfucker wake up 
                         after thousands of years in the ice, 
                         huh?

                                     MACREADY
                              (annoyed)
                         I don't know how. Because he's 
                         different than we are. Because he's 
                         a space guy. What do you want from 
                         me, anyway. Go ask Blair.

                                     CHILDS
                         You buy any of this, Blair?

               A beat as Blair stares straight ahead, transfixed. He speaks 
               softly, to no one particular.

                                     BLAIR
                         It was here... got to that dog... It 
                         was here in this camp...

               The men take in his grave countenance.

                                     GARRY
                         So...? So what? It's over with.

               Blair turns to them. A pause. The men search his face.

                                     BENNINGS
                              (edgy)
                         Well, isn't it?

               INT. LAB - CLOSE ON A SHEET

               as Blair rips it off exposing the tangled mess of interlocking 
               dogs.

               Pull back. All the men have gathered. Some of the men settle 
               into chairs, others stand.

                                     BLAIR
                         Whatever that Norwegian dog was...  
                         It... It was capable of changing its 
                         form...

                         ...when it attacked our dog... it 
                         somehow was able to digest... or... 
                         absorb it... and in the process shaped 
                         its own cells to imitate our dog's 
                         cells exactly...

                         all -- it's imitation... We got to

                         ...I think the whole process would 
                         have taken an hour... maybe more. 
                         And then I suppose both would have 
                         changed back to dog form.

                         adaptable creature it was... it tried 
                         to become something that could... 
                         Before the Norwegians killed it... 
                         it somehow got to this dog.

                         What do you mean "got" to the dog?

                         It was a life form that was able to 
                         imitate and reproduce, whatever it 
                         ate or absorbed, cell for cell.

               Silence.

                                     BLAIR
                         The concept is staggering. I know... 
                         I... I don't fully understand it 
                         myself.

                         You're saying... that big muther in 
                         the ice, became the dog.

                                     BLAIR
                              (nodding)
                         I think we're talking about an 
                         organism... that could imitate other 
                         life forms... perfectly... It could 
                         have gone on and on... It could have 
                         become one dog... It could have become 
                         as many dogs as it wanted to -- and 
                         without losing any of its original 
                         mass...

                                     NORRIS
                         You been into Childs' weed, Blair?

               Blair slams his fist on the slab.

                                     BLAIR
                         Look, I know it's hard to believe...

                                     GARRY
                              (breaking in)
                         So what's our problem?

                                     BLAIR
                         Well... there's still some cell 
                         activity... it's not entirely dead 
                         yet.

               Several of the men nearest the carcasses jump back knocking 
               over a chair.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COMPOUND - NIGHT - CLOSE ON THE DOG CARCASSES

               lying on the snow. Splash. They are being soaked with 
               gasoline.

                         You can't do this! You can't burn 
                         these remains...

               Pull back. Fuchs is beside himself. Childs has the large 
               torch. MacReady empties another can on the bodies. Dr. Copper 
               stands nearby.

                                     MACREADY
                         And the horse you rode in on, Fuchs.
                              (to Childs)
                         Light it up.

               Childs lights the tip. Fuchs makes a determined move for the 
               torch.

                                     FUCHS
                         Well, I'm not going to let this 
                         happen...

               Childs struggles with him for a beat and then flings him to 
               the ground. Dr. Copper grabs him preventing him from getting 
               back up.

               Childs splays the remains with a jet of flame. Fuchs shakes 
               his head in frustration and disgust.

                                     FUCHS
                         I just can't believe it... We're 
                         going to go down as the biggest bunch 
                         of assholes in history...

                         to live to be an old bunch of 
                         assholes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KENNEL - NIGHT

               The night feeding. Clark dishes out the food. Blair is taking 
               blood samples from the remaining three dogs.

                                     BLAIR
                              (perplexed, bothered)
                         Clark, did you notice anything strange 
                         about that dog? Just anything at 
                         all? Any little thing?

                                     CLARK
                         No. Just that he recovered real 
                         quick... That night when I found him 
                         in the rec room, he had already 
                         scraped off his bandage. Before I 
                         put him with the others, I redressed 
                         his wound and noticed it had healed 
                         up real good...

               A beat as Blair stares at Clark.

                                     BLAIR
                         That night?

                                     CLARK
                              (pets dog vigorously)
                         Yeah.

                                     BLAIR
                         What was he doing in the rec room?

                                     CLARK
                         Well, after I worked on him -- thought 
                         I'd let him rest. Left the room for 
                         a bit. When I came back, he was gone.

                                     BLAIR
                         Well, where was he? Where did he go?

                                     CLARK
                         Don't know. Looked for him for a 
                         bit... couldn't find him.

                                     BLAIR
                              (a long beat)
                         You're saying he wasn't put into the 
                         kennel until the night?

               Clark seems uneasy under Blair's intense gaze.

                                     CLARK
                         Well... yeah.

               Blair stands, his eyes still glued to Clark.

                                     BLAIR
                         How long were you with the dog? Alone, 
                         I mean?

                                     CLARK
                         Ah... He was hurt bad. Bullet nicked 
                         an artery... I don't know... An 
                         hour... hour and a half...

               Blair's eyes glaze as if in revelation.

                                     CLARK
                         What the hell you looking at me like 
                         that for?

                                     BLAIR
                         Nothing. Nothing at all.

               He backs out of the kennel.

               INT. HALLWAY - COMPOUND

               Irritated, distressed, station manager Garry moves briskly 
               down the hall. Blair, worried and pale, tries to keep up 
               with him.

                                     BLAIR
                         ...It could have gotten to somebody...

                                     GARRY
                         Anybody sick?

                                     BLAIR
                         No, I... I don't mean infection... 
                         or disease...

               Garry stops at the entrance to the communications room.

                                     GARRY
                         Any luck yet?

               Sanchez shrugs.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         Couple seconds of an Argentine disco 
                         station.

                                     GARRY
                         Well, stick with it. I want you at 
                         it round the clock. We got to get 
                         help in here...

                                     BLAIR
                              (alarm)
                         No... No, you can't let anyone in 
                         here... That dog was all over this 
                         camp...

               Bennings interrupts, entering the hallway, referring to his 
               meteorological chart.

                                     BENNINGS
                              (to Garry)
                         Travel-wise, tomorrow may be okay. 
                         But after that some pretty nasty 
                         northeasterly shit's coming in.

                                     FUCHS
                         ...Goddamn fools...

               The men outside come stomping through the hallway.

                                     BLAIR
                              (pleading)
                         Listen to me, Garry. Please...

                              (to MacReady)
                         If the weather clears enough before 
                         we reach anybody -- I'm sending you 
                         and Doc up to MacMurdo...

                         BLAIR
                 No! You can't let people 
                 leave...

                                                       MACREADY

                              (snapping)
                         The hell you won't, MacReady!

                                     BLAIR
                         Don't you understand?! That Thing 
                         didn't want to become a dog...

                                     GARRY
                              (fed up)
                         Damn you, Blair! You've already got 
                         everybody half-hysterical around 
                         here.

                                     BLAIR
                         You can't let anybody leave!

                                     GARRY
                         I've got six dead Norwegians on my 
                         hands, a burned up flying saucer, 
                         and we've just destroyed the 
                         scientific find of the century. Now 
                         fuck off!

               Close on Blair, ashen-faced, falling silent. As if in a daze, 
               he watches the men as they continue to converse. Suspicious, 
               frightened.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COMPOUND - NIGHT

               Pitch black except for the barest of lighting which outlines 
               the building. Wind. The swirl of ice.

               INT. MACREADY'S CABIN - NIGHT

               Far away from the others, MacReady sits in his little hovel 
               putting the final screw into his mended chess set.

               On the other side of the set, his busty, inflatable companion 
               has been propped up in a chair. His sombrero hangs down her 
               back, keeping her in place. Hawaiian music plays from his 
               tape deck.

                                     MACREADY
                         All set.

               He puts down his screwdriver, holds up his glass and offers 
               a toast with a big grin.

                                     MACREADY
                         To us.

               He clinks the drink he has made for her that rests on her 
               side of the board. He sips. He turns on the machine and makes 
               his first move.

                                     MACREADY
                         Now go easy on me, Esperanza. I'm 
                         just a beginner.

               The set answers for Esperanza.

                                     CHESS VOICE
                         Rook takes bishop at Queen four -- 
                         Rook take pawn at Queen two -- Rook 
                         takes Queen at Queen one -- Checkmate.

                                     MACREADY
                         Aw shit.

               He flips open the circuitry panel in disgust. He tosses his 
               screwdriver on the board and grabs his drink, downing it.

                                     MACREADY
                         Sorry, hon.

               He reaches inside his ice bucket. Empty.

                                     MACREADY
                         Never any damn ice around here...

               EXT. MACREADY'S CABIN - NIGHT

               MacReady exits. He swacks at a nearby bank of ice with a 
               small ice pick.

                                     MACREADY
                         Now in Mexico... Tahiti... They got 
                         ice... They got ice coming out of 
                         their ears.

               The sound of a clanking. He turns his attention. Metal against 
               metal. Strange. MacReady listens. It appears to be coming 
               from far off below, near the camp.

               MACREADY

               as he makes his way down with the aid of the steadying ropes. 
               The clanking louder now. He senses the direction.

               MACREADY

               at the bottom near the main compound.  The sound has stopped.  
               He looks around in the near blackness.  A beat.

               THE CHOPPERS

               sitting idle in the dark. MacReady approaches. The door to 
               one of the cockpits is slightly ajar. He opens it cautiously.

               INT. CHOPPER

               MacReady slips in. He turns on a flashlight. The controls 
               have been mangled. Beaten with something heavy. Bang!! 
               MacReady, startled, turns. Like the sound of a gun. Coming 
               from the main compound.

               INT. COMPOUND - MAIN ENTRANCE

               Confusion. Shouts. MacReady enters. He grabs Palmer as he 
               and Bennings rush by.

                                     MACREADY
                         What's...

                                     PALMER
                         Blair. He's gone berserk.

                                     BENNINGS
                         He's in the radio room. Got a gun. 
                         Beat on Sanchez something fierce.

               HALLWAY - RADIO ROOM ENTRANCE

               The men are on either side of the open radio room doorway.

               Garry peeks his head in. A gunshot blast forces him back.

               RADIO ROOM

               Sanchez lies on the floor, groaning. Blair holds the gun on 
               the door. He wields a fire ax with the other hand and smashes 
               down on the radio.

                                     BLAIR
                         Anybody interferes, I'll kill! 
                         Nobody's getting in or out of this 
                         camp...

               HALLWAY

               MacReady has joined the others.

                                     MACREADY
                         He smashed one of the choppers up 
                         good. Childs, go check the other one 
                         and the tractor.

               Childs is off.

               RADIO ROOM

               Blair crunches the ax down once again, while keeping an eye 
               on the door.

                                     BLAIR
                         ...You think I'm crazy? Fine! Most 
                         of you don't know what's going on -- 
                         but I'm damn well sure some of you 
                         do!
                              (crunch)

               BACK TO HALLWAY

                                     NORRIS
                         The back window. A couple of us could 
                         maybe surprise him.

                                     MACREADY
                         Too damn dangerous.

               BACK TO RADIO ROOM

                                     BLAIR
                         ...You think this Thing wants to 
                         become an animal? Dogs can't make it 
                         1000 miles to the sea. No skua gulls 
                         to imitate this time of year... No 
                         penguins this far inland... Don't 
                         you understand?! It wanted to become 
                         us!

               He brings the ax down hard on the radio.

               BACK TO HALLWAY

               Childs runs up, out of breath.

                                     CHILDS
                         He got both choppers and the 
                         tractor... I don't know how bad yet.

               Garry readies his large .357 Magnum.

                                     MACREADY
                         No, wait a minute.
                              (to Norris)
                         The fuse box.

               Norris double-times down the hall.

               MacReady turns the corner and into the rec room. He grabs 
               one of the thick card tables.

               MacReady returns with the table to the hallway.

                                     BLAIR
                         ...Can't you see...? If one cell of 
                         this Thing got out it could imitate 
                         every living thing on Earth. Nothing 
                         could stop it! Nothing!

                                     MACREADY
                              (humoring)
                         Look Blair, maybe you're right about 
                         this. But we've got to be rational. 
                         We've got to talk this over. I'm 
                         unarmed and I'm coming in.

                                     BLAIR
                         No, you're not! I don't trust any of 
                         you!

               NORRIS

               reaches the fuse box. He opens it.

               HALLWAY

               MacReady readies the table like a shield.

                                     MACREADY
                         If you're right we've all got to 
                         stick together.

               The lights go out. MacReady charges into the black room.

               Blair fires. MacReady barrels into him, knocking him to the 
               ground. He pummels him with a right hand and manages to 
               control the gun.

               The others dive in and pile on.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COMPOUND

               Heavily-clothed, MacReady, Fuchs and Dr. Copper help a dazed 
               Blair to a toolshed some seventy-five yards from the main 
               compound.

               INT. TOOLSHED

               More spacious than MacReady's. Very livable. Two windows. 
               Blair has been placed on the cot. Dr. Copper injects him 
               with a sedative.

                                     BLAIR
                         Why am I here?

                                     DR. COPPER
                         It's for your own protection, Blair.

                                     MACREADY
                         And mainly ours.

               EXT. SHACK

               Fuchs and MacReady nail boards over the windows.

                                     MACREADY
                         Leave a bit of an opening so he can 
                         see out.

               Blair's droopy-eyed, heavily drugged features loom up at 
               MacReady through the window.

                                     MACREADY
                         How you doin', old boy?

                                     BLAIR
                              (softly)
                         I don't know who to trust.

                                     MACREADY
                              (humoring)
                         Know what you mean, Blair. Trust is 
                         a tough thing to come by these days. 
                         Just trust in the Lord.

                                     BLAIR
                              (beat)
                         Watch Clark.

                                     MACREADY
                         What?

                                     BLAIR
                         Watch him close. Ask him why he didn't 
                         kennel the dog.

               Blair's face disappears from the window.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COMPOUND - DAY

               Harsh and grey. Getting very dark as winter takes a stronger 
               hold. Bennings is dumping the trash in a large hole in the 
               snow which acts as the trash dump.

               Bennings finishes and drags the empty bins past Palmer and 
               Childs, who are fixing the wounded choppers.

               INT. RADIO ROOM

               The radio looks a mess. Norris and Sanchez, a bandage wrapped 
               around his head, examines the damage. He is in pain and still 
               looks a little groggy.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         I'll see what I can do. But they 
                         didn't teach me much about fixing 
                         these things.

               Norris smiles and pats him comfortingly.

                                     NORRIS
                         They didn't teach you much about 
                         working them either.

               INT. MESS HALL - MORNING

               CLOSE ON A BUFFET OF EGGS, BACON, TOAST, ETC.

               Pull back. The men help themselves. It is a cramped, elongated 
               room.

               Dr. Copper approaches Nauls and hands him a capsule.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Put this in Blair's juice before you 
                         take him his tray.

               Clark comes running into the room, pallid, out of breath.  
               The men turn to look.

                                     CLARK
                         The dogs...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE KENNEL

               Empty. Clark and Garry examine the latch of the kennel door.

                                     GARRY
                         Doesn't look broken.

                                     CLARK
                         No. Door was wide open. I know I 
                         latched it.

               EXT. COMPOUND ABOVE THE UNDERGROUND KENNEL

               CLOSE ON THE DOGS' TRACKS in the snow. They lead from the 
               kennel's open stairwell and out onto the ice. All the men 
               have gathered.

                                     CLARK
                         All three of them took off.

               MacReady is writing down what appears to be a list on a pad.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         How long do you suppose they've been 
                         gone?

                                     CLARK
                         I haven't seen them since their last 
                         feeding. Could be as much as twenty-
                         four hours.

                                     MACREADY
                         They couldn't have gotten that far 
                         in this weather.

               Garry and several others turn to MacReady quizzically.

                                     GARRY
                         You're not thinking of going after 
                         them, are you?

                                     MACREADY
                         I am going after them.

                                     NORRIS
                         What in the hell for? Even if Blair's 
                         right -- they'll just die out there. 
                         No food. They're over a thousand 
                         miles from anything.

                                     PALMER
                         Chopper aren't going to be ready for 
                         days.

               MacReady hands his list to Bennings.

                                     MACREADY
                         Get these things out of supply and 
                         meet me over by the snowmobiles.

                                     GARRY
                         You're not going to catch them in 
                         one of those with the start they 
                         got.

                                     MACREADY
                         Palmer, how long would it take you 
                         to strap those big four-cylinder 
                         carburetors on?

                                     PALMER
                              (grins)
                         Oh, I got you. Not too long.

                                     MACREADY
                         Then get a move on. Childs, come 
                         with me.

               He puts his arm around Childs and pulls him along. The others 
               watch them walk off, a little bewildered.

                                     GARRY
                              (shouting after them)
                         Besides, what are you going to do 
                         when you catch up to them?

               Bennings is reading MacReady's list.

                                     BENNINGS
                         Holy shit.
                              (hands list to Garry)
                         Whatever he's going to do, he ain't 
                         fucking around.

               EXT. OUTDOOR WORK AREA - CLOSE ON THE BARREL

               of the large torch. A fierce stream of flame bursts from its 
               nozzle.

               Pull back. The stream has shot out some fifteen feet.

               Childs has been modifying it.

                                     CHILDS
                         I can get maybe another five or six 
                         feet out of it.

                                     MACREADY
                         That's good enough.

               CLOSE ON PALMER

               as he works on the snowmobiles. Into frame rolls a wheelbarrow 
               on sleds. A box marked DYNAMITE is its most prominent article. 
               Pull back. Bennings reads off the list of supplies.

                                     BENNINGS
                         All right... Box of dynamite... box 
                         of thermite... three shotguns... box 
                         of flares... two flare guns... thirty 
                         cans gasoline... and a case of 
                         alcohol.

                                     MACREADY
                         Let's load 'em.

               EXT. ANTARCTICA - ICESCAPE

               The two vehicles rip across the hard, flat ice, bolstered by 
               the added horsepower. They follow the still visible dog tracks 
               in the snow.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE SUN

               sliding across the horizon, signaling midday. The snowmobiles 
               whoosh past. Bennings drives the one loaded with supplies. 
               MacReady and Childs double up on the other.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MACREADY

               steadying his binoculars, while Childs drives, spots something 
               up ahead. The vehicles slow down and come to a halt. Something 
               lies just ahead of them in the whiteness, in the middle of 
               the dog tracks.

               THE MEN

               kneel down by the "something." It is the half-eaten remains 
               of a dog. Its hind legs and lower stomach picked clean. Its 
               ripped hide, flapping in the wind. Its top half missing.

                                     CHILDS
                         What is it?

               MacReady follows the line of continuing dog tracks.

                                     MACREADY
                         Maybe dinner.

                                     BENNINGS
                         Dogs don't eat each other.

                                     MACREADY
                              (beat)
                         I know.

                                     CHILDS
                         Where's the other half?

                                     MACREADY
                         Probably the next meal.

               MacReady moves to the snowmobile and grabs a two-gallon can 
               of gasoline. He turns to Bennings.

                                     MACREADY
                         Where these tracks headed?

                                     BENNINGS
                         Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.

               A beat as MacReady takes this in. He pours the gas over the 
               remains and sets it aflame.

                                     MACREADY
                         Let's move.

               Childs and Bennings are not that anxious to continue.

                                     CHILDS
                         They could be hours ahead of us, 
                         Mac.

                                     BENNINGS
                         Gonna get dark soon, too. Supposed 
                         to be fifty below tonight.

               MacReady gets on and revs up the engine.

                                     MACREADY
                         Turn back if you want.

               Childs and Bennings return shrugs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE SUN

               making its last pass, rolling off the horizon. Only a slight 
               orange hue left.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE SNOWMOBILES

               move slower, positioned on either side of the tracks. The 
               tracks abruptly change direction. The men come to a stop.

               It is much colder now. Their beards, a mask of white powder.

               MacReady surveys the new direction. They are headed toward a 
               far-off ridge of bluffs. Large, windswept mounds of ice.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE SNOWMOBILES

               as they move through a valley of newly-formed dunes and tall 
               ice cliffs. The last of the sun obscured, the headlamps are 
               turned on and pointed at the tracks.

               The men look behind, in front, and from side to side, as 
               they proceed cautiously through the maze. Up ahead MacReady 
               spots:

               A DOG

               It sits, its back to them, unconcerned, heedless of their 
               arrival. It is munching on the other half of the dog carcass.

               The men stop their machines some twenty yards from it. They 
               are hemmed in at the valley's narrowest point.

               Childs, carrying the torch, and MacReady, armed with a 
               thermite bomb, wade awkwardly but carefully toward the animal 
               in their snowshoes. Bennings stands back by the snowmobiles.

               Childs and MacReady spread out some dozen feet from the dog. 
               It continues to pay them no mind, content to chew its food.

                                     CHILDS
                         Where's the other one?

               Bennings surveys the tops of the snow bluffs that encircle 
               them with his flashlight.

                                     MACREADY
                              (to dog)
                         Where's your buddy, boy? Huh?

               No response. MacReady searches the near vicinity with his 
               light. All three are growing uneasy.

                                     MACREADY
                         Let that thing fly, Childs. Don't 
                         let up until he's ash.

               Childs turns on the gas and lights the tip.

               Bennings is still watching the bluffs. Something from beneath 
               the snow reaches up and grabs his feet. He is ripped back 
               down through the hard snow in one incredibly powerful motion. 
               He screams, his head the only thing sticking out of the ice.

               Childs and MacReady turn, confused, unable to see anything 
               be Bennings' screaming head. They rush toward him.

               MacReady stumbles.

               The sound of a snapping, a crackling to MacReady's rear.

               He freezes; turns back to the dog. Its back is still to him; 
               its coat of hair sticking up like that of a porcupine. It 
               snarls; its face turns slowly toward him.

               Its skin splitting; its mouth ripping open wildly.

                                     MACREADY
                         Childs!!

               Childs stops, confused as to who to help first. He notices 
               the dog hunched and ready to spring. He steps back toward 
               MacReady. The dog/Thing leaps for MacReady; an incredible 
               jump of some twenty feet.

               Childs lets loose a blast, hitting the dog in midair; the 
               force of the spray knocking it back and tumbling to the ice 
               in flames.

               MacReady throws his thermite canister. It discharges and 
               engulfs the screeching animal in fire.

               BENNINGS

               howling in pain. The ice underneath him thrashes violently. 
               Childs and MacReady stand by helplessly, unable to see what 
               has him or what action to take. Childs moves closer to help.

                                     MACREADY
                              (pulls him back)
                         Stay back!!

               Bennings' head disappears with a sudden jerk through the 
               ice. The ice continues to rumble like boiling water, moving 
               in different directions. Part of Bennings' body pops up in a 
               different area and is just as quickly pulled back down.

               MacReady and Childs watch on in frustration and anger.

                                     CHILDS
                         What we going to do?!

                                     MACREADY
                         How the fuck do I know?!

               Bennings' head and shoulders then surface near one of the 
               snowmobiles. Something has him. Unclear as to what. The jowls 
               of a dog. But huge. Bennings' heavy clothing begins to rip, 
               tear, as if his skin underneath was bulging out. The jowls 
               seem to be absorbing his head.

               MacReady runs for the snowmobile.

                                     MACREADY
                         Torch them!!

                                     CHILDS
                         But...

                                     MACREADY
                         He's gone already! Do it!

               Childs blasts away. The ice begins to melt as Bennings and 
               whatever has him catch fire. A screeching.

               MacReady grabs cans of gas from the snowmobiles. Suddenly a 
               steel-like, arachnid-shaped arm shoots out in pain and with 
               incredible force pierces the fiberglass chassis of the 
               snowmobile. MacReady is knocked back. He recovers and dumps 
               cans of gasoline on the writhing mess.

               He dives and rolls away from the lunging appendage.

               He and Childs watch on as Bennings and The Thing roar in 
               flame. Behind them, the other dog/Thing continues to burn. 
               The screeching, mewing and gurgling wails on, all about them.

               They look to each other in disbelief, their faces illuminated 
               by the flickering flames. The strident sounds beginning to 
               subside.

               THE SUN

               Its slim, orange arc sets, signaling the start of the Vernal 
               Equinox. And the beginning of six months of darkness.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COMPOUND - REC ROOM

               The men are interrogating Clark. He is frazzled and defensive.

                                     CLARK
                         ...I'm telling you I don't remember 
                         leaving the kennel unlatched...

               Childs is holding the industrial torch directly in his face.

                                     CHILDS
                         Bullshit! You left it open so they 
                         could get out!

               EXT. TRASH DUMP

               MacReady, waist-deep in trash and snow, searches for 
               something.

               INT. REC ROOM

               The interrogation continues.

                                     CLARK
                         ...Would I even have told you they 
                         were gone if I had anything to hide?

                                     GARRY
                         But why didn't you kennel that dog 
                         right away?

                                     CLARK
                         I told you I couldn't find...
                              (pushes torch away)
                         ...get that out of my face.

               Childs grabs him by the collar and rips him off his chair.

                                     CHILDS
                         Don't you be telling me...

               Nauls steps between them.

                                     NAULS
                              (to Childs)
                         Lighten your load, sucker. You ain't 
                         the judge and executioner around 
                         here!

                                     CHILDS
                         Who you trying to protect, 
                         mutherfucker? I'm telling you this 
                         S.O.B. could be one of them.

               Garry breaks it up, pulling them apart. MacReady enters from 
               the outside. A bundle is tucked under his arm.

                                     GARRY
                         Hold on, damn it. We're getting 
                         nowhere... If this bit of Blair's 
                         about absorbing and imitating is 
                         true... then that dog could have 
                         gotten to anybody.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         And if it got to Clark... Clark could 
                         have gotten to anybody.

               MacReady moves over to the table.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Theoretically any of us could be 
                         whatever the hell this thing is.

               Norris shakes his head, rubbing his chest in slight 
               discomfort.

                                     NORRIS
                         It's just too damn wild -- I can't 
                         believe it.

               MacReady pushes his sombrero back over his head.

                                     MACREADY
                         Well, you can believe it now.

               He drops the bundle he had been holding on the table between 
               the men. It is the shredded pair of long johns.

                                     MACREADY
                         Nauls found this yesterday. It's 
                         ripped just like the clothing on the 
                         Norwegian we brought back. The same 
                         thing was happening to Bennings' 
                         clothes when it got to him. Seems 
                         these Things don't imitate clothes. 
                         Just flesh and bone.

               The men look from one another. Silence. MacReady picks it up 
               and examines the label.

                                     MACREADY
                         Size large.
                              (grins)
                         What do you wear, Clark?

               Clark stews.

                                     CLARK
                         So what?

                                     NORRIS
                         I wear a size large, too.

                                     MACREADY
                         So do I. So do most of us.

               The uneasiness in the room grows.

                                     MACREADY
                         Doubt if it got to more than one or 
                         two of us. But it got to someone.
                              (beat)
                         Somebody in this room ain't what he 
                         appears to be.

               A pause as all eyes travel from man to man.

                                     SANCHEZ
                              (scared)
                         Well, what we going to do?

               Norris turns to Dr. Copper and Fuchs.

                                     NORRIS
                         Can there be... some kind of test? 
                         To find out who's what?

                                     DR. COPPER
                         A serum test possibly.

                                     FUCHS
                         Right. Why not?

                                     GARRY
                         What's that?

                                     DR. COPPER
                         It's a simple blood typing test. 
                         This Thing's blood chemistry is 
                         different than ours. Basically we 
                         mix someone's blood with 
                         uncontaminated human blood. If we 
                         don't get the proper serum reaction -- 
                         then that person isn't human.

                                     CHILDS
                         Whose uncontaminated blood we going 
                         to use?

                                     DR. COPPER
                         We've got blood plasma in storage.

                                     GARRY
                         How long will it take you to prepare 
                         this?

                                     DR. COPPER
                         A couple of hours.

                                     GARRY
                         Well, get to it.

               Garry unhinges a key from his belt and hands it to Dr.  
               Copper. Dr. Copper and Fuchs head for the infirmary.

                                     PALMER
                         How's that Thing get to the dogs? I 
                         though we stopped it in time.

                                     MACREADY
                         Copper thinks they swallowed pieces 
                         of it during the fight.

                                     PALMER
                         And that was enough?

                                     DR. COPPER (O.S.)
                         Garry. The rest of you! Come here!

               INT. INFIRMARY

               The men rush in. Fuchs and Copper stand by the open plasma 
               storage refrigerator. The inside is a mess of dried blood. 
               The bladders have been ripped open. Copper is ghastly pale.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Somebody got to the blood... sabotaged 
                         it.

                                     NAULS
                         Oh, my God.

               A horrified silence.

                                     MACREADY
                         Was it broken into?

                                     FUCHS
                         No. Somebody opened it. Closed it. 
                         And then locked it.

               Sanchez twitches, terrified.

                                     MACREADY
                         Well, who's got access to it?

                                     DR. COPPER
                         I guess I'm the only one.

                                     GARRY
                         And I've got the only key.

               Several pairs of eyes turn to Garry.

                                     MACREADY
                         Would that test have worked?

                                     DR. COPPER
                         I think so.

                                     NORRIS
                         Somebody else sure as hell thought 
                         so.

                                     MACREADY
                         Who else could have used that key?

                                     GARRY
                         Ah... no one... I give it to Copper 
                         when he needs it...

                                     MACREADY
                         Could anyone have gotten it from 
                         you?

                                     DR. COPPER
                         I don't see how... when I'm finished 
                         I return it right away.

                                     NORRIS
                         When was the last time you used it?

                                     DR. COPPER
                              (uneasy)
                         A day or so ago... I guess.

               Garry senses the nervous and inquiring eyes on him.

                                     GARRY
                         I suppose... well, it's possible 
                         someone might have lifted it from 
                         me. But...

                                     CHILDS
                         That key ring of yours is always 
                         hooked to your belt. Now how could 
                         somebody get to it without you 
                         knowing?

                                     GARRY
                              (upset, flustered)
                         Look, I haven't been near that... 
                         that refrigerator.

               Silence as the men continue to stare. Sanchez is perspiring.

                                     GARRY
                         Copper's the only one who has any 
                         business with it.

               The eyes shift from Garry to Copper.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Now... wait a second, Garry, you've 
                         been in here on several occasions...

                                     FUCHS
                         And the Doc thought of the test.

                                     CHILDS
                              (anger)
                         So what?! Is that supposed to leave 
                         him in the clear?! Bullshit!

               Sanchez bolts out the door. Stunned for a beat, the others 
               chase after him.

                                     GARRY
                         Hey, Sanchez!

               SANCHEZ

               in terror, runs at top speed through the narrow corridors.

               Opening and shutting doors. The others are in pursuit.

               They shout for him to stop.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SANCHEZ

               as he reaches a small armory. A glass case set into the wall. 
               A half dozen rarely used guns are inside. He tries the handle. 
               Locked.

               He hears the clamor of feet and voices as the others are 
               nearing. He breaks the glass and grabs a shotgun. Then a box 
               of shells. He frantically tries to load, but is too nervous.

               The others arrive at the end of the hallway. Garry pulls his 
               handgun and points.

                                     GARRY
                         Put that down!

                                     SANCHEZ
                              (trembling)
                         No.

                                     GARRY
                         I'll put this right through your 
                         head.

               No one doubts Garry's sincerity.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         You guys going to let him give orders? 
                         I mean he could be one of those 
                         Things.

               The other regard Garry tensely. No one oblivious to the fact, 
               that Sanchez just might be right.

                                     MACREADY
                              (calm)
                         Put it away, Sanchez. Just put it 
                         away.

               Still trembling, he tosses the shells back into the broken 
               case, leans the gun against the wall and begins to sob.

               Nauls skates over to comfort him.

               The men watch as Garry lowers his gun. He turns to them.

                                     GARRY
                         I don't know about Copper. But I 
                         didn't go near that plasma...
                              (beat)
                         But I guess you'll all rest easier 
                         if someone else is in charge.

               He hands his gun to Norris.

                                     GARRY
                         Can't see anyone objecting to you, 
                         Norris.

                                     NORRIS
                         Sorry, gentlemen...
                              (rubs chest)
                         ...Don't think I'd be up to it. 
                         Haven't been feeling well lately.

               Childs goes for the gun.

                                     CHILDS
                         I'll take it...

               MacReady beats him to it.

                                     MACREADY
                         Maybe it should be someone a bit 
                         more even-tempered, Childs.

               Childs glares.

                                     MACREADY
                              (to others)
                         ...Any objections?

               Roving eyes pass about the hallway. Nobody is sure who to 
               trust. MacReady seems as good as any.

               INT. REC ROOM

               The men have gathered to discuss plans. Furtive and 
               untrustworthy glances are passed around the room.

                                     MACREADY
                         ...From what we know this Thing likes 
                         to go one on one. So we stick together 
                         as much as possible. In two's and 
                         three's.

               Childs points to Garry, Dr. Copper and Clark.

                                     CHILDS
                         What do we do about those three?

                                     MACREADY
                         We got morphine, don't we.

               Fuchs nods.

                                     MACREADY
                         Well, we keep them loaded. Stash 
                         them here in the rec room and watch 
                         'em twenty-four hours.

                              (ears perk up)
                         Morphine? You know I was pretty close 
                         to that dog, too.

               Palmer is ignored.

                                     NORRIS
                         We should sleep in shifts.

                                     MACREADY
                         Right. Half of us awake at all times.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         How we going to try and find out 
                         who's... you know, who's who?

                                     MACREADY
                              (to Fuchs)
                         Can you think of any other tests?

                                     FUCHS
                         I'll try.  I could sure use Copper's 
                         help though.

                                     CHILDS
                         You can eighty-six that thought right 
                         now, man.

               Dr. Copper eyes his accuser solemnly.

                                     MACREADY
                         Also... When this Thing turns... it 
                         turns slowly at first. I think we 
                         can handle it in that state. But if 
                         it ever got to full power... from 
                         what I saw of that Norwegian camp... 
                         well, I just don't know... It would 
                         probably take it an hour or more to 
                         get like that. So no matter what 
                         anybody's doing, we all return to 
                         this room every twenty minutes. 
                         Anybody gone longer than that... 
                         anybody trying to leave... we kill 
                         'em.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COMPOUND - DARKNESS

               It is the dead of winter. Six months of darkness ahead. Palmer 
               fights the cold as he works dismantling the engine of the 
               helicopter.

               He frowns, searching for something.

                                     PALMER
                              (mumbles)
                         Where's that magneto? Can't find a 
                         darn thing around here any more.

               INT. REC ROOM

               Copper, Clark and Garry sit moodily together on a couch.

               Norris awkwardly prepares to give them their injections.

               He is new at this. Childs stands guard with his torch.

               Dr. Copper offers to help.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         I'll do it. You're going to break 
                         the needle in my arm.

                                     CHILDS
                         No, Doc. He's doing a real fine job.

               EXT. COMPOUND

               MacReady and Sanchez are foraging through the trash dump.

                                     MACREADY
                         Look for shoes, too. And burned cloth.

               INT. RADIO ROOM

               Norris has begun dismantling the radio. He rubs at his chest 
               as he disengages the headset.

               INT. HALLWAY

               Following Nauls as he skates through the labyrinth.

               Checking waste bins. Pausing to look behind shelves and any 
               obscure hiding place.

               MacReady passes him coming the other way.

                                     NAULS
                         That thing's too smart to be hiding 
                         any more of its clothes, MacReady.

                                     MACREADY
                         Just keep looking.

               INT. LAB

               Fuchs is poring over a book. Several others lie open on his 
               desk.

               MacReady pokes his head in the lab.

                                     MACREADY
                         How's it going?

                                     FUCHS
                         Nothing yet. But, MacReady, I've 
                         been thinking... If our dogs changed 
                         by swallowing parts of that other 
                         one... We better see to it that 
                         everyone prepares their own food and 
                         we eat out of cans.

                                     MACREADY
                         Gotchya.

               EXT. COMPOUND

               A siren goes off, signaling the end of a twenty-minute period. 
               Sanchez pulls himself out of the trash dump.

               Palmer carries a large part of a helicopter engine toward 
               the compound.

               INT. COMPOUND

               The hallway near the supply storage cubicle. MacReady holds 
               the door open as Palmer makes his way to him lugging the 
               heavy helicopter part.

               Childs passes by from the other direction.

                                     PALMER
                         Childs, where's that magneto from 
                         Chopper One?

                                     CHILDS
                         Ain't it there?

               He passes by.

                                     PALMER
                         No it ain't there. Would I be asking 
                         if it were there?

                                     MACREADY
                         Move it, Palmer.

               INT. SUPPLY STORAGE ROOM

               Palmer sets down the heavy part. Norris follows him inside 
               with a bundle of radio gear. They move back out into the 
               hallway. MacReady locks the door behind them.

               HALLWAY

               The three move down the hall toward their appointed rendezvous 
               at the rec room.

                                     MACREADY
                              (to Palmer)
                         Start taking apart those snowmobiles 
                         next, huh?

               INT. KITCHEN

               Cramped. Several of the men are preparing their food.

               Opening cans. Heating them in pots.

               EXT. COMPOUND

               Nauls wearily approaches Blair's tool shed with a tray of 
               food. He hears a pounding from within.

                                     NAULS
                         I got your goodies, superdude.

               He peeks in through the opening in the boarded-up window.

               Blair is nailing himself in from the inside. He looks pretty 
               crazed.

                                     NAULS
                         What you doin'?

                                     BLAIR
                         Nobody's getting in here. You can 
                         tell them all that!

                                     NAULS
                         Well, who the hell you think wants 
                         to get in there with you?

               Nauls slides the tray in the slot. It is immediately shoved 
               back out and topples onto the ice. Some of the food has 
               splashed on Nauls' heavy coat.

                                     NAULS
                         Now why'd you go and...

                                     BLAIR
                         And I don't want any more food with 
                         sedatives in it. I know what you're 
                         up to. Don't think I don't. And if 
                         anyone tries to get in here -- I've 
                         got rope. I'll hang myself before it 
                         gets to me.

                                     NAULS
                         You promise?

               Nauls picks up the tray, heads back mumbling.

                                     NAULS
                         Crazy white scientist motherfucker...

               EXT. COMPOUND

               Palmer works on the snowmobile. Sanchez resumes searching 
               through the trash.

               INT. BALLOON TOWER

               MacReady slashes into the huge uninflated weather balloons, 
               rendering them useless. Tanks of helium and hydrogen are 
               stacked nearby.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Nauls does the dishes. His cassette plays in the b.g.

               INT. REC ROOM

               Childs continues guarding the three men.

                                     CLARK
                         Gotta go to the can, Childs.

               Childs follows him to the other end of the room.

                                     CHILDS
                         Be quick.

               Clark walks to the head. Childs moves back to the middle of 
               the room. As the guard he is much more vulnerable in this 
               position. Being split between his prisoners.

               The lights begin to flicker. The soft purr of the generator 
               begins to fade.

                                     CHILDS
                         Oh, no.

               The lights go out. Nauls calls from the kitchen.

                                     NAULS (O.S.)
                         Childs! That a fuse?

                                     CHILDS
                         No. The generator. You got the 
                         auxiliary box just off the kitchen. 
                         Get to it.
                              (fumbling around)
                         Where's the damn flashlight?
                              (calling out)
                         You fellas okay over there?

               Dr. Copper giggles in the dark.

                                     CHILDS
                         Cut that out, Copper.
                              (beat)
                         Nauls? What's taking you?!

                                     NAULS (O.S.)
                         I'm working it! Nothing's happening!

                                     CHILDS
                         That's impossible, man! Okay, Clark, 
                         out of the john where I can see you!

                                     NAULS (O.S.)
                         It's shorted out or something!

                                     CHILDS
                              (shouting)
                         Clark, you come on out here!!

               Childs lights the tip of his torch, allowing him a strong 
               candlelight. Garry is no longer in the room.

                                     CHILDS
                         Where's... Where's Garry?

               Dr. Copper looks numbly at the empty seat next to him. Childs 
               finds the portable siren and blares it.

               EXT. COMPOUND

               MacReady, Palmer and Sanchez heed the call and head for the 
               compound.

               INT. REC ROOM

               Childs jerks his head around in different directions.

                                     CHILDS
                         Where are you, Garry? Don't you move 
                         an inch, Copper.
                              (shouts)
                         Nauls, bring me a goddamn flashlight!

               INT. KITCHEN

               Pitch black.

                                     NAULS
                         Somebody's taken it. I can't find 
                         it!

                                     CHILDS (O.S.)
                         Clark, you want me to come in after 
                         you?!

               INT. HALLWAY

               MacReady, Sanchez and Palmer come in from the outside.

               They bump into each other trying to get their bearings from 
               the lack of light. Palmer, the only one who seems to have 
               one, turns on his flashlight.

                                     MACREADY
                              (shouting)

                                     NORRIS (O.S.)
                         MacReady, that you?

                                     MACREADY
                         Yeah!

                                     NORRIS (O.S.)
                         It's the generator I think! No power.

                              (to Palmer)

                         What?

                                     CHILDS (O.S.)
                         Garry's missing!

                              (shouts)
                         Well, hang on!

                                     CHILDS (O.S.)
                         Gee, thanks!

               INT. GENERATOR ROOM

               Palmer and MacReady stumbling down the stairs. MacReady turns 
               around, looks.

                                     MACREADY
                         Where's Sanchez?

               Both look around. Sanchez is gone. Palmer's light finds the 
               motionless generator. He examines it.

                                     PALMER
                         The fuel pump... it's gone...
                              (frantic)
                         You've got to get up to supply, Mca. 
                         If we don't get this thing started 
                         soon, it'll freeze on us and we'll 
                         never get it going.

               MacReady dashes upstairs into the darkness.

               INT. HALLWAY

               The lab door is opened. Fuchs holding a small candle walks 
               out. As he passes, the shoulder of a man springs into frame.

               INT. GENERATOR ROOM

               Palmer is feverishly working underneath the generator on his 
               back.

               INT. REC ROOM

               The temperature continues to drop rapidly. Childs swats 
               himself to keep warm, while still keeping an eye on Dr. Copper 
               and the rest of the room.

               INT. HALLWAY

               MacReady rushes out of the supply room, with a fuel pump, 
               bumps into somebody.

                                     MACREADY
                         Who... Who is that?

               The silhouette moves on down the hallway.

                                     MACREADY
                         Sanchez...?  Hey, who...

                                     PALMER (O.S.)
                         Mac, where the hell is that pump!!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GENERATOR ROOM

               MacReady holds the flashlight for Palmer. Their breath, puffs 
               of white smoke.

                                     PALMER
                         Somebody definitely messed with it.

                                     MACREADY
                         We going to make it?

                                     PALMER
                         Hope so. Another ten, fifteen minutes. 
                         What I don't get is...

               The sound of a screeching. From somewhere in the compound. 
               The two men's faces, locked in fear.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. REC ROOM

               The generator has been repaired; the lights within the 
               compound are back on.

               Grim and tense. Everyone is present but Fuchs. Eyes flit 
               from man to man. Palmer, Nauls and Sanchez are spread out 
               about the room, keeping as much distance as possible from 
               the rest.

               Norris and Childs are tying the Doctor, Clark and Garry to 
               the couch. MacReady prepares several makeshift blowtorches 
               as he kneels on the ground.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         Where were the flashlights?

                                     MACREADY
                         Screw the flashlights. Where the 
                         hell were you?

                                     PALMER
                         Tons of stuff's been missing around 
                         here. Magnetos, cables, wire...

                                     NAULS
                         Kitchen things, too...

                                     MACREADY
                         Anybody see Fuchs... or hear him...? 
                         Huh?

               No answer as the men's faces roam the room. Childs glares at 
               Garry as he begins to tie him in.

                                     CHILDS
                         Where'd you go?

               Garry's groggy features stare blankly.

                                     CHILDS
                         I said where? Where'd you go?!

                                     GARRY
                         Was dark... find a light...

                                     CHILDS
                         You lying bastard...

               Garry struggles to his feet, affronted.

                                     GARRY
                              (slurring)
                         I rather don't like your tone...

               He grabs Childs by the collar.

                                     CHILDS
                         You sit back down...

               Childs whales on him with a right hand. Both go tumbling 
               over the couch. MacReady and Norris dive in breaking it up.

                                     NORRIS
                         Enough...

               MacReady, furious, pulls Childs away.

               Norris breathing heavily from the activity, massages his 
               chest. The strong, stormy winds overhead batter the roofing. 
               MacReady glances up. He and Childs release each other.

                                     MACREADY
                         That storm's going to start ripping 
                         any minute -- so we don't have much 
                         time.

               He thrusts one of the blowtorches hard into Childs' stomach.

                                     MACREADY
                         We've got to find Fuchs. When we 
                         find him -- we kill him.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         Why?

                                     MACREADY
                         If he's one of those Things, we've 
                         got to get to him before he changes... 
                         Nauls, you and Childs and I'll check 
                         the outside shacks...

               He tosses torches to Sanchez and Palmer.

                                     MACREADY
                         Sanchez, you and Palmer search the 
                         inside...

                                     PALMER
                         I ain't going with Sanchez.

               Sanchez snaps his head toward Palmer. Palmer looks at the 
               others.

                                     PALMER
                         I ain't going with him. I'll go with 
                         Childs...

                                     SANCHEZ
                         Well, screw you, man!

                                     PALMER
                         I ain't going with you!

                                     CHILDS
                         Well, who says I want you going with 
                         me?!

                                     MACREADY
                         Cut the bullshit... Okay, Sanchez, 
                         you come with us. Norris... you stay 
                         here...
                              (refers to tied-up 
                              men)
                         Any of them move -- you fry 'em. And 
                         if you hear anything, anything at 
                         all you let loose the siren. We all 
                         meet back here in twenty minutes 
                         regardless.
                              (a beat)
                         And everybody watch whoever you're 
                         with. Real close.

               The men survey each other.

                                     MACREADY
                         Let's move.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COMPOUND - NIGHT

               MacReady and Nauls, wearing their snowshoes and using flares 
               for light, pull themselves along the steadying rope that 
               leads to Blair's shed. They are careful to keep an eye on 
               each other as they move along.

               Sanchez heads off in the direction of another shack.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COMPOUND - HALLWAY

               One of the many doors creak open. Childs and Palmer stealthily 
               move into the next corridor. Palmer falls a few steps behind.

                                     PALMER
                         What'd we ever do to these Things 
                         anyway...

               Childs freezes and snaps his head around facing Palmer. A 
               beat.

                                     PALMER
                         What?

                                     CHILDS
                         Don't walk behind me.

               Another beat.

                                     PALMER
                         Right.

               He moves to the other side of the wall, parallel with Childs. 
               They continue on, skimming along the sides of the corridor 
               in plain view of one another.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COMPOUND

               Nauls and MacReady arrive at Blair's shack. They peer in 
               through the spaces between the boards.

               A weak light burns as Blair is seated eating out of a can. A 
               hangman's noose dangles from the ceiling nearby.

                                     MACREADY
                         Hey, Blair!!

               Blair jumps in fear, spilling his can.

                                     MACREADY
                         Has Fuchs been out here?

               Blair approaches the boarded-up window. He looks haggard and 
               afraid.

                                     BLAIR
                         I've changed my mind... I'd... I'd 
                         like to come back inside... I don't 
                         want to stay out here any more...  
                         Funny things... I hear funny things 
                         out here.

                                     MACREADY
                         Have you come across Fuchs?

                                     BLAIR
                         Fuchs...? No, it's not Fuchs... You 
                         must let me back in... I won't harm 
                         anyone... I promise...

                                     MACREADY
                         We'll see...

               He and Nauls trudges off. Blair shouts after them.

                                     BLAIR
                         I promise! I'm much better now! I'll 
                         be good!! I'm all better!! Don't 
                         leave me here!!

               INT. REC ROOM

               Norris continues his watch on the sedated trio. He anxiously 
               tries to keep an eye on the various entrances behind and in 
               front of him. He rubs his chest in pain.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         I'm getting worried about you. You 
                         ought to have a checkup.

                                     NORRIS
                         Let's just not get worried about 
                         anything just now.

                                     DR. COPPER
                              (yawning)
                         After all this mess then.

                                     NORRIS
                              (nodding)
                         After all this mess.

               EXT. COMPOUND - THE SLOPE TO MACREADY'S SHACK

               The winds are thick and vicious now. MacReady and Nauls pull 
               themselves along the rope fighting their way up the slope. A 
               violent gust sends MacReady's body horizontal, but still 
               hanging onto the rope. The wind slaps him back down. His 
               flare and torch tumble back toward Nauls.

               Nauls saves the torch from rolling down the hill.

               MacReady, lying vulnerable, watches Nauls pull his way toward 
               him. He tenses. Nauls reaches him. A beat. He hands back his 
               torch. Relieved, MacReady pulls himself upright.

               INT. COMPOUND - KITCHEN - CLOSE ON THICK POWER CABLES

               that line the wall. They have been torn apart. Childs and 
               Palmer examine.

                                     PALMER
                         Auxiliary light cables...? Been cut.

                                     CHILDS
                         Cut, bullshit. Been pulled apart.

               EXT. MACREADY'S SHACK

               as they reach the top. The remaining flare their only light. 
               Very dark. They stand on either side of the door. MacReady 
               shoves it open. Pitch black inside. MacReady flips the light 
               switch. Doesn't work.

               INT. SHACK

               They enter. Hunched. Torches ready. The place is a mess. The 
               winds as strong as on the outside.

               The single flare illuminating the ceiling. Almost all of the 
               corrugated, steel roofing is gone. As if ripped off.

                                     NAULS
                              (shouting to be heard)
                         Where's the roof?!

               MacReady stares up incredulous, as they advance through the 
               room.

                                     NAULS
                         This storm do that?

                                     MACREADY
                              (shouting)
                         Couldn't be possible. Must have 
                         weighted a ton and a half...

               Nauls kicks over a chair. A naked, fleshy object bounds high 
               into the air. Nauls thrusts out his torch, catching the 
               breasts of the inflatable woman. She pops and is sucked out 
               through the hole in the roof.

               Nauls tries to catch his breath.

                                     NAULS
                         Goddamn white women.

               INT. COMPOUND

               Underground, rickety corridor. Palmer stands by as Childs 
               undoes the many locks to the room that houses his plants.

               One by one. Palmer twists his head in every which direction. 
               Nervous.

               Childs pulls open the heavy door. A flush of snow and wind 
               push them back. They wedge their bodies at the entrance to 
               the lightless room.

                                     CHILDS
                         My babies.

               They enter. The light from the hall exposes the completely 
               smashed-in window high above the plants. The plants look 
               frozen.

                                     PALMER
                         Somebody broke in.

                                     CHILDS
                         Now who'd go and do...

               Saddened, angry, Childs goes to check the damage to his 
               plants. Palmer, his face set in horror, yanks him back.

                                     PALMER
                         Childs!!

                                     CHILDS
                         Let go of me...

                                     PALMER
                         Don't get near 'em. The plants! 
                         They're alive. Those things can 
                         imitate anything...

                                     CHILDS
                         What's it going to do, being a plant?

               Palmer readies his small torch.

                                     PALMER
                         We got to burn 'em.

                                     CHILDS
                         Now hold on, you dumb...

               Palmer sprays them with flame. Childs pushes him to the 
               ground, and tries to swat out the fire.

                                     CHILDS
                         You stupid, sonofa...

               Palmer, his mouth agape with terror, screams and points to 
               the closing door to their rear. Childs whirls.

               FUCHS

               One arm outstretched, swings into view. An ax, embedded deep 
               into his chest, pins his frozen body to the inside of the 
               door.

               INT. REC ROOM

               Norris startled by the scream, turns on the siren.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PLANT ROOM

               Sanchez has joined Childs and Palmer. The body of Fuchs is 
               still pinned to the door. Sanchez tries to wrench the ax 
               loose. It is too deeply embedded and won't budge.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         Whoever put this through him...

               Sanchez observes Childs' hulking frame and adds pointedly:

                                     SANCHEZ
                         ...is one bad-ass and strong muther.

                                     CHILDS
                         No one's that strong, boy!

               INT. PASSAGEWAY

               Tracking with the three men. Opening and closing doors, as 
               they make their way back to the rec room. They keep their 
               distance from each other, watching each other while they 
               walk.

                                     PALMER
                         Why didn't it imitate Fuchs? Isn't 
                         that its number -- to get more 
                         recruits.

                                     CHILDS
                         Wasn't enough time. Generator was 
                         out, what...? Thirty minutes. Takes 
                         the bastards an hour, maybe two to 
                         absorb somebody.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         Why Fuchs?

                                     CHILDS
                         He was working on a test. Fuchs must 
                         have been onto something. These 
                         bastards got scared and got rid of 
                         him.
                              (suddenly realizing)
                         ...Hey... Where's...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COMPOUND - CLOSE ON PALMER'S FACE

               shouting down a passageway.

                                     PALMER
                         MacReady!!

               CLOSE ON CHILDS

               bellowing.

                                     CHILDS
                         Nauls!! MacReady!!

               EXT. COMPOUND

               A strong driftwind streams snow across the ground obscuring 
               everything but the very top of the buildings.

               The siren screams.

               INT. REC ROOM

               Rigid, immobile faces. Listening to the storm overhead.

                                     CHILDS
                         How long they been out now?

                                     NORRIS
                         Forty... Forty-five minutes.

               Silence, as the uneasy eyes measure one another.

                                     CHILDS
                         We better start closing off the 
                         outside hatchways.

               VARIOUS ANGLES OF THE COMPOUND

               Childs, Sanchez and Palmer -- closing off and bolting the 
               entrances to the camp.

                                     NORRIS (O.S.)
                         All of you! Come here!

               INT. COMPOUND MAIN HALLWAY - POINT OF VIEW - THE MEN

               Through the fogged-up windows, a figure can be seen 
               approaching the main compound. It pulls and drags its way 
               along the guide rope, fighting the gale force winds.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MEN

               weapons in hand, huddle at the main doorway. They unbolt it. 
               Sleet and hail send Nauls rolling in from the outside. The 
               men force the door back and lock it.

               The weary Nauls kneels on the floor and gasps for air.

               The others surround him.

                                     PALMER
                         Where's MacReady?

               Nauls weighs each of them ominously, while digging down 
               underneath his heavy jacket.

                                     NAULS
                         Cut him loose of the line up by his 
                         shack.

                                     CHILDS
                         Cut him loose?

                                     NAULS
                         When we were up poking around his 
                         place... I found this...

               He pulls out a thick bundle of heavy clothing. It is mutilated 
               and partially burned. He holds out the jacket to show the 
               inside collar.

               Close on name tag -- it reads: R.J. MACREADY The men, as 
               they examine in a hush.

                                     NAULS
                         ...It was stashed in his old coal 
                         furnace... wind must have dislodged 
                         it... I don't think he saw me find 
                         it.

               The men continue to examine in various states of disbelief.

                                     NAULS
                         ...Made sure I got ahead of him on 
                         the towline on the way back... cut 
                         him loose.

                                     SANCHEZ
                              (incredulous)
                         MacReady...?

                                     NAULS
                         He's one of them.

                                     SANCHEZ
                              (scared)
                         When do you think it got to him?

                                     PALMER
                         Could have been anytime. Anywhere.

                                     CHILDS
                              (to Nauls, suspicious)
                         If it did get to him.

                                     NAULS
                         Look, man...

                                     PALMER
                         When the lights went out...

                                     NORRIS
                         Would have been a perfect time...

                                     PALMER
                         Right. Garry was missing...
                              (pointedly)
                         ...And Sanchez...

                                     SANCHEZ
                              (goes for him)
                         Fuck you, Palmer.

               Childs and Norris separate them.

                                     NORRIS
                         This is just what it wants... to pit 
                         us against each other.

               A pounding at the door sends the men jerking backward.

               Nauls scampers to his feet. They tense.

                                     MACREADY (O.S.)
                         Open up!

               No answer as the men surround the door, their weapons ready.  
               Fear.

                                     MACREADY (O.S.)
                         ...Hey, somebody! Open up, it's me, 
                         MacReady...
                              (still nothing)
                         ...Come on, damn it... The towline 
                         snapped. Been crawling around like a 
                         seal out here...

                                     NAULS
                              (harsh whisper)
                         Bullshit! He's got to know damn well 
                         I cut it!

               The men keep their voices low.

                                     PALMER
                         Let's open it.

                                     CHILDS
                         Hell no.

               More pounding.

                                     SANCHEZ
                              (shaking)
                         You think he's changed into one of 
                         those Things?

                                     NORRIS
                         He hasn't had enough time.

                                     CHILDS
                         ...Nothing human could have made it 
                         back here in this weather without a

                                     MACREADY (O.S.)
                         ...Where is everybody?! I'm half 
                         frostbit!

                                     PALMER
                         Let's open it. Now...

                                     CHILDS
                              (edgy, hostile)
                         Why you so damn anxious to let him 
                         in here...

                                     PALMER
                              (slightly trembling)
                         He's so close. Maybe our best chance 
                         to blow him away.

                                     CHILDS
                         No. Just let him freeze out there.

                                     SANCHEZ
                              (voice cracking)
                         What if we're wrong about him?

                                     CHILDS
                         Then we're wrong.

               The muffled breaking of a window down the hall. The men turn.

                                     PALMER
                         The supply window!

                                     SANCHEZ
                              (terror)
                         What we going to...

                                     NORRIS
                         All right... all right... we've got 
                         no choice now...

               INT. SUPPLY ROOM

               Pitch black. MacReady's voice is heard cursing as he appears 
               to be stumbling around, looking for a light switch. He 
               responds to the muffled voices at the door.

                                     MACREADY
                         What's going on out there?

               HALLWAY

               Palmer stands by as Childs tries the knob. Locked.

                                     CHILDS
                         Damn it, he's got the keys.

               Childs rips a nearby fire ax off the wall and begins hacking 
               away at the door.

               INT. SUPPLY ROOM

                                     MACREADY
                         What are you doing?

                                     CHILDS (O.S.)
                         You're a dead man, MacReady -- or a 
                         dead whatever the hell you are!

               MacReady begins to rummage through the supplies in the 
               darkness.

                                     CHILDS (O.S.)
                         We found your clothes -- the ones 
                         you tried to burn.

                                     MACREADY
                         What clothes?

                                     CHILDS (O.S.)
                         You been made, MacReady.

               Childs chops away. MacReady desperately continues rummaging 
               through the supplies.

                                     MACREADY
                         Someone's trying to mark me, you 
                         bastard... trying to frame me.

               HALLWAY

               Childs cautions to Palmer as he prepares for one last blow.

                                     CHILDS
                         Move in slow now.

               Crunch. The door gives. The men move in. Their blow torches 
               ready. They freeze.

               MacReady stands before them holding a lighted flare. His 
               hair and clothing are covered with snow; his cheeks and nose 
               blackened by frostbite. Tucked under his arm is an entire 
               box of dynamite. He holds the flare dangerously close to the 
               open box.

                                     MACREADY
                         Anyone messes with me -- the whole 
                         camp goes.

               He appears to mean it. They don't seem anxious to test him.

                                     MACREADY
                         Put those torches on the floor and 
                         back off.

               They do. He follows them out into the hall.

               HALLWAY

               The men step backwards carefully.

                                     MACREADY
                         ...back way off.

               They heed, retreating further down the hall. MacReady glances 
               behind him.

                                     MACREADY
                         ...Where's the rest...

               Nauls and Norris, who have silently crept in through the 
               supply window, come flying through the hacked-up door and 
               barrel into MacReady. Both going straight for the flare.

               MacReady spins Nauls off and rips into Norris, sending him 
               crashing violently into the wall. Nauls tackles MacReady's 
               legs, pulling him to the floor.

               The others rush him. MacReady, still in control of the 
               dynamite and flare, bellow:

                                     MACREADY
                         So help me I mean it!!

               They skid to a halt. Nauls crawls away, quickly.

                                     NAULS
                         It's cool, man. We ain't near you, 
                         man... Stay cool...

                                     PALMER
                         Yeah, man, really. Just relax.

                                     MACREADY
                         Anybody touches me... we go.

               Norris, lying on the floor, coughs as if gasping for breath. 
               He quivers for a moment and then is still. Nauls crawls over 
               to him and shakes him. A beat.

                                     NAULS
                         I don't think he's breathing.

               Nauls listens to Norris' chest. MacReady stands.

                                     MACREADY
                         Go untie the Doc. Get him in here. 
                         Bring the others, too...
                              (grins menacingly)
                         From now on no one gets out of my 
                         sight.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. INFIRMARY

               Norris' body is plopped on the examination table. Copper 
               stumbles and is steadied by some of the men. MacReady 
               continues to keep his distance.

               Copper places an oxygen mask over Norris' face. He then rips 
               open his shirt.

                                     MACREADY
                         So you sweethearts had yourselves a 
                         little trial. I just may have to 
                         kill you on general principle, Nauls.

               Copper begins swathing Norris' chest with a gelatin substance.

                                     MACREADY
                         ...Ever occur to the jury that anybody 
                         could have gotten to some of my 
                         clothes and stuck them up...

                                     CHILDS
                         We ain't buying that.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Damn it, quit the bickering and give 
                         me a hand. Wheel that fibrillator 
                         over here.

               Sanchez pushes over the portable fibrillator. Copper climbs 
               up on the table and straddles Norris' chest.

               Unnoticed, Clark paws the contents of the instrument tray 
               behind his back.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Palmer, turn on that oxygen and hold 
                         the mask over his face... Childs, 
                         grab his shoulders.

               They do so. Copper holds electrical prongs over Norris' chest.

                                     CHILDS
                              (to MacReady, 
                              threatening)
                         You're going to have to sleep 
                         sometime.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Quiet down...
                              (to Sanchez)
                         ...turn that thing on.

               Sanchez depresses the "on" button.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Now hold him.

                                     MACREADY
                         I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Enough, MacReady!

               Dr. Copper presses the prongs onto Norris' chest and shoots 
               a bolt of current. Norris' body heaves upward. A slight 
               crackling sound and an odd chirp through the oxygen mask.

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Again... More current this time, 
                         Sanchez...

               Buzzz. Several more jolts from the prongs. Clark's hand has 
               found a scalpel. He gently lifts it out, bringing it to his 
               side.

                                     MACREADY
                         And if anyone tries to wake me...

                                     DR. COPPER
                         Damn you, MacReady!

               Norris' body begins bounding up. More crackling and popping. 
               His chest begins to break up and spread. The mask pops off -- 
               a hideous mewing escaping from Norris' distorted mouth.

               The men jump back, incredulous. Dr. Copper scrambles off his 
               chest and flops to the floor.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         God... what...?

               They watch on in stunned horror as The Thing that was Norris 
               begins to change, to spread awkwardly on the slab.

               Its clothes tearing. A shoe splits in half and falls to the 
               floor, exposing the beginnings of a talon.

               MacReady charges toward it, shooing the men off.

                                     MACREADY
                         Get out of the way!!

               He unloads with a stream of flame. The body writhes in pain, 
               belching and hissing. The slab catches fire. It struggles, 
               lunges for the floor, straightens up, and moves a few feet.

               A black and yellow substance rips through its trousers and 
               squirts to the floor. Norris' body collapses on the 
               fibrillating machine in flames. Extinguishers are ripped 
               from the walls and put to work.

               MacReady watches the smoking particles of ooze in fascination, 
               as they twitch and mew on the floor.

               Within seconds the fire is out. The men stand around in awe 
               as they look upon The Thing that was once Norris.

               MacReady continues to observe the small particles. Their 
               tiny squeals abating into silence.

               INT. REC ROOM

               MacReady, still carrying the industrial torch, has maneuvered 
               all the men into the room. He holds Garry's .44. He has 
               untaped the explosives from his chest and laid them on the 
               nearby table next to two more boxes of dynamite.

                                     CLARK
                         What you got in mind, MacReady?

                                     MACREADY
                         A little test.

                                     PALMER
                         What kind of test?

                                     MACREADY
                         I'm sure a lot of you already know.

               He tosses a ream of steel cable and some rope to Palmer.

                                     MACREADY
                         Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone 
                         down. Real tight.

                                     CHILDS
                         What for?

                                     MACREADY
                         For your health.

                                     GARRY
                              (to others)
                         Let's rush him. He's not going to 
                         blow us all up.

                                     MACREADY
                         Damn if I won't.

                                     CHILDS
                              (a beat)
                         You ain't tying me up.

                                     MACREADY
                         Then I'll have to kill you.

                                     CHILDS
                         Then kill me.

               MacReady points the .44 at Childs' head.

                                     MACREADY
                         I mean it.

               MacReady cocks his gun. Childs holds his ground.

                                     CHILDS
                         I guess you do.

               A beat. Clark springs for MacReady. Scalpel raised.

               MacReady spins and fires three shots, point-blank, the forces 
               of the charges sending Clark flying backwards. The others, 
               themselves about to pounce, stop -- as MacReady whirls the 
               torch and gun back toward them.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MEN

               being tied securely to couches and chairs.

                                     MACREADY
                         Tie up Clark, too.

                                     PALMER
                              (bemused)
                         He's dead.

                                     MACREADY
                         Norris looked pretty dead, himself. 
                         Bullets don't kill these Things.

               MacReady turns on a Bunsen burner while he cuts the rubber 
               covering off an electrical cord, exposing the copper wire.

               All the while, he keeps his eye on the men.

                                     CHILDS
                              (muttering)
                         We should have jumped his ass.

                                     MACREADY
                         Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.

               Copper starts to tie Palmer to the small couch next to Childs 
               and Garry.

                                     MACREADY
                         We're going to draw a little bit of 
                         everybody's blood.

                                     NAULS
                         What are you going to do? Drink it?

                                     MACREADY
                         Watching Norris in there... gave me 
                         the idea that maybe every part of 
                         you bastards is a whole. Every piece 
                         of you is self-sufficient, an animal 
                         unto itself. When a man bleeds it's 
                         just tissue. But blood from one of 
                         you Things won't obey. It's a newly 
                         formed individual with a built-in 
                         desire to protect its own life. When 
                         attacked, your blood will try and 
                         survive -- and crawl away from a hot 
                         needle say.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SANCHEZ

               grimacing as Dr. Copper pinches a scalpel to his thumb and 
               collects a small portion of his blood in a dish.

               All the men have been tied up. Palmer, Childs and Garry on 
               the small couch. The others, including the lifeless corpse 
               of Clark, in chairs.

               Copper returns the plate to the table and sets it down in 
               line with the other plates of blood that he has collected.

               The names of each man have been scribbled onto the plates.

               MacReady slides the Doctor a fresh plate.

                                     MACREADY
                         Now you.

               Copper cuts his thumb, his blood dribbles onto the plate.

               He stands nervously for a beat.

                                     MACREADY
                         Slide it back here.

               Copper pushes it toward MacReady.

                                     MACREADY
                         Now step way back.

               Copper steps backward, moisture beginning to collect on his 
               brow. MacReady begins to heat the copper wire over the Bunsen 
               burner.

               The men watch intently. The wire begins to glow. MacReady 
               points the torch directly at the Doctor. Both of them 
               perspiring. MacReady lifts the glowing wire from the flame. 
               The Doctor is dead still. MacReady slowly touches the wire 
               to the Doctor's plate. A soft hiss.

               MacReady heats it again and tries once more. The same soft 
               hiss. MacReady and the Doctor both let out a sigh.

                                     MACREADY
                         I guess you're okay.

                                     DR. COPPER
                              (shaken, facetious)
                         Thank you.

                                     MACREADY
                         I didn't think you'd use that 
                         fibrillator on Norris if you were 
                         one of them.

               He hands Copper the torch.

                                     MACREADY
                         Watch them.

               He cuts himself with the scalpel and begins collecting his 
               own blood.

                                     MACREADY
                         Now I'll show you what I already 
                         know.

               He heats the wire and puts it to his plate. The same harmless 
               hissing. All eyes continue to watch as he tries again. The 
               same result. Childs mumbles.

                                     CHILDS
                         Load of bullshit.

                                     MACREADY
                         We'll see. Let's try Clark.

               He heats the wire and lays it in Clark's dish. The hissing.

                                     CHILDS
                         So Clark was human, huh?

               MacReady nods.

                                     CHILDS
                         So that make you a murderer.

               MacReady glances over the group.

                                     MACREADY
                         Palmer now.

               He sets Palmer's plate in front of him and heats the wire.

                                     GARRY
                         Pure nonsense. This won't prove a 
                         damn thing.

                                     MACREADY
                         Thought you'd feel that way, Garry. 
                         You were the only one who could have 
                         gotten to that blood plasma...
                              (placing the wire in 
                              Palmer's dish)
                         ...we'll do you last...

               Screech!!! The blood howls, trying to crawl off the plate.

               Palmer bolts forward with incredible force, racing for 
               MacReady; his face splitting; his mouth roaring -- dragging 
               the couch, Childs and Garry with him. He smashes into MacReady 
               knocking him over the table.

                                     MACREADY
                         Copper!!

               It's all happened too fast. Copper tries to get off a burst 
               of flame. The ever-changing Palmer breaks his bonds and leaps 
               on the Doctor.

               The others sit helpless, struggling at their bindings.

               MacReady dives on Palmer's back and the three go rolling to 
               the floor. Screeching. Crackling. MacReady pounds viciously 
               at Palmer's head. A powerful, shirt-splitting arm sends him 
               skidding across the floor.

               Copper momentarily has control of the torch. Just as he 
               positions it, Palmer's mouth splits from his chin to his 
               forehead and engulfs the entirety of the Doctor's head.

               The big torch slaps against the wall. Palmer bounds to his 
               feet, wrapping his arms around the dangling, struggling body 
               of Dr. Copper.

               The men are screaming hysterically. MacReady tries to fire 
               up the bruised torch. Busted. Won't work.

               Frustrated, he charges up behind Palmer and begins hammering 
               the thick steel instrument over his head.

               The shirt of Palmer's back erupts in MacReady's face.

               Splitting and ripping wildly, exposing the beginnings of yet 
               another orifice. A blackened, iron-strong tongue lunges 
               outward. Stunned, MacReady manages to elude it, diving for 
               the top of the table by the boxes of dynamite.

               MacReady lights the fuse of a thick roll and bounds from the 
               table. Palmer awkwardly spins in circles, swinging the 
               Doctor's body like a propeller blade, struggling to keep on 
               balance, as he advances on MacReady. The second orifice, 
               spitting and snarling as it continues to take form.

               MacReady waits until Palmer's back spins around, facing him. 
               Only two yards away, MacReady flings his lit roll into the 
               ever-evolving second mouth and leaps onto the couch covering 
               Childs and Garry with his body.

               A muffled boom, as the swallowed explosive ignites from deep 
               within Palmer and sends his flesh splattering all over the 
               room. MacReady rolls away from Childs and Garry as fast as 
               he can.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MACREADY

               perspiring profusely, his hand trembling slightly, prepares 
               to continue the test. He heats the wire.

               The men are pouring sweat, white-knuckled.

               One of the smaller torches is pointed at Nauls. He closes 
               his eyes. MacReady places the heated wire into his plate. 
               Hiss. MacReady exhales. Nauls opens his eyes.

               MacReady unties Nauls with one hand, while the torch stays 
               glued to the others.

               MacReady heats the wire once again. Both he and Nauls have 
               torches aimed at Sanchez. Sanchez is near tears.

               The wire is dipped into the plate... Hisssss.

               Sanchez breaks down and sobs.

               CHILDS

               sits stoicly, while he watches the preparations for his turn.

                                     CHILDS
                         Let's do it, Bwana.

               Nauls and Sanchez take aim five yards away. Fierce, 
               determined. The wire comes off the flame into the plate... 
               the harmless hissing.

               The muscles in Childs' face melt into a sigh.

                                     CHILDS
                         Muthafu...

               ALL EYES

               snap towards station manager Garry. Childs, suddenly realizing 
               who he is sitting next to, squirms.

                                     CHILDS
                         Get me... get me the hell away from... 
                         cut me loose, damn it!

               Nauls rips away his bindings. The other two stand guard.

               Childs scrambles off the couch and onto the floor.

               GARRY

               stares grimly ahead. Childs soaks his clothing with a can of 
               gasoline. He is then surrounded. The room tenses, adrenalin 
               pumps, breathing halts.

               The burner. The torches. The wire. The plate. Garry's face.

               Hisssss.

               MacReady tries again. Hiss. The men breathe. Their torches 
               are lowered. Nauls throws his on the floor.

               Sanchez and Childs flop down in chairs. MacReady wipes his 
               face.

               A long silence. Sanchez weeps quietly with relief.

                                     GARRY
                         I know you gentlemen have been through 
                         a lot. But when you find the time... 
                         I'd rather not spend the rest of the 
                         winter tied to this couch.

               A beat. Childs starts to giggle. The strain on MacReady's 
               jaw begins to lessen. Garry sits catatonic. Nauls scowls at 
               Childs' uncontrollable laughter.

               The infectious rasping causes MacReady a slight smile as he 
               looks up, taking comfort in the sound of the raging Antarctic 
               wind vibrating the roof. Nauls, untying Garry, grumbles, at 
               Childs.

                                     NAULS
                         Shut the damn hell up.

               Childs wipes his eyes and grins over toward MacReady. His 
               smile fades, MacReady is now stone-faced. Childs' grin goes 
               stale, in sudden realization.

                                     MACREADY
                              (almost a whisper)
                         Blair...

               EXT. COMPOUND - NIGHT

               The wind rumbles. The storm is at its peak. MacReady, Childs 
               and Nauls, guided by their flares, pull themselves along the 
               steadying rope, headed, for Blair's shack.

               BLAIR'S SHACK

               The door is wide open. They pause by the entrance, trying to 
               balance against the wind. They enter.

               INT. BLAIR'S SHACK

               Empty. A few of the floorboards are loosened. They pull them 
               up. They stare down into a large hole beneath the planking. 
               Something is down there. They pull up more boards.

               The hole is some fifteen feet deep. Its dimensions are the 
               same as the shack. Its space is almost completely taken up 
               by some strange metallic object.

               Crudely fashioned, a patchwork job, but streamlined.

               Sheets of corrugated steel are visible; but cut apart and 
               welded into the desired shapes. The object appears to be 
               unfinished.

                                     NAULS
                         What is it?

                                     MACREADY
                         Everything that's been missing.

                                     CHILDS
                         Spaceship of some kind.

                                     MACREADY
                         Smart S.O.B. He put it together piece 
                         by piece.

                                     NAULS
                         Where was he trying to go?

                                     MACREADY
                         Anyplace but here.

               MacReady pulls out a dozen tightly wrapped sticks of dynamite.

                                     MACREADY
                         But he ain't going to make it.

               Far off, amidst the howling gale -- the screeching. The men 
               jump. MacReady lights the fuse, as they make it to the exit. 
               He tosses it in.

               EXT. COMPOUND ALONG THE ROPE

               The explosion echoes behind them. The men pull along. Their 
               heads jerk in circles, searching into the blackness.

               Some twenty yards to their rear something swooshes down, 
               severing the line. The wind sends the men tumbling along the 
               ice. Childs loosens the line and is blown away, rolling out 
               of sight.

               MacReady and Nauls have lost their torches. They pull 
               feverishly along the ground trying to make it to the compound.

               The screeching closes in behind them. MacReady loses his 
               grip on the rope and is blown toward the main building.

               He crawls along looking for an opening.

               Nauls slides near the outside entrance to the dog kennel.

               He climbs down through the open stairwell.

               INT. PLANT ROOM

               MacReady has found the broken window. He rolls through it, 
               landing on the frozen plants below. Something smashes at the 
               glass above his head, trying to get in. He sprints for the 
               door. Fuchs' frozen body is still pinned to it with the ax. 
               MacReady grapples with the stiff torso which blocks the knob.

               He finally gets it open and lets himself out, slamming and 
               locking the door from the hall. Fuchs' body swings eerily, 
               back and forth.

               INT. HALLWAY

               MacReady charges up the stairs from the plant room. He zooms 
               down the twisting corridors, opening and closing doors. He 
               rounds a bend and crashes into Nauls coming the other way.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. REC ROOM - CLOSE ON SANCHEZ

               pouring gasoline into empty bottles, preparing Molotov 
               cocktails.

               Garry is connecting an electrical device: wires attached to 
               two portable generators. MacReady appears to be injecting 
               something into empty contact capsules. The men work 
               feverishly.

               Nauls rushes in with another box of dynamite.

                                     NAULS
                         What about Childs?

                                     MACREADY
                         Forget about Childs. He's over.

               Nauls begins cutting the wicks off the dynamite.

                                     GARRY
                         Make 'em short. They'll go off quicker 
                         if we need to use them.

               The wind belts into the roofing overhead. Garry sets the 
               wiring to the main doorway. MacReady begins blocking off one 
               of the other entrances with a large computer.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         What if it doesn't come?

                                     MACREADY
                         It'll come. It needs us. We're the 
                         only thing left to imitate...
                              (to Sanchez)
                         Give me a hand.

               They block off a door with two heavy electrical games.

                                     MACREADY
                              (to Sanchez)
                         You and Nauls got to block off the 
                         west side bunks, the mess hall and 
                         the kitchen.

                                     NAULS
                              (protest)
                         You crazy? He might be inside already?

                                     MACREADY
                         Chance we got to take. We got to 
                         force him to come down the east side 
                         to the door we got rigged.

               Nauls starts lacing his skates.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         He might just wait us out.

                                     MACREADY
                         I'm going to blow the generator when 
                         you get back. He'll have to come for 
                         us -- or freeze.

               MacReady further barricades the door with small couch.

                                     MACREADY
                         We've got portable heaters -- we'll 
                         last longer.

               Sanchez and Nauls start to leave.

                                     MACREADY
                         ...Hold it.

               He dispenses the capsules.

                                     MACREADY
                         Sodium cyanide. We place them between 
                         our cheeks and gums... This Thing 
                         can't imitate anything that's dead.

               A grim silence.

                                     MACREADY
                         If it gets a hold of you -- bite 
                         down... They're supposed to be fast 
                         and painless... Now move.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CORRIDOR

               Sanchez and Nauls inch their way through.

               INT. REC ROOM

               MacReady rips linen, soaks the strips in gas, and stuffs 
               them in the Molotov bottles. Garry tests the current on the 
               door. Popping, sparks, smoke.

                                     MACREADY
                         Looks good.

                                     GARRY
                         One thousand volts. Should be enough.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Nauls pushes a stove, reinforcing a locked door. Five yards 
               away, Sanchez maneuvers the refrigerator in front of another 
               outlet.

               Sanchez hears a quiet purring, bubbling sound. He turns to 
               Nauls.

                                     SANCHEZ
                         You hear that?

                                     NAULS
                         Hear what?

               A blaring. They whip their attention to stereo speakers on 
               either side of the kitchen. Rock music screams out. Top 
               volume.

               INT. REC ROOM

               The same loud music. MacReady and Garry look to the three 
               speakers attached to the walls. MacReady yells his 
               incomprehension to Garry. Garry tries to respond. Their voices 
               drowned out.

               INT. HALLWAY

               Empty. Another of the stereo speakers that line the walls, 
               thunders.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Nauls, in sudden realization, screams over the din and points 
               back in the direction they came.

                                     NAULS
                         It's got into the pub! It's turned 
                         on the stereo!

                                     SANCHEZ
                         What?!

                                     NAULS
                         It's in between us and them!! How we 
                         going to get back?!

                                     SANCHEZ
                         I can't hear you.

               INT. REC ROOM

               MacReady, cursing, rips the speakers off the wall.

                                     MACREADY
                         What are they doing out there?!

               The music is now subdued within the room, but continues 
               booming throughout the camp. Nauls' scream can be barely 
               heard.

                                     GARRY
                         What's he saying?

               INT. KITCHEN - NAULS

               at the top of his lungs...

                                     NAULS
                         MacReady! We been cut off!!

               A sharp, red, talon-like fingernail, pierces the top of the 
               door above Nauls' head. It saws downward, quickly.

               Black goo drips through the slit. The sawing obscured by the 
               music.

               Sanchez, eyes bulging, points. Nauls turns. A claw rips 
               through the wood. Nauls dives to the floor.

               In the opposite direction, behind Sanchez, another arm splits 
               through the door and the refrigerator, extends itself five 
               feet and yanks Sanchez back as if he were a puppet.

               Sanchez struggles, looking imploringly at Nauls. He bites 
               down on his capsule. Nauls takes off like a speed skater.

               INT. REC ROOM

               The sound of the screeching over the music.

                                     MACREADY
                         Got to get to the generator.

               He opens the door. Looks down the hall. No one. The speakers -- 
               blaring music.

               NAULS

               full speed down the maze. Left. Right. Totally reckless. He 
               hits a straightaway.

               SANCHEZ'S BODY

               from out of nowhere, blasts through the hallway wall, directly 
               in Nauls' path. A thick arm pins the body to the other side. 
               Unable to stop, Nauls skids out of control, banging into the 
               sides of the wall, his cyanide capsule flying out of his 
               mouth.

               Whatever the rest of it is, it starts to crumble through the 
               wall. Nauls dives over the arm, somersaults to his feet and 
               takes off.

               INT. MAIN HALL

               MacReady, running, spots Nauls careening out of a turn, 
               heading toward him.

                                     NAULS
                         Get back!!

                                     MACREADY
                         The generator!

                                     NAULS
                         Screw the generator!!

               Nauls blazes by him. MacReady hears the snarls and screeches 
               heading his way. He streaks after Nauls.

               INT. REC ROOM

               They make it in. Lock the door... MacReady tries to catch 
               his breath. Nauls shakes, pants.

                                     NAULS
                         Got Sanchez... World War Three 
                         wouldn't mess with this fucker...  
                         Can go through walls... And it's 
                         like all over the place...

                                     MACREADY
                         Calm down and get in your position.

                                     NAULS
                         Position, my ass...

               Garry fiddles with the two generators.

                                     GARRY
                         I'm going to bump this up, much as I 
                         can.

                                     NAULS
                         Boulder Dam might do it.

               The loud music in the compound is turned off. MacReady shuts 
               off the lights. The men spread out. Silence.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. REC ROOM

               The men watch all the doors. Dead silence. Dark. Whispers.

                                     GARRY
                         How long's it been?

                                     MACREADY
                         Little over two hours.

                                     NAULS
                         Maybe it ain't coming.

                                     MACREADY
                         Then we go after him.

                                     NAULS
                         Bet the last place you ever go.

               The sound of a door opening and closing. Far off.

               Another creaking door is opened. A rustling. Still far off. 
               MacReady and Nauls spread further apart.

               The soft bubbling, cooling sound. A slight scratch at the 
               door. Garry's hand tightens around the generator switches. 
               The scratching gets more pronounced. MacReady cautions Garry 
               with a whisper.

                                     MACREADY
                         Wait...

               The door begins to pound from the outside. Nauls and MacReady 
               light two cocktails each.

               The door booms. The room's foundations shake. The ceiling 
               quivers. The gas bombs are cocked.

               From the roof The Thing roars down into their midst.

               Stunned, the men stumble back. MacReady throws his gas bomb. 
               Nauls the same.

               For a moment it stands silhouetted in flame. Enormous.

               Grotesque.

               Garry bolts for the main door. The Thing's tongue spirals 
               from his mouth and spears him. The good two-thirds of its 
               body follows its tongue and engulfs Garry by the door.

               Another leg slaps Nauls to the ground. MacReady dodges still 
               another appendage, dives on the generators and throws the 
               switch.

               The current rips through the door. Garry dies instantly.

               One of The Thing's talons, still caught in the door, sends 
               it writhing in pain. It literally rips the door from its 
               latchings and pounds it to the ground, trying to shake it 
               loose. Nauls, hobbles, scrambles, out of the opening.

               MacReady dives through the window and out into the storm.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COMPOUND - HALL

               The distant sound of a motor. Nauls, battered and bloodied, 
               his leg apparently broken, crawls along the ground. Another 
               sound, a bubbling and gurgling is heard well to his rear. 
               But closing.

               The terror forces him to drag faster, oblivious to the pain.

               He reaches the bathroom stall. Crawls in. Locks it. The 
               gurgling nears. Leaning on the toilet seat, he looks about 
               himself, frantically.

               The Presence pauses at the door. A scratching. Nauls paws, 
               rips at a cracked and weathered slab of wood, cutting his 
               fingers as he tries to break it off the siding.

               A strong blow begins to breach the stall door. Nauls finally 
               unhinges the piece of wood, brings the jagged end to one 
               side of his throat and rips...

               INT. LAB WALL

               The motorized rumbling nears. The wall seems to explode. The 
               tractor barrels into the lab. Its enormous shovel scooper 
               tearing half the room to shreds.

               MacReady drives. His eyes glint like a wild man's; he looks 
               stark raving mad.

               His frostbite, now in an advanced stage, resembles black war 
               paint. He clenches a stick of dynamite between his teeth, 
               like a buccaneer's cutlass. Two large, compressed air tanks 
               have been tied together at the top and are draped around his 
               neck. They are marked -- HYDROGEN.

               They are used for the weather balloons.

               He pulls the tractor to a stop, yanks the stick from his 
               mouth, grins and bellows.

                                     MACREADY
                         Okay, creep! Just you and me now! Be 
                         on your toes! We're going to do a 
                         little remodeling!

               MacReady guns it through the next wall and into the infirmary. 
               Medical equipment goes flying. The machine is powerful; the 
               prefabricated walls buckling under its force.

               INT. COMPOUND

               A trail of viscous yellow ooze leads around a bend.

               Boom.

               MacReady rams into the mess hall, sweeping away tables, 
               chairs. He sings out loud the lyrics of some Mexican song. 
               All the while he keeps his eyes on everything.

               Through the kitchen. The foundation is crumbling. He sings 
               on.

               NARROW PASSAGEWAY

               Gurgling and hissing. A taloned arm slinks around a corner 
               in retreat.

                                     MACREADY (O.S.)
                         Chime in if you know that words, old 
                         boy.

               MACREADY

               plows through several more rooms before ending up in the pub 
               area. He backs it up and retrieves a bottle of liquor from 
               the bar.

                                     MACREADY
                         You like whiskey? Come on, join me 
                         for a drink. Be good for you. Grow 
                         fangs on your chest.

               He takes a drink and rams through another wall.

               INT. REC ROOM

               The tractor blazes into the rec room. MacReady parks it 
               directly in front of the hole in the roof, created by The 
               Thing when it surprised them earlier.

                                     MACREADY
                         Damn it, ran out of gas.

               He pulls off the heavy hydrogen tanks and drapes them over 
               the tractor. As he talks his eyes move like a hawk passing 
               from roof, to doorways, to rubble.

               Wind and ice bristle through the gaping holes, stinging 
               MacReady with the cold. He winces at his mittenless, blackened 
               fingers.

                                     MACREADY
                         Sweetheart, it's going to get mighty 
                         cold in here soon... You better make 
                         your move... I mean, hell, I'm only 
                         one person...

               He takes a swig from his bottle.

                                     MACREADY
                         I know you're bugged because we ruined 
                         your trip, right? Spiffy little toy 
                         you had there.

               A slight tremor perks his eyes and ears. He looks up through 
               the hole, then around. He lights a lighter and cups it in 
               his hand near the stick of dynamite in his lap.

                                     MACREADY
                         But your real hang up is your looks...

               A stronger tremor. The adrenalin pumps.

                                     MACREADY
                              (wants him bad)
                         Atta boy. I know you're around.

               The floor shakes. MacReady stands, his head whirling around 
               the room.

                                     MACREADY
                         Come on, sucker.

               The tractor inches up off the ground. MacReady falls forward 
               and looks straight down through the chassis and into the 
               vile and grinning face below. A claw flashes up, splitting 
               the steering wheel but missing his face.

               He depresses the ignition, bolting the tractor ten feet.

               He jumps, hanging onto the edge of the hole in the ceiling. 
               The Thing's face and arms burst through the metal plating of 
               the tractor. The reaching claws just miss him as he pulls 
               himself through.

               EXT. ROOF

               He lights his fuse, drops in the stick, turns and runs.

               Half of The Thing's grotesque and angular torso bolts up 
               through the hole, howling in fury. An appendage springs 
               outward and winds around MacReady's jacket, hissing like 
               acid into the fabric.

               An immense explosion. The hydrogen tanks send a white fireball 
               fifty feet into the sky. The Thing's body disintegrating 
               almost immediately.

               The force of the blast sweeps MacReady off the roof. He and 
               the severed appendage crash to the hard ice in flames. He 
               rolls over and over trying to smother the fire and tear off 
               the insidious limb.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAMP

               A ruin. One half of it burnt almost to the ground.

               MacReady wears a thick blanket which covers him like a shroud, 
               from his shoulders to the floor.

               He walks bent over and in much pain, trying to blunt patches 
               of fire with an extinguisher. It is futile. He gives up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PUB AREA

               Mostly untouched by the fire, but like most of the rest of 
               the camp, exposed to the outside. The storm has settled 
               considerably.

               CLOSE ON MACREADY

               lighting a cigar. His hands are heavily wrapped. He pours 
               himself a drink.

               A puffy white hand, missing two fingers, enters the frame 
               and whirls a startled MacReady around. It is Childs.

               White and black blotches cover his frostbitten face.

                                     CHILDS
                         Did you kill it?

               He looks as weak as MacReady. A beat.

                                     MACREADY
                         I think so.

                                     CHILDS
                         What do you mean "you think so?"

               Both men speak guardedly and stare at each other suspiciously.

                                     MACREADY
                         Yeah. I got it.
                              (refers to Childs' 
                              condition)
                         Pretty mean frostbite.

               Childs steps back, keeping his distance. He indicates his 
               puffy white hand.

                                     CHILDS
                         It'll turn black again soon enough. 
                         Then I guess I'll be losing the whole 
                         thing...
                              (refers to feet)
                         ...Think my toes are already gone.

               MacReady, carrying the bottle and glass, limps over and sits 
               down behind a gaming table. There is a chess set and several 
               decks of cards. The two men continue to eye each other.

                                     CHILDS
                         So you're the only one who made it.

               MacReady begins setting up a non-electronic chessboard.

                                     MACREADY
                         Not the only one.

                                     CHILDS
                         The fire's got the temperature way 
                         up all over camp... won't last long 
                         though.

                                     MACREADY
                         Neither will we.

                                     CHILDS
                         Maybe we should try and fix the 
                         radio... try and get some help.

                                     MACREADY
                         Maybe we shouldn't.

                                     CHILDS
                         Then we'll never make it.

               MacReady puffs on his cigar. He reveals a small blowtorch 
               from under the table and places it beside him on top.

                                     MACREADY
                         Maybe we shouldn't make it.

                                     CHILDS
                              (beat)
                         If you're worried about anything, 
                         let's take that blood test of yours.

                                     MACREADY
                         If we've got any surprises for each 
                         other -- we shouldn't be in any 
                         condition to do anything about it.
                              (beat)
                         You play chess?

               They regard each other for a moment. Childs painfully sits 
               down across from MacReady.

                                     CHILDS
                         I guess I'll be learning.

               MacReady grins and hands the bottle to Childs. Childs smiles 
               back and takes a healthy swig.

               EXT. COMPOUND - NIGHT

               The fires smolder on. Bright embers dance in the blackness -- 
               pushed by the soughing wind.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

     GLIDING OBJECTS IN A WIDE DARK VOID - (ANIMATION)

             Out of the SILENT darkness a short white       A
             fluted column surmounted by a SUNDIAL
             appears.  It floats in, waveringly, until
             it becomes clearly visible, then drifts
             off as though moving in some huge orbit.

             Next an HOURGLASS floats in from the left      B
             of the screen.  The faint HISSING OF
             RUNNING SAND breaks the stillness of space.

             As the hourglass glides across the screen,     C
             it is met by a GREEK WATER CLOCK accompanied
             by the sound OF DRIPPING WATER.

             A MEDIEVAL CLOCK with weights arises as its    D
             horizontal escapement TICKS LOUDLY.  Mean-
             while the sundial, hourglass and water clock
             return, drifting at diverse angles across
             the screen.

     THE SOUND of the various devices continues to MOUNT.

             A FIGURE wheels past, with the face of a       E
             clock and the body carved like a drummer
             of the 14th century, BEATING the hour.

             A SMALL CLOCK bears a golden angel with        F
             hammer in hands as it STRIKES A BELL.

             ANOTHER TIMEPIECE, with CHIMES, floats in      G
             to mingle with all the drifting objects.

             The BIG BEN is TOLLING                         H

             Then a GREAT BELL.                             J

     DEAFENING SOUNDS NOW COME FROM ALL DIRECTIONS, as the time K
     devices weave across the screen and, reaching CRESCENDO,
     STOP abruptly.  A mellow VOICE begins to SING THE THEME of L
     the picture, "The Land Of The Leal".  Simultaneously, the
     screen reveals the MAIN TITLE:                             M

                        "THE LAND OF THE LEAL"

                      Words & Music by Peggy Lee

         When I was a wee lad                               L
         And dark was the night
         Afraid I would be
         Til the bright morning light
         And sometimes...for comfort
         Away I would steal Away
         I would go to the Land of the Leal.

         And soon I would be there
         It took me no time
         My heart would be soaring
         As I made the climb
         And there was the green grass
         So cool and so sweet
         So good to be run through
         With happy bare feet!

         And who was my teacher
         And how did I know?
         Just when to be going
         And which way to go?
         But always when wishing
         Away I would steal
         Away I would go to the Land of the Leal.

         And now that I'm older
         I try to be wise
         But when I am troubled
         I still close my eyes
         And just like the wee lad
         Away I will steal
         Away I will go to the Land of the Leal.

         For there are no questions
         And there are no lies
         And never a storm there
         To darken the skies
         The birds who are flying
         No freer they feel
         Than I
         When I live in the land of the Leal.

     EXT. COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) - (MATTE)

     Warm lights pour through the windows, spreading
     over the snow-patched countryside.  Only the
     laboratory, a converted greenhouse, is dark, shaded
     from the moonlight by a majestic, leafless oak.
     A two-horse carriage, in the style of the turn of
     the century, lingers in the driveway.  Beyond all
     this, the River Thames takes a sharp curve.

     A lonely figure hurries up to the front door and
     KNOCKS on it impatiently.



     AT THE DOOR                                            2

     The knock is answered by MRS. WATCHETT, the house-
     keeper, a thin, tense woman with iron gray hair.
     The CAMERA ENTERS the HALL with DAVID FILBY, an
     amiable red-haired young man of science, who hastily
     hands her his rumpled cloak and hat, then rushes
     toward:



     INT. LIBRARY                                           3

     A pleasant Edwardian room, the shelves are stacked
     tightly with volumes of books, many of ancient
     Vintage.

     Three men are seated in a rough circle, motionless,
     obviously awaiting the arrival of occupants for the
     two empty chairs.  The silence is accentuated by the
     merry CRACKLING of logs in the fireplace and the
     capricious TICKING of innumerable timepieces about
     the room.

     Filby enters, pauses to glance down, then embarrassedly
     takes his chair.



     SERIES OF CLOSE SHOTS                                  4

               DR. PHILIP HILLYER is an imposing            (a)
               businessman, wearing full sideburns.
               He stares stonily at the last empty
               chair, then at Filby with annoyance.

               ANTHONY BRIDEWELL, a man of the world,       (b)
               impeccably attired in the latest fashion,
               welcomes Filby the only way he knows, by
               lifting his glass of whiskey.

               black piercing eyes, angrily chews on
               his Havana.

               Filby fidgets uncomfortably in his chair     (d)
               as

               Hillyer glances impatiently at his           (e)
               watch, comparing time with a GRAND-
               FATHER CLOCK behind him, then snaps
               it shut and glares at:



     EMPTY CHAIR - MED. SHOT                                5

     Conspicuously unoccupied.



     GRANDFATHER CLOCK - CLOSE SHOT                         6

     Reaching the hour of eight, it begins to STRIKE ITS
     YELLOW CHIMES.  Other timepieces JOIN IN the announce-
     ment.



     GROUPSHOT                                              7

     The men look at each other until the CHIMES, BELLS
     ETC. FADE away.  Dr. Hillyer angrily slaps on the
     arm of his leather chair.

                         DR. HILLYER
               I say, this is outright rude of the man!

                         FILBEY
               He's undoubtedly been detained.  That's
               all.

     Bridewell, filling his glass, is trying to say some-
     thing but is interrupted by

                         KEMP (unscrews the cigar from
                    his tight lips)
               This is such a confounded waste of
               time!  If he's not coming, I've any
               number of more important things to do.

     All heads turn as Mrs. Watchett enters, closing the
     door quietly behind her.  With an envelope in her
     hand she stands there, hesitating.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Speak up -- what is it, woman?

     She is taken aback for a moment, then walks over
     to Filby and hands him the open envelope.  He
     takes his time in extracting the note.

                         BRIDEWELL
               Well...are we or are we not invited
               to dinner?

                         FILBY (reading)
               Apparently we are.
                    (to Mrs. Watchett)
               How long has he been gone?

                         MRS. WATCHETT (nervously)
               I can't rightly say, sir. - Several
               days...I hardly catch a glimpse of
               him lately.  He never leaves the
               laboratory and comes out only to
               nibble at his meals...but he did tell
               me days ago about dinner tonight and
               left these instructions.
                    (pointing to note)

                         FILBY
               Thank you, Mrs. Watchett.

     A faint, nervous smile is her acknowledgement and
     with that she retreats toward the door.

                         DR. HILLYER (indicating the
                    note)
               What does it say, Filby?  What's
               wrong?

                         FILBY
               Nothing really. - George merely says
               that if he is not here by eight we're
               to begin without him.

     Kemp tears the note out of Filby's hand and reads it
     hurriedly.  Meanwhile, Mrs. Watchett swings the door
     open and turns around.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Dinner is served, gentlemen!

                         BRIDEWELL (puts his glass
                    down)
               First sensible thing I've heard all
               evening.

     He rises and starts for the dining room.  The others
     follow.



     FILBY, HILLYER & KEMP - MOVING SHOT                    8

     As they walk toward the DINING ROOM.

                         FILBY
               This is peculiar.  He is usually very
               prompt, precise and punctual.

                         DR. HILLYER
               He's making fools of us by inviting
               us here and then not showing up.
               It's not the behavior of a gentleman.

                         KEMP
               To say nothing of the waste of
               time.

                         DR. HILLYER (agreeing)
               To say nothing of the waste of
               time.

     Bridewell, already seated at the heavily laden dining
     table, pours a glass of wine for himself while the
     others settle down.  This time the chair at the head
     of the table is conspicuously unoccupied.

                         BRIDWELL (arises, lifting
                    his glass)
               One thing I will say for George, he
               keeps the best cellar in the south of
               England...and Mrs. Watchett is the
               finest cook in the world. - I think
               I'll drink to that!

     The glass barely touches his lips as he freezes at
     the SOUND OF DROPPING TRAYS and a PIERCING SCREAM.
     All look in the direction of another door across
     the room.



     THE DOOR - FULL SHOT                                   9

     It bursts inward and Mrs. Watchett, her hair flying,
     dashes down the steps panic-stricken into the room.
     The CAMERA RUSHES with her to the table where the
     men have come to their feet.  Clutching Filby's arm,
     she points toward the long corridor now revealed by
     the open door.

                         MRS. WATCHETT (frightened)
               There!...there...

     All stare o.s., Hillyer with the carving knife
     clasped in his hand.



     CORRIDOR THROUGH DOORWAY - FULL SHOT                   10

     We see the figure of a man approaching, a black
     silhouette against the pale glow at the end of
     the passage.  He is bent with exhaustion and
     sways as he moves forward, limping.  The man comes
     closer, his features still blacked out by shadows,
     but as he nears the doorway, the light from the
     room strikes first his legs, then his body and
     finally his face.  Here he stops.

     This is our first meeting with the TIME TRAVELLER
     (for so it will be convenient to speak of him).  At
     this instant he is in a sorry state.  His clothing
     is tattered and dirty, his face pale, bruised and
     scratched and his eyes glazed with fatigue.  For
     a moment he hesitates as if dazzled by the light
     and then takes another swaying step into the room.



     FILBY AND BRIDEWELL - MOVING SHOT                      11

     They come to life.  Bridewell, noticing the glass
     of wine still in his hand, quickly gulps it down
     before rushing with Filby toward the Time Traveller.

                         FILBY
               Good lord! - What's happened?

     Reaching him, each seizes an elbow to support him.
     Bridewell throws a frantic glance at Dr. Hillyer
     back at the table.  The Time Traveller, however,
     moves forward under his own power.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I'm all right...just some food...a
               drink...

     He reaches the table and sinks into his chair.  With
     trembling hands Bridewell tries to pour him a glass
     of wine, spilling most of it over the tablecloth.
     The Time Traveller looks up at him with a wry smile.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Are you all right?

     A stunned Bridewell is unable to speak while the Time
     Traveller empties his glass.

                         BRIDEWELL (a delayed
                    answer)
               Of course.  I'm...all right...

     Meanwhile, Mrs. Watchett hovers over the Time Traveller
     like a mother hen.

                         MRS. WATCHETT (half
                    apology, half concern)
               I didn't recognize you!...it was
               so dark...

     The CAMERA MOVES IN as she dishes up a bowl of soup
     for him, but he pushes it away.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Meat...I'm hungry for meat!

     Mrs. Watchett grasps the carving knife from Dr.
     Hillyer and, with a single slash, cuts off a huge
     portion of beef and loads it onto his plate.



     GROUPSHOT                                              12

     The Time Traveller eats, the men watching him
     curiously.  Finally Dr. Hillyer leans forward.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Well, can't you speak, man?  What
               happened to you?  Aren't you going
               to tell us...

                         BRIDEWELL
               Leave him alone, can't you?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (swallowing)
               It's all right. - I want to tell.

                         FILBY
               It will keep, George.  Eat, rest a
               little.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               No!  I must tell it now... while I
               still remember.

                         FILBY
               Relax, try to relax a bit.  You've
               all the time in the world.



     CLOSE ON THE TIME TRAVELLER                            13

     As he looks up, amused.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You're right, David.
                    (almost to himself)
               That's exactly what I have. -
               All the time in the world!...
               ever since we were all together
               five days ago, the last day of
               Eighteen Hundred Ninety Nine.

     Slowly the CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSER while everyone
     listens so intensely that, aside from the Time
     Traveller's VOICE, only the TICKING of a pendulum
     CLOCK is heard.

                                         SLOWLY DISSOLVE:



     INT. - EBONY BOX ON TABLE - CLOSE SHOT (AFTERNOON)     14

     (NOTE:  The Slow Dissolve from the previous shot
             should give the effect of the Ebony Box
             emerging from the Time Traveller's brain.)

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               There in that box rests the result
               of two years' labor.

     The CAMERA DRAWS BACK to reveal the LIBRARY.  The Time
     Traveller, wearing casual tweeds and smoking a pipe,
     sits in his favorite chair behind the Ebony Box.
     Across from him in another chair sits Dr. Hillyer
     puffing his cigar.  Bridewell and Filby have glasses
     in their hands -- Kemp nothing.  All are looking at
     the box.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (continues)
               I wanted to finish the job before
               the new century began. - I barely
               made it.

                         BRIDEWELL
               Marvelous.

                         DR. HILLYER (stands up)
               What is it?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Well, it has to do with time.

                         DR. HILLYER
                    (steps to box)
               I've always maintained what this
               nation needs is a reliable timepiece.
               The Navy needs one. The Army needs
               one. - For the artillery you know.

                         KEMP (leaning forward)
               Couldn't do better, George.  So
               that's why you've been in hiding. -
               Clever of you, indeed!

                         FILBY (studying the Time
                    Traveller's reaction)
               I don't believe George is referring
               to a new kind of timepiece.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               When I speak of time, I'm referring
               to the fourth dimension.

     A perplexed look comes over Bridewell's face.
     Dr. Hillyer registers concern.  Kemp looks troubled.
     Only Filby expresses avid interest.

                         FILBY
               Go on, George.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Now, as you know, the difficulty
               in explaining the fourth dimension
               is that it cannot be seen or felt -
               it must be thought of.

                         FILBY
               If you don't mind, George, would
               you refresh me on the first three
               dimensions.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Really, Filby, they must have
               taught you something at school!

                         BRIDEWELL (baiting
                    Dr. Hillyer)
               Suppose you explain it, Doctor.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Certainly!
                    (he demonstrates
                     pompously)
               When I move in a straight line,
               forward or backward, that's one
               dimension. - When I move to the
               left or right, two dimensions. -
               When I move up and down, three
               dimensions.
                    (a bright idea lights up
                    his face.  At last he can
                    get ahold of the box, but
                    Filby interferes before
                    Dr. Hillyer can get his
                    fingers on it and he has
                    to be satisfied with merely
                    pointing)
               For instance, this box has three
               dimensions:  length, breadth, and
               height.

                         BRIDEWELL (amazed)
               Well, then, what's the fourth
               dimension?

                         DR. HILLYER
               Well, that's...that's mere theory!
               No one can really say what the
               fourth dimension is or even that
               it exists.



     THE TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                         15

     Leaning forward in his chair.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               On the contrary, Doctor!  The
               fourth dimension is as true and as
               real a dimension as any of the
               other three.  In fact, they couldn't
               exist without it.

                         DR. HILLYER (enters the SHOT)
               How do you mean?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Well, take that box.  It has the
               first three dimensions, as you said.
               But what if it didn't exist in Time?
               It wouldn't exist at all, would it?

                         DR. HILLYER
               No.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               So - for an object to exist at all,
               it must exist in the fourth dimen-
               sion....and that fourth dimension
               is duration....Time!

                         DR. HILLYER (impatiently)
               All right!  But what's in that box?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I'm coming to that.  But first,
               consider!  Why is it that we usually
               ignore the fourth dimension?  Because
               we have no freedom to move in it.  We
               can move in the other three -- up,
               down, forward, backward, sideways.
               But when it comes to Time, we are
               prisoners.  Do you follow me, Anthony?



     GROUP SHOT                                             16

     In the f.g., Bridewell who has been sitting with a
     glazed, dreamy look, suddenly jumps.

                         KEMP
               George!  You've given a most lucid
               explanation and all that!  But I
               don't think I entirely understand.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Look!  There are a lot of things in
               the world you don't understand,
               aren't there?

                         KEMP
               Of course!  Quite a number.

               But you don't refuse to believe
               in them because of that?

                         KEMP
               Not if I can see the proof with
               my own eyes.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Good!  All I'm asking you to do
               now is to witness a demonstration
               of the possibility of movement in
               the fourth dimension.
                    (to Dr. Hillyer)
               Philip, will you please hand me
               that box?

     All eyes turn to Dr. Hillyer as he eagerly rushes to
     the table, lifts the box with surprise at its lightness,
     and takes it to the Time Traveller.  George opens it
     with great care and brings forth a mechanical device

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I've told you.  The larger model
               can carry a passenger on a journey
               through Time. - Not through Space,
               mind you, but through Time.

                         BRIDEWELL
               Oh, I say George!  If you start
               floating around in the future, aren't
               you likely to mess things up for the
               rest of us?

                         DR. HILLYER
               The future is already there.  It's
               irrevocable and cannot be changed.

     He answers thoughtfully.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               That's the most important question
               to which I hope to find an answer.
               Can Man control his destiny?  Can he
               change the shape of things to come?

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Imagine that this cigar is the Time
               Traveller.  Now, this lever in front
               of him controls movement.  Forward
               pressure sends the Machine into the
               future, backward pressure into the
               past.  And the harder the pressure
               the faster the Machine travels.

     All eyebrows are raised.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               This experiment can be performed
               only once.  If it succeeds, I lose
               my model forever.  That is why I
               need witnesses.

     They look at each other, uncertain whether he is
     joking or not.  Bridewell stoops with difficulty to
     examine the table.

                         KEMP
               Go ahead.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You're ready then?

     Despite disbelief, there is a tense silence as he puts
     his finger on the lever.  Then he pauses.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Doctor Hillyer, would you care
               to lend me your hand?

     Dr. Hillyer extends his hand hesitantly, smiling
     weakly.



     INSERT OF MODEL                                        25

     Using Dr. Hillyer's forefinger, the Time Traveller
     presses the lever forward.  A LOW-PITCHED HUM is
     heard.



     CLOSE ON THE MEN - LOW ANGLE                           26

     The men stare in fascination as the CAMERA PANS
     and the HUMMING INCREASES.



     INSERT:  GLASSES - CHANDELIER - VASE                   27

               The glasses on the silver tray rattle        (a)
               and clink against each other.

               The gas lights of the chandelier             (b)
               flicker rapidly.

               A vase shudders and moves slightly on        (c)
               the mantelpiece.



     INSERT OF MODEL                                        28

     As the vibration increases, the outline of the model
     is blurred and gradually becomes transparent, until
     the Machine with the cigar has vanished utterly.
     The HUMMING HAS REACHED A HIGH SHRIEK and STOPS
     abruptly.



     BACK TO CLOSE ON MEN - LOW ANGLE                       29

     The sudden silence is almost unbearable.  They
     stare at the empty table.  The CAMERA PANS.

                         DR. HILLYER (touches his
                    cigar pocket)
               I'll be damned!

                         TIME TRAVELLER (almost
                    to himself)
               It worked!

     Filby swallows.

     Bridewell, with his mouth open, stares at the table.
     Now he looks at the glass of champagne in his hand
     and places it on the mantelpiece as far out of
     reach as he can.  Then, suddenly reversing his
     decision, he retrieves the glass and gulps it down.

     TWO SHOT                                               31

     Dr. Hillyer slowly turns to the Time Traveller.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Where did it go?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (recovering)
               Go?  Nowhere in the usual sense.
               It's still here.
                    (indicating space where the
                    Machine stood)
               But it's no longer in the present.
               It's traveling through time - to
               the future, to be precise.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Do you seriously expect us to
               believe that?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Certainly.

                         DR. HILLYER
               But you just said it hasn't
               really moved.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               That's correct.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Then why can't we see it?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Because we're in this room on
               December 31st, 1899, while the
               model you saw is perhaps a hundred
               years away.  This room, or even
               this house, may no longer exist a
               hundred years from now.  But the
               Time Machine is occupying the same
               space it did a moment before it went
               off on its journey.

     Dr. Hillyer runs his hand over the top of the table.

                         DR. HILLYER (exasperated)
               If it occupies the same space, I
               should be able to feel it.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You must remember that the space
               you've just put your hand through
               is today's space.  You can't put
               your hand into the space of
               tomorrow.

                         DR. HILLYER (getting angry)
               Space is space!  It doesn't change!
               The same space that is here now should
               be here a hundred or even a thousand
               years from now.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               No!  Time changes space.  This flat
               ground we're standing on now could
               have been at the bottom of the sea
               a million years ago.  And a million
               years from now it could be the
               interior of a huge mountain.

     Dr. Hillyer turns away, speechless.



     GROUP SHOT                                             32

     Kemp steps forward.

                         KEMP
               Suppose what you say is true.
               Exactly what do you suggest we do
               with such a contraption?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               For my part, I intend to take a
               journey into the future. - Unless
               someone else prefers to volunteer.

     There is no response.

                         BRIDEWELL (chuckling)
               I say, George.  Suppose you go off
               and get lost in the fiftieth century!
               How will you find your way back?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (quite
                    serious)
               That's a calculated risk I'm prepared
               to take.

     Dr. Hillyer, having controlled his fury, now exchanges
     significant glances with Kemp and turns back with an
     air of reasonableness.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Now listen, George!  I don't
               know what you take us for, but
               we're not fools.  There are a
               number of ways of doing a
               disappearing trick!  But a man of
               your ability should not bother
               with such nonsense.



     CLOSE ON DR. HILLIER - MOVING SHOT                     33

     He gets up from his chair.

                         DR. HILLYER (unable to
                    resist the temptation for
                    sarcasm)
               There's a war on, you know!  The
               Boers are putting up a pretty stiff
               fight in South Africa and our
               country needs inventors like you.
               I can put you in touch with the
               War Office if you wish.

     He walks over to the Time Traveller who is sitting
     near the table on which stands the empty Ebony Box
     with its lid open.  Filby is in the b.g.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (looks
                    up at Filby)
               What do you think?

                         FILBY (hesitating
                    slightly, and then)
               I think Dr. Hillyer has a point,
               George.

     Lazily the Time Traveller toys with the lid of the
     Ebony Box, then closes it with a SNAP.  He looks up
     and nods.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Now you're being sensible.  I'll
               take care of it first thing in
               the New Year.



     BACK TO GROUP SHOT                                     34

     Everyone rises.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Well, time to go.

                         KEMP
               Yes, we all have our plans for
               tonight.

     Dr. Hillyer and Kemp head toward the door.  Bridewell
     lingers at the table where the model of the Time
     Machine disappeared.

                         BRIDEWELL (concerned)
               Are you all right, George?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Of course, I am.

                         DR. HILLYER'S VOICE
               Coming, Bridewell?

     Reluctantly Bridewell leaves the library followed
     by the Time Traveller.



     INT. ENTRANCE HALL - FULL SHOT                         35

     While his guests put on their capes, overcoats, scarfs,
     gloves and hats, preparing for the cold weather
     outside, the Time Traveller steps to the door and
     grasps the handle.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Thanks for coming.

     He opens the door and they file past him, Bridewell
     at the rear.

                         AD LIBS
               Happy New Year. - Goodbye, George -
               Happy Twentieth Century. - Etc.

     Bridewell clasps the Time Traveller's shoulder,
     reassuringly.



     EXT. COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - (DUSK) - (MATTE)            36

     In contrast to the previous SHOT (Sc.l) this is a snow-
     less wintery day.  The visitors are boarding the
     carriage that awaits them in the drive.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Come on, Bridewell.

     Bridewell glances back to the Time Traveller, then
     submits and, with a CRACK OF A WHIP, the carriage
     moves off.



     EXT. ENTRANCE - FULL SHOT                              37

     The Time Traveller, a silhouette framed in the door-
     way, waves to them.



     THE CARRIAGE                                           38

     As it pulls away, Bridewell leans out, waving.  From
     the opposite direction another carriage full of NOISY
     YOUNG PEOPLE THUNDERS by.  In early New Year's Eve
     REVELRY they TOOT their toy HORNS at the Time Traveller.



     BACK TO THE TIME TRAVELLER                             39

     Unmindful of their salutations he turns and enters the
     cottage.



     INT. ENTRANCE HALL - MED SHOT                          40

     The Time Traveller slowly closes the door and leans his
     back against it, staring into space.  Thinking. - He
     spots a newspaper on a nearby table, apparently left by
     one of his guests, and picks it up.



     INSERT: NEWSPAPER                                      40-A

     A ROLL OF DRUMS in military fashion ACCENTS the headline
     that the Boer Army has won another victory.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                40-B

     He closes his eyes and, added to the DRUMS, we HEAR
     the call to battle by a DISTANT BUGLE.  Then more
     BRASS, FIFES and HORNS join the BUGLE and DRUMS to take
     up a MILITANT OVERTURE.

     He loosens his collar, then with sudden resolution
     strides toward:

     The Time Traveller crosses to his writing table in
     the f.g.  He stands there and even in the darkness
     WE CAN OBSERVE that he is an angry man.  He strikes
     a match and lights the overhead gas fixture.  The
     light comes up and the MUSIC STOPS as he stares
     across the room to see:



     FILBY - MED. SHOT                                      58

     sitting in a chair near the fireplace.

                         FILBY
               I thought I'd better stay.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               You needn't have troubled yourself.
               I'm all right.

                         FILBY
               No you're not. - You've been
               behaving oddly for over a month
               now.
                    (and then)
               I'm not leaving until you tell me
               what's on your mind.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             59

     Deep in thought, he goes to the fireplace and stirs
     the coals.  The CAMERA FOLLOWS.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I appreciate your gesture, David,
               but if you don't mind I'd rather
               you left me alone.

                         FILBY
               You have changed, George.
               Enormously.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I'm sorry.

                         FILBY (looks up to him
                    directly)
               Will you answer me one question
               honestly?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I'll try.

                         FILBY
               Why this preoccupation with Time?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (sharply)
               Why not?

                         FILBY
               Don't go simple on me, George!

                         TIME TRAVELLER (a beat,
                    then calmly)
               If you want to know the truth, I
               don't much care for the time I was
               born into. - It seems people aren't
               dying fast enough these days.  They
               call upon science to invent new,
               more efficient weapons to depopulate
               the earth.

                         FILBY
               I quite agree with you.  But here
               we are and we have to make the best
               of it.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You may have to.  I don't.

                         FILBY (making a half-
                    hearted attempt at levity)
               All right.  Take a journey on your
               contraption.  What would you become?...
               A Greek?  A Roman?  One of the
               Pharaohs?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I prefer the future.

                         FILBY
               You're not seriously saying you can
               do it?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You saw the experiment this afternoon,
               didn't you?

                         FILBY
               I saw a toy machine vanish.  But
               I'm certain there are a number of
               ways of doing that trick.  Any
               magician at the Hippodrome could
               probably do it.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (angrily)
               It was no trick! - Would you care
               to see the full-scale model?

                         FILBY
               No, I would not!  I have no desire
               to tempt the laws of Providence and
               I don't think you should.  It's not
               for man to trifle with.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Now you sound like Hillyer and Kemp.

                         FILBY
               There is something in their common
               sense attitude to life.
                    (and then)
               George, I speak to you as a friend.
               More, as a brother.  If that machine
               can do what you say it can...destroy
               it.  Destroy it, George, before it
               destroys you.

     Distant SOUNDS of NEW YEAR'S CELEBRATIONS are HEARD.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You must have plans for New Year's
               Eve.  Don't let me keep you.

                         FILBY
               Mary isn't well.  We decided to
               stay home with the baby.  But why
               don't you come home with me.  You
               haven't seen little Jaime for a
               long time.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I can't.

                         FILBY
               What's stopping you?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I just want to see the old century
               out by myself.

                         FILBY (rising)
               Have it your own way.

     He goes to the door.



     AT THE DOOR                                            60

     Filby stops, then turns around.

                         FILBY
               Will you promise me that you won't
               leave the house tonight?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I promise you, I won't walk out of
               the door.

     Filby, a little puzzled by this strange promise, turns
     to go as the Time Traveller puts down the poker and
     steps up to him.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               David!  Please don't think me un-
               friendly! - Come over to dinner -
               next Friday.  Won't you?

                         FILBY
               Very well.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Fine...and will you bring the others
               with you?

                         FILBY (with a warm smile)
               Whatever you say, George. - Happy
               New Year.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (shaking hands)
               And a very happy New Year to you, David.

     Filby pats his arm before he leaves.  The Time Traveller
     stands there until he hears the FRONT DOOR SHUT.  Then,
     FOLLOWED BY THE CAMERA, he goes to the writing table
     and sits down.



     AT THE WRITING TABLE                                   61

     The Time Traveller opens a drawer and takes out the
     new calendar that reads:  "1900, Welcome New Century."
     He flips a few pages to find the next Friday and jots
     down the dinner engagement.  At this point Mrs. Watchett,
     with his velvet smoking jacket over her arm, appears
     in the doorway and walks up to him.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Will you be having supper in this
               evening, sir?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (while ex-
                    changing jackets with Mrs.
                    Watchett's help)
               I don't think so, Mrs. Watchett.  Why
               don't you take the evening off and
               celebrate.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Thank you, sir, but if you won't be
               needing me I think I'll turn in early
               and get some sleep...
                    (indicating revelers outside)
               ...it I can. - Goodnight, sir.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Goodnight.

     She turns to go as the Time Traveller calls after her.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Oh, Mrs. Watchett!
                    (as she responds)
               I've invited Mr. Filby and the others
               to dinner next Friday.
                    (and then)
               Happy New Year, Mrs. Watchett.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Happy New Year, sir.

     Mrs. Watchett exits, closing the door after her.  Once
     again the Time Traveller is alone.  He looks at the
     old calendar that reads:  "December 3l. 1899," rips
     the final sheet from the pad, crumples it into a tight
     little ball and tosses it into the hearth where it
     burns.  With slow and deliberate movements he replaces
     the old calendar with the new one.  Then, he hastily
     scribbles a note which he puts into an envelope and
     places it prominently on the table.  He rises and
     mounts the steps that lead to:



     INT. CORRIDOR - MOVING SHOT                            62

     The Time Traveller walks slowly toward a closed door
     at the end of the passageway.  Here he pauses momentarily,
     removes the key from his pocket, unlocks the door, then
     slowly swings it open as the MUSIC STARTS the THEME of
     the picture.



     INT. LABORATORY - FULL SHOT - (NIGHT)                  63

     The laboratory has the appearance of having once been
     a greenhouse.  Only a few potted plants remain.  The
     glass walls are obscured from view from the garden by
     rows of tall growing plants.  Only the glass skylight
     is clear.  Thick, dark, low-hanging clouds are pass-
     ing beneath the moon, dimming its light and leaving
     the interior a maze of dark shadows.  As the slow mov-
     ing clouds pass overhead, a shaft of moonlight seeps
     through and we SEE workbenches, numerous tools, sheets
     of drawings and scientific instruments situated around
     the perimeter.

     But the most conspicuous object in the room is the
     Time Machine.  It is a duplicate of the miniature model
     already seen.

     However, its size gives it a majestic quality.  Nickel,
     ivory and crystalline quartz gleam and sparkle.  While
     the miniature possessed a delicate, appealing note, the
     full size Machine has an ominous look.  The wavering
     moonlight seems to render it alive and give it the
     power of movement.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                  64

     Staring at the Machine, hypnotized by his own crafts-
     manship, he locks the door with accustomed movement,
     then crosses to a workbench and lights a candle.  Here
     a crystalline lever is attached to a polishing buffer.
     The Time Traveller sets it in motion, polishing the
     crystal lever until its rough edges disappear and it
     sparkles like a fine cut diamond.  As he works, his
     lips purse and he softly STARTS TO WHISTLE the melancholy
     strains of "The Land Of The Leal."  A clock near him on
     the workbench reads:  "9:30."

     Satisfied with the buffing, he removes the gleaming
     handle and crosses to the Machine.  He settles into the
     saddle and affixes the crystalline lever.  There is no
     sign of urgency in his movements to betray that his
     settling himself into the saddle is any more than a
     routine position he has taken before to work on the
     Machine.

     Then he leans back in the saddle and gazes up at:



     INSERT:  SKYLIGHT - (STOP MOTION OR ANIMATION)         65

     Passing clouds.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 66

     He looks upwards for several moments.  Then his hand
     slowly reaches forth and his fingers encircle the
     lever. - Gently he urges it forward.

     A HUMMING SOUND, similar to the one made by the model,
     but MORE RESONANT starts and a soft glow wells up from
     within the Machine.



     INSERT:  THE CONTROL PANEL                             67

     The luminous dials show:  "31 December 1899."  The
     meters and indicators start to BUZZ and whirl.  The
     glow increases.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 68

     His expression is taut as he looks around, then down
     to the control panel.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               I started...and the laboratory grew
               faint around me...



     INSERT OF PANEL                                        69

     The figures spin, the needles vibrate.  Then almost
     at once the Time Traveller's hand reaches for the
     lever and jerks it over to halt the Machine.  The
     HUMMING LESSENS and FADES.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 70

     As he starts to look up and around, slowly.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               ...I stopped.



     WHAT HE SEES - MOVING SHOT                             71

     Starting at the WINDOW with frost around the edges
     and icicles outside, we move around the room PASSING
     THE WORKBENCH over to the DOOR.  During this we HEAR the:

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               No change; everything exactly as it
               bad been before. - But no!

     THE CAMERA SWINGS BACK TO THE WORKBENCH, CLOSE, where
     the clock now shows "11:09" and the candle has burned
     shorter.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE (excited)
               The clock said 9:31 when I started and
               now it was 11:O9...and the candle,
               shorter by inches.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 72

     He looks amazed, then pulls his old fashioned watch
     from his pocket by its gold chain.  It flips open
     showing almost "9:32."

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               And yet by my watch which was in the
               machine with me, only a few seconds
               had passed.

     Pleased, he puts his watch away and reaches for the
     lever, looking off toward the:



     WORKBENCH - (ANIMATION)                                73

     The HUMMING SOUND STARTS again and, while the hands
     of the clock circle the dial, the flame of the candle
     flickers with the speed of a bee's wing, melting the
     candle down.  The CAMERA MOVES to the window where the
     frost has spread and the icicles continue to grow.
     Light comes up behind so that the crystals glitter like
     gems and the sun starts to rise.



     TIME TRAVELLER IN THE MACHINE - MED. SHOT              74

     The rays of the early Morning sun slide down the lab-
     oratory wall and sweep across the Time Traveller and
     his Machine.  A trace of a smile -- and then, he looks
     up and squints.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               It was disconcerting to see the sun...



     INSERT:  SKYLIGHT - MED. SHOT - (STOP MOTION OR        75
     ANIMATION)

     As the sun arches majestically.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               ...arc in less than a minute...

               for the night, changes that normally
               took hours, occuring in seconds, was
               beautiful.

     During this it has turned into night and a little SNAIL
     rushes across the ground beneath the plant, and then
     the flowers start to open again.  Light begins to flood
     the scene.

     In the b.g. Mrs. Watchett leaps into the garden, pauses
     the briefest instant to sprinkle the flowers, then with
     the speed of wind streaks away.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 77

     A trace of a smile, then apprehension.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               And as yet I was travelling very slowly!
                    (challenging)
               What if I went faster?!

     His hand shoves the lever farther over toward the
     future position.

     THE HUMMING SOUND RISES TO HIGHER PITCH.  The Time
     Traveller lurches in his seat, clings to the controls
     and looks at the dials.



     INSERT:  CLOSE ON DIALS                                78

     INSERT OF SKYLIGHT - (STOP MOTION OR ANIMATION)        80

     The sun soars across the sky, night falls.  Pin points
     of stars streak by and dawn comes.  The sun is chased
     by the stars again and again.  Faster and faster.



     VERY CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                           81

     His eyes gleam with a mad light, half pleasure, half
     pain.  His face is illuminated by the alternating
     flashes of light, each one indicating the passage of
     another day.

     He turns toward the:



     WINDOW - FULL SHOT - (ANIMATION, STOP MOTION & STOCK)  82

     Without a trace of frost or icicles.  The snow has
     disappeared, replaced by the lush green of Spring.
     While the vines of a morning Glory grow up and around
     the window like a snake and the flowers open and close,
     we see the following through repeated fast flashes.

                    The sun hops swiftly across the sky.    (a)

                    The night falls and the stars circle    (b)

                    tumultuous clouds.

                    On the following day the sky darkens    (e)
                    with thunderheads.  There is a
                    cataract of lightning and THUNDER.



     BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 83

     Quick flashes of lightning on the Time Traveller's
     face followed by a series of SHORT THUNDERCLAPS.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               It became intoxicating.  To see an
               entire storm in a few seconds. -
               So I pushed the lever on toward
               even greater speed.

     He applies greater pressure on the lever.  The
     HUMMING INCREASES.  The alternate flashes of light
     become a flicker almost too fast for the eye to
     follow.  He looks o.s. and sees:



     EXT. TREE IN GARDEN - FULL SHOT - (ANIMATION)          84

     Its shadows, cast by the sun and the moon, dance
     around the trunk, faster and faster -- the moon
     passing through its phases and the sun shifting
     its position with the seasons.



     BRANCHES - CLOSE SHOT - (ANIMATION)                    85

     Leaves grow quickly.  Flowers appear and turn into
     small green apples.  Growing larger, they turn red
     and fall.  The leaves gradually become amber and
     disappear.  Suddenly the bare branches are covered
     with snow for a few seconds, then again burst into
     green leaves and blossoms.



     EXT. DISTANT HILLSIDE - FULL SHOT - (ANIMATION)        86

     Through the window we see the trees grow and
     change like puffs of vapor -- now brown, now
     green; they spread, shiver and pass away.  Snow
     flashes across the country, vanishes and is
     followed by the brief bright green of Spring.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Thirteen years had passed...fourteen...
               fifteen...sixteen...and then...

     Gradually soot, dirt and grime has built up on the
     windows from the outside and darkness prevails.

               I stopped.

     The flickering of passing days and nights slows and
     the HUMMING SOUND GRADUALLY DIMINISHES.  The dial

     The CAMERA PULLS BACK as he steps out of his Machine
     and glances with astonishment around the interior
     of the laboratory.  The once clear windows are now
     dirty and boarded up.  The world outside is
     completely obscured from view.  Only faint light
     penetrating cracks indicates that it is day out-
     doors.  He crosses to the door.  Dust falls as he
     opens it and enters the corridor.



     INT. LIBRARY                                           90

     The dim light and the protective sheets covering
     the furnishings previously seen, lend the room a
     ghostly appearance.  Tilted paintings reveal
     faded spots on the walls and the dust is inches
     thick here, as well as in the dining room seen
     in the b.g.  Cobwebs are everywhere.

     The floor SQUEAKS on every footfall as the Time
     Traveller, coming down the steps from the
     corridor, enters the room and looks about.



     THE SHELVES - TIME TRAVELLER'S P.O.V.                  91

     Among his books still rest the clocks, his once
     prized possessions.  There is NO TICKING now.
     The hands of the clocks, each pair indicating a
     different time, seem to guard the past.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                  92

     Curiosity takes the Time Traveller from the
     library, through the ENTRANCE HALL, to the front
     door.  It refuses to respond to his attempt to
     open it.  Even when he uses his shoulder it does
     not budge.  He steps back and flings his full
     weight against it and with a WRENCHING SOUND it
     gives slightly.  Under continued pressure the
     nailed boards outside give way and a flood of
     daylight illuminates the dusty interior.  The
     Time Traveller moves into the open driveway that
     is now taken over by weeds.



     EXT. COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - DAY                         93

     The Time Traveller takes a deep breath and looks
     curiously around.  Everything is overgrown with
     vines and flowers.  The house is boarded up.  He
     starts to wander around, thinking, investigating.

     (NOTE:  The house is situated upon a site with
             distinctive landmarks that will stay
             recognizable during his journey into
             the future, thereby giving a clear
             conception that time-travelling does
             not involve geographical movement.
             For instance, the sharp curve of the
             River Thames in the distance will
             remain even after the house itself
             has disappeared.)

     Suddenly the SOUND OF AN APPROACHING ENGINE
     catches his attention.  He looks puzzled toward:



     EXT. ROAD - LONG SHOT - (DAY)                          95

     Coming up the hill on a narrow dusty road is a
     car of 1916 vintage, with the HORN HONKING.  The
     CAMERA PANS with it, up to a SMALL STORE across
     the street.  The sign above the entrance reads:
     "Filby's Department Store".  A MANNEQUIN,
     dressed for the period, is in the window.  The
     driver, in the uniform of a Second Lieutenant of
     the First World War, steps out of the car.  The
     Time Traveller walks over to see his old friend,
     sans moustache.



     TWO SHOT                                               96

                         TIME TRAVELLER (glibly)
               Going to a masquerade, David?  You
               look rather silly without your
               moustache, old man!

                         FILBY (puzzled)
               Were you addressing me, sir?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (positively)
               Filby!  I expected more of an
               enthusiastic greeting from...

                         FILBY (smiles as he
                    interrupts)
               I'm afraid you have me confused
               with my father, sir.  There was a
               remarkable resemblance. - I'm
               James Filby.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Was?

                         JAMES FILBY
               Were you a friend of father's?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Yes...yes...I've been away.

                         JAMES FILBY
               He was killed in the war...a year
               ago.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (aghast)
               No!...it can't be...
                    (then, as he realizes its
                    truth)
               I'm sorry to hear that.
                    (pause, then hesitantly
                    points)
               And the gentleman who used to live
               across the street?

                         JAMES FILBY
               Oh, him.  Some inventor who
               disappeared around the turn of the
               century. - If you're interested in
               that house, forget it.  You can't
               buy it or even go inside.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Why is that?

                         JAMES FILBY
               My father was executor of the
               inventor's estate and he refused to
               liquidate it.
                    (adds with a smile)
               I often chided him on that account,
               but he felt positive that the owner
               would return some day. - Some people
               hereabouts think it's haunted.
                    (stares at Time Traveller
                    curiously, studying the
                    strange cut of his clothes)
               Who are you, sir?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Just a stranger who once knew your
               father.

                         JAMES FILBY
               I see.
                    (still curious at the Time
                    Traveller's abstract attitude)
               Have you been at the front, sir?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Front?  What front?

                         JAMES FILBY
               Why the war, of course.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What war?

                         JAMES FILBY
               Great heavens, man, don't you know
               we've been at war with Germany
               since nineteen fourteen?  I thought
               perhaps you had seen action in
               France...or maybe...
                    (noticing confusion, adds
                    with a note of compassion)
               Perhaps a cup of tea would make
               you feel better.  Won't you come in?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               No...no, thank you.

                         JAMES FILBY
               You're sure you're alright, sir?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Yes, I'm quite alright.

                         JAMES FILBY (hesitantly)
               Then...goodbye, sir.

     The Time Traveller nods and James Filby slowly
     turns and, glancing back repeatedly, enters the
     Department Store.

     He speaks almost to himself.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Goodbye, Jaime.

     With the bitter taste of death for his old
     friend, David Filby, he slowly walks across the
     street and returns to the cottage.



     INT. LABORATORY - FULL SHOT                            98

     The Time Traveller approaches the Machine, steps
     up into the seat, throws his head back and grimly
     shoves the lever forward.



     SKYLIGHT - FULL SEOT - (STOCK AND ANIMATION)           99

     ACCENT on MUSIC, then as the HUMMING OF THE TIME
     MACHINE takes over, suddenly panes of GLASS BREAK
     one after another, giving a clear view of a sky
     full of SWIRLIING TURBULENT CLOUDS.

     The FLICKERS of days and nights, as well as the
     HUMMING, INCREASES and DECREASES, in accordance
     with his manipulation of the controls.  Over this:

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               As I went along, I gained experience
               in handling the Machine.  I found
               that I could stop for a day, an hour,
               or even for a second to observe, then
               go ahead for a year or two. - Thus I
               was able to see the changing world
               in a series of glimpses.

     Something catches his interest.  He pulls back
     the lever to SLOW DOWN.



     EXT. STREET - FULL SHOT - (NIGHT) - (STOP MOTION)      101

     With the speed of wind, pedestrians streak across
     the pavement.  The bright lights of the night pop
     out one after another leaving a sparingly
     illuminated street.  The HUMMING SUBSIDES.  The
     mannequin previously seen in the show window now
     wears the clothing of the "Roaring Twenties".  A
     distant CLOCK STRIKES ELEVEN.

     CAMERA PANS DOWN to the hem line of her skirt,
     twelve inches from the floor.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 104

     A smile appears on his face.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               This was intriguing.  I wondered
               just how far women would permit
               this to go.

     He pushes the lever ahead.  Flashes and HUMMING
     INCREASE and we:

     As the years speed by INTERRUPTED BY SHORT BLURS,
     the dresses of the mannequin change.  The skirts
     get shorter and shorter, then drop inch by inch
     while the hair styles vary.  The bosom appears to
     swell with the sinking neckline and flattens as
     the neckline rises.  During this:

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               I began to grow fond of that
               mannequin.  Maybe because, like me,
               she didn't age.

     EXPLOSIONS in a strangely ACCELERATED manner.
     He looks down at the instruments.



     INSERT OF DIALS                                        107

     He stares at the dials with much concern as he
     is PITCHED back and forth in his Machine.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Suddenly, in nineteen forty I began
               to be buffeted from side to side.
               My first thought was that the Machine
               had a mechanical defect or a part
               had worn out.

     The Time Traveller HEARS the SCREAMS of DIVING
     PLANES.  He stops the Machine and looks up at:



     SKYLIGHT - MED. SHOT - (NIGHT) - (STOCK)               109

     Through the panes of broken glass we see a clear
     but limited glimpse of the night sky that is
     swept by beams of searching lights.

     ANTI-AIRCRAFT batteries are FIRING as a squadron
     of Nazi fighter planes are caught in the criss-
     cross beams of light.  The sky is pierced with
     ack ack.  Then, following the sound OF APPROACHING RAF.
     FIGHTER PLANES, a dog fight ensues.  Several of the
     planes are hit and plummet earthward, balls of
     streaking flame and fire.

     Gazing up at the grim spectacle.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               The last time I had stopped was in
               nineteen seventeen, twenty three years
               ago.  And the war with Germany was
               still waging - now in the air with
               flying machines.  It didn't seem
               possible they could go on fighting
               all these years and still have the
               means of fighting.  Then I realized
               the truth of the matter.  This was a
               new war.  There must have been an
               interval of peace in between these
               wars.  Yet they had learned nothing
               but to prepare even more effective
               means of destroying one another.  I
               decided to push on into time and see
               the outcome.

     He looks down at:

     The dials spin from 1940 to 1959 where the HUMMING
     NOISE SUBSIDES and the dials again come to a stop.

               The fighting in the sky lasted only
               a few moments.  By nineteen forty five
               it was over, but I continued on a
               few more years before pausing for
               another glimpse of my silent, never
               aging friend.

               It vas reassuring to find that she
               hadn't changed.  Only her costume.
               Provocative to say the least.  I
               wondered what she would look like
               ten years hence.

     and so on until it finally STOPS on 1966.

     EXT. STREET IN 1966 - LONG SHOT - (DAY)                117

     People are racing along the sidewalk.  The SOUND
     OF MORE DEEP-THROATED SIRENS from all directions
     comes over.  Drivers leave their cars of the period
     in disorder.

     The running is purposive, however.  All are entering
     particular buildings or, like those closest to the
     Time Traveller, are descending a stairway from the
     sidewalk down below street level.  Some glance sky-
     ward.

     A LITTLE GIRL picks up the doll she has dropped
     as her FATHER returns from the shelter.  He gathers
     her up in his arms and rushes back to safety.

     In a few seconds the streets are deserted.

     The Time Traveller gets out and looks around,
     confused.

               At first I wondered if my Machine and
               I were the cause of the panic.  I was
               to soon find out we weren't.

     He starts off toward the sidewalk, the CAMERA
     MOVING with him.  At the descending subway stair-
     way he stops and peers downward, but sees no one
     below.  Meanwhile, through a loudspeaker o.s.,
     a melodious SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA is heard softly,
     until a BURST OF CHORDS attracts the Time Traveller's
     attention.

     led by one of the popular conductors of tomorrow.
     The CAMERA SWINGS to the modern ENTRANCE of FILBY'S
     DEPARTMENT STORE just as the Time Traveller reaches
     the two broad glass doors.  As he steps forward he
     intercepts the rays of electronic eyes and the doors
     fly wide open.

     He stops startled, looking about to see who opened
     them.  Seeing no one, he starts slowly forward.

     From the TV set BLARES MUSIC that gradually becomes
     the UNDERSCORE for the SCENE.  The Time Traveller
     enters and turns his attention to other products
     of tomorrow -- refrigerators, vacuum cleaners,
     reducing belts, etc.  As his keen mind grasps the
     significance of each, he smiles with approval, proud
     of his fellow man.  His delight increases until he
     is interrupted by APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS.  He looks
     off.

     plastic suit.  He also wears an armband and a white
     crash helmet, both bearing the insignia of "Civilian
     Defense."  MUMBLES are heard from beneath his mask
     as the CAMERA PANS him to the Time Traveller.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (shakes his head)
               I can't understand you.

     The warden takes off his helmet.  He is David
     Filby's son, James, whom we saw in 1917 as a young
     man.  He is now in his mid-sixties.

                         WARDEN
                    (looking at helmet)
               Confounded radio in this thing.
               Makes more noise than it does sense.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (recognizing him)
               Filby!

                         WARDEN
               My name is Mister Filby. - Didn't
               you hear the air raid siren?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You mean that horrible screeching?

                         WARDEN
               It wasn't constructed for its
               aesthetic values, you know, but to
               warn silly young fools like yourself
               to get down into the shelter.  Now
               go on.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               But I'm perfectly comfortable and
               I find your store magnificent.  What
               splendid achievements, what gigantic
               strides mankind has taken, what...

                         WARDEN
                    (interrupting)
               Come on, young man.  We'd better be
               going before the mushrooms start
               sprouting.
                    (looks at Time Traveller
                    with renewed interest)
               You do look familiar.  Haven't
               we met somewhere before?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Indeed we have.  Right here.  Many
               years ago.

                         WARDEN
               I was sure of that, but the exact
               time escapes me.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               It was two wars ago, I believe.
               Nineteen seventeen.

                         WARDEN (awed)
               Why now I recall.  The chap who
               inquired about my father -- and
               the house that used to be across
               the way.
                    (stops and stares at
                    the Time Traveller)
               But no...that's impossible.  You
               haven't changed.  You're not a day
               older.  And your clothes...

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I'm afraid it's going to take me
               a little time to explain... You see...

     There is an insistent, EAR PIECING SIREN.  It
     lasts for three seconds.

                         WARDEN
               The last alert...hurry!

     He grabs the Time Traveller by the arm and drags
     him out.



     ON THE STREET - FULL SHOT                              122

     They emerge from the store.  The Time Traveller
     pulls himself free.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Listen to me!  It's important.

                         WARDEN (points to sky)
               Look!  An atomic satellite zeroing
               in!  That's important!!

     The Warden runs, looks back over shoulder, calling.

                         WARDEN
               Hurry!  Hide 'til the All Clear!

     He descends into the air raid shelter.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                  123

     He looks puzzled.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               All clear?
                    (yells)
               I've got to talk to you.

     The Time Traveller looks up as he hears the
     APPROACHING SIRENS OF AN AMBULANCE.  Alarmed,
     he runs across the street directly in the path
     of the ambulance that threads its way between the
     cars left in disorder on the road.  The driver
     spins the steering wheel and the ambulance tilts
     crazily in trying to avoid the Time Traveller.
     Suddenly there is a BLINDING FLASH.  He stops and
     looks startled.



     VIEW THROUGH THE STREETS - LONG SHOT - (STOCK,         124
     MINIATURE, SPLIT)

     A SATELLITE travels over the city in the distance.
     The flash is followed by an EXPLOSION and a giant
     cobalt mushroom begins to rise over the horizon.



     BACK TO SCENE                                          125

     As the Time Traveller tries again to rush toward
     his Machine, the shockwaves reach him and throw him
     to the ground.  He looks back, desperately.



     THE CITY - LONG SHOT - (MINIATURE)                     126

     Through the thick cloud of smoke and dust we see
     the once proud city of the future in ruins.  Only
     a single, large structure in the f.g. remains stand-
     ing for a moment, then it also collapses in an instant.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               The labor of centuries gone in an
               instant.

     The ground shudders with an OMINOUS sound and sudden
     a great rent appears in the wide street ahead, as
     though the earth were being torn apart.  It zig-zags
     down the street and from the widening fissure clouds
     of smoke and steam rise.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               But then Mother Earth, aroused by man's
               violence, responded with volcanic
               violence or her own!



     CHASM IN THE GROUND - (STOCK)                          127

     The smoke and steam give way to a spluttering of
     red hot lava which swells slowly at first in a
     rising tide and then spilling over begins to
     EXPLODE into the air.



     BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 128

     The Time Machine is shaken violently, but the
     Time Traveller manages to crawl into it.



     THE THAMES - LONG SHOT - (STOCK)                       129

     As the river spills over its bed and turns into
     another direction.



     THE STREETS - (STOCK, MINIATURE, SPLIT)                130

     With red hot lava swirling around the bases of the
     remaining buildings.  The lower parts of the struct-
     ures in the f.g. dissolve into smoke and flame and
     the upper parts come tumbling down into the rising
     red flood.  Then the incoming rush of the river
     meets the flowing tide of lava.  The two opposite
     elements, molten rock and cold green water, dwarf
     the ruined city as they leap toward each other, and
     meet with explosive fury.  The air is rent with the
     SINGING HISS of water and the CRACKLING of cooling
     rock.  Steam whitens the sky.



     THE TIME MACHINE - LONG SHOT - (STOCK) - (PROCESS)     131

     Out of the tumult a flow of red hot lava turns
     aside and leaps directly toward the Time Machine.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Then I saw my own danger.  I too was
               to be engulfed!

     As he sees his great peril.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               But to go back was unthinkable.

     He jams the lever forward to its furthest position.
     The HUMMING SOARS TO A VERY HIGH PITCH.



     THE ENCROACHING LAVA - (STOCK)                         133

     It has been approaching with the speed of a torrent,
     but now it literally leaps forward in a blinding
     red haze that engulfs the entire scene.



     THE TIME MACHINE - MED. SHOT                           134

     The interior of the Machine is permeated with a dull
     red glow which seems to flow like mist all about the
     Time Traveller.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Only my speed through time saved me
               from being roasted alive and encased
               in stone forever.



     INSERT OF DIALS                                        135

     They are spinning too fast to distinguish anything
     in the gradually fading red glow.



     EXTREME CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                        136

     His face is bathed in sweat.  His eyes search the
     growing darkness.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               The molten rock cooled.
                    (he closes his burning
                    eyes as the last of the
                    light vanishes)
               I prayed...wondering how many centuries,
               how many eons must pass before the wind
               and rain could wear away the mountain
               that enclosed me.

     In the pitch darkness there are only the sounds of
     the HUMMING TIME MACHINE and the SLOW LABORED
     BREATHING of the Time Traveller.

     Then a match flickers.  The CAMERA SCARES BACK.  The
     Time Traveller holds up a burning matchstick, his
     face glistening with perspiration as he leans forward
     to look at the dials.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
                    (whispering)
               Darkness...darkness for centuries.



     INSERT OF DIALS                                        137

     They roll very fast.  We can distinguish only the
     passing of years -- 70,000...80,000...90,000...
     100,000.  Then the matchlight flickers and goes
     out leaving only the dial's own faint glow.



     BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 138

     Once again there is darkness and the MONOTONOUS HUM
     of the Time Machine.  He breathes heavily and tries
     to calm himself.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               I wondered if there was still war
               being waged on the ground above me...
               if man would still exist on earth,
               when I saw the sun again.

     As he speaks, the Time Machine goes faster and faster.
     HIGH PITCHED HUMMING INCREASES.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               The centuries rolled by. - I put
               my trust in time and waited for
               the rock to wear down around me.

     A white light from above begins to permeate the dark-
     ness.  The Time Traveller looks up, his face showing
     immense relief.



     WHAT HE SEES - (ANIMATION)                             139

     Rocks deteriorate and a bright blue sky bursts into
     view.  ACCENT ON MUSIC.



     EXT. TIME MACHINE AND GROUND NEARBY - LONG SHOT        140
     (SPLIT, ANIMATION)

     Everything is a blur except the Time Machine with its
     passenger.  The black rock on the surface slowly melts
     away and the flickering sunlight returns.  The Machine
     is now finally entirely above ground, the only distinct
     object in the whirling transparent landscape.



     EXT. TIME TRAVELLER - CLOSE SHOT                       141

     As he smiles gratefully up at the sky.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               I was free again!

     He looks o.s.



     INDISTINCT COUNTRYSIDE - LONG SHOT - (ANIMATION)       142

     There is an impression of several great buildings
     set wide apart by green landscape -- a landscape
     which no longer changes color even though trees
     spring up like plumes of green smoke.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Thousands of centuries passed, but
               the earth stayed green!  There was
               no winter!  No wars! - Had man finally
               learned to control both the elements
               and themselves? - I had to stop and
               find out.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             143

     As he eagerly pulls hard on the lever, the HUMMING
     DECREASES and the dial freezes on:  "23 November
     802,701".  THERE IS A CRASH LIKE THUNDER and the
     Time Machine suddenly goes into a spin.  The CAMERA
     ZOOMS BACK TO A FULL HIGH SHOT as the machine keels
     over.  The friction caused by the intrusion creates
     a pitiless HAIL, and we

                                    SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO:



     EXT. TIME TRAVELLER - CLOSE SHOT - (DAY)               144

     Thick mist eddies about his face, undulating
     dreamily, revealing enough to see that he is
     unconscious.  Blood seeps from a gash across his
     forehead.  He dazedly opens his eyes to find that
     he is gazing across the dewey, green turf.  Then
     he looks up.



     EXT. THE SPHINX - FULL SHOT - LOW ANGLE - (MATTE)      145

     The vapor rises like a curtain to disclose a great
     bronze pedestal, green with verdigris, whereon
     clawed feet support the white marble figure of an
     immense Sphinx.  The figure has the face of a
     woman, the body of a huge cat and the tail of a
     serpent.  A weeping birch tree barely touches its
     outspread wings.



     THE TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                         146

     He shakes the cobwebs out of his head and, FOLLOWED
     BY THE CAMERA, rises with difficulty.  Still half-
     dazed he presses a handkerchief to his temple, as
     he loosens his collar, then reaches into the Machine,
     pockets the lever and surveys his surroundings.



     LANDSCAPE - LONG SHOT - (MATTE)                        147

     It looks like a garden untended for centuries.  The
     trees and shrubs are laden with strange blossoms or
     exotic fruits.

     In the distance there is a building that might once
     have been a temple.  Vines mat the ancient walls,
     seemingly holding them together.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 148

     He smiles.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (to himself)
               At last I've found a Paradise.

     He starts off toward the building WHISTLING his
     favorite tune, "The Land Of The Leal".  The CAMERA
     ACCOMPANIES him as he looks about with interest.



     WHAT HE SEES - MOVING SHOT                             149

     Strange, exotic fruits bend the branches of the
     TREES, some purplish and gourd-shaped, others
     suggesting giant raspberries, mangoes, etc.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Nature tamed completely and more
               bountiful than ever before.



     VARIETY OF FLOWERS - MOVING SHOT                       150

     The CAMERA PANS under boughs laden with orchids and
     a multitude of other gorgeous blossoms.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Flowers everywhere...the whole landscape
               one vast garden with no sign of weeds or
               briars.



     EXT. ENTRANCE TO GREAT BUILDING - LONG SHOT - (DAY)    151

     The Time Traveller pauses and looks up at the building.



     ACROSS FACADE - PAN DOWN - (MINIATURE?)                152

     Vines creep up the crevices.  The ornamental stone
     work, while rich in detail, is weathered and
     broken with age.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
                    (surprised)
               Unrepaired for centuries!  Maybe
               unlived in for as long.
                    (then)
               It would be no Paradise if it
               belonged to me alone.



     INT. ENTRANCE - MED. SHOT                              153

     Shooting through the ARCHWAY we see the Time
     Traveller mount the steps and enter the building.



     INT. THE GREAT HALL - FULL SHOT - (MATTE) - (DAY)      154

     In the background across the hall, the Time Traveller
     halts.  He is dwarfed by the height of the vaulted
     ceiling.  Although ancient in appearance, everything
     is ultra modern in design.  Sunlight streams through
     windows where half the panes of stained glass are
     broken.  Faded curtains droop in dusty folds along
     the walls, and at random about the floor are low
     tables, some heavily fractured, loaded with bowls
     of fruit.

     His FOOTSTEPS ECHO through the great hall as the
     Time Traveller crosses to:



     A TABLE - MED. SHOT                                    155

     The Time Traveller glances down at the spread of
     exotic fruit.  Everything looks fresh and clean as
     though newly prepared.  Yet there is no indication
     of life or sound, either human or animal.  The air
     hangs in a deathlike stillness.  Slowly the Time
     Traveller turns and looks around the walls, his
     eyes searching, scrutinizing for some clue to
     this strange place.  There is none.

     Then he picks up an empty marble plate and POUNDS
     with it on the top of the table.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (shouting)
               Anyone here?

     But an ECHO is his only answer.  Curiously he re-
     traces his steps and leaves the great hall.



     EXT. LANDSCAPE - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                     156

     Pick up the Time Traveller as he walks slowly along.
     Every sense he possesses is on the alert.  His eyes
     probe every bush and tree and object that could
     possibly conceal some person or thing.



     SERIES OF SHOTS                                        157-161

     As the Time Traveller takes this long, slow walk,
     INTERCUT INSERTS of the various innocent objects
     he looks at with CLOSEUPS of Time Traveller as he
     reacts to the bewildering SILENCE and lack of life
     or movement.

     The continued stretch of emptiness builds up a wave
     of apprehension in the Time Traveller which grows
     as he moves along.  The apprehension mounts into
     tension and gradually but inevitably approaches
     the state of horror that a human being would
     experience in a strange place where he had just
     come from an innocent freshly set table of ripe
     fruits and stepped outside into a beautiful but
     weird vacuum.



     EXT. WOODED AREA - LONG SHOT                           162

     As the Time Traveller reaches the edge of the trees,
     he hesitates, then moves into the forest.



     SERIES OF SHOTS                                        163-166

     The trees are thick and deep shadows cut patches of
     darkness through the bright sunlight which struggles
     to penetrate the maze.  The Time Traveller walks
     with continued wariness through the trees, glancing
     from left to right and occasionally stopping dead
     still and quickly darting a glance behind him at
     what he imagines to be some sound of movement.
     But all this is imaginary on his part.  There is
     nothing that moves or makes a sound in this forest.

     Suddenly he stops as he distinctly hears a familar
     and quite HUMAN combination of NOISES.  The SOUND
     SPLASHING WATER and LAUGHTER.  He hurries to some
     dense foliage where he stops to cautiously peer out.



     EXT. THE POOL - LONG SHOT - (DAY)                      167

     The Time Traveller's VIEW is partially obscured by
     the leaves.  At considerable distance upstream, the
     PEOPLE OF THE FUTURE are swimming in a natural pool
     and sunning themselves on a beach of white sand.
     They are small, but delicately formed.  Their grace
     and beauty fits perfectly into this splendid new
     world.  The spot is also extremely lovely, surrounded
     by fern trees, and with the water plunging into it
     from a high waterfall.  Below the pool the stream
     emerges in a swift torrent.



     ANOTHER, CLOSER SHOT                                   168

     A beautiful GIRL, dressed in a silken robe of white
     and gold, starts running.  As she runs, she loosens
     her robe which drifts to the sand and she dives deep
     into the crystal water.

     He smiles philosophically and leans back against a
     tree trunk, watching the distant swimmers, reassured.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (musingly,
                    to himself)
               So this is man's future...



     GROUP SHOT                                             170

     The people, apparently without any cares of the
     world, play, romp and swim.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (o.s.)
               ...to bask in the sunlight, bathe in
               the clear streams and eat the fruits
               of earth with all knowledge of work
               and hardship forgotten.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 171

     He pauses, thinking back on what he has just said.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Well, and why not?

     Suddenly a SHRILL SCREAM COMES OVER from the pool.
     He turns.



     THE POOL - LONG SHOT                                   172

     The Girl has swum out too far and is caught by the
     swift torrent.  She CRIES OUT PITEOUSLY.

     The other people turn their heads toward her, but
     make no move to help.



     CLOSE ON GIRL                                          173

     She has caught a ledge of rock and clings.  Two
     little men, their bare feet dangling in the water,
     sit nearby but ignore the Girl's plight.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           174

     He jumps out from the foliage, rushes to the bank,
     points toward the Girl and tries to attract the
     attention of those near her on the bank.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Help her!...

     No one moves.  He runs toward the ledge.



     BACK TO THE GIRL                                       175

     Her grasp on the ledge grows weaker.  She is at
     the point of letting go.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           176

     Reaching the ledge, he pushes past the people nearby
     and grasps the Girl's wrist just as her fingers
     slip.  Quickly, he pulls her out of the river's
     turbulent current and lifts her up in his arms.



     GIRL - EXTREME CLOSE UP                                177

     Looking up at the Time Traveller bewildered, she
     shows neither fear nor gratitude.



     TIME TRAVELLER - EXTREME CLOSE UP                      178

     Gazing back at the Girl thoroughly puzzled.  He
     turns and glances down at the two little people
     on the ledge.



     CLOSE TWO SHOT                                         179

     These two men will later be known as the YOUNG MAN
     and the MAN IN WHITE.  They return the Time Travel-
     ler's look of scorn with pleasant smiles as if they
     do not know the meaning of a mean look.



     TIME TRAVELLER & GIRL - EXTREME CLOSE, MOVING SHOT     180

     Trying to avoid looking at the dripping, robeless
     Girl - after all he is a Victorian - he carries her
     to the safety of the bank and sets her down on the
     sandy beach beneath the trees.  The CAMERA FOLLOWS
     him as he straightens, then quickly takes off his
     jacket and throws it around her.

     He looks at her for the first time sees the almost
     ultimate in feminine beauty.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Are you all right?



     TIME TRAVELLER & GIRL - FULL SHOT                      181

     Wearing his velvet jacket very appealingly, she
     calmly rises, turns and, without a word, walks
     away.  The Time Traveller stares after her in
     astonishment.

     The disconcerned people, now all dressed in multi-
     colored robes, are leaving the pool.  They walk
     past the Time Traveller as though he was a part of
     the scenery, merely adding to his confusion.

     EXT. ENTRANCE TO THE GREAT BUILDING - (SUNSET)         183

     Shooting toward the ARCHWAY.  The sun is sinking as
     the last stragglers of the little people enter the
     great hall.  The Time Traveller slowly follows them.
     He pauses on the steps to see if any will turn back
     to either welcome him or resent his intrusion, but
     they move on with lack of interest, completely.  He
     sits down on the steps, thoroughly perplexed at this
     utter indifference.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             184

     Seated on the steps leaning against a column.  He
     senses another's presence, looks about, sees no one,
     then turns to glance over his shoulder.  The Girl, now
     wearing her robe and holding his jacket over her arm,
     appears from behind the column.  He looks at her and
     smiles reassuringly, but makes no move toward her. -
     She comes closer, then sits on the step above him and
     returns his jacket.  While he slowly slips it on,
     she slides down a step to sit alongside him.

                         THE GIRL
               Why did you?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Why did I what?

                         THE GIRL
               Come after me.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (ironic)
               I did it to save your life, young
               lady, which I'm afraid doesn't hold
               much meaning for you or anyone else.

                         THE GIRL (simply)
               It doesn't.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Must have been fifty of your friends
               watching you drown.  Not one of
               them so much as lifted a finger. -
                    (shakes his head)
               A curious attitude - in a curious
               world.
                    (a pause, then a
                    smile)
               Aren't you the least bit interested
               in what I am...where I come from?

                         THE GIRL (innocently)
               Should I be?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (smiles)
               Perhaps you'd better take me to
               someone a bit older I can talk to.

                         THE GIRL
               There is no one older.

     The Time Traveller is suddenly struck by the truth
     of her words.  All of the little people seem to be
     of the Girl's age or younger.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Doesn't anyone age in this land
               of yours?

     The Girl makes no reply.  Instead she gazes off at the
     sun which is low in the heavens.  Shadows have already
     fallen over the distant hills.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What's your name?

                         THE GIRL
               Weena.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               How do you spell that?

                         WEENA
               Spell?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Write!  - Can't you write?  Look!

     He bends over, picks up a stick and starts to draw
     on the ground.



     INSERT: DUST                                           185

     As the stick writes out: " W E E N A "



     BACK TO SCENE                                          186

     She shows little interest.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               And what are your people called?

                         WEENA (as if he ought to know)
               Eloi.



     INSERT OF DUST                                         187

     The stick now writes in the dust: " E L O I "



     BACK TO SCENE                                          188

     A shadow crosses her face.  Suddenly she springs
     to her feet, concerned.

                         WEENA
               Come.  We must go in.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (rising)
               Why?  What's wrong?

                         WEENA (anxiously)
               It is getting dark.

     She grabs his hand and pulls him toward:



     INT. THE GREAT HALL - LONG SHOT - (MATTE?) - (DAY)     189

     Crowded now.  The people of the future are sitting
     on cushions around the tables, having their evening
     meal.  The glowing orange light of the setting sun
     pierces the broken windows, lending a curious at-
     mosphere to the place.  No one pays attention to
     Weena or to the Time Traveller as they enter in the
     b.g.



     AT THE MAIN TABLE - MED. SHOT                          190

     A score of attractive young men and young women are
     enjoying their dinner.  There is a general atmos-
     phere of bubbling good humor.  They don't even look
     up as Weena and the Time Traveller sit down at the
     table.  She hands him an orange-sized raspberry.  He
     takes it, looks at the Young Man and the Man in White
     who sit across the table from him and tries to engage
     them in conversation.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (directed to
                    Young Man, but meant for the
                    entire group)
               I don't mind telling you, I'm quite
               hungry.  I've come a long, long way.

     Looks around for some kind of a reaction.  There is
     none.

     He bites into the fruit.  It's good.  While he is

     subject.

               In my time a berry this size would
               have made news in every civilized
               country.

     There is no reaction, so he addresses the Young Man
     again.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Sir, perhaps curiosity has died.
               Perhaps even courtesy has died, but
               I have come a long way and there are
               things I would like to know.

                         YOUNG MAN (considers a
                    moment, then)
               Why?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Because I shall return to my time
               and they will ask questions such as
               what kind of government rules your
               world.

                         MAN IN WHITE
               We have no government.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (speaking
                    as though to a child)
               You must have a body of men who pass
               and enforce laws.

                         MAN IN WHITE
               There are no laws.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (taken aback,
                    then)
               How do you get your food and clothing?

     The Man in White looks at the Young Man beside him.
     They both shrug their shoulders.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Doesn't anyone work?

                         MAN IN WHITE
               No.

                    fruit)
               Then where does this come from?

                         MAN IN WHITE
               It grows.  It always grows.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               But it must be planted, cultivated,
               nurtured...unless...
                    (with mistaken insight as he
                    observes no reaction to this
                    last query)
               Unless you have an economy so well
               organized that you can devote all your
               time to study and experimentation.
               Am I right?

                         MAN IN WHITE
               You ask many questions.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (annoyed)
               Yes!  And I'm not ashamed of it.
               That is how man has learned and
               bettered himself.  I must learn about
               you and your civilization.  You have
               books, don't you?

                         YOUNG MAN (recognizing a
                    half-forgotten word)
               Books. - Books!  Yes, we have books.

     He rises and beckons.  The Time Traveller's brow
     clears.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Books will tell me what I want to
               know.  Books will tell me all about
               you.

     He too gets up and follows the Young Man.

     The Young Man leading.  He reaches the wall and
     seizes an ancient curtain which covers it.  A
     cloud of dust rises as he tugs it aside and the
     curtain falls, almost crumbling.  Shelves and
     shelves of books are disclosed.  The books are
     old even though many of them have futuristic de-
     signs.  The bindings of once proud volumes hang in
     brown tatters.  The Time Traveller steps to the
     books.

     The realization of the true state of affairs shows
     on his face.  He is appalled.  Carefully he pulls
     a volume from the shelf.  Its binding breaks as
     he opens it and, when his hand touches the pages,
     they crumple like ashes and drift to the floor.
     He drops the book.  His voice is a shocked WHISPER.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Yes...they do tell me all about you!

     With sudden violence he slams his fist into a whole
     shelf of books.  His hand plows through them and
     the dust swirls into the air.  He turns back in
     anger.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What have you done?  Thousands of
               years of building and rebuilding
               creating and re-creating so that
               you can let it crumble to dust.

     With one hand he grabs the Young Man and shakes him.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               A million yesterdays of sensitive
               men dying for their dreams.  For
               what?  So you can swim and dance
               and play.

     He releases him and leaves.



     THE HALL - MOVING SHOT                                 195

     The Time Traveller stomps among the Eloi, hating
     them for their dissipation.

     Without emotion they watch him walk toward the
     entrance.  Only Weena jumps to her feet.  Her
     former indifference is gone.

     From the top step, the Time Traveller looks down
     at them.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I am returning to my time!  Not to
               tell of the uselessness of the
               struggle - not to tell of the
               hopeless future - but only so that
               I can die among men!

     He turns and strides toward the door.



     EXT. ENTRANCE - MED. SHOT - (DUSK)                     197

     The Time Traveller bursts out of the building.  A
     moment later Weena appears in the archway.  She
     stands there, looking after him.

     strides across.

     Coming from the distance the CAMERA PANS HIM TO
     THE EDGE OF LAWN, where he stops short, jerking
     the pipe from his mouth, his eyes wide with con-
     sternation.  He raises the torch high to see:



     EXT. THE LAWN - FULL SHOT - (NIGHT)                    200

     There is no Time Machine.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                201

     In stunned shock.



     THE PATH - FULL SHOT                                   202

     Holding his torch high, the Time Traveller hurries
     toward the bushes around the edge of the lawn
     looking for his Machine, beating the branches with
     his free hand.  After he passes one of the bushes,
     a white indistinct creature dashes out of it and
     disappears in the darkness.  Unaware of this, the
     Time Traveller stops in the mindle of the lawn
     where the Machine was last seen.

     (NOTE:  The surrounding is suggestive of the spot
             where the Time Traveller's house once stood.)

     He looks about, slowly turning in a complete circle.
     Meanwhile the CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE.  Then, sud-
     denly remembering, he digs his free hand into the
     pocket of his trouser, drawing out the lever he
     had removed and looks at it with self-assurance.
     Returning the lever to his pocket, he drops to his
     knees and by the light of his torch, scrutinizes
     the grass.



     THE GROUND - TIME TRAVELLER'S P.O.V.                   203

     The turf has been ripped in parallel grooves as
     though some heavy object had been dragged across.
     CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY FORWARD following these grooves
     and HALTS where small misshapen, half-human foot-
     prints stand out clearly in the freshly turned
     earth.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           204

     He straightens slowly, his eyes narrowed.
     Nervously he looks around, then steps on follow-
     ing the grooves.



     BACK TO THE FOOTPRINTS                                 205

     THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO FOLLOW the grooves
     straight across the lawn to the flagstones around
     the white sphinx.  There are dark scratches on the
     stones leading to the wide panel in the base of
     the pedestal.  Here the marks end.



     AT THE PEDESTAL - MED. SHOT                            206

     The Time Traveller pauses, then gives the panel an
     exploratory KNOCK.  It responds with a HOLLOW SOUND.

     The Time Traveller thrusts his torch between the
     claws of the sphinx.  With both hands now free,
     he tries unsuccessfully to push the panel either
     to right or left or up or down.  Taking a penknife
     from his pocket, he runs the blade around the panel's
     edge hunting for a secret latch.  No success.

     Then he pauses, searching for a tool, and sees a
     loosened flagstone.  He picks it up.  With this
     heavy weight he batters the panel.  At each blow
     it RESOUNDS LOUDLY, not unlike a gong.  Four times
     he strikes, and then on the fifth blow the rock
     shatters in his hands.  He stops in despair.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                207

     He senses he is under observation by an unseen
     presence.  Alarmed, he whips around then looks up
     to:



     THE SPHINX - LOW ANGLE - (MINIATURE OR MATTE)          208

     The marble face looks baleful, almost smiling in
     the torch light.



     BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 209

     He turns and peers toward:



     THE BUSHES                                             210

     In the shadows, beyond reach of the light, is a
     wide semi-circle of luminous eyes, reflecting the
     flame of the torch.



     TIME TRAVELLER - FULL SHOT                             211-213

     He grabs his torch from the pedestal and slowly
     paces toward the nearest bush.  But as he ap-
     proaches, the glowing eyes vanish in the haze,
     followed by a ghostly impression of pale,
     fleeing creatures.

     The Time Traveller halts and turns in another
     direction.  The same thing happens.

     Then he has an idea.  Bending, he beats the torch
     against the moist soil and extinguishes it.  Now
     in the darkness he straightens and waits, peering
     around until he hears a twig CRACK, then moves
     into the deep shadow of a tall bush, looking off.



     THE PATH                                               214

     Through the mist in the foliage a pale figure
     approaches slowly.  It emerges onto the lawn.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             215

     The CAMERA FOLLOWS as he leaps forward, grapples the
     other figure and bears it to earth.  For a moment
     there is a struggle and then the other figure lies
     perfectly still.  The Time Traveller rears back to
     get a look at it.



     THE FIGURE ON THE GROUND - EXTREME CLOSE SHOT          216

     It is Weena.  The moving shadow of the Time Traveller
     reveals her pale face, with closed eyes, wearing an
     expression of helpless terror.  She appears to be
     waiting for the inevitable end, but when it does
     not come, she slowly opens her eyes.  She sees the
     Time Traveller and her face records a wave of
     relief.

     The CAMERA WITHDRAWS TO TWO SHOT as the Time
     Traveller, embarrassed, helps her sit up.

                         WEENA
               I heard you pounding...I came to
               tell you...

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               How do you open that panel?

                         WEENA
               No one opens it.  Only the Morlocks.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Morlocks? - Who are the Morlocks?

     A look of fear comes into her eyes.  She drifts
     her gaze away from his, too frightened to answer.
     Gently he takes her by the shoulders and turns
     her to face him.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Why are you afraid of the Morlocks?

     Again Weena drops her eyes from him, but he cups
     his hand beneath her chin and tenderly turns her
     head back so that her eyes meet his.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Tell me.

                         WEENA
               When they call, we must go below.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Do the Morlocks live beneath the
               earth?
                    (Weena nods)
               Why must you obey their command?

                         WEENA
               They give us the food we eat, the
               clothes we wear.  We must do as
               they command.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What happens to your people when
               they go below?

                         WEENA (repressing an in-
                    voluntary shudder)
               No one knows.  No one has ever
               returned.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (smiling
                    at her warmly, reassuringly)
               It won't happen to you.

     Weena looks up at him, her fears dwindling, find-
     ing comfort in this strange being whom she cannot
     understand.  Then she glances high into the dark sky
     and the old fear returns.

                         WEENA
               It is night.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Only children are frightened by
               the dark. - But then you are a
               child, aren't you?
                    (Weena glances around
                    warily into the shadows,
                    her anxiety mounting)
               I'll build a fire.

                         WEENA (taking his
                    hand, rises)
               Let us go from here.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (getting
                    up)
               I can't, child.
                    (walking toward the sphinx)
               My Machine is inside there, I
               intend to wait here 'til morning,
               then find some way of getting
               inside.

                         WEENA (catching up)
               No, you must not.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (stops,
                    then)
               Help me gather some wood.



     THE LAWN AND THE BASE - LONG SHOT                      217

     Reluctantly she helps him collect a few twigs which
     she hands over to him.

                         WEENA
               Where are you from?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (picks
                    up dry branches)
               As a matter of fact, I'm from
               right here.
                    (gesturing)
               There's where my house stood many
               thousands of years ago.  Here - to
               that monument, was my laboratory.
               About there was my library where I
               once sat talking with friends about
               my Time Machine.

     Meanwhile, Weena has seated herself near the
     bushes in the f.g.



     CLOSE ON WEENA                                         218

     She watches every move he makes.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
                    (continuing)
               I hoped to learn a great deal.  I
               hoped to take back the knowledge,
               the advancement, mankind made...
               instead what do I find?  Vegetables!

     Meanwhile a pair of pale, hairy hands rise slowly
     from behind her.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             219

     With his back turned, he is piling up the sticks.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (continuing)
               The human race reduced to living
               vegetables!



     BACK TO WEENA                                          220

     The hairy hands grab her shoulders.  The fear
     paralyzes her.  She is unable to scream.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 221

     He is about to light a match, but finds he needs
     more wood.  Without turning he calls back to Weena.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Get me a few more twigs.

     When there is no answer he turns and looks.



     AT THE BUSHES                                          222

     Weena is gone.  The CAMERA ZIPS TO LEFT, then to
     RIGHT and finally STOPS on the limp legs of Weena
     slowly disappearing under the brush.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           223

     We hear the RUSTLING OF BRANCHES and quick DIMINISHING
     FOOTSTEPS as the CAMERA RUSHES with the Time Traveller
     toward the bush.  He helps Weena to her feet and draws
     her to the pile of dry branches.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (after calming her)
               What was it?

                         WEENA (low)
               Morlocks.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (strikes
                    match and holds it to twigs)
               This seems to keep them away.



     CLOSE ON WEENA                                         224

     She gazes into the fire, with fascination.  Slowly
     she raises her hand and reaches out to grasps the
     flame.



     TWO SHOT                                               225

     The Time Traveller grabs her hand.  It is almost
     too late.  She looks at her burned hand with more
     amazement than pain.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (while
                    examining her hand)
               What ever made you put your hand in
               the fire?

                         WEENA
               I never saw it before.

     Apparently no harm done, the Time Traveller releases
     her hand.  He shakes his head in amazement and sits
     down beside her.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (after a long silence)
               Do you know that the first thing
               which separated man from the rest
               of the mammals was his knowledge of
               fire?
                    (he looks at her)
               No, I suppose you don't.
                    (pokes at fire)
               The next great stride came with
               the discovery of the wheel.
                    (turns to her)
               Do you know what that is?
                    (she shakes her head)
               I'm sorry I was angry with your
               people.  I had no right to be.
               No more than if I had visited the
               Island of Bali in my own time.
               You were safe inside your great
               house, yet you came out into the
               night to warn me.  The one
               characteristic which distinguished
               man from the animal kingdom was the
               spirit of self sacrifice.  You have
               that quality, Girl.  I'm sure all
               of your people have it.  All it
               requires is someone to reawaken it.
               I shall try if you'll let me.  Will
               you?

                         WEENA
               I do not understand you, but I
               believe you.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               That's a good start. - Now try to
               tell me...who or what are the Morlocks?
                    (Weena looks at him blankly)
               Are they people or animals?
                    (her expression remains unchanged)
               What do you know about yourself?  The
               past?  Don't your people ever speak
               of the past?

                         WEENA
               There is no past.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Don't you ever wonder about the future?

                         WEENA
               There is no future.



     ANOTHER ANGLE                                          226

     The Time Traveller is staring into the fire stirring
     the glowing embers as he speaks slowly and with
     compassion, hoping to arouse some feeling within
     her, even though she may not grasp the meaning of
     the words.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Man's past is mainly a grim struggle
               for survival, but there have been
               moments when a few voices have spoken
               up.  These rare moments have made the
               history of man a glorious thing.  I
               refuse to believe it is dead and gone.
               We've had our dark ages before and
               this is only another of them.  All
               you need is for someone to show you
               the way out. - I'm only a tinkering
               mechanic, but there must be this
               hidden spark in one of your people.
               If I can only kindle that spark, my
               coming here will have some meaning.

     During his speech Weena has cuddled close to him,
     her cheek touching his knee.  He looks down at her
     and sees he has made a friend.  He places his hand
     gently on her hair.  She looks up, her eyes no
     longer showing fear.  Their faces are illuminated
     by the dancing flames.



     THE FIRE - CLOSE SHOT                                  227

     It CRACKLES reassuringly.

                                     SLOW DISSOLVE TO:



     EXT. WELL - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                          228

     The ring of flames from the previous scene is
     seemingly replaced by a dark, circular shaft from
     which comes the low THROBBING of some GIANT
     MACHINES, pounding, beating monotonously.  The
     CAMERA MOVES BACK to include the LANDSCAPE
     where more wells are visible in the distance,
     each surrounded by a low, porcelain wall.  Their
     roofs are shining brass-like disks.

     Across the field, from the direction of the sphinx,
     approach the Time Traveller, carrying his jacket
     over his shoulder, and a few steps behind, Weena.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               My efforts next morning to open the
               panel were fruitless.  I had to find
               another way to retrieve my Machine.

     Weena, concerned, stands back as the Time Traveller
     walks up to the well in the f.g. and peers down into:



     THE SHAFT - HIGH ANGLE                                 229

     It descends into darkness, but near the top can be
     seen handholds in an irregular pattern.  The
     THROBBING OF MACHINES is ominous.



     AT THE MOUTH OF WELL - FULL SHOT                       230

     The Time Traveller in the f.g. turns back to Weena.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Listen!
                    (pause)
               Do you hear?

                         WEENA (fearfully)
               Yes.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Machines!

                         WEENA
               No...Morlocks.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (straightening, amazed)
               You mean those animals run machines?

                         WEENA
               They are Morlocks.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (as he walks to her)
               I know, but have you seen the
               machines?



     CLOSE ON WEENA                                         231

     She shakes her head.

                         WEENA
               No, only heard of them.

     The CAMERA EASES BACK to include the Time Traveller
     as he reaches her.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Who told you?

                         WEENA
               The talking rings.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (moves closer to her)
               What sort of rings?

                         WEENA
                    (with a shrug)
               Rings that talk.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Can you show me these rings?

     Weena nods and starts off.  He follows her.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:



     INT. GREAT HALL - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                    232

     Deserted, until Weena leads the Time Traveller past
     the tables toward the shelves of crumbling books
     that the Young Man had previously shown him.

     She enters an archway and walks up a dark stone
     corridor.  He follows.



     INT. STONE CORRIDOR - MED. SHOT                        233

     Weena leading the Time Traveller up the corridor
     where it veers sharply to the right.  They disappear
     around the corner.



     INT. GREEN MUSEUM - LONG SHOT - (DAY) - (MATTE)        234

     The Time Traveller and Weena stop at the threshold of
     a huge museum-like room, all done in a greenish
     colored porcelain-like substance.  There are no
     windows, but the vaulted ceiling has a transparent
     dome where the sun's rays, changing with the course
     of day, illuminate the entire museum.  It is
     evidently a place that no one bothers to visit.



     TIME TRAVELLER & WEENA - MOVING SHOT                   235

     Their feet kick up small flurries of dust as they
     walk among exhibitions of a long bygone era still
     existent behind plastic.  Some of the cases are
     broken and their contents, exposed to the atmos-
     phere, have decayed, crumbled to dust.  We recognize
     objects and machines, some belonging to the early
     part of the twentieth century and still others take
     on the forms and shapes that the audience of today
     will recognize as contemporary.  Then they pass
     cabinets that hold objects of a time far beyond
     comprehension.

     Weena finally leads the Time Traveller to a broken
     case which contains several boxes of golden rings
     a few inches in diameter and one inch wide, lined
     with minutely spaced grooves.  He picks up the
     nearest box and examines its contents.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (picking up a ring)
               Are these the talking rings?

                         WEENA
               Yes.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               They speak?

                         WEENA
               Yes.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Of what?

                         WEENA
               Things no one here understands.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               How do you get it to talk?

     Weena takes the ring from the Time Traveller and
     lays it on a smooth topped porcelain block on its
     edge, like a coin, and spins it like a top.



     INSERT:  WHIRLING RING                                 236

     A VOICE emerges from the spinning ring as the current
     of air flows through its grooves, much like a phono-
     graph needle evokes sound as it plays through the
     surface of one of our records.

                         VOICE FROM RING
               Whomsoever chances upon these rings
               will probably hear the last recorded
               voice of civilized man.  This is the
               year four thousand eight hundred and
               twenty-nine.



     TWO SHOT                                               237

     The Time Traveller is listening in fascination and
     Weena in disinterested detachment.

                         VOICE FROM RING (cont'd)
               The war between the East and West,
               which is now in its three hundredth
               and twenty-sixth year has at last
               come to an end.  There is nothing
               left to fight with and few of us
               left to fight.  The atmosphere has
               become so polluted with deadly
               germs that it can no longer be
               breathed.  There is no place on
               this planet that is immune.  The
               last surviving factory for the
               manufacture of oxygen has been
               destroyed.  Stockpiles are rapidly
               diminishing and when they are gone,
               we must die...

     The last few WORDS DECREASE IN VOLUME and FADE AWAY.
     The Time Traveller eagerly reaches into the case for
     the second ring and spins it.

                         ANOTHER VOICE FROM RING
               This is the last day.  We, the last
               to survive, have had our final meeting.
               We have decided to split into two
               groups.  Each man and woman has made
               his own decision.  Some have chosen
               to take refuge in the great caverns
               and find a new way of life far down
               below the earth's surface.  The rest
               of us have decided to take our chances
               in the sunlight, small as those chances
               may be.

     The VOICE from the ring DWINDLES and is heard no
     more.  The Time Traveller quickly picks up the
     third and last ring and spins it.  NO WORDS are
     heard -- only the SOUND of MARCHING FOOTSTEPS over
     floors of stone -- then a deadly SILENCE.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                238

     As he watches the last ring spin to a standstill.
     Over this:

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               From the talking rings I learned how
               the human race divided itself and
               how the world of the Eloi and Morlocks
               began.

     He turns.



     GREEN MUSEUM - LONG SHOT                               239

     The Time Traveller paces across the hall.  Weena
     hurries after him.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               By some quirk of fate the Morlocks
               had become the masters and the Eloi
               their servants.  The Morlocks main-
               tained them and bred them like cattle
               only to take them below when they
               reached maturity, which explained why
               there were no older people along them.

     They exit.



     GREAT HALL - FULL SHOT                                 240

     The Time Traveller, followed by Weena, walks from
     the book shelves toward the entrance.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Now I knew I must go below.  It was
               the only means of finding a way up
               into the sphinx to reach my Machine
               and to find out what happened to the
               little people when they went below.

     They leave the Great Hall.



     EXT. LANDSCAPE - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                     241

     The Time Traveller strides toward one of the wells.
     Weena senses his intention and catches up with him
     to grasp his arm.

                         WEENA
               No...don't go...please.

     He shakes her off.



     AT MOUTH OF WELL - MED. SHOT                           242

     The Time Traveller places his jacket on the wall.
     Then into the well he drops a dry leaf which, instead
     of fluttering slowly down, is at once sucked out of
     sight by the current from the shaft.  Then he looks
     around and finds a pebble, drops it down the well and
     listens.

     After a PLOP is heard he puts his arm down the
     shaft as far as it goes, feeling its surface, then
     throws his leg over the porcelain wall and starts
     to descend.  Weena rushes to his side to stop him.

                         WEENA
               You will not come back.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I'll be back.

     Weena shakes her head and, as though giving him
     a farewell gift, thrusts a large blossom into his
     pocket.  The Time Traveller smiles as he dis-
     appears.



     FROM THROAT OF WELL - LOW ANGLE                        243

     Locking from below, the top of the well appears
     like a small blue disk with Weena peering down.
     The Time Traveller gropes his way.

     Suddenly from the far distance comes the SOUND of
     LOW but POWERFUL SIREN.  Weena straightens.



     CLOSE ON WEENA                                         244

     An expression of fear comes slowly over her face
     as the LOW SIREN is joined by ANOTHER of HIGHER
     PITCH.  The Two make a grating dissonance.  Slowly
     she turns in the direction of the sound.



     BACK WITH TIME TRAVELLER                               245

     He looks up, concerned, pausing in his descent.



     BACK TO WEENA                                          246

     As the THIRD DISCORDANT BLAST joins the other two,
     Weena's fear is gone.  In its place is an expres-
     sion of utter resignation.  Like someone in a
     trance she opens her eyes and stares straight
     ahead.  Then, as though she is summoning all her
     strength to go through some ordeal, she starts
     walking away.  The CAMERA PANS and we see the breeze
     ripple her silken robe about her as she moves.

     (NOTE:  During the above and throughout the follow-
             ing sequence the dirge-like WHISTLES
             CONTINUE, ECHOING mournfully.)



     REVERSE SHOT                                           247

     Weena is walking forward and disappears behind the
     trees as the Time Traveller emerges from the well
     in the b.g.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                248

     Looking for Weena.  She is nowhere to be seen.
     His face shows exasperation, bewilderment.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Weena!  Where are you, Girl?



     WEENA - FULL SHOT                                      249

     She continues to walk toward the source of the
     SIRENS.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           250

     The DIRGE-LIKE MELODY becomes LOUDER, pulsating,
     as he pauses to watch:



     EXT. EDGE OF FOREST - LONG SHOT - (DAY)                251

     Emerging from the forest are two Eloi, a man and
     a woman.  They are several paces apart and pay no
     attention to one another.  Both have exactly the
     same manner as Weena.  They walk along, eyes
     straight ahead, faces expressionless.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                252

     As he looks ahead, then left and right, searching.



     VARIOUS GROUPS OF ELOI - (SPLIT?)                      253-254

     In the open country now, the forest behind them.
     In their colorful robes, the Eloi march slowly
     across the green landscape.

     All are converging toward a single point somewhere
     ahead.



     WEENA AMONG ELOI                                       255

     They walk close together, paying no attention to one
     another, following the command of the MELANCHOLY
     STRAINS OF THE SIRENS.



     BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 256

     His concern has turned to apprehension as he tries
     to grasp the meaning of what he observes.



     EXT. THE SIRENS ON THE SPHINX - FULL SHOT - (DAY)      257
     (MINIATURE)

     It is the source of the sound.  There are little
     bursts of vapor from the tops of the sirens as
     they repeat their tones, like a fantastic pipe
     organ behind the Sphinx.



     TIME TRAVELLER AND ELOI                                258

     All of them walk in the same direction.  The Time
     Traveller looks this way and that, bewildered.
     But the Eloi disregard him and march straight
     ahead, eyes forward.

     The Time Traveller breaks into a run.



     TWO SHOT                                               259

     The Time Traveller overtakes the Young Man, seizes
     his arm and jerks him to a halt.  Around them pass
     the shadows of the marching Eloi.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What's happening?  Tell me!

     The Young Man shows no emotion as he struggles to
     free himself.  His movements are almost mechanical.
     This unnerves the Time Traveller.  He stares at
     him, releasing his grip.

     The moment the Young Man is free, he faces about
     and continues his march.  The Time Traveller re-
     mains motionless, watching him go.  The ECHOING
     SIRENS are now getting on his nerves.



     EXT. ENTRANCE TO THE GREAT BUILDING - LONG SHOT -      260
     (DAY)

     The Eloi pour out of the Great Hall, walking in
     a trance-like state.



     EXT. LANDSCAPE - EXTREME LONG SHOT - (DAY) - (SPLIT?)  261

     From all directions the Eloi in their bright robes
     are moving, singly and in long files.  The impres-
     sion is one of vastness -- a feeling that mankind
     is marching to some unknown doom.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           262

     He spots a girl, rushes up, grabs her from behind.
     But it is not Weena.  Disappointed, he releases
     her, then goes on again, covering his ears with
     his palms, fighting to retain command of his own
     reason.



     SEVERAL SHOTS OF THE SIRENS - (MINIATURE)              263-265

     At various angles -- up, sideways, tilted.  The
     WAILING is DEAFENING.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                266

     He still strives to control himself, moves forward,
     then pauses in amazement, looking straight ahead.



     EXT. THE SPHINX - FULL SHOT - (DAY) - (MATTE)          267

     It is toward the white sphinx that the Eloi have
     been marching.  But now the panel, upon which the
     Time Traveller had pounded so hard, is wide open,
     revealing a dark entrance into the pedestal.

     And despite their previous repugnance to the
     Sphinx, all of the people are now marching across
     the lawn resolutely to it.



     AT THE PEDESTAL - LONG SHOT                            268

     The Young Man is the first to reach it.  He enters
     the wide opening and starts descending into sub-
     terranean darkness.  Others follow, Weena among
     them.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (o.s.)
               Weena!

     Without hearing him she passes through the entrance.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           269

     He desperately pushes forward, elbowing his way
     past others in his haste to overtake Weena.  The
     crowd impedes his progress and he shoves the
     Eloi impatiently aside as he fights on.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (shouts in
                    despair)
               Weena!



     THE PANEL                                              270

     Slowly closing and the sound of the SIRENS gradually
     DIES AWAY.  The Time Traveller reaches the panel as
     it shuts tight before he can touch it.  He spreads
     his palms against it in despair, then turns to face
     those Eloi who, like him, are locked outside.  What
     he sees astonishes him.



     GROUP OF ELOI                                          271

     They no longer approach the sphinx.  The ceasing of
     the sirens seems to have released them from their
     hypnotic spell and now, awake again and frightened,
     they are retreating.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 272

     As he goes after them to the edge of the flagstones
     and calls out angrily.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Stop!



     BACK TO ELOI                                           273

     Featuring the Man in White in the f.g.  They halt
     and stare back.  The Time Traveller's voice comes
     over like a whip.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (o.s.)
               What are you running from?

     None of the Eloi answer.



     TOWARD THE SPHINX - FULL SHOT                          274

     Beyond several Eloi the Time Traveller stands in
     the shadow of the white sphinx.  He steps slowly
     forward onto the lawn, looking around the big
     semi-circle of his audience.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (sharply,
                    gesturing back toward the panel)
               Where have they gone?
                    (no answer)
               What happens to them?
                    (no answer)
               Don't stand there like a fatted
               cattle grazing contentedly in lush
               pastures. - Answer me!  What's
               wrong?

                         MAN IN WHITE (calmly)
               There is nothing wrong.  It is all
               clear.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What do you mean, all clear?

                         MAN IN WHITE (repeating)
               All clear!

                         TIME TRAVELLER (thinking
                    rapidly, talking to himself)
               Once....in the middle nineteen
               hundreds I heard a man...
                    (it bursts upon him)
               The falling bombs!
                    (to the Man in white
                    and the crowd)
               That's over.  Gone.  Dead for
               hundreds of thousand of years.
               There are no more flying machines.
               No bombs.  No wars!

                         MAN IN WHITE
               Yes, the rings have told us that
               story.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED SHOT                              275

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               But you didn't listen.  You didn't
               learn anything.  All that is left
               is fear...a blind animal fear.
               Ages ago men were taught to hide in
               the ground when the sirens blew...
               taught to run from a raining death...
               but those men are dead!  And so are
               the men who slaughtered them.  Don't
               you understand?
                    (looks around pleadingly)
               You are slaves of a dead past... You
               don't even own your souls.  You're
               led to slaughter like sheep!

                         MAN IN WHITE (o.s.)
               But there is nothing to fear now,
               it's all clear.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What about those who went below?
               How are they to come back?



     MAN IN WHITE                                           276

     He looks ominously at the Time Traveller.

                         MAN IN WHITE
               They never come back.  Nobody can
               bring them back.

     Unimpressed, the crowd begins to disperse, the Man
     in White following them.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 277

     Calling after them.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You can try.  Won't any of you
               even try?

     He sees that the situation is hopeless.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (almost
                    to himself)
               Well, someone has to try!

     He runs off.



     SERIES OF SHOTS                                        278

     The Time Traveller running through the forest.         (a)

     He is laboring up the open hillside.                   (b)

     The Eloi in a semi-circle silently watch.  A few       (c)
     of them hesitantly start after the Time Traveller.



     EXT. THE WELL - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                      279

     Arriving, the Time Traveller pauses to catch his
     breath, picks up a piece of wood that could serve
     as a torch, then jumps over the wall and starts
     to descend.

     Over this a faint THROBBING OF MACHINES can be
     heard.



     SHOOTING INTO SHAFT - HIGH ANGLE                       280

     The Time Traveller climbs down, gripping the walls
     with his hands and feet.  The depth beneath him is
     dizzying.  THROBBING LOUDER.



     IN THE WELL - FULL SHOT                                281

     As the Time Traveller descends, the CAMERA FOLLOWS
     him, step after step.  The deeper he goes, the darker
     it becomes and the THROBBING OF MACHINES INCREASES as
     well.

     Suddenly a rock gives beneath his weight.  He barely
     saves himself.  Not without fear he pauses to rest,
     glancing upward.



     FROM THE THROAT OF WELL - LOW ANGLE                    282

     A couple of the curious Eloi peer downward, watching
     the Time Traveller's progress.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 283

     A metal ladder affixed to the wall brings him finally
     to the opening of a transverse passageway.  In almost
     complete darkness he steps from the ladder into the
     tunnel and pauses to take the piece of wood from his
     belt, but decides not to light it.  He bends and peers
     ahead.



     INT. GREAT CAVERN - FULL SHOT                          283X1

     The Time Traveller emerges onto the bridge in the b.g.,
     pausing for a moment to survey the surroundings, then
     starts slowly down the staircase carved along the wall.
     The gloom is relieved only by puffing smoke and waver-
     ing lights, revealing occasionally vague shapes and
     grotesque shadows.

     (NOTE:  DRIPPING WATER from the walls and THROBBING OF
             MACHINES punctuate the desolation of this
             scene as well as the following sequence.)



     CLOSE ON T.T. - MOVING SHOT                            283X2

     Walking, he notices an opening ahead and cautiously
     moves toward:



     INT. ENTRANCE TO FEASTING ROOM - FULL SHOT             283X3

     At the threshold of this dark, silent cell the T.T.
     pauses, then slowly enters.  Behind him, across the
     cavern, an indistinct figure watches, but quickly
     disappears as the T.T. strikes a match.  The sight
     that the T.T. beholds fills him with revulsion and
     horror.



     THE FEASTING ROOM - T.T.'S P.O.V.                      283X4

     This is obviously a feasting place of the Morlocks.
     In the flickering light we see stone tables and
     scattered around the floor far below the unmistak-
     able remains of human bones after the flesh has been
     carnivorously picked away.

                         T.T.'S VOICE
               So, this was the destiny of the
               Eloi.



     CLOSE ON T.T.                                          283X5

     His features twisted in horror in the flickering
     light of his match.

                         T.T.'S VOICE
                    (continuing)
               They were being bred like cattle
               by the Morlocks who had degenerated
               into the lowest form of human
               life...cannibalism.

     The match dies between his fingers.  Suppressing a
     shudder, the T.T. turns and as he leaves this chamber
     of horror, the rock behind him comes to life.  A pale,
     spectral Morlock crosses the screen in the f.g.
     descending.  Another in the b.g. does likewise.



     MACHINES - FULL SHOT                                   283X6

     Morlocks, their indistinct bodies obscene in their
     mockery of the human form, labor endlessly tending
     the needs of their machinery.  They look up toward the
     intruder as they HEAR his APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS, then
     hide.



     STAIRWAY - MOVING SHOT                                 283X7

     The T.T. slowly descends the slender stone stairway
     that hugs the sheer wall.  Meanwhile at the base of
     the feasting room under the stairway on which the T.T.
     is moving a Morlock moves a curtain aside and reveals
     itself.  It silently watches as another Morlock
     appears at the top of the stairs and follows.

     GROUP OF ELOI                                          283X15

     Passing near the T.T.'s hiding place.  Weena and the
     Young Man are side by side.



     AT THE MACHINES                                        283X16

     The Morlocks who followed the T.T. are closing in.



     BACK TO T.T. - MOVING SHOT                             283X17

     He is unaware of the Morlocks behind him.  Hugging
     the rock, he makes his way to the closest possible
     point where he can still remain unobserved by the
     herding Morlocks and get Weena's attention.  He
     reaches out.

                         T.T.
               Weena!

     But she continues on with complete resignation to her
     fate.  Unmindful of his own safety, he leaves his hid-
     ing place and grasps her by the shoulders.

                         T.T.
                    (shaking her)
               Girl!
                    (he turns and grasps the
                    passing Young Man)
               Come to your senses!  All of you!

     As the T.T. pulls Weena toward the staircase, the
     Young Man follows.



     FOOT OF STAIRWAY                                       283X18

     Morlocks block the escape.



     THREE SHOT                                             283X19

     The CAMERA MOVES with the T.T., Weena and the Young
     Man as they are forced to retreat.



     AT ENTRANCE OF FEASTING ROOM                           283X20

     Where other Morlocks with CRACKING WHIPS herd the Eloi
     into the chamber of horrors.

     One of the Morlocks spots the T.T., Weena and the
     Young Man.  He swings his whip.



     BACK TO THREE SHOT                                     283X21

     The CAMERA MOVES with them as vicious CRACKING
     WHIPS drive them back to the entrance of the
     feasting room.



     TWO SHOT                                               283X22

     The T.T. tries to protect Weena.  Suddenly a long
     lash of a whip strikes like a serpent and coils
     about the T.T.'s neck.  He drops his unlit torch
     and whirls in pain.

     Another whip scares Weena into the chamber of
     horrors, while several other whips land on the T.T.'s
     shoulders.  Finally he grabs the whip from around
     his neck and jerks it, wrenching it free.



     AT THE ENTRANCE OF FEASTING ROOM                       283X23

     The T.T., wielding the whip fiercely, drives the
     Morlocks back several paces, then suddenly from
     above a pale body of a Morlock lands on him,
     knocking him down, causing him to drop the whip.
     On the ground the cowardly Morlock stumbles
     away leaving the T.T. a prey to the battery of
     CRACKING WHIPS.  He crawls in pain into the
     chamber of horrors.



     GROUPSHOT INSIDE FEASTING ROOM                         283X24

     The T.T. comes to his feet among the Eloi.  The
     WHIPS HAVE STOPPED, then the silence is broken by
     the GROWL of approaching MORLOCKS.  Through the
     curtains, dark shapes swarm toward them.  Then
     suddenly the T.T. pulls out his matchbox from his
     pocket.  A match flares!



     GROUP OF MORLOCKS                                      283X25

     In the glare of yellow light we see the leprous
     figures of blinded Morlocks, dropping their whips,
     shielding their eyes.



     THROUGH MORLOCKS'S EYES - (OPTICAL EFFECT)             283X26

     The T.T.'s hand with the burning match rapidly zooms
     into the center of the picture in a BLINDING FLASH
     turning the screen momentarily white, then yellow
     and red.  Then the CAMERA MOVES BACK indicating the
     Morlocks' retreat.  Slowly the normal colors
     reappear.



     BACK TO THE GROUP OF MORLOCKS                          283X27

     Regaining their sight in the darkness, they start
     to close in.



     THROUGH MORLOCKS'S EYES - (OPTICAL EFFECT)             283X28

     Followed by the Eloi the T.T. exits the feasting
     room and again lights a match.  A BLINDING FLASH
     starting from the flame as a center engulfs the screen,
     momentarily white again, then yellow, finally red.
     Once more the CAMERA RETREATS, then still seeing
     through the Morlocks' eyes the CAMERA ZOOMS CLOSE
     ON THE MATCH BOX and the scaley hand of a Morlock
     slaps all the matches except one to the floor.



     T.T. - MED. SHOT                                       283X29

     He lights his last match and moves forward, looking
     for his lost torch.



     GROUPSHOT                                              283X30

     The T.T. leads the Eloi toward the stairway, the
     light of the match his only weapon in keeping the
     Morlocks away.  Finally he spots his torch and
     picks it up hurriedly.



     CLOSE ON T.T.                                          283X31

     His face streams with sweat and is taut with appre-
     hension while he applies the dying match to the
     intended torch.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (muttering)
               Burn, will you!

     He holds the match steady, but it burns lower and
     lower without starting the wood.  In despair he
     turns to Weena.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Quick, something to burn!  It's
               my last match!



     BACK TO THE MORLOCKS                                   283X32

     As they are closing in.



     CLOSE ON WEENA                                         283X33

     With a fierce gesture she rips open the loose sleeve
     of her robe, tears off a piece of cloth and holds
     it out.



     BACK TO T.T.                                           283X34

     As match is about to die, he holds it beneath the
     cloth.  It flames up and he seizes it, dropping the
     dead match.

     He holds the burning cloth beneath the wood and
     in this hotter flame it begins to burn.  Once it
     starts he again attempts to make his way by blind-
     ing the Morlocks and leads the Eloi to the stairway.



     GROUPSHOT                                              283X35

     As the Eloi slowly make their way toward the stairway,
     one Morlock gains courage, and with his long whip
     strikes the torch out of the T.T.'s hand.



     A CORNER                                               283X36

     The torch rolls in and begins to sputter.



     BACK TO SCENE                                          283X37

     The Eloi huddle against the wall in terror as other
     Morlocks gain courage and move forward toward the
     T.T.  As they face one another, the fight begins.



     [PAGE 90 MISSING FROM HARD COPY]



     Eloi below him.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Weena!  Weena, get the torch!



     CLOSE SHOT - WEENA AND YOUNG MAN                       351X5

     Huddled against rock - React to fight - Weena
     looks quickly toward the Time Traveller, then
     turns searching for the flickering torch.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 351X6

     As he turns to fight with Morlock on ledge.
     Morlock swings at him.  He ducks and almost
     falls off ledge.  He grabs Morlock, and hangs
     on until he can scramble up on ledge again.
     He clutches at Morlock's throat, banging his
     head against the rock wall, finally throwing
     him off ledge.  At the same time another Mor-
     lock appears on ledge, while the Morlock he
     had previously kicked rises to menace him from
     the other side.  The Time Traveller jumps across
     cavern to ramp and starts down toward the floor,
     trying to get back to his torch, his only weapon
     against the Morlocks.



     CLOSE SHOT - THE TIME TRAVELLER                        351X7

     He pauses momentarily against Rock Wall.  He
     sees Eloi, still huddled in a group, apparently
     too confused to move.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Weena!  Go on!  Go on the
               steps!



     CLOSE SHOT - AT ROCK - WEENA AND YOUNG MAN             351X8

     Weena spots the still flickering torch and
     starts toward it.



     INSERT OF TORCH                                        351X9

     Lying on ground, still burning, Weena bends
     down to pick up torch, when suddenly a Morlock
     appears facing her.  She screams and jumps back,
     watching in terror, as the Morlock comes toward
     her.



     MED. SHOT                                              351X10

     The Time Traveller comes down ramp to meet several
     Morlocks converging on him.  He tries to fight his
     way past them.



     CLOSE SHOT - WEENA AND YOUNG MAN                       351X11

     Morlock rushes in, grabs Weena and carrying her
     over his shoulder starts across toward Feasting
     Cave.



     MED. SHOT - TIME TRAVELLER                             351X12

     JUMPS up on ramp, kicks back at Morlocks - sees
     Morlock carrying Weena - JUMPS through Morlocks
     and runs toward her.



     FULL SHOT                                              351X13

     The Time Traveller runs to Weena, pulls her away
     from Morlock, knocks him against rock.  In the
     meantime another Morlock runs up on rock and
     jumps at Time Traveller, knocking him down.
     The second Morlock rebounds from rock and leaps
     on the Time Traveller and starts to choke him.



     CLOSE SHOT - TIME TRAVELLER                            351X14

     Looks up toward YOUNG MAN - silently appeals for
     help.



     CLOSE SHOT - YOUNG MAN                                 351X15

     Stancing in front of group of Eloi returns the
     Time Traveller's silent plea for help.  Slowly
     raises his right hand, stares at it as he
     gradually clenches it into a fist.  Then, making
     up his mind, raises both hands and strikes Mor-
     lock hard on the back of his neck.



     MED. SHOT                                              351X16

     As Morlock relaxes his grip the Time Traveller
     kicks him back to rock, scrambles up and runs
     to get his torch.  Several Morlocks try to herd
     Eloi back into Feasting Cave, but led by the
     Young Man and his newly discovered strength, the
     Eloi resist them.  The Time Traveller runs back
     in with torch, and herd the Eloi toward stairs.



     FULL SHOT                                              351X17

     The Time Traveller urges the Eloi up the stairs
     pushing Weena ahead of him.  They climb up past
     Cauldron.  Morlocks come in after fleeing Eloi,
     shielding their eyes from the light of the Time
     Traveller's torch.



     CLOSER SHOT                                            351X18

     The Time Traveller looks ahead to be sure the
     Eloi are all on their way out.  Then turns back
     and drops his torch into the oil flowing into
     the Cauldron.



     FULL SHOT                                              351X19

     The burning torch catches the Cauldron on
     fire, which quickly spreads across the floor
     of the Cavern, to the steaming Machine on
     the right, which explodes.  The Time Traveller
     herds Eloi out across Stone Bridge.



     MED. SHOT                                              351X20

     Pursuing Morlock runs up steps in back of
     burning Cauldron hiding his face from the
     flames.  He bumps into the Pipe coming down
     the wall, loses his balance and falls into
     the burning Cauldron - Flames shoot higher.



     PAN SHOT                                               351X21

     Another Morlock comes from behind machine, as
     fire creeps across floor, almost reaches machine
     at same time as fire - and it explodes.  Morlock
     catches fire and runs across into Feasting Cave.



     PASSAGEWAY - LONG SHOT                                 352

     Smoke is thick as the Time Traveller and Weena
     run toward a circle of light on the floor far
     ahead.



     CIRCLE OF LIGHT - HIGH ANGLE                           353

     Weena and the Time Traveller reach the light
     that comes straight down from above, and look
     up the shaft.  Smoke belches from the passage-
     way as he helps her start up the ladder and
     then he, himself, follows, clambering out of
     sight.



     IN THE WELL                                            354

     The CAMERA FOLLOWS Weena and the Time Traveller
     climbing up, COUGHING from smoke.  The light
     becomes slowly brighter and he looks up.



     FROM THROAT OF WELL - LOW ANGLE                        355

     Gradually the top of the well becomes visible
     through the swirling smoke.  The Young Man is
     peering down.  He reaches to help Weena and the
     Time Traveller.



     SHOOTING INTO SHAFT - HIGH ANGLE                       356

     Weena and the Time Traveller are both dark with
     soot, near exhaustion.  Far below them red flames
     pierce through the smoke.  They each in turn grasp
     the helping hand of the Young Man and climb up out
     of the well.



     EXT. THE WELL - MED. SHOT - (SUNSET)                   357

     As their eyes meet, the Time Traveller grips the
     Young Man's shoulder and gives it a brief shake
     of approval.

     The Time Traveller then grabs up branches and twigs,
     carries them to the mouth of the well, ignites the
     pile of kindling with his torch and drops the burn-
     ing wood down in to the well.



     SHOOTING INTO SHAFT - HIGH ANGLE                       358

     The burning wood drops to the bottom where it ignites
     the oil with a burst of flame that shoots up the well.



     BACK TO SCENE                                          359

     The Time Traveller picks up his jacket and points to
     the other wells.  The Young Man first, then the rest of
     the Eloi grasp the idea.  They also light branches
     from the torch and dash for the various wells to
     duplicate the Time Traveller's action.



     VARIOUS SHOTS OF ELOI                                  360-362

     Carrying bundles of burning wood to the mouths of
     wells and dumping the fire below.



     TWO SHOT                                               363

     With Weena at his side, the Time Traveller gazes on
     with approval at the Eloi's work.



     EXT. LANDSCAPE - FULL SHOT - (SUNSET)                  364

     It is dotted with wells, each of which has been
     turned into a fiery furnace shooting flames and
     smoke up from the burning oil below, preventing
     the Morlocks from any avenue of escape to the
     surface of the Earth.



     A WELL - (MINIATURE)                                   365

     It falls with a CRASH to the ground and begins to
     spew smoke and flame into the undergrowth of the
     forest nearby.



     EXT. ENTRANCE TO GREAT BUILDING - LONG SHOT -          366
     (SUNSET)

     Smoke drifts out of its windows.  The Eloi hurry
     out, led by the Man in White.  They stop and stare
     at the sight of the Morlock world being destroyed
     below.



     EXT. THE BLAZING FOREST - (SUNSET) - (STOCK)           367-368

     The sun on the horizon is a dim red ball through
     the smoke.  Several trees fall over, blazing.  LOW
     UNDERGROUND RUMBLING is heard.



     WEENA AND THE TIME TRAVELLER                           369

     They start down the hill after the Eloi, seeking
     safety together.  Suddenly a DISTANT RUMBLE OF THE
     EARTH makes them pause and look o.s.



     EXT. LANDSCAPE - FULL SHOT - (DUSK) - (MINIATURE)      370

     Then comes a SERIES OF TREMBLORS, each more powerful
     than the one before.  The earth shudders and the
     blazing forest begins to collapse.  It does
     not explode into the air.  Rather, the solid
     earth seems to give way so that the entire
     surface of the ground begins to fall into the
     subterranean chambers.



     ANOTHER ANGLE - (MINIATURE)                            371

     A section of the earth sheers away and falls
     in an ever widening rift.



     A WELL - (MINIATURE)                                   372

     As it is swallowed by the earth, followed by a
     belch of steam.



     BACK TO LANDSCAPE - (MINIATURE)                        373

     Leveled off by the earthquake.  There are no more
     flowers, no more buildings, wells, smokestacks or
     obelisks.  There is no movement -- only the
     flickering of low flames and the smoke driven by
     the gentle breeze.



     GROUP OF ELOI                                          374

     Staring into the vast destruction.



     TIME TRAVELLER AND WEENA                               375

     He holds her hand.  The CAMERA MOVES IN SLOWLY and
     we begin to hear the

                      TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
                 (calmly)
             The underworld of the Morlocks was
             gone...and so was the life of leisure
             for the Eloi.

     He looks o.s.



     GROUP OF ELOI                                          376

     The Man in White, with others, approaches the group
     headed by the Young Man.  The two men look at each
     other, their gestures and expressions showing their
     joy at release from centuries of fear.

                      TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
             From now on they would have to work
             to survive.  And looking at their
             faces, I somehow knew that they could
             start over again.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER AND WEENA                       377

     He looks down to Weena and we HEAR:

                      TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
             Another night was coming, but this
             night no Eloi needed to fear.

     The CAMERA MOVES CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER who looks
     up in concern.

                      TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
             But what of me? - I was imprisoned
             in a world in which I did not belong.

                                  DISSOLVE TO:



     EXT. THE POOL - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT)                    378

     This is the same pool where the Time Traveller
     saved Weena's life.  The peaceful SOUND of the
     RUSHING STREAM is occasionally interrupted by a
     REMOTE RUMBLE of EXPLOSION from the earth below.

     There is no sign in the sky of old constellations,
     only the face of the full moon looks familiar.
     The Time Traveller, wearing his velvet jacket,
     relaxes on the white sand, playing with the
     blossom Weena gave him earlier that day, and
     WHISTLING "The Land Of The Leal".

     Weena sits on a large rock nearby at the edge of
     the pool, washing the soot from her face and hands.
     She glances over to the Time Traveller.

                      WEENA
             Are you sorry?

     He STOPS WHISTLING, but the MUSIC CONTINUES.
     He turns.

                      TIME TRAVELLER
             Sorry? - Sorry for what?

                      WEENA
             That you have to stay.

                      TIME TRAVELLER
                 (gazing into the night)
             Yes. - I am sorry because I could
             tell so much to the people of my
             own time... I could tell them about
             the happiness and sorrow the future
             has in store for them.  They could
             learn from it...or would they?

                      WEENA
             You don't want to stay, do you?

                      TIME TRAVELLER
             It isn't that, but I don't fit here
             anymore than you would in my time.

                      WEENA
                 (a pause, and then)
             I would like to see your time.

                      TIME TRAVELLER
             No, Girl, you wouldn't be very
             happy there.

                      WEENA
             Do you have someone like me -
             there?

                      TIME TRAVELLER
             No.  No one like you.  But there
             are friends who will miss me. - As
             a matter of fact, I'm probably late
             already.

                      WEENA
                 (stealing a glance,
                 then quietly)
             Women?

                      TIME TRAVELLER
             No, men.
                 (teasing)
             There is a woman too, of course!
                 (noticing her disappointment,
                 he relents)
             She looks after my house for me.
             She is sixty-two years old. - Much
             older than you are.

     Weena, relieved, starts to comb her wet hair
     into a new arrangement.

                      WEENA
                 (suddenly)
             How do they wear their hair?

                      TIME TRAVELLER
             Who?

                      WEENA
             The women in your time.

                      TIME TRAVELLER
                 (after a thought)
             Up!

                      WEENA
             Up? - How?

                      TIME TRAVELLER
                 (with awkward gesture)
             Like this.

                      WEENA
             Show me.

     The Time Traveller puts the flower back into his
     pocket, gets up and walks over to Weena.



     WEENA - MED. SHOT                                      379

     The Time Traveller appears behind her.  He first
     hesitates, then gently lifts her hair into a fair
     imitation of the upswept Edwardian style.  She
     smiles, then with an impulsive move turns her face
     toward him.

                      WEENA
                 (innocently)
             Would I be pretty?

     The gesture brings her eyes and lips close to his.
     He still holds her upswung hair and, as he gazes
     into her young eyes, he feels her warm breath on
     his cheek.

                      TIME TRAVELLER
                 (slowly)
             Yes...you would be.  More than
             pretty.
                 (his voice sinks to a whisper)
             I wish we could go back together,
             Weena, back to my own time...or to
             times before that when the world
             was young.  We could...

     EXCITED VOICES o.s. interrupt this interlude.  They
     both look in the direction of the voices.



     EXT. HILL - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) - (MATTE)              380

     A group of Eloi, led by the Young Man and the Man
     in White, approach them, talking excitedly,
     pointing to the ruins of the white sphinx just
     revealed by the rolling smoke.  The face is
     broken and the pedestal partly in shambles.  The
     panel is open.



     TIME TRAVELLER & WEENA                                 381

     Joyfully he grabs her hand and, pulling her,
     breaks into a run.



     GROUP OF ELOI                                          382

     The Young Man steps forward, pointing o.s.  The
     Time Traveller and Weena run through the haze,
     then the Eloi follow them.



     EXT. THE WHITE SPHINX - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) -          383
     (MATTE)

     The face is broken in half.  It is left with only
     a half a smile and thin smoke drifts through the
     remaining eye.  The rest of the statue and the
     sirens are on the ground beside the partial ruins
     of the pedestal.  Beyond it the hill is gone and
     gray haze covers the once green world.  The Time
     Traveller and Weena come through the charred
     bushes onto the lawn.  Here they stop.



     THE OPEN PANEL - THEIR P.O.V.                          384

     The Time Machine sits in the midst of the swirling
     smoke.  The flames, licking at the inside walls,
     have not yet reached the Machine.



     TIME TRAVELLER & WEENA - MED. SHOT                     385

     He releases her hand to reach into his jacket pocket
     and bring forth the lever without which the Machine
     will not function.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (without
                    looking at her)
               Come, Girl!

     He walk, toward the panel.  Weena follow,
     hesitantly, but the long habit compels her to
     halt before the threshold.  Unmindful of this,
     the Time Traveller enters.



     INT. PEDESTAL - LONG SHOT                              386

     Shooting from inside the pedestal, the Time
     Traveller and his Machine are black silhouettes
     in the foreground, while beyond him Weena stands
     on the lawn outside, the moonlight flooding her
     radiant features.

     Inside, black smoke still rises and whirls around
     as the Time Traveller examines his Machine and
     starts to fit the lever into place.



     REVERSE ANGLE                                          387

     The Time Traveller working eagerly.  A shadow
     starts sliding across his figure, moving more
     swiftly until darkness falls and the panel closes
     with a CLANG.



     OUTSIDE THE PANELS                                     388

     Weena, seeing the panels close, runs up to them
     and POUNDS her fists vainly on the metal doors.



     INSIDE THE SPHINX - MOVING SHOT                        389

     The Time Traveller leaps to the panels and struggles
     to open them.  From without he hears Weena's
     POUNDING and CRIES.  Suddenly he senses a living
     presence within the sphinx.  For a moment there is
     silence.  Then from the right comes a hacking,
     weak COUGH.  Another from the left.  Then some-
     thing STUMBLES OFF, down the stairway.  He whirls
     around, GASPING and COUGHING, to see three of the
     enmaddened Morlocks rising before him.  Avoiding
     them, he stumbles to his Machine and gets into
     the saddle.  The suffocating smoke blinds him as
     he gropes for the lever.  Morlocks seize his legs and
     try to wrest him off the Machine.  The fire and
     smoke become dense, half obliterating the struggling
     bodies.



     INSERT:  THE CONTROL PANNEL                            390

     The Time Traveller's hand gropes for the lever and
     finally grasps it.

     INSERT OF DIALS                                        404

     Spinning backwards.  Suddenly, a gloomy shade falls
     over the instruments, followed by a burst of
     whirling smoke and the twinkling red light of fire.
     There is a flash of sunshine, then finally total
     darkness.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             405

     Passing back in time through his captivity beneath
     the lava.  He reels in the saddle, then coming
     from darkness a red glow quickly engulfs the scene.
     As the red hot lava leaps away from him and the
     daylight returns, we can see that his face is
     covered with perspiration.  He looks off to see:



     SERIES OF SHOTS - (ANIMATION, MINIATURE, SPLIT)        406

     (NOTE:  These shots seen previously are now printed
             backward.)

             The red hot lava withdraws through the         (a,b,c)
             street ruins and the great rents in the
             ground gulp it up quickly.  Out of the
             ruins building are molded and then
             atomic explosions in reverse flash
             across the screen.  The SOUND OF
             EXPLOSIONS, RUMBLING ETC.  IN REVERSE
             AND SPEEDED UP join the HUMMING of the
             Time Machine.

             slowing.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 407

     INTERCUT his reaction to the previous scenes until
     he straightens and readjusts the lever.  The
     HUMMING DECREASES, then walls rise about him.
     Watching the dials, he carefully moves the lever.
     The flickers of the days and nights decelerate
     and, with a sudden pull, he halts the Time Machine.
     The HUMMING ABRUPTLY CEASES.



     INSERT:  DIAL                                          408

     It stops on:  "5 January 1900".



     INT. LABORATORY - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT)                  409

     The Time Machine has returned, but it is resting
     in the far corner of the room instead of in the
     spot where we originally saw it.

     In the gloom, the Time Traveller clambers pain-
     fully from the Machine.  Then, FOLLOWED BY CAMERA,
     he staggers to the workbench and sinks onto it.
     His eyes explore the room and finally come to rest
     on the clock.  It is "8:04".

                                        SLOW DISSOLVE TO:



     PENDULUM CLOCK - CLOSE SHOT                            410

     Now showing "9:22".  For a long while only its
     MONOTONOUS TICKING is heard. - A welcome change
     from the cacophony of time traveling.

     The CAMERA MOVES slowly to reveal the DINING ROOM
     where the five men, their meal finished, are
     sitting silently around the table.  Mrs. Watchett
     is quietly serving the liqueur.  The Time Traveller
     is puffing on his pipe.  Kemp is chewing on his
     cigar and Hillyer's face is red with indignation.

                         DR. HILLYER
               It is ridiculous!  Simply preposterous!

     Filby is bent over his coffee playing absorbedly
     with the spoon which CLINKS loudly in the room's
     silence.  Bridewell, of course, takes a big gulp
     from his brandy.

                         BRIDEWELL
               Well, there's one thing I'll say
               for you, George.  You always could
               tell a good story.  Best adventure
               yarn I've heard for years.
                    (loudly)
               You're a truly fine inventor,
               George!

     He alone starts to laugh at his 'joke', but a
     hiccup quickly puts a period to that.  Mrs. Watchett
     steps to the Time Traveller to pour him a bit of
     brandy.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               I'll turn down your bed for you!

     As she exits Kemp looks up.

                         KEMP
               Truthfully, where have you been
               for the past week?

     Bridewell examines the remaining brandy in his glass.

                         BRIDEWELL
                    (voice of experience)
               Now, we shouldn't ask such questions,
               Walter.  It's not hard for a man to
               lose a week now and then.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (smiling)
               I understand your doubt.  Take it
               as a lie if you wish.  Now that
               I'm back I scarcely believe it
               myself.
                    (a flash of memory)
               Except that...
                    (groping in pocket)
               ...here are the flowers Weena gave
               me.

     He places the blossoms on the table before Filby.
     They are actually less than a day old and fairly
     fresh.



     FILBY AND THE BLOSSOMS - CLOSE SHOT                    411

     As he picks them up to examine.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (o.s.)
               A present for you, David.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             412

                         TIME TRAVELLER (to Filby)
               You were always interested in
               botany. - Try to match them with
               any species known today.



     BACK TO FILBY                                          413

     As he looks up, puzzled.

                         FILBY
               I don't think I can.



     GROUP SHOT                                             414

     A still unimpressed Hillyer slams his hands on
     the table, stands up, looks around and then down
     to Kemp.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Are you coming, Kemp.

     Rising hesitantly, Kemp turns to the Time Traveller.

                         KEMP
               It's getting late and you look
               exhausted.  You had better get
               some rest.

     Everyone gets up, Bridewell with difficulty, and
     starts to leave.



     COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) - (MATTE)                415

     The snow falls softly, big flakes wobbling down
     from the sky.  The front door opens letting out
     the four guests wearing hats, capes and overcoats.
     They walk toward a waiting carriage, Kemp helping
     the staggering Bridewell.  Filby is the last to
     leave.  He pauses at the step of the carriage
     looking back to the Time Traveller who stands
     motionless in the doorway.

                         FILBY
               Goodnight, George.



     AT THE ENTRANCE                                        416

     The Time Traveller lifts his hand and waves.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Thank you, David, for being such
               a good friend - always.

     With this he turns and goes into the house, closing
     the door slowly.



     AT THE CARRIAGE                                        417

     Those inside are waiting for Filby to get in,
     but he, deep in thought, still stands gazing back.
     Kemp thrusts his head from the window.

                         KEMP
               What do you think, Filby?

                         FILBY (after a pause)
               One thing is certain.  Those
               flowers couldn't have possibly
               bloomed in the winter-time.

                         HILLYER (in the b.g.)
               You don't really think that story
               was true?

     Filby reaches a decision.

                         FILBY
               Look, you chaps go on.  It's
               just a short walk home for me.

                         HILLYER (o.s.)
               Go on, driver!

     The WHIP CRACKS.



     THE DRIVEWAY                                           418

     As the carriage rolls off leaving Filby standing
     in the falling snow.  He waits until the carriage
     disappears, then retraces his steps to the front
     door and raps on it.  He pauses a moment, then
     uses the heavy knocker.  There is still no answer.
     He steps back and looks off toward the:



     EXT. LABORATORY WING - FILBY'S P.O.V.                  419

     No light shines through its windows.



     BACK TO FILBY                                          420

     He raps once more, and getting no reply tries the
     door.  It is unlocked.  He steps into the house.



     INT. LIBRARY - FULL SHOT                               421

     The coals still glow in the grate as Filby enters
     the fully lit room, looking for his friend.
     Suddenly a clock from the neighboring room CHIMES
     ONCE.  Filby turns, goes toward it and stops at
     the doorway.



     DINING ROOM - FILBY'S P.O.V.                           422

     The table is cleared, candles extinguished.  The
     pendulum clock is TICKING lazily.  The time is
     "9:30".



     FILBY - PANSHOT                                        423

     He calls into the darkness.

                         FILBY
               George!...

     No answer.  Then an odd HUMMING sound brings
     him to stiff attention.  The SOUND INCREASES in
     VOLUME and PITCH until the entire house seems
     to tremble.  Then a violent gust of wind blows
     open the door that leads to the laboratory.

     Filby pivots and runs up the steps, through the
     corridor.



     AT THE DOOR OF LABORATORY - FULL SHOT                  424

     Filby, dishevelled and out of breath, arrives
     and tries the door -- it is locked.  The NOISE
     is almost DEAFENING.  He puts his shoulder to
     the door and finally bursts it open.  At the
     very instant he does so, the SOUND CEASES abruptly.
     He stops short, gazing aghast.



     THE LABORATORY - FILBY'S P.O.V.                        425

     The Time Traveller with his Machine FADING,
     leaving the present.

     Then the CAMERA MOVES ACROSS the workbench to the
     corner where we last saw the Time Machine.  It is
     not there!  The CAMERA WHIPS to the other corner.
     Nor is it there!  A few sheets of paper whirl
     desolately in the center of the floor.



     CLOSE ON FILBY                                         426

     He looks tense, ignoring the APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS
     behind him.  Mrs. Watchett hurries in.

                         MRS. WATCHETT (nervous,
                    breathless)
               Oh, Mr. Filby...what...
                    (her eyes widen)

                         FILBY (with finality)
               He's gone!

     The CAMERA FOLLOWS Mrs. Watchett as she slowly
     approaches the center of the room.  Here, with
     squinting eyes, she leans down to observe the
     floor.

                         MRS. WATCHETT (to
                    Filby)
               There's something funny here, sir!

     Filby steps aside her to investigate.



     WHAT THEY SEE                                          427

     The CAMERA MOVES ALONG parallel grooves resembling
     the ones the Time Machine left in the lawn at the
     front of the sphinx.  They are scratched deep in
     the floor leading from the spot where the Machine
     was last seen to the other corner of the laboratory
     where it originally stood.  Here, not only its
     imprint, but also the color and finish of the
     floor is preserved.



     TWO SHOT                                               428

     They straighten.  Mrs. Watchett looks at Filby,
     puzzled.

                         FILBY
               I think I understand. - Look!



     LABORATORY - FULL SHOT                                 429

     Mrs. Watchett listens as Filby moves to the imprint
     in the floor where the Machine first stood and
     explains.

                         FILEY (pointing)
               See the imprint?  This is where
               the Time Machine originally
               stood.
                    (he paces across to the
                    end of the grooves)
               But the Morlocks moved it.
               They dragged it across the lawn
               right into the sphinx...right
               here.
                    (turns and points)
               And Weena was standing there when
               he last saw her...the same space -
               in a different time. - So he moved
               back his heavy Machine from here,
               across the room, scratching this
               floor...
                    (indicating the grooves
                    that lead to the imprint)
               So that he can appear outside the
               sphinx again and help the Eloi
               build a new world...and build a
               new world of his own.

                         MRS. WATCHETT (faintly,
                    sentimentally)
               Where he left her!..

     Filby doesn't answer.  He looks about the labora-
     tory for the last time, then takes Mrs. Watchett's
     arm and leads her from the room.  The MUSIC STARTS
     THE THEME:  "The Land Of The Leal".



     INT. LIBRARY - FULL SHOT                               430

     Filby and Mrs. Watchett come into the room.

                         FILBY
               But it isn't like George. - To
               return empty handed.  To try to
               rebuild a civilization without
               a plan.
                    (to Mrs. Watchett)
               He must have taken something
               with him.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Nothing.

     She looks around and discovers three empty spaces
     on the tightly packed book shelves.  She walks to
     them.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Nothing except three books.

                         FILBY
               Which three books?

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               I don't know. -- Is it important?

                         FILBY (smiles)
               No, I suppose not. - Only...what
               three books would you have taken?

     She looks at him, pondering the question as they
     leave the library.



     INT. ENTRANCE HALL                                     431

     They stop at the door and Mrs. Watchett stands
     beside Filby as he opens it.  Outside the snow
     is falling softly.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Mr. Filby, do you think he will
               ever return?

                         FILBY (quietly)
               One cannot choose but wonder. -
               You see...he has all the time in
               the world!

     With these words, Filby turns up his collar, pulls
     the brim of his hat over his eyes and walks into
     the night.  Mrs. Watchett looks after him.  She
     hears the SOUND of his DIMINISHING FOOTSTEPS
     SQUEAKING in the virgin snow.  Slowly she closes
     the door.



     EXT. COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) - (MATTE)           432

     Drifting like a curtain, the snow falls quietly
     as Filby, a solitary figure in the night, pauses
     a moment to look up at the sky, then selects a
     path and starts walking the long way home.

                                            SLOW FADE OUT.

     Leo the Lion ROARS over the FANFARE, then

                                                 FADE OUT:

     GLIDING OBJECTS IN A WIDE DARK VOID - (ANIMATION)

             Out of the SILENT darkness a short white       A
             fluted column surmounted by a SUNDIAL
             appears.  It floats in, waveringly, until
             it becomes clearly visible, then drifts
             off as though moving in some huge orbit.

             Next an HOURGLASS floats in from the left      B
             of the screen.  The faint HISSING OF
             RUNNING SAND breaks the stillness of space.

             As the hourglass glides across the screen,     C
             it is met by a GREEK WATER CLOCK accompanied
             by the sound OF DRIPPING WATER.

             A MEDIEVAL CLOCK with weights arises as its    D
             horizontal escapement TICKS LOUDLY.  Mean-
             while the sundial, hourglass and water clock
             return, drifting at diverse angles across
             the screen.

     THE SOUND of the various devices continues to MOUNT.

             A FIGURE wheels past, with the face of a       E
             clock and the body carved like a drummer
             of the 14th century, BEATING the hour.

             A SMALL CLOCK bears a golden angel with        F
             hammer in hands as it STRIKES A BELL.

             ANOTHER TIMEPIECE, with CHIMES, floats in      G
             to mingle with all the drifting objects.

             The BIG BEN is TOLLING                         H

             Then a GREAT BELL.                             J

     DEAFENING SOUNDS NOW COME FROM ALL DIRECTIONS, as the time K
     devices weave across the screen and, reaching CRESCENDO,
     STOP abruptly.  A mellow VOICE begins to SING THE THEME of L
     the picture, "The Land Of The Leal".  Simultaneously, the
     screen reveals the MAIN TITLE:                             M

         When I was a wee lad                               L
         And dark was the night
         Afraid I would be
         Til the bright morning light
         And sometimes...for comfort
         Away I would steal Away
         I would go to the Land of the Leal.

         And soon I would be there
         It took me no time
         My heart would be soaring
         As I made the climb
         And there was the green grass
         So cool and so sweet
         So good to be run through
         With happy bare feet!

         And who was my teacher
         And how did I know?
         Just when to be going
         And which way to go?
         But always when wishing
         Away I would steal
         Away I would go to the Land of the Leal.

         And now that I'm older
         I try to be wise
         But when I am troubled
         I still close my eyes
         And just like the wee lad
         Away I will steal
         Away I will go to the Land of the Leal.

         For there are no questions
         And there are no lies
         And never a storm there
         To darken the skies
         The birds who are flying
         No freer they feel
         Than I
         When I live in the land of the Leal.

     After the CREDIT TITLES, the MUSIC SUBSIDES and we slowly

                                                 FADE OUT:



     FADE IN:                                               1
     EXT. COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) - (MATTE)

     Warm lights pour through the windows, spreading
     over the snow-patched countryside.  Only the
     laboratory, a converted greenhouse, is dark, shaded
     from the moonlight by a majestic, leafless oak.
     A two-horse carriage, in the style of the turn of
     the century, lingers in the driveway.  Beyond all
     this, the River Thames takes a sharp curve.

     A lonely figure hurries up to the front door and
     KNOCKS on it impatiently.



     AT THE DOOR                                            2

     The knock is answered by MRS. WATCHETT, the house-
     keeper, a thin, tense woman with iron gray hair.
     The CAMERA ENTERS the HALL with DAVID FILBY, an
     amiable red-haired young man of science, who hastily
     hands her his rumpled cloak and hat, then rushes
     toward:



     INT. LIBRARY                                           3

     A pleasant Edwardian room, the shelves are stacked
     tightly with volumes of books, many of ancient
     Vintage.

     Three men are seated in a rough circle, motionless,
     obviously awaiting the arrival of occupants for the
     two empty chairs.  The silence is accentuated by the
     merry CRACKLING of logs in the fireplace and the
     capricious TICKING of innumerable timepieces about
     the room.

     Filby enters, pauses to glance down, then embarrassedly
     takes his chair.



     SERIES OF CLOSE SHOTS                                  4

               DR. PHILIP HILLYER is an imposing            (a)
               businessman, wearing full sideburns.
               He stares stonily at the last empty
               chair, then at Filby with annoyance.

               ANTHONY BRIDEWELL, a man of the world,       (b)
               impeccably attired in the latest fashion,
               welcomes Filby the only way he knows, by
               lifting his glass of whiskey.

               WALTER KEMP, a middle aged man with keen     (c)
               black piercing eyes, angrily chews on
               his Havana.

               Filby fidgets uncomfortably in his chair     (d)
               as

               Hillyer glances impatiently at his           (e)
               watch, comparing time with a GRAND-
               FATHER CLOCK behind him, then snaps
               it shut and glares at:



     EMPTY CHAIR - MED. SHOT                                5

     Conspicuously unoccupied.



     GRANDFATHER CLOCK - CLOSE SHOT                         6

     Reaching the hour of eight, it begins to STRIKE ITS
     YELLOW CHIMES.  Other timepieces JOIN IN the announce-
     ment.



     GROUPSHOT                                              7

     The men look at each other until the CHIMES, BELLS
     ETC. FADE away.  Dr. Hillyer angrily slaps on the
     arm of his leather chair.

                         DR. HILLYER
               I say, this is outright rude of the man!

                         FILBEY
               He's undoubtedly been detained.  That's
               all.

     Bridewell, filling his glass, is trying to say some-
     thing but is interrupted by

                         KEMP (unscrews the cigar from
                    his tight lips)
               This is such a confounded waste of
               time!  If he's not coming, I've any
               number of more important things to do.

     All heads turn as Mrs. Watchett enters, closing the
     door quietly behind her.  With an envelope in her
     hand she stands there, hesitating.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Speak up -- what is it, woman?

     She is taken aback for a moment, then walks over
     to Filby and hands him the open envelope.  He
     takes his time in extracting the note.

                         BRIDEWELL
               Well...are we or are we not invited
               to dinner?

                         FILBY (reading)
               Apparently we are.
                    (to Mrs. Watchett)
               How long has he been gone?

                         MRS. WATCHETT (nervously)
               I can't rightly say, sir. - Several
               days...I hardly catch a glimpse of
               him lately.  He never leaves the
               laboratory and comes out only to
               nibble at his meals...but he did tell
               me days ago about dinner tonight and
               left these instructions.
                    (pointing to note)

                         FILBY
               Thank you, Mrs. Watchett.

     A faint, nervous smile is her acknowledgement and
     with that she retreats toward the door.

                         DR. HILLYER (indicating the
                    note)
               What does it say, Filby?  What's
               wrong?

                         FILBY
               Nothing really. - George merely says
               that if he is not here by eight we're
               to begin without him.

     Kemp tears the note out of Filby's hand and reads it
     hurriedly.  Meanwhile, Mrs. Watchett swings the door
     open and turns around.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Dinner is served, gentlemen!

                         BRIDEWELL (puts his glass
                    down)
               First sensible thing I've heard all
               evening.

     He rises and starts for the dining room.  The others
     follow.



     FILBY, HILLYER & KEMP - MOVING SHOT                    8

     As they walk toward the DINING ROOM.

                         FILBY
               This is peculiar.  He is usually very
               prompt, precise and punctual.

                         DR. HILLYER
               He's making fools of us by inviting
               us here and then not showing up.
               It's not the behavior of a gentleman.

                         KEMP
               To say nothing of the waste of
               time.

                         DR. HILLYER (agreeing)
               To say nothing of the waste of
               time.

     Bridewell, already seated at the heavily laden dining
     table, pours a glass of wine for himself while the
     others settle down.  This time the chair at the head
     of the table is conspicuously unoccupied.

                         BRIDWELL (arises, lifting
                    his glass)
               One thing I will say for George, he
               keeps the best cellar in the south of
               England...and Mrs. Watchett is the
               finest cook in the world. - I think
               I'll drink to that!

     The glass barely touches his lips as he freezes at
     the SOUND OF DROPPING TRAYS and a PIERCING SCREAM.
     All look in the direction of another door across
     the room.



     THE DOOR - FULL SHOT                                   9

     It bursts inward and Mrs. Watchett, her hair flying,
     dashes down the steps panic-stricken into the room.
     The CAMERA RUSHES with her to the table where the
     men have come to their feet.  Clutching Filby's arm,
     she points toward the long corridor now revealed by
     the open door.

                         MRS. WATCHETT (frightened)
               There!...there...

     All stare o.s., Hillyer with the carving knife
     clasped in his hand.



     CORRIDOR THROUGH DOORWAY - FULL SHOT                   10

     We see the figure of a man approaching, a black
     silhouette against the pale glow at the end of
     the passage.  He is bent with exhaustion and
     sways as he moves forward, limping.  The man comes
     closer, his features still blacked out by shadows,
     but as he nears the doorway, the light from the
     room strikes first his legs, then his body and
     finally his face.  Here he stops.

     This is our first meeting with the TIME TRAVELLER
     (for so it will be convenient to speak of him).  At
     this instant he is in a sorry state.  His clothing
     is tattered and dirty, his face pale, bruised and
     scratched and his eyes glazed with fatigue.  For
     a moment he hesitates as if dazzled by the light
     and then takes another swaying step into the room.



     FILBY AND BRIDEWELL - MOVING SHOT                      11

     They come to life.  Bridewell, noticing the glass
     of wine still in his hand, quickly gulps it down
     before rushing with Filby toward the Time Traveller.

                         FILBY
               Good lord! - What's happened?

     Reaching him, each seizes an elbow to support him.
     Bridewell throws a frantic glance at Dr. Hillyer
     back at the table.  The Time Traveller, however,
     moves forward under his own power.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I'm all right...just some food...a
               drink...

     He reaches the table and sinks into his chair.  With
     trembling hands Bridewell tries to pour him a glass
     of wine, spilling most of it over the tablecloth.
     The Time Traveller looks up at him with a wry smile.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Are you all right?

     A stunned Bridewell is unable to speak while the Time
     Traveller empties his glass.

                         BRIDEWELL (a delayed
                    answer)
               Of course.  I'm...all right...

     Meanwhile, Mrs. Watchett hovers over the Time Traveller
     like a mother hen.

                         MRS. WATCHETT (half
                    apology, half concern)
               I didn't recognize you!...it was
               so dark...

     The CAMERA MOVES IN as she dishes up a bowl of soup
     for him, but he pushes it away.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Meat...I'm hungry for meat!

     Mrs. Watchett grasps the carving knife from Dr.
     Hillyer and, with a single slash, cuts off a huge
     portion of beef and loads it onto his plate.



     GROUPSHOT                                              12

     The Time Traveller eats, the men watching him
     curiously.  Finally Dr. Hillyer leans forward.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Well, can't you speak, man?  What
               happened to you?  Aren't you going
               to tell us...

                         BRIDEWELL
               Leave him alone, can't you?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (swallowing)
               It's all right. - I want to tell.

                         FILBY
               It will keep, George.  Eat, rest a
               little.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               No!  I must tell it now... while I
               still remember.

                         FILBY
               Relax, try to relax a bit.  You've
               all the time in the world.



     CLOSE ON THE TIME TRAVELLER                            13

     As he looks up, amused.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You're right, David.
                    (almost to himself)
               That's exactly what I have. -
               All the time in the world!...
               ever since we were all together
               five days ago, the last day of
               Eighteen Hundred Ninety Nine.

     Slowly the CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSER while everyone
     listens so intensely that, aside from the Time
     Traveller's VOICE, only the TICKING of a pendulum
     CLOCK is heard.

                                         SLOWLY DISSOLVE:



     INT. - EBONY BOX ON TABLE - CLOSE SHOT (AFTERNOON)     14

     (NOTE:  The Slow Dissolve from the previous shot
             should give the effect of the Ebony Box
             emerging from the Time Traveller's brain.)

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               There in that box rests the result
               of two years' labor.

     The CAMERA DRAWS BACK to reveal the LIBRARY.  The Time
     Traveller, wearing casual tweeds and smoking a pipe,
     sits in his favorite chair behind the Ebony Box.
     Across from him in another chair sits Dr. Hillyer
     puffing his cigar.  Bridewell and Filby have glasses
     in their hands -- Kemp nothing.  All are looking at
     the box.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (continues)
               I wanted to finish the job before
               the new century began. - I barely
               made it.

                         BRIDEWELL
               Marvelous.

                         DR. HILLYER (stands up)
               What is it?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Well, it has to do with time.

                         DR. HILLYER
                    (steps to box)
               I've always maintained what this
               nation needs is a reliable timepiece.
               The Navy needs one. The Army needs
               one. - For the artillery you know.

                         KEMP (leaning forward)
               Couldn't do better, George.  So
               that's why you've been in hiding. -
               Clever of you, indeed!

                         FILBY (studying the Time
                    Traveller's reaction)
               I don't believe George is referring
               to a new kind of timepiece.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               When I speak of time, I'm referring
               to the fourth dimension.

     A perplexed look comes over Bridewell's face.
     Dr. Hillyer registers concern.  Kemp looks troubled.
     Only Filby expresses avid interest.

                         FILBY
               Go on, George.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Now, as you know, the difficulty
               in explaining the fourth dimension
               is that it cannot be seen or felt -
               it must be thought of.

                         FILBY
               If you don't mind, George, would
               you refresh me on the first three
               dimensions.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Really, Filby, they must have
               taught you something at school!

                         BRIDEWELL (baiting
                    Dr. Hillyer)
               Suppose you explain it, Doctor.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Certainly!
                    (he demonstrates
                     pompously)
               When I move in a straight line,
               forward or backward, that's one
               dimension. - When I move to the
               left or right, two dimensions. -
               When I move up and down, three
               dimensions.
                    (a bright idea lights up
                    his face.  At last he can
                    get ahold of the box, but
                    Filby interferes before
                    Dr. Hillyer can get his
                    fingers on it and he has
                    to be satisfied with merely
                    pointing)
               For instance, this box has three
               dimensions:  length, breadth, and
               height.

                         BRIDEWELL (amazed)
               Well, then, what's the fourth
               dimension?

                         DR. HILLYER
               Well, that's...that's mere theory!
               No one can really say what the
               fourth dimension is or even that
               it exists.



     THE TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                         15

     Leaning forward in his chair.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               On the contrary, Doctor!  The
               fourth dimension is as true and as
               real a dimension as any of the
               other three.  In fact, they couldn't
               exist without it.

                         DR. HILLYER (enters the SHOT)
               How do you mean?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Well, take that box.  It has the
               first three dimensions, as you said.
               But what if it didn't exist in Time?
               It wouldn't exist at all, would it?

                         DR. HILLYER
               No.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               So - for an object to exist at all,
               it must exist in the fourth dimen-
               sion....and that fourth dimension
               is duration....Time!

                         DR. HILLYER (impatiently)
               All right!  But what's in that box?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I'm coming to that.  But first,
               consider!  Why is it that we usually
               ignore the fourth dimension?  Because
               we have no freedom to move in it.  We
               can move in the other three -- up,
               down, forward, backward, sideways.
               But when it comes to Time, we are
               prisoners.  Do you follow me, Anthony?



     GROUP SHOT                                             16

     In the f.g., Bridewell who has been sitting with a
     glazed, dreamy look, suddenly jumps.

                         KEMP
               George!  You've given a most lucid
               explanation and all that!  But I
               don't think I entirely understand.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Look!  There are a lot of things in
               the world you don't understand,
               aren't there?

                         KEMP
               Of course!  Quite a number.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               But you don't refuse to believe
               in them because of that?

                         KEMP
               Not if I can see the proof with
               my own eyes.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Good!  All I'm asking you to do
               now is to witness a demonstration
               of the possibility of movement in
               the fourth dimension.
                    (to Dr. Hillyer)
               Philip, will you please hand me
               that box?

     All eyes turn to Dr. Hillyer as he eagerly rushes to
     the table, lifts the box with surprise at its lightness,
     and takes it to the Time Traveller.  George opens it
     with great care and brings forth a mechanical device

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I've told you.  The larger model
               can carry a passenger on a journey
               through Time. - Not through Space,
               mind you, but through Time.

                         BRIDEWELL
               Oh, I say George!  If you start
               floating around in the future, aren't
               you likely to mess things up for the
               rest of us?

                         DR. HILLYER
               The future is already there.  It's
               irrevocable and cannot be changed.

     He answers thoughtfully.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               That's the most important question
               to which I hope to find an answer.
               Can Man control his destiny?  Can he
               change the shape of things to come?

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Imagine that this cigar is the Time
               Traveller.  Now, this lever in front
               of him controls movement.  Forward
               pressure sends the Machine into the
               future, backward pressure into the
               past.  And the harder the pressure
               the faster the Machine travels.

     All eyebrows are raised.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               This experiment can be performed
               only once.  If it succeeds, I lose
               my model forever.  That is why I
               need witnesses.

     They look at each other, uncertain whether he is
     joking or not.  Bridewell stoops with difficulty to
     examine the table.

                         KEMP
               Go ahead.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You're ready then?

     Despite disbelief, there is a tense silence as he puts
     his finger on the lever.  Then he pauses.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Doctor Hillyer, would you care
               to lend me your hand?

     Dr. Hillyer extends his hand hesitantly, smiling
     weakly.



     INSERT OF MODEL                                        25

     Using Dr. Hillyer's forefinger, the Time Traveller
     presses the lever forward.  A LOW-PITCHED HUM is
     heard.



     CLOSE ON THE MEN - LOW ANGLE                           26

     The men stare in fascination as the CAMERA PANS
     and the HUMMING INCREASES.



     INSERT:  GLASSES - CHANDELIER - VASE                   27

               The glasses on the silver tray rattle        (a)
               and clink against each other.

               The gas lights of the chandelier             (b)
               flicker rapidly.

               A vase shudders and moves slightly on        (c)
               the mantelpiece.

     As the vibration increases, the outline of the model
     is blurred and gradually becomes transparent, until
     the Machine with the cigar has vanished utterly.
     The HUMMING HAS REACHED A HIGH SHRIEK and STOPS
     abruptly.



     BACK TO CLOSE ON MEN - LOW ANGLE                       29

     The sudden silence is almost unbearable.  They
     stare at the empty table.  The CAMERA PANS.

                         DR. HILLYER (touches his
                    cigar pocket)
               I'll be damned!

                         TIME TRAVELLER (almost
                    to himself)
               It worked!

     Filby swallows.

     Bridewell, with his mouth open, stares at the table.
     Now he looks at the glass of champagne in his hand
     and places it on the mantelpiece as far out of
     reach as he can.  Then, suddenly reversing his
     decision, he retrieves the glass and gulps it down.

     Dr. Hillyer slowly turns to the Time Traveller.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Where did it go?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (recovering)
               Go?  Nowhere in the usual sense.
               It's still here.
                    (indicating space where the
                    Machine stood)
               But it's no longer in the present.
               It's traveling through time - to
               the future, to be precise.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Do you seriously expect us to
               believe that?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Certainly.

                         DR. HILLYER
               But you just said it hasn't
               really moved.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               That's correct.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Then why can't we see it?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Because we're in this room on
               December 31st, 1899, while the
               model you saw is perhaps a hundred
               years away.  This room, or even
               this house, may no longer exist a
               hundred years from now.  But the
               Time Machine is occupying the same
               space it did a moment before it went
               off on its journey.

     Dr. Hillyer runs his hand over the top of the table.

                         DR. HILLYER (exasperated)
               If it occupies the same space, I
               should be able to feel it.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You must remember that the space
               you've just put your hand through
               is today's space.  You can't put
               your hand into the space of
               tomorrow.

                         DR. HILLYER (getting angry)
               Space is space!  It doesn't change!
               The same space that is here now should
               be here a hundred or even a thousand
               years from now.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               No!  Time changes space.  This flat
               ground we're standing on now could
               have been at the bottom of the sea
               a million years ago.  And a million
               years from now it could be the
               interior of a huge mountain.

     Dr. Hillyer turns away, speechless.

     Kemp steps forward.

                         KEMP
               Suppose what you say is true.
               Exactly what do you suggest we do
               with such a contraption?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               For my part, I intend to take a
               journey into the future. - Unless
               someone else prefers to volunteer.

     There is no response.

                         BRIDEWELL (chuckling)
               I say, George.  Suppose you go off
               and get lost in the fiftieth century!
               How will you find your way back?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (quite
                    serious)
               That's a calculated risk I'm prepared
               to take.

     Dr. Hillyer, having controlled his fury, now exchanges
     significant glances with Kemp and turns back with an
     air of reasonableness.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Now listen, George!  I don't
               know what you take us for, but
               we're not fools.  There are a
               number of ways of doing a
               disappearing trick!  But a man of
               your ability should not bother
               with such nonsense.



     CLOSE ON DR. HILLIER - MOVING SHOT                     33

     He gets up from his chair.

                         DR. HILLYER (unable to
                    resist the temptation for
                    sarcasm)
               There's a war on, you know!  The
               Boers are putting up a pretty stiff
               fight in South Africa and our
               country needs inventors like you.
               I can put you in touch with the
               War Office if you wish.

     He walks over to the Time Traveller who is sitting
     near the table on which stands the empty Ebony Box
     with its lid open.  Filby is in the b.g.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (looks
                    up at Filby)
               What do you think?

                         FILBY (hesitating
                    slightly, and then)
               I think Dr. Hillyer has a point,
               George.

     Lazily the Time Traveller toys with the lid of the
     Ebony Box, then closes it with a SNAP.  He looks up
     and nods.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Now you're being sensible.  I'll
               take care of it first thing in
               the New Year.

     Everyone rises.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Well, time to go.

                         KEMP
               Yes, we all have our plans for
               tonight.

     Dr. Hillyer and Kemp head toward the door.  Bridewell
     lingers at the table where the model of the Time
     Machine disappeared.

                         BRIDEWELL (concerned)
               Are you all right, George?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Of course, I am.

                         DR. HILLYER'S VOICE
               Coming, Bridewell?

     Reluctantly Bridewell leaves the library followed
     by the Time Traveller.



     INT. ENTRANCE HALL - FULL SHOT                         35

     While his guests put on their capes, overcoats, scarfs,
     gloves and hats, preparing for the cold weather
     outside, the Time Traveller steps to the door and
     grasps the handle.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Thanks for coming.

     He opens the door and they file past him, Bridewell
     at the rear.

                         AD LIBS
               Happy New Year. - Goodbye, George -
               Happy Twentieth Century. - Etc.

     Bridewell clasps the Time Traveller's shoulder,
     reassuringly.

     In contrast to the previous SHOT (Sc.l) this is a snow-
     less wintery day.  The visitors are boarding the
     carriage that awaits them in the drive.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Come on, Bridewell.

     Bridewell glances back to the Time Traveller, then
     submits and, with a CRACK OF A WHIP, the carriage
     moves off.



     EXT. ENTRANCE - FULL SHOT                              37

     The Time Traveller, a silhouette framed in the door-

     THE CARRIAGE                                           38

     As it pulls away, Bridewell leans out, waving.  From
     the opposite direction another carriage full of NOISY
     YOUNG PEOPLE THUNDERS by.  In early New Year's Eve
     REVELRY they TOOT their toy HORNS at the Time Traveller.



     BACK TO THE TIME TRAVELLER                             39

     Unmindful of their salutations he turns and enters the

     INT. ENTRANCE HALL - MED SHOT                          40

     The Time Traveller slowly closes the door and leans his
     back against it, staring into space.  Thinking. - He
     spots a newspaper on a nearby table, apparently left by
     one of his guests, and picks it up.

     that the Boer Army has won another victory.

     He closes his eyes and, added to the DRUMS, we HEAR
     the call to battle by a DISTANT BUGLE.  Then more
     BRASS, FIFES and HORNS join the BUGLE and DRUMS to take
     up a MILITANT OVERTURE.

     He loosens his collar, then with sudden resolution
     strides toward:

     INT. LIBRARY - LONG SHOT                               57

     The Time Traveller crosses to his writing table in
     the f.g.  He stands there and even in the darkness
     WE CAN OBSERVE that he is an angry man.  He strikes
     a match and lights the overhead gas fixture.  The
     light comes up and the MUSIC STOPS as he stares
     across the room to see:



     FILBY - MED. SHOT                                      58

     sitting in a chair near the fireplace.

                         FILBY
               I thought I'd better stay.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               You needn't have troubled yourself.
               I'm all right.

                         FILBY
               No you're not. - You've been
               behaving oddly for over a month
               now.
                    (and then)
               I'm not leaving until you tell me
               what's on your mind.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             59

     Deep in thought, he goes to the fireplace and stirs
     the coals.  The CAMERA FOLLOWS.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I appreciate your gesture, David,
               but if you don't mind I'd rather
               you left me alone.

                         FILBY
               You have changed, George.
               Enormously.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I'm sorry.

                         FILBY (looks up to him
                    directly)
               Will you answer me one question
               honestly?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I'll try.

                         FILBY
               Why this preoccupation with Time?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (sharply)
               Why not?

                         FILBY
               Don't go simple on me, George!

                         TIME TRAVELLER (a beat,
                    then calmly)
               If you want to know the truth, I
               don't much care for the time I was
               born into. - It seems people aren't
               dying fast enough these days.  They
               call upon science to invent new,
               more efficient weapons to depopulate
               the earth.

                         FILBY
               I quite agree with you.  But here
               we are and we have to make the best
               of it.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You may have to.  I don't.

                         FILBY (making a half-
                    hearted attempt at levity)
               All right.  Take a journey on your
               contraption.  What would you become?...
               A Greek?  A Roman?  One of the
               Pharaohs?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I prefer the future.

                         FILBY
               You're not seriously saying you can
               do it?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You saw the experiment this afternoon,
               didn't you?

                         FILBY
               I saw a toy machine vanish.  But
               I'm certain there are a number of
               ways of doing that trick.  Any
               magician at the Hippodrome could
               probably do it.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (angrily)
               It was no trick! - Would you care
               to see the full-scale model?

                         FILBY
               No, I would not!  I have no desire
               to tempt the laws of Providence and
               I don't think you should.  It's not
               for man to trifle with.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Now you sound like Hillyer and Kemp.

                         FILBY
               There is something in their common
               sense attitude to life.
                    (and then)
               George, I speak to you as a friend.
               More, as a brother.  If that machine
               can do what you say it can...destroy
               it.  Destroy it, George, before it
               destroys you.

     Distant SOUNDS of NEW YEAR'S CELEBRATIONS are HEARD.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You must have plans for New Year's
               Eve.  Don't let me keep you.

                         FILBY
               Mary isn't well.  We decided to
               stay home with the baby.  But why
               don't you come home with me.  You
               haven't seen little Jaime for a
               long time.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I can't.

                         FILBY
               What's stopping you?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I just want to see the old century
               out by myself.

                         FILBY (rising)
               Have it your own way.

     He goes to the door.



     AT THE DOOR                                            60

     Filby stops, then turns around.

                         FILBY
               Will you promise me that you won't
               leave the house tonight?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I promise you, I won't walk out of
               the door.

     Filby, a little puzzled by this strange promise, turns
     to go as the Time Traveller puts down the poker and
     steps up to him.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               David!  Please don't think me un-
               friendly! - Come over to dinner -
               next Friday.  Won't you?

                         FILBY
               Very well.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Fine...and will you bring the others
               with you?

                         FILBY (with a warm smile)
               Whatever you say, George. - Happy
               New Year.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (shaking hands)
               And a very happy New Year to you, David.

     Filby pats his arm before he leaves.  The Time Traveller
     stands there until he hears the FRONT DOOR SHUT.  Then,
     FOLLOWED BY THE CAMERA, he goes to the writing table
     and sits down.



     AT THE WRITING TABLE                                   61

     The Time Traveller opens a drawer and takes out the
     new calendar that reads:  "1900, Welcome New Century."
     He flips a few pages to find the next Friday and jots
     down the dinner engagement.  At this point Mrs. Watchett,
     with his velvet smoking jacket over her arm, appears
     in the doorway and walks up to him.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Will you be having supper in this
               evening, sir?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (while ex-
                    changing jackets with Mrs.
                    Watchett's help)
               I don't think so, Mrs. Watchett.  Why
               don't you take the evening off and
               celebrate.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Thank you, sir, but if you won't be
               needing me I think I'll turn in early
               and get some sleep...
                    (indicating revelers outside)
               ...it I can. - Goodnight, sir.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Goodnight.

     She turns to go as the Time Traveller calls after her.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Oh, Mrs. Watchett!
                    (as she responds)
               I've invited Mr. Filby and the others
               to dinner next Friday.
                    (and then)
               Happy New Year, Mrs. Watchett.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Happy New Year, sir.

     Mrs. Watchett exits, closing the door after her.  Once
     again the Time Traveller is alone.  He looks at the
     old calendar that reads:  "December 3l. 1899," rips
     the final sheet from the pad, crumples it into a tight
     little ball and tosses it into the hearth where it
     burns.  With slow and deliberate movements he replaces
     the old calendar with the new one.  Then, he hastily
     scribbles a note which he puts into an envelope and
     places it prominently on the table.  He rises and
     mounts the steps that lead to:



     INT. CORRIDOR - MOVING SHOT                            62

     The Time Traveller walks slowly toward a closed door
     at the end of the passageway.  Here he pauses momentarily,
     removes the key from his pocket, unlocks the door, then
     slowly swings it open as the MUSIC STARTS the THEME of
     the picture.



     INT. LABORATORY - FULL SHOT - (NIGHT)                  63

     The laboratory has the appearance of having once been
     a greenhouse.  Only a few potted plants remain.  The
     glass walls are obscured from view from the garden by
     rows of tall growing plants.  Only the glass skylight
     is clear.  Thick, dark, low-hanging clouds are pass-
     ing beneath the moon, dimming its light and leaving
     the interior a maze of dark shadows.  As the slow mov-
     ing clouds pass overhead, a shaft of moonlight seeps
     through and we SEE workbenches, numerous tools, sheets
     of drawings and scientific instruments situated around
     the perimeter.

     But the most conspicuous object in the room is the
     Time Machine.  It is a duplicate of the miniature model
     already seen.

     However, its size gives it a majestic quality.  Nickel,
     ivory and crystalline quartz gleam and sparkle.  While
     the miniature possessed a delicate, appealing note, the
     full size Machine has an ominous look.  The wavering
     moonlight seems to render it alive and give it the
     power of movement.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                  64

     Staring at the Machine, hypnotized by his own crafts-
     manship, he locks the door with accustomed movement,
     then crosses to a workbench and lights a candle.  Here
     a crystalline lever is attached to a polishing buffer.
     The Time Traveller sets it in motion, polishing the
     crystal lever until its rough edges disappear and it
     sparkles like a fine cut diamond.  As he works, his
     lips purse and he softly STARTS TO WHISTLE the melancholy
     strains of "The Land Of The Leal."  A clock near him on
     the workbench reads:  "9:30."

     Satisfied with the buffing, he removes the gleaming
     handle and crosses to the Machine.  He settles into the
     saddle and affixes the crystalline lever.  There is no
     sign of urgency in his movements to betray that his
     settling himself into the saddle is any more than a
     routine position he has taken before to work on the
     Machine.

     Then he leans back in the saddle and gazes up at:



     INSERT:  SKYLIGHT - (STOP MOTION OR ANIMATION)         65

     Passing clouds.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 66

     He looks upwards for several moments.  Then his hand
     slowly reaches forth and his fingers encircle the
     lever. - Gently he urges it forward.

     A HUMMING SOUND, similar to the one made by the model,
     but MORE RESONANT starts and a soft glow wells up from
     within the Machine.



     INSERT:  THE CONTROL PANEL                             67

     The luminous dials show:  "31 December 1899."  The
     meters and indicators start to BUZZ and whirl.  The
     glow increases.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 68

     His expression is taut as he looks around, then down
     to the control panel.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               I started...and the laboratory grew
               faint around me...



     INSERT OF PANEL                                        69

     The figures spin, the needles vibrate.  Then almost
     at once the Time Traveller's hand reaches for the
     lever and jerks it over to halt the Machine.  The
     HUMMING LESSENS and FADES.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 70

     As he starts to look up and around, slowly.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               ...I stopped.



     WHAT HE SEES - MOVING SHOT                             71

     Starting at the WINDOW with frost around the edges
     and icicles outside, we move around the room PASSING
     THE WORKBENCH over to the DOOR.  During this we HEAR the:

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               No change; everything exactly as it
               bad been before. - But no!

     THE CAMERA SWINGS BACK TO THE WORKBENCH, CLOSE, where
     the clock now shows "11:09" and the candle has burned
     shorter.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE (excited)
               The clock said 9:31 when I started and
               now it was 11:O9...and the candle,
               shorter by inches.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 72

     He looks amazed, then pulls his old fashioned watch
     from his pocket by its gold chain.  It flips open
     showing almost "9:32."

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               And yet by my watch which was in the
               machine with me, only a few seconds
               had passed.

     Pleased, he puts his watch away and reaches for the
     lever, looking off toward the:



     WORKBENCH - (ANIMATION)                                73

     The HUMMING SOUND STARTS again and, while the hands
     of the clock circle the dial, the flame of the candle
     flickers with the speed of a bee's wing, melting the
     candle down.  The CAMERA MOVES to the window where the
     frost has spread and the icicles continue to grow.
     Light comes up behind so that the crystals glitter like
     gems and the sun starts to rise.



     TIME TRAVELLER IN THE MACHINE - MED. SHOT              74

     The rays of the early Morning sun slide down the lab-
     oratory wall and sweep across the Time Traveller and
     his Machine.  A trace of a smile -- and then, he looks
     up and squints.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               It was disconcerting to see the sun...



     INSERT:  SKYLIGHT - MED. SHOT - (STOP MOTION OR        75
     ANIMATION)

     As the sun arches majestically.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               ...arc in less than a minute...

               for the night, changes that normally
               took hours, occuring in seconds, was
               beautiful.

     During this it has turned into night and a little SNAIL
     rushes across the ground beneath the plant, and then
     the flowers start to open again.  Light begins to flood
     the scene.

     In the b.g. Mrs. Watchett leaps into the garden, pauses
     the briefest instant to sprinkle the flowers, then with
     the speed of wind streaks away.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 77

     A trace of a smile, then apprehension.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               And as yet I was travelling very slowly!
                    (challenging)
               What if I went faster?!

     His hand shoves the lever farther over toward the
     future position.

     THE HUMMING SOUND RISES TO HIGHER PITCH.  The Time
     Traveller lurches in his seat, clings to the controls
     and looks at the dials.

     The sun soars across the sky, night falls.  Pin points
     of stars streak by and dawn comes.  The sun is chased
     by the stars again and again.  Faster and faster.



     VERY CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                           81

     His eyes gleam with a mad light, half pleasure, half
     pain.  His face is illuminated by the alternating
     flashes of light, each one indicating the passage of
     another day.

     He turns toward the:



     WINDOW - FULL SHOT - (ANIMATION, STOP MOTION & STOCK)  82

     Without a trace of frost or icicles.  The snow has
     disappeared, replaced by the lush green of Spring.
     While the vines of a morning Glory grow up and around
     the window like a snake and the flowers open and close,
     we see the following through repeated fast flashes.

                    The sun hops swiftly across the sky.    (a)

                    The night falls and the stars circle    (b)
                    the North Star.

                    tumultuous clouds.

                    On the following day the sky darkens    (e)
                    with thunderheads.  There is a
                    cataract of lightning and THUNDER.



     BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 83

     Quick flashes of lightning on the Time Traveller's
     face followed by a series of SHORT THUNDERCLAPS.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               It became intoxicating.  To see an
               entire storm in a few seconds. -
               So I pushed the lever on toward
               even greater speed.

     He applies greater pressure on the lever.  The
     HUMMING INCREASES.  The alternate flashes of light
     become a flicker almost too fast for the eye to
     follow.  He looks o.s. and sees:



     EXT. TREE IN GARDEN - FULL SHOT - (ANIMATION)          84

     Its shadows, cast by the sun and the moon, dance
     around the trunk, faster and faster -- the moon
     passing through its phases and the sun shifting
     its position with the seasons.



     BRANCHES - CLOSE SHOT - (ANIMATION)                    85

     Leaves grow quickly.  Flowers appear and turn into
     small green apples.  Growing larger, they turn red
     and fall.  The leaves gradually become amber and
     disappear.  Suddenly the bare branches are covered
     with snow for a few seconds, then again burst into
     green leaves and blossoms.



     EXT. DISTANT HILLSIDE - FULL SHOT - (ANIMATION)        86

     Through the window we see the trees grow and
     change like puffs of vapor -- now brown, now
     green; they spread, shiver and pass away.  Snow
     flashes across the country, vanishes and is
     followed by the brief bright green of Spring.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Thirteen years had passed...fourteen...
               fifteen...sixteen...and then...

     Gradually soot, dirt and grime has built up on the
     windows from the outside and darkness prevails.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                87

     His brow is beaded with perspiration.  Alarmed,
     he grabs the handle of the Time Machine.



     INSERT:  THE DIALS                                     88

     The hand of the Time Traveller quickly pulls back
     the lever.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               In the year nineteen hundred seventeen...
               I stopped.

     The flickering of passing days and nights slows and
     the HUMMING SOUND GRADUALLY DIMINISHES.  The dial
     stops on "13 September 1917".



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             89

     The CAMERA PULLS BACK as he steps out of his Machine
     and glances with astonishment around the interior
     of the laboratory.  The once clear windows are now
     dirty and boarded up.  The world outside is
     completely obscured from view.  Only faint light
     penetrating cracks indicates that it is day out-
     doors.  He crosses to the door.  Dust falls as he
     opens it and enters the corridor.



     INT. LIBRARY                                           90

     The dim light and the protective sheets covering
     the furnishings previously seen, lend the room a
     ghostly appearance.  Tilted paintings reveal
     faded spots on the walls and the dust is inches
     thick here, as well as in the dining room seen
     in the b.g.  Cobwebs are everywhere.

     The floor SQUEAKS on every footfall as the Time
     Traveller, coming down the steps from the
     corridor, enters the room and looks about.



     THE SHELVES - TIME TRAVELLER'S P.O.V.                  91

     Among his books still rest the clocks, his once
     prized possessions.  There is NO TICKING now.
     The hands of the clocks, each pair indicating a
     different time, seem to guard the past.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                  92

     Curiosity takes the Time Traveller from the
     library, through the ENTRANCE HALL, to the front
     door.  It refuses to respond to his attempt to
     open it.  Even when he uses his shoulder it does
     not budge.  He steps back and flings his full
     weight against it and with a WRENCHING SOUND it
     gives slightly.  Under continued pressure the
     nailed boards outside give way and a flood of
     daylight illuminates the dusty interior.  The
     Time Traveller moves into the open driveway that
     is now taken over by weeds.



     EXT. COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - DAY                         93

     The Time Traveller takes a deep breath and looks
     curiously around.  Everything is overgrown with
     vines and flowers.  The house is boarded up.  He
     starts to wander around, thinking, investigating.

     (NOTE:  The house is situated upon a site with
             distinctive landmarks that will stay
             recognizable during his journey into
             the future, thereby giving a clear
             conception that time-travelling does
             not involve geographical movement.
             For instance, the sharp curve of the
             River Thames in the distance will
             remain even after the house itself
             has disappeared.)

     Suddenly the SOUND OF AN APPROACHING ENGINE
     catches his attention.  He looks puzzled toward:



     EXT. ROAD - LONG SHOT - (DAY)                          95

     Coming up the hill on a narrow dusty road is a
     car of 1916 vintage, with the HORN HONKING.  The
     CAMERA PANS with it, up to a SMALL STORE across
     the street.  The sign above the entrance reads:
     "Filby's Department Store".  A MANNEQUIN,
     dressed for the period, is in the window.  The
     driver, in the uniform of a Second Lieutenant of
     the First World War, steps out of the car.  The
     Time Traveller walks over to see his old friend,
     sans moustache.



     TWO SHOT                                               96

                         TIME TRAVELLER (glibly)
               Going to a masquerade, David?  You
               look rather silly without your
               moustache, old man!

                         FILBY (puzzled)
               Were you addressing me, sir?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (positively)
               Filby!  I expected more of an
               enthusiastic greeting from...

                         FILBY (smiles as he
                    interrupts)
               I'm afraid you have me confused
               with my father, sir.  There was a
               remarkable resemblance. - I'm
               James Filby.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Was?

                         JAMES FILBY
               Were you a friend of father's?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Yes...yes...I've been away.

                         JAMES FILBY
               He was killed in the war...a year
               ago.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (aghast)
               No!...it can't be...
                    (then, as he realizes its
                    truth)
               I'm sorry to hear that.
                    (pause, then hesitantly
                    points)
               And the gentleman who used to live
               across the street?

                         JAMES FILBY
               Oh, him.  Some inventor who
               disappeared around the turn of the
               century. - If you're interested in
               that house, forget it.  You can't
               buy it or even go inside.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Why is that?

                         JAMES FILBY
               My father was executor of the
               inventor's estate and he refused to
               liquidate it.
                    (adds with a smile)
               I often chided him on that account,
               but he felt positive that the owner
               would return some day. - Some people
               hereabouts think it's haunted.
                    (stares at Time Traveller
                    curiously, studying the
                    strange cut of his clothes)
               Who are you, sir?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Just a stranger who once knew your
               father.

                         JAMES FILBY
               I see.
                    (still curious at the Time
                    Traveller's abstract attitude)
               Have you been at the front, sir?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Front?  What front?

                         JAMES FILBY
               Why the war, of course.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What war?

                         JAMES FILBY
               Great heavens, man, don't you know
               we've been at war with Germany
               since nineteen fourteen?  I thought
               perhaps you had seen action in
               France...or maybe...
                    (noticing confusion, adds
                    with a note of compassion)
               Perhaps a cup of tea would make
               you feel better.  Won't you come in?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               No...no, thank you.

                         JAMES FILBY
               You're sure you're alright, sir?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Yes, I'm quite alright.

                         JAMES FILBY (hesitantly)
               Then...goodbye, sir.

     The Time Traveller nods and James Filby slowly
     turns and, glancing back repeatedly, enters the
     Department Store.

     With the bitter taste of death for his old
     friend, David Filby, he slowly walks across the
     street and returns to the cottage.

               As I went along, I gained experience
               in handling the Machine.  I found
               that I could stop for a day, an hour,
               or even for a second to observe, then
               go ahead for a year or two. - Thus I
               was able to see the changing world

     With the speed of wind, pedestrians streak across

               had worn out.

     The Time Traveller HEARS the SCREAMS of DIVING
     PLANES.  He stops the Machine and looks up at:

     ANTI-AIRCRAFT batteries are FIRING as a squadron
     of Nazi fighter planes are caught in the criss-
     cross beams of light.  The sky is pierced with
     ack ack.  Then, following the sound OF APPROACHING RAF.

               The last time I had stopped was in
               nineteen seventeen, twenty three years
               ago.  And the war with Germany was
               still waging - now in the air with
               flying machines.  It didn't seem
               possible they could go on fighting
               all these years and still have the
               means of fighting.  Then I realized
               the truth of the matter.  This was a
               new war.  There must have been an
               interval of peace in between these
               wars.  Yet they had learned nothing
               but to prepare even more effective
               means of destroying one another.  I
               decided to push on into time and see
               the outcome.

               The fighting in the sky lasted only
               a few moments.  By nineteen forty five

               few more years before pausing for
               another glimpse of my silent, never

               ten years hence.

     With a grin he throws the lever forward.



     INSERT OF DIALS                                        114

     HUMMING INCREASES and the years spin; 1960, 1961
     and so on until it finally STOPS on 1966.



     BACK AT THE MANNEQUIN                                  115

     Dressed in the sleek dress of the future.  First
     a distant, then a close AIR RAID SIREN HOWLS,
     menacingly.



     BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 116

     His smile becomes a puzzled stare at what he sees.



     EXT. STREET IN 1966 - LONG SHOT - (DAY)                117

     People are racing along the sidewalk.  The SOUND
     OF MORE DEEP-THROATED SIRENS from all directions
     comes over.  Drivers leave their cars of the period
     in disorder.

     The running is purposive, however.  All are entering
     particular buildings or, like those closest to the
     Time Traveller, are descending a stairway from the
     sidewalk down below street level.  Some glance sky-
     ward.

     A LITTLE GIRL picks up the doll she has dropped
     as her FATHER returns from the shelter.  He gathers
     her up in his arms and rushes back to safety.

     In a few seconds the streets are deserted.



     TIME MACHINE AT EDGE OF PARK - FULL SHOT               118

     The Time Traveller gets out and looks around,
     confused.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               At first I wondered if my Machine and
               I were the cause of the panic.  I was
               to soon find out we weren't.

     He starts off toward the sidewalk, the CAMERA
     MOVING with him.  At the descending subway stair-
     way he stops and peers downward, but sees no one
     below.  Meanwhile, through a loudspeaker o.s.,
     a melodious SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA is heard softly,
     until a BURST OF CHORDS attracts the Time Traveller's
     attention.



     EXT. STORE WINDOW - FULL SHOT                          119

     A TELEVISION CABINET on display.  The set is
     operating, showing a huge symphony orchestra
     led by one of the popular conductors of tomorrow.
     The CAMERA SWINGS to the modern ENTRANCE of FILBY'S
     DEPARTMENT STORE just as the Time Traveller reaches
     the two broad glass doors.  As he steps forward he
     intercepts the rays of electronic eyes and the doors
     fly wide open.

     He stops startled, looking about to see who opened
     them.  Seeing no one, he starts slowly forward.



     INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - LONG SHOT                      120

     From the TV set BLARES MUSIC that gradually becomes
     the UNDERSCORE for the SCENE.  The Time Traveller
     enters and turns his attention to other products
     of tomorrow -- refrigerators, vacuum cleaners,
     reducing belts, etc.  As his keen mind grasps the
     significance of each, he smiles with approval, proud
     of his fellow man.  His delight increases until he
     is interrupted by APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS.  He looks
     off.



     REVERSE SHOT                                           121

     Coming from the office is THE WARDEN, dressed in a
     plastic suit.  He also wears an armband and a white
     crash helmet, both bearing the insignia of "Civilian
     Defense."  MUMBLES are heard from beneath his mask
     as the CAMERA PANS him to the Time Traveller.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (shakes his head)
               I can't understand you.

     The warden takes off his helmet.  He is David
     Filby's son, James, whom we saw in 1917 as a young
     man.  He is now in his mid-sixties.

                         WARDEN
                    (looking at helmet)
               Confounded radio in this thing.
               Makes more noise than it does sense.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (recognizing him)
               Filby!

                         WARDEN
               My name is Mister Filby. - Didn't
               you hear the air raid siren?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You mean that horrible screeching?

                         WARDEN
               It wasn't constructed for its
               aesthetic values, you know, but to
               warn silly young fools like yourself
               to get down into the shelter.  Now
               go on.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               But I'm perfectly comfortable and
               I find your store magnificent.  What
               splendid achievements, what gigantic
               strides mankind has taken, what...

                         WARDEN
                    (interrupting)
               Come on, young man.  We'd better be
               going before the mushrooms start
               sprouting.
                    (looks at Time Traveller
                    with renewed interest)
               You do look familiar.  Haven't
               we met somewhere before?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Indeed we have.  Right here.  Many
               years ago.

                         WARDEN
               I was sure of that, but the exact
               time escapes me.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               It was two wars ago, I believe.
               Nineteen seventeen.

                         WARDEN (awed)
               Why now I recall.  The chap who
               inquired about my father -- and
               the house that used to be across
               the way.
                    (stops and stares at
                    the Time Traveller)
               But no...that's impossible.  You
               haven't changed.  You're not a day
               older.  And your clothes...

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I'm afraid it's going to take me
               a little time to explain... You see...

     There is an insistent, EAR PIECING SIREN.  It
     lasts for three seconds.

                         WARDEN
               The last alert...hurry!

     He grabs the Time Traveller by the arm and drags
     him out.



     ON THE STREET - FULL SHOT                              122

     They emerge from the store.  The Time Traveller
     pulls himself free.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Listen to me!  It's important.

                         WARDEN (points to sky)
               Look!  An atomic satellite zeroing
               in!  That's important!!

     The Warden runs, looks back over shoulder, calling.

                         WARDEN
               Hurry!  Hide 'til the All Clear!

     He descends into the air raid shelter.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                  123

     He looks puzzled.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               All clear?
                    (yells)
               I've got to talk to you.

     The Time Traveller looks up as he hears the
     APPROACHING SIRENS OF AN AMBULANCE.  Alarmed,
     he runs across the street directly in the path
     of the ambulance that threads its way between the
     cars left in disorder on the road.  The driver
     spins the steering wheel and the ambulance tilts
     crazily in trying to avoid the Time Traveller.
     Suddenly there is a BLINDING FLASH.  He stops and
     looks startled.



     VIEW THROUGH THE STREETS - LONG SHOT - (STOCK,         124
     MINIATURE, SPLIT)

     A SATELLITE travels over the city in the distance.
     The flash is followed by an EXPLOSION and a giant
     cobalt mushroom begins to rise over the horizon.



     BACK TO SCENE                                          125

     As the Time Traveller tries again to rush toward
     his Machine, the shockwaves reach him and throw him
     to the ground.  He looks back, desperately.



     THE CITY - LONG SHOT - (MINIATURE)                     126

     Through the thick cloud of smoke and dust we see
     the once proud city of the future in ruins.  Only
     a single, large structure in the f.g. remains stand-
     ing for a moment, then it also collapses in an instant.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               The labor of centuries gone in an
               instant.

     The ground shudders with an OMINOUS sound and sudden
     a great rent appears in the wide street ahead, as
     though the earth were being torn apart.  It zig-zags
     down the street and from the widening fissure clouds
     of smoke and steam rise.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               But then Mother Earth, aroused by man's
               violence, responded with volcanic
               violence or her own!



     CHASM IN THE GROUND - (STOCK)                          127

     The smoke and steam give way to a spluttering of
     red hot lava which swells slowly at first in a
     rising tide and then spilling over begins to
     EXPLODE into the air.



     BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 128

     The Time Machine is shaken violently, but the
     Time Traveller manages to crawl into it.



     THE THAMES - LONG SHOT - (STOCK)                       129

     As the river spills over its bed and turns into
     another direction.



     THE STREETS - (STOCK, MINIATURE, SPLIT)                130

     With red hot lava swirling around the bases of the
     remaining buildings.  The lower parts of the struct-
     ures in the f.g. dissolve into smoke and flame and
     the upper parts come tumbling down into the rising
     red flood.  Then the incoming rush of the river
     meets the flowing tide of lava.  The two opposite
     elements, molten rock and cold green water, dwarf
     the ruined city as they leap toward each other, and
     meet with explosive fury.  The air is rent with the
     SINGING HISS of water and the CRACKLING of cooling
     rock.  Steam whitens the sky.



     THE TIME MACHINE - LONG SHOT - (STOCK) - (PROCESS)     131

     Out of the tumult a flow of red hot lava turns
     aside and leaps directly toward the Time Machine.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Then I saw my own danger.  I too was
               to be engulfed!



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                132

     As he sees his great peril.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               But to go back was unthinkable.

     He jams the lever forward to its furthest position.
     The HUMMING SOARS TO A VERY HIGH PITCH.



     THE ENCROACHING LAVA - (STOCK)                         133

     It has been approaching with the speed of a torrent,
     but now it literally leaps forward in a blinding
     red haze that engulfs the entire scene.



     THE TIME MACHINE - MED. SHOT                           134

     The interior of the Machine is permeated with a dull
     red glow which seems to flow like mist all about the
     Time Traveller.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Only my speed through time saved me
               from being roasted alive and encased
               in stone forever.



     INSERT OF DIALS                                        135

     They are spinning too fast to distinguish anything
     in the gradually fading red glow.



     EXTREME CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                        136

     His face is bathed in sweat.  His eyes search the
     growing darkness.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               The molten rock cooled.
                    (he closes his burning
                    eyes as the last of the
                    light vanishes)
               I prayed...wondering how many centuries,
               how many eons must pass before the wind
               and rain could wear away the mountain
               that enclosed me.

     In the pitch darkness there are only the sounds of
     the HUMMING TIME MACHINE and the SLOW LABORED
     BREATHING of the Time Traveller.

     Then a match flickers.  The CAMERA SCARES BACK.  The
     Time Traveller holds up a burning matchstick, his
     face glistening with perspiration as he leans forward
     to look at the dials.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
                    (whispering)
               Darkness...darkness for centuries.



     INSERT OF DIALS                                        137

     They roll very fast.  We can distinguish only the
     passing of years -- 70,000...80,000...90,000...
     100,000.  Then the matchlight flickers and goes
     out leaving only the dial's own faint glow.



     BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 138

     Once again there is darkness and the MONOTONOUS HUM
     of the Time Machine.  He breathes heavily and tries
     to calm himself.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               I wondered if there was still war
               being waged on the ground above me...
               if man would still exist on earth,
               when I saw the sun again.

     As he speaks, the Time Machine goes faster and faster.
     HIGH PITCHED HUMMING INCREASES.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               The centuries rolled by. - I put
               my trust in time and waited for
               the rock to wear down around me.

     A white light from above begins to permeate the dark-
     ness.  The Time Traveller looks up, his face showing
     immense relief.



     WHAT HE SEES - (ANIMATION)                             139

     Rocks deteriorate and a bright blue sky bursts into
     view.  ACCENT ON MUSIC.



     EXT. TIME MACHINE AND GROUND NEARBY - LONG SHOT        140
     (SPLIT, ANIMATION)

     Everything is a blur except the Time Machine with its
     passenger.  The black rock on the surface slowly melts
     away and the flickering sunlight returns.  The Machine
     is now finally entirely above ground, the only distinct
     object in the whirling transparent landscape.



     EXT. TIME TRAVELLER - CLOSE SHOT                       141

     As he smiles gratefully up at the sky.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               I was free again!

     He looks o.s.



     INDISTINCT COUNTRYSIDE - LONG SHOT - (ANIMATION)       142

     There is an impression of several great buildings
     set wide apart by green landscape -- a landscape
     which no longer changes color even though trees
     spring up like plumes of green smoke.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Thousands of centuries passed, but
               the earth stayed green!  There was
               no winter!  No wars! - Had man finally
               learned to control both the elements
               and themselves? - I had to stop and
               find out.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             143

     As he eagerly pulls hard on the lever, the HUMMING
     DECREASES and the dial freezes on:  "23 November
     802,701".  THERE IS A CRASH LIKE THUNDER and the
     Time Machine suddenly goes into a spin.  The CAMERA
     ZOOMS BACK TO A FULL HIGH SHOT as the machine keels
     over.  The friction caused by the intrusion creates
     a pitiless HAIL, and we

                                    SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO:



     EXT. TIME TRAVELLER - CLOSE SHOT - (DAY)               144

     Thick mist eddies about his face, undulating
     dreamily, revealing enough to see that he is
     unconscious.  Blood seeps from a gash across his
     forehead.  He dazedly opens his eyes to find that
     he is gazing across the dewey, green turf.  Then
     he looks up.



     EXT. THE SPHINX - FULL SHOT - LOW ANGLE - (MATTE)      145

     The vapor rises like a curtain to disclose a great
     bronze pedestal, green with verdigris, whereon
     clawed feet support the white marble figure of an
     immense Sphinx.  The figure has the face of a
     woman, the body of a huge cat and the tail of a
     serpent.  A weeping birch tree barely touches its
     outspread wings.



     THE TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                         146

     He shakes the cobwebs out of his head and, FOLLOWED
     BY THE CAMERA, rises with difficulty.  Still half-
     dazed he presses a handkerchief to his temple, as
     he loosens his collar, then reaches into the Machine,
     pockets the lever and surveys his surroundings.



     LANDSCAPE - LONG SHOT - (MATTE)                        147

     It looks like a garden untended for centuries.  The
     trees and shrubs are laden with strange blossoms or
     exotic fruits.

     In the distance there is a building that might once
     have been a temple.  Vines mat the ancient walls,
     seemingly holding them together.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 148

     He smiles.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (to himself)
               At last I've found a Paradise.

     He starts off toward the building WHISTLING his
     favorite tune, "The Land Of The Leal".  The CAMERA
     ACCOMPANIES him as he looks about with interest.



     WHAT HE SEES - MOVING SHOT                             149

     Strange, exotic fruits bend the branches of the
     TREES, some purplish and gourd-shaped, others
     suggesting giant raspberries, mangoes, etc.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Nature tamed completely and more
               bountiful than ever before.



     VARIETY OF FLOWERS - MOVING SHOT                       150

     The CAMERA PANS under boughs laden with orchids and
     a multitude of other gorgeous blossoms.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Flowers everywhere...the whole landscape
               one vast garden with no sign of weeds or
               briars.



     EXT. ENTRANCE TO GREAT BUILDING - LONG SHOT - (DAY)    151

     The Time Traveller pauses and looks up at the building.



     ACROSS FACADE - PAN DOWN - (MINIATURE?)                152

     Vines creep up the crevices.  The ornamental stone
     work, while rich in detail, is weathered and
     broken with age.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
                    (surprised)
               Unrepaired for centuries!  Maybe
               unlived in for as long.
                    (then)
               It would be no Paradise if it
               belonged to me alone.



     INT. ENTRANCE - MED. SHOT                              153

     Shooting through the ARCHWAY we see the Time
     Traveller mount the steps and enter the building.



     INT. THE GREAT HALL - FULL SHOT - (MATTE) - (DAY)      154

     In the background across the hall, the Time Traveller
     halts.  He is dwarfed by the height of the vaulted
     ceiling.  Although ancient in appearance, everything
     is ultra modern in design.  Sunlight streams through
     windows where half the panes of stained glass are
     broken.  Faded curtains droop in dusty folds along
     the walls, and at random about the floor are low
     tables, some heavily fractured, loaded with bowls
     of fruit.

     His FOOTSTEPS ECHO through the great hall as the
     Time Traveller crosses to:



     A TABLE - MED. SHOT                                    155

     The Time Traveller glances down at the spread of
     exotic fruit.  Everything looks fresh and clean as
     though newly prepared.  Yet there is no indication
     of life or sound, either human or animal.  The air
     hangs in a deathlike stillness.  Slowly the Time
     Traveller turns and looks around the walls, his
     eyes searching, scrutinizing for some clue to
     this strange place.  There is none.

     Then he picks up an empty marble plate and POUNDS
     with it on the top of the table.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (shouting)
               Anyone here?

     But an ECHO is his only answer.  Curiously he re-
     traces his steps and leaves the great hall.



     EXT. LANDSCAPE - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                     156

     Pick up the Time Traveller as he walks slowly along.
     Every sense he possesses is on the alert.  His eyes
     probe every bush and tree and object that could
     possibly conceal some person or thing.



     SERIES OF SHOTS                                        157-161

     As the Time Traveller takes this long, slow walk,
     INTERCUT INSERTS of the various innocent objects
     he looks at with CLOSEUPS of Time Traveller as he
     reacts to the bewildering SILENCE and lack of life
     or movement.

     The continued stretch of emptiness builds up a wave
     of apprehension in the Time Traveller which grows
     as he moves along.  The apprehension mounts into
     tension and gradually but inevitably approaches
     the state of horror that a human being would
     experience in a strange place where he had just
     come from an innocent freshly set table of ripe
     fruits and stepped outside into a beautiful but
     weird vacuum.



     EXT. WOODED AREA - LONG SHOT                           162

     As the Time Traveller reaches the edge of the trees,
     he hesitates, then moves into the forest.



     SERIES OF SHOTS                                        163-166

     The trees are thick and deep shadows cut patches of
     darkness through the bright sunlight which struggles
     to penetrate the maze.  The Time Traveller walks
     with continued wariness through the trees, glancing
     from left to right and occasionally stopping dead
     still and quickly darting a glance behind him at
     what he imagines to be some sound of movement.
     But all this is imaginary on his part.  There is
     nothing that moves or makes a sound in this forest.

     Suddenly he stops as he distinctly hears a familar
     and quite HUMAN combination of NOISES.  The SOUND
     SPLASHING WATER and LAUGHTER.  He hurries to some
     dense foliage where he stops to cautiously peer out.



     EXT. THE POOL - LONG SHOT - (DAY)                      167

     The Time Traveller's VIEW is partially obscured by
     the leaves.  At considerable distance upstream, the
     PEOPLE OF THE FUTURE are swimming in a natural pool
     and sunning themselves on a beach of white sand.
     They are small, but delicately formed.  Their grace
     and beauty fits perfectly into this splendid new
     world.  The spot is also extremely lovely, surrounded
     by fern trees, and with the water plunging into it
     from a high waterfall.  Below the pool the stream
     emerges in a swift torrent.



     ANOTHER, CLOSER SHOT                                   168

     A beautiful GIRL, dressed in a silken robe of white
     and gold, starts running.  As she runs, she loosens
     her robe which drifts to the sand and she dives deep
     into the crystal water.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                169

     He smiles philosophically and leans back against a
     tree trunk, watching the distant swimmers, reassured.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (musingly,
                    to himself)
               So this is man's future...



     GROUP SHOT                                             170

     The people, apparently without any cares of the
     world, play, romp and swim.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (o.s.)
               ...to bask in the sunlight, bathe in
               the clear streams and eat the fruits
               of earth with all knowledge of work
               and hardship forgotten.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 171

     He pauses, thinking back on what he has just said.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Well, and why not?

     Suddenly a SHRILL SCREAM COMES OVER from the pool.
     He turns.



     THE POOL - LONG SHOT                                   172

     The Girl has swum out too far and is caught by the
     swift torrent.  She CRIES OUT PITEOUSLY.

     The other people turn their heads toward her, but
     make no move to help.



     CLOSE ON GIRL                                          173

     She has caught a ledge of rock and clings.  Two
     little men, their bare feet dangling in the water,
     sit nearby but ignore the Girl's plight.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           174

     He jumps out from the foliage, rushes to the bank,
     points toward the Girl and tries to attract the
     attention of those near her on the bank.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Help her!...

     No one moves.  He runs toward the ledge.



     BACK TO THE GIRL                                       175

     Her grasp on the ledge grows weaker.  She is at
     the point of letting go.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           176

     Reaching the ledge, he pushes past the people nearby
     and grasps the Girl's wrist just as her fingers
     slip.  Quickly, he pulls her out of the river's
     turbulent current and lifts her up in his arms.



     GIRL - EXTREME CLOSE UP                                177

     Looking up at the Time Traveller bewildered, she
     shows neither fear nor gratitude.



     TIME TRAVELLER - EXTREME CLOSE UP                      178

     Gazing back at the Girl thoroughly puzzled.  He
     turns and glances down at the two little people
     on the ledge.



     CLOSE TWO SHOT                                         179

     These two men will later be known as the YOUNG MAN
     and the MAN IN WHITE.  They return the Time Travel-
     ler's look of scorn with pleasant smiles as if they
     do not know the meaning of a mean look.



     TIME TRAVELLER & GIRL - EXTREME CLOSE, MOVING SHOT     180

     Trying to avoid looking at the dripping, robeless
     Girl - after all he is a Victorian - he carries her
     to the safety of the bank and sets her down on the
     sandy beach beneath the trees.  The CAMERA FOLLOWS
     him as he straightens, then quickly takes off his
     jacket and throws it around her.

     He looks at her for the first time sees the almost
     ultimate in feminine beauty.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Are you all right?



     TIME TRAVELLER & GIRL - FULL SHOT                      181

     Wearing his velvet jacket very appealingly, she
     calmly rises, turns and, without a word, walks
     away.  The Time Traveller stares after her in
     astonishment.

     The disconcerned people, now all dressed in multi-
     colored robes, are leaving the pool.  They walk
     past the Time Traveller as though he was a part of
     the scenery, merely adding to his confusion.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                182

     Perplexed.

                                      DISSOLVE TO:



     EXT. ENTRANCE TO THE GREAT BUILDING - (SUNSET)         183

     Shooting toward the ARCHWAY.  The sun is sinking as
     the last stragglers of the little people enter the
     great hall.  The Time Traveller slowly follows them.
     He pauses on the steps to see if any will turn back
     to either welcome him or resent his intrusion, but
     they move on with lack of interest, completely.  He
     sits down on the steps, thoroughly perplexed at this
     utter indifference.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             184

     Seated on the steps leaning against a column.  He
     senses another's presence, looks about, sees no one,
     then turns to glance over his shoulder.  The Girl, now
     wearing her robe and holding his jacket over her arm,
     appears from behind the column.  He looks at her and
     smiles reassuringly, but makes no move toward her. -
     She comes closer, then sits on the step above him and
     returns his jacket.  While he slowly slips it on,
     she slides down a step to sit alongside him.

                         THE GIRL
               Why did you?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Why did I what?

                         THE GIRL
               Come after me.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (ironic)
               I did it to save your life, young
               lady, which I'm afraid doesn't hold
               much meaning for you or anyone else.

                         THE GIRL (simply)
               It doesn't.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Must have been fifty of your friends
               watching you drown.  Not one of
               them so much as lifted a finger. -
                    (shakes his head)
               A curious attitude - in a curious
               world.
                    (a pause, then a
                    smile)
               Aren't you the least bit interested
               in what I am...where I come from?

                         THE GIRL (innocently)
               Should I be?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (smiles)
               Perhaps you'd better take me to
               someone a bit older I can talk to.

                         THE GIRL
               There is no one older.

     The Time Traveller is suddenly struck by the truth
     of her words.  All of the little people seem to be
     of the Girl's age or younger.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Doesn't anyone age in this land
               of yours?

     The Girl makes no reply.  Instead she gazes off at the
     sun which is low in the heavens.  Shadows have already
     fallen over the distant hills.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What's your name?

                         THE GIRL
               Weena.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               How do you spell that?

                         WEENA
               Spell?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Write!  - Can't you write?  Look!

     He bends over, picks up a stick and starts to draw
     on the ground.



     INSERT: DUST                                           185

     As the stick writes out: " W E E N A "



     BACK TO SCENE                                          186

     She shows little interest.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               And what are your people called?

                         WEENA (as if he ought to know)
               Eloi.



     INSERT OF DUST                                         187

     The stick now writes in the dust: " E L O I "



     BACK TO SCENE                                          188

     A shadow crosses her face.  Suddenly she springs
     to her feet, concerned.

                         WEENA
               Come.  We must go in.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (rising)
               Why?  What's wrong?

                         WEENA (anxiously)
               It is getting dark.

     She grabs his hand and pulls him toward:



     INT. THE GREAT HALL - LONG SHOT - (MATTE?) - (DAY)     189

     Crowded now.  The people of the future are sitting
     on cushions around the tables, having their evening
     meal.  The glowing orange light of the setting sun
     pierces the broken windows, lending a curious at-
     mosphere to the place.  No one pays attention to
     Weena or to the Time Traveller as they enter in the
     b.g.



     AT THE MAIN TABLE - MED. SHOT                          190

     A score of attractive young men and young women are
     enjoying their dinner.  There is a general atmos-
     phere of bubbling good humor.  They don't even look
     up as Weena and the Time Traveller sit down at the
     table.  She hands him an orange-sized raspberry.  He
     takes it, looks at the Young Man and the Man in White
     who sit across the table from him and tries to engage
     them in conversation.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (directed to
                    Young Man, but meant for the
                    entire group)
               I don't mind telling you, I'm quite
               hungry.  I've come a long, long way.

     Looks around for some kind of a reaction.  There is
     none.

     He bites into the fruit.  It's good.  While he is

     subject.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               In my time a berry this size would
               have made news in every civilized
               country.

     There is no reaction, so he addresses the Young Man
     again.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Sir, perhaps curiosity has died.
               Perhaps even courtesy has died, but
               I have come a long way and there are
               things I would like to know.

                         YOUNG MAN (considers a
                    moment, then)
               Why?

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Because I shall return to my time
               and they will ask questions such as
               what kind of government rules your
               world.

                         MAN IN WHITE
               We have no government.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (speaking
                    as though to a child)
               You must have a body of men who pass
               and enforce laws.

                         MAN IN WHITE
               There are no laws.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (taken aback,
                    then)
               How do you get your food and clothing?

     The Man in White looks at the Young Man beside him.
     They both shrug their shoulders.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Doesn't anyone work?

                         MAN IN WHITE
               No.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (picks up
                    fruit)
               Then where does this come from?

                         MAN IN WHITE
               It grows.  It always grows.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               But it must be planted, cultivated,
               nurtured...unless...
                    (with mistaken insight as he
                    observes no reaction to this
                    last query)
               Unless you have an economy so well
               organized that you can devote all your
               time to study and experimentation.
               Am I right?

                         MAN IN WHITE
               You ask many questions.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (annoyed)
               Yes!  And I'm not ashamed of it.
               That is how man has learned and
               bettered himself.  I must learn about
               you and your civilization.  You have
               books, don't you?

                         YOUNG MAN (recognizing a
                    half-forgotten word)
               Books. - Books!  Yes, we have books.

     He rises and beckons.  The Time Traveller's brow
     clears.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Books will tell me what I want to
               know.  Books will tell me all about
               you.

     He too gets up and follows the Young Man.

     The Young Man leading.  He reaches the wall and
     seizes an ancient curtain which covers it.  A
     cloud of dust rises as he tugs it aside and the
     curtain falls, almost crumbling.  Shelves and
     shelves of books are disclosed.  The books are
     old even though many of them have futuristic de-
     signs.  The bindings of once proud volumes hang in
     brown tatters.  The Time Traveller steps to the
     books.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                194

     The realization of the true state of affairs shows
     on his face.  He is appalled.  Carefully he pulls
     a volume from the shelf.  Its binding breaks as
     he opens it and, when his hand touches the pages,
     they crumple like ashes and drift to the floor.
     He drops the book.  His voice is a shocked WHISPER.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Yes...they do tell me all about you!

     With sudden violence he slams his fist into a whole
     shelf of books.  His hand plows through them and
     the dust swirls into the air.  He turns back in
     anger.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What have you done?  Thousands of
               years of building and rebuilding
               creating and re-creating so that
               you can let it crumble to dust.

     With one hand he grabs the Young Man and shakes him.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               A million yesterdays of sensitive
               men dying for their dreams.  For
               what?  So you can swim and dance
               and play.

     He releases him and leaves.



     THE HALL - MOVING SHOT                                 195

     The Time Traveller stomps among the Eloi, hating
     them for their dissipation.

     Without emotion they watch him walk toward the
     entrance.  Only Weena jumps to her feet.  Her
     former indifference is gone.



     AT THE ENTRANCE                                        196

     From the top step, the Time Traveller looks down
     at them.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I am returning to my time!  Not to
               tell of the uselessness of the
               struggle - not to tell of the
               hopeless future - but only so that
               I can die among men!

     He turns and strides toward the door.



     EXT. ENTRANCE - MED. SHOT - (DUSK)                     197

     The Time Traveller bursts out of the building.  A
     moment later Weena appears in the archway.  She
     stands there, looking after him.

                                           DISSOLVE TO:



     EXT. FOREST - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT)                      198

     There are patches of mist and haze between the
     trees.  With a blazing torch the Time Traveller
     strides across.



     EXT. TIME TRAVELLER ON THE PATH - (NIGHT)              199

     Coming from the distance the CAMERA PANS HIM TO
     THE EDGE OF LAWN, where he stops short, jerking
     the pipe from his mouth, his eyes wide with con-
     sternation.  He raises the torch high to see:



     EXT. THE LAWN - FULL SHOT - (NIGHT)                    200

     There is no Time Machine.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                201

     In stunned shock.



     THE PATH - FULL SHOT                                   202

     Holding his torch high, the Time Traveller hurries
     toward the bushes around the edge of the lawn
     looking for his Machine, beating the branches with
     his free hand.  After he passes one of the bushes,
     a white indistinct creature dashes out of it and
     disappears in the darkness.  Unaware of this, the
     Time Traveller stops in the mindle of the lawn
     where the Machine was last seen.

     (NOTE:  The surrounding is suggestive of the spot
             where the Time Traveller's house once stood.)

     He looks about, slowly turning in a complete circle.
     Meanwhile the CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE.  Then, sud-
     denly remembering, he digs his free hand into the
     pocket of his trouser, drawing out the lever he
     had removed and looks at it with self-assurance.
     Returning the lever to his pocket, he drops to his
     knees and by the light of his torch, scrutinizes
     the grass.



     THE GROUND - TIME TRAVELLER'S P.O.V.                   203

     The turf has been ripped in parallel grooves as
     though some heavy object had been dragged across.
     CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY FORWARD following these grooves
     and HALTS where small misshapen, half-human foot-
     prints stand out clearly in the freshly turned
     earth.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           204

     He straightens slowly, his eyes narrowed.
     Nervously he looks around, then steps on follow-
     ing the grooves.



     BACK TO THE FOOTPRINTS                                 205

     THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO FOLLOW the grooves
     straight across the lawn to the flagstones around
     the white sphinx.  There are dark scratches on the
     stones leading to the wide panel in the base of
     the pedestal.  Here the marks end.



     AT THE PEDESTAL - MED. SHOT                            206

     The Time Traveller pauses, then gives the panel an
     exploratory KNOCK.  It responds with a HOLLOW SOUND.

     The Time Traveller thrusts his torch between the
     claws of the sphinx.  With both hands now free,
     he tries unsuccessfully to push the panel either
     to right or left or up or down.  Taking a penknife
     from his pocket, he runs the blade around the panel's
     edge hunting for a secret latch.  No success.

     Then he pauses, searching for a tool, and sees a
     loosened flagstone.  He picks it up.  With this
     heavy weight he batters the panel.  At each blow
     it RESOUNDS LOUDLY, not unlike a gong.  Four times
     he strikes, and then on the fifth blow the rock
     shatters in his hands.  He stops in despair.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                207

     He senses he is under observation by an unseen
     presence.  Alarmed, he whips around then looks up
     to:



     THE SPHINX - LOW ANGLE - (MINIATURE OR MATTE)          208

     The marble face looks baleful, almost smiling in
     the torch light.



     BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 209

     He turns and peers toward:



     THE BUSHES                                             210

     In the shadows, beyond reach of the light, is a
     wide semi-circle of luminous eyes, reflecting the
     flame of the torch.



     TIME TRAVELLER - FULL SHOT                             211-213

     He grabs his torch from the pedestal and slowly
     paces toward the nearest bush.  But as he ap-
     proaches, the glowing eyes vanish in the haze,
     followed by a ghostly impression of pale,
     fleeing creatures.

     The Time Traveller halts and turns in another
     direction.  The same thing happens.

     Then he has an idea.  Bending, he beats the torch
     against the moist soil and extinguishes it.  Now
     in the darkness he straightens and waits, peering
     around until he hears a twig CRACK, then moves
     into the deep shadow of a tall bush, looking off.



     THE PATH                                               214

     Through the mist in the foliage a pale figure
     approaches slowly.  It emerges onto the lawn.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             215

     The CAMERA FOLLOWS as he leaps forward, grapples the
     other figure and bears it to earth.  For a moment
     there is a struggle and then the other figure lies
     perfectly still.  The Time Traveller rears back to
     get a look at it.



     THE FIGURE ON THE GROUND - EXTREME CLOSE SHOT          216

     It is Weena.  The moving shadow of the Time Traveller
     reveals her pale face, with closed eyes, wearing an
     expression of helpless terror.  She appears to be
     waiting for the inevitable end, but when it does
     not come, she slowly opens her eyes.  She sees the
     Time Traveller and her face records a wave of
     relief.

     The CAMERA WITHDRAWS TO TWO SHOT as the Time
     Traveller, embarrassed, helps her sit up.

                         WEENA
               I heard you pounding...I came to
               tell you...

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               How do you open that panel?

                         WEENA
               No one opens it.  Only the Morlocks.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Morlocks? - Who are the Morlocks?

     A look of fear comes into her eyes.  She drifts
     her gaze away from his, too frightened to answer.
     Gently he takes her by the shoulders and turns
     her to face him.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Why are you afraid of the Morlocks?

     Again Weena drops her eyes from him, but he cups
     his hand beneath her chin and tenderly turns her
     head back so that her eyes meet his.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Tell me.

                         WEENA
               When they call, we must go below.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Do the Morlocks live beneath the
               earth?
                    (Weena nods)
               Why must you obey their command?

                         WEENA
               They give us the food we eat, the
               clothes we wear.  We must do as
               they command.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What happens to your people when
               they go below?

                         WEENA (repressing an in-
                    voluntary shudder)
               No one knows.  No one has ever
               returned.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (smiling
                    at her warmly, reassuringly)
               It won't happen to you.

     Weena looks up at him, her fears dwindling, find-
     ing comfort in this strange being whom she cannot
     understand.  Then she glances high into the dark sky
     and the old fear returns.

                         WEENA
               It is night.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Only children are frightened by
               the dark. - But then you are a
               child, aren't you?
                    (Weena glances around
                    warily into the shadows,
                    her anxiety mounting)
               I'll build a fire.

                         WEENA (taking his
                    hand, rises)
               Let us go from here.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (getting
                    up)
               I can't, child.
                    (walking toward the sphinx)
               My Machine is inside there, I
               intend to wait here 'til morning,
               then find some way of getting
               inside.

                         WEENA (catching up)
               No, you must not.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (stops,
                    then)
               Help me gather some wood.

     Reluctantly she helps him collect a few twigs which
     she hands over to him.

                         WEENA
               Where are you from?

                         TIME TRAVELLER (picks
                    up dry branches)
               As a matter of fact, I'm from
               right here.
                    (gesturing)
               There's where my house stood many
               thousands of years ago.  Here - to
               that monument, was my laboratory.
               About there was my library where I
               once sat talking with friends about
               my Time Machine.

     Meanwhile, Weena has seated herself near the
     bushes in the f.g.

     She watches every move he makes.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
                    (continuing)
               I hoped to learn a great deal.  I
               hoped to take back the knowledge,
               the advancement, mankind made...
               instead what do I find?  Vegetables!

     Meanwhile a pair of pale, hairy hands rise slowly
     from behind her.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             219

     With his back turned, he is piling up the sticks.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (continuing)
               The human race reduced to living
               vegetables!



     BACK TO WEENA                                          220

     The hairy hands grab her shoulders.  The fear
     paralyzes her.  She is unable to scream.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 221

     He is about to light a match, but finds he needs
     more wood.  Without turning he calls back to Weena.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Get me a few more twigs.

     When there is no answer he turns and looks.



     AT THE BUSHES                                          222

     Weena is gone.  The CAMERA ZIPS TO LEFT, then to
     RIGHT and finally STOPS on the limp legs of Weena
     slowly disappearing under the brush.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           223

     We hear the RUSTLING OF BRANCHES and quick DIMINISHING
     FOOTSTEPS as the CAMERA RUSHES with the Time Traveller
     toward the bush.  He helps Weena to her feet and draws
     her to the pile of dry branches.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (after calming her)
               What was it?

                         WEENA (low)
               Morlocks.

                    match and holds it to twigs)
               This seems to keep them away.

     She gazes into the fire, with fascination.  Slowly
     she raises her hand and reaches out to grasps the
     flame.



     TWO SHOT                                               225

     The Time Traveller grabs her hand.  It is almost
     too late.  She looks at her burned hand with more
     amazement than pain.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (while
                    examining her hand)
               What ever made you put your hand in
               the fire?

                         WEENA
               I never saw it before.

     Apparently no harm done, the Time Traveller releases
     her hand.  He shakes his head in amazement and sits
     down beside her.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (after a long silence)
               Do you know that the first thing
               which separated man from the rest
               of the mammals was his knowledge of
               fire?
                    (he looks at her)
               No, I suppose you don't.
                    (pokes at fire)
               The next great stride came with
               the discovery of the wheel.
                    (turns to her)
               Do you know what that is?
                    (she shakes her head)
               I'm sorry I was angry with your
               people.  I had no right to be.
               No more than if I had visited the
               Island of Bali in my own time.
               You were safe inside your great
               house, yet you came out into the
               night to warn me.  The one
               characteristic which distinguished
               man from the animal kingdom was the
               spirit of self sacrifice.  You have
               that quality, Girl.  I'm sure all
               of your people have it.  All it
               requires is someone to reawaken it.
               I shall try if you'll let me.  Will
               you?

                         WEENA
               I do not understand you, but I
               believe you.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               That's a good start. - Now try to
               tell me...who or what are the Morlocks?
                    (Weena looks at him blankly)
               Are they people or animals?
                    (her expression remains unchanged)
               What do you know about yourself?  The
               past?  Don't your people ever speak
               of the past?

                         WEENA
               There is no past.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Don't you ever wonder about the future?

                         WEENA
               There is no future.



     ANOTHER ANGLE                                          226

     The Time Traveller is staring into the fire stirring
     the glowing embers as he speaks slowly and with
     compassion, hoping to arouse some feeling within
     her, even though she may not grasp the meaning of
     the words.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Man's past is mainly a grim struggle
               for survival, but there have been
               moments when a few voices have spoken
               up.  These rare moments have made the
               history of man a glorious thing.  I
               refuse to believe it is dead and gone.
               We've had our dark ages before and
               this is only another of them.  All
               you need is for someone to show you
               the way out. - I'm only a tinkering
               mechanic, but there must be this
               hidden spark in one of your people.
               If I can only kindle that spark, my
               coming here will have some meaning.

     During his speech Weena has cuddled close to him,
     her cheek touching his knee.  He looks down at her
     and sees he has made a friend.  He places his hand
     gently on her hair.  She looks up, her eyes no
     longer showing fear.  Their faces are illuminated
     by the dancing flames.



     THE FIRE - CLOSE SHOT                                  227

     It CRACKLES reassuringly.

                                     SLOW DISSOLVE TO:



     EXT. WELL - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                          228

     The ring of flames from the previous scene is
     seemingly replaced by a dark, circular shaft from
     which comes the low THROBBING of some GIANT
     MACHINES, pounding, beating monotonously.  The
     CAMERA MOVES BACK to include the LANDSCAPE
     where more wells are visible in the distance,
     each surrounded by a low, porcelain wall.  Their
     roofs are shining brass-like disks.

     Across the field, from the direction of the sphinx,
     approach the Time Traveller, carrying his jacket
     over his shoulder, and a few steps behind, Weena.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               My efforts next morning to open the
               panel were fruitless.  I had to find
               another way to retrieve my Machine.

     Weena, concerned, stands back as the Time Traveller
     walks up to the well in the f.g. and peers down into:



     THE SHAFT - HIGH ANGLE                                 229

     It descends into darkness, but near the top can be
     seen handholds in an irregular pattern.  The
     THROBBING OF MACHINES is ominous.



     AT THE MOUTH OF WELL - FULL SHOT                       230

     The Time Traveller in the f.g. turns back to Weena.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Listen!
                    (pause)
               Do you hear?

                         WEENA (fearfully)
               Yes.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Machines!

                         WEENA
               No...Morlocks.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (straightening, amazed)
               You mean those animals run machines?

                         WEENA
               They are Morlocks.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (as he walks to her)
               I know, but have you seen the
               machines?



     CLOSE ON WEENA                                         231

     She shakes her head.

                         WEENA
               No, only heard of them.

     The CAMERA EASES BACK to include the Time Traveller
     as he reaches her.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Who told you?

                         WEENA
               The talking rings.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (moves closer to her)
               What sort of rings?

                         WEENA
                    (with a shrug)
               Rings that talk.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Can you show me these rings?

     Weena nods and starts off.  He follows her.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:



     INT. GREAT HALL - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                    232

     Deserted, until Weena leads the Time Traveller past
     the tables toward the shelves of crumbling books
     that the Young Man had previously shown him.

     She enters an archway and walks up a dark stone
     corridor.  He follows.



     INT. STONE CORRIDOR - MED. SHOT                        233

     Weena leading the Time Traveller up the corridor
     where it veers sharply to the right.  They disappear
     around the corner.



     INT. GREEN MUSEUM - LONG SHOT - (DAY) - (MATTE)        234

     The Time Traveller and Weena stop at the threshold of
     a huge museum-like room, all done in a greenish
     colored porcelain-like substance.  There are no
     windows, but the vaulted ceiling has a transparent
     dome where the sun's rays, changing with the course
     of day, illuminate the entire museum.  It is
     evidently a place that no one bothers to visit.



     TIME TRAVELLER & WEENA - MOVING SHOT                   235

     Their feet kick up small flurries of dust as they
     walk among exhibitions of a long bygone era still
     existent behind plastic.  Some of the cases are
     broken and their contents, exposed to the atmos-
     phere, have decayed, crumbled to dust.  We recognize
     objects and machines, some belonging to the early
     part of the twentieth century and still others take
     on the forms and shapes that the audience of today
     will recognize as contemporary.  Then they pass
     cabinets that hold objects of a time far beyond
     comprehension.

     Weena finally leads the Time Traveller to a broken
     case which contains several boxes of golden rings
     a few inches in diameter and one inch wide, lined
     with minutely spaced grooves.  He picks up the
     nearest box and examines its contents.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
                    (picking up a ring)
               Are these the talking rings?

                         WEENA
               Yes.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               They speak?

                         WEENA
               Yes.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Of what?

                         WEENA
               Things no one here understands.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               How do you get it to talk?

     Weena takes the ring from the Time Traveller and
     lays it on a smooth topped porcelain block on its
     edge, like a coin, and spins it like a top.



     INSERT:  WHIRLING RING                                 236

     A VOICE emerges from the spinning ring as the current
     of air flows through its grooves, much like a phono-
     graph needle evokes sound as it plays through the
     surface of one of our records.

                         VOICE FROM RING
               Whomsoever chances upon these rings
               will probably hear the last recorded
               voice of civilized man.  This is the
               year four thousand eight hundred and
               twenty-nine.



     TWO SHOT                                               237

     The Time Traveller is listening in fascination and
     Weena in disinterested detachment.

                         VOICE FROM RING (cont'd)
               The war between the East and West,
               which is now in its three hundredth
               and twenty-sixth year has at last
               come to an end.  There is nothing
               left to fight with and few of us
               left to fight.  The atmosphere has
               become so polluted with deadly
               germs that it can no longer be
               breathed.  There is no place on
               this planet that is immune.  The
               last surviving factory for the
               manufacture of oxygen has been
               destroyed.  Stockpiles are rapidly
               diminishing and when they are gone,
               we must die...

     The last few WORDS DECREASE IN VOLUME and FADE AWAY.
     The Time Traveller eagerly reaches into the case for
     the second ring and spins it.

                         ANOTHER VOICE FROM RING
               This is the last day.  We, the last
               to survive, have had our final meeting.
               We have decided to split into two
               groups.  Each man and woman has made
               his own decision.  Some have chosen
               to take refuge in the great caverns
               and find a new way of life far down
               below the earth's surface.  The rest
               of us have decided to take our chances
               in the sunlight, small as those chances
               may be.

     The VOICE from the ring DWINDLES and is heard no
     more.  The Time Traveller quickly picks up the
     third and last ring and spins it.  NO WORDS are
     heard -- only the SOUND of MARCHING FOOTSTEPS over
     floors of stone -- then a deadly SILENCE.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                238

     As he watches the last ring spin to a standstill.
     Over this:

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               From the talking rings I learned how
               the human race divided itself and
               how the world of the Eloi and Morlocks
               began.

     He turns.



     GREEN MUSEUM - LONG SHOT                               239

     The Time Traveller paces across the hall.  Weena
     hurries after him.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               By some quirk of fate the Morlocks
               had become the masters and the Eloi
               their servants.  The Morlocks main-
               tained them and bred them like cattle
               only to take them below when they
               reached maturity, which explained why
               there were no older people along them.

     They exit.



     GREAT HALL - FULL SHOT                                 240

     The Time Traveller, followed by Weena, walks from
     the book shelves toward the entrance.

                         TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
               Now I knew I must go below.  It was
               the only means of finding a way up
               into the sphinx to reach my Machine
               and to find out what happened to the
               little people when they went below.

     They leave the Great Hall.



     EXT. LANDSCAPE - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                     241

     The Time Traveller strides toward one of the wells.
     Weena senses his intention and catches up with him
     to grasp his arm.

                         WEENA
               No...don't go...please.

     He shakes her off.



     AT MOUTH OF WELL - MED. SHOT                           242

     The Time Traveller places his jacket on the wall.
     Then into the well he drops a dry leaf which, instead
     of fluttering slowly down, is at once sucked out of
     sight by the current from the shaft.  Then he looks
     around and finds a pebble, drops it down the well and
     listens.

     After a PLOP is heard he puts his arm down the
     shaft as far as it goes, feeling its surface, then
     throws his leg over the porcelain wall and starts
     to descend.  Weena rushes to his side to stop him.

                         WEENA
               You will not come back.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               I'll be back.

     Weena shakes her head and, as though giving him
     a farewell gift, thrusts a large blossom into his
     pocket.  The Time Traveller smiles as he dis-
     appears.



     FROM THROAT OF WELL - LOW ANGLE                        243

     Locking from below, the top of the well appears
     like a small blue disk with Weena peering down.
     The Time Traveller gropes his way.

     Suddenly from the far distance comes the SOUND of
     LOW but POWERFUL SIREN.  Weena straightens.



     CLOSE ON WEENA                                         244

     An expression of fear comes slowly over her face
     as the LOW SIREN is joined by ANOTHER of HIGHER
     PITCH.  The Two make a grating dissonance.  Slowly
     she turns in the direction of the sound.



     BACK WITH TIME TRAVELLER                               245

     He looks up, concerned, pausing in his descent.



     BACK TO WEENA                                          246

     As the THIRD DISCORDANT BLAST joins the other two,
     Weena's fear is gone.  In its place is an expres-
     sion of utter resignation.  Like someone in a
     trance she opens her eyes and stares straight
     ahead.  Then, as though she is summoning all her
     strength to go through some ordeal, she starts
     walking away.  The CAMERA PANS and we see the breeze
     ripple her silken robe about her as she moves.

     (NOTE:  During the above and throughout the follow-
             ing sequence the dirge-like WHISTLES
             CONTINUE, ECHOING mournfully.)



     REVERSE SHOT                                           247

     Weena is walking forward and disappears behind the
     trees as the Time Traveller emerges from the well
     in the b.g.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                248

     Looking for Weena.  She is nowhere to be seen.
     His face shows exasperation, bewilderment.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Weena!  Where are you, Girl?



     WEENA - FULL SHOT                                      249

     She continues to walk toward the source of the
     SIRENS.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           250

     The DIRGE-LIKE MELODY becomes LOUDER, pulsating,
     as he pauses to watch:



     EXT. EDGE OF FOREST - LONG SHOT - (DAY)                251

     Emerging from the forest are two Eloi, a man and
     a woman.  They are several paces apart and pay no
     attention to one another.  Both have exactly the
     same manner as Weena.  They walk along, eyes
     straight ahead, faces expressionless.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                252

     As he looks ahead, then left and right, searching.



     VARIOUS GROUPS OF ELOI - (SPLIT?)                      253-254

     In the open country now, the forest behind them.
     In their colorful robes, the Eloi march slowly
     across the green landscape.

     All are converging toward a single point somewhere
     ahead.



     WEENA AMONG ELOI                                       255

     They walk close together, paying no attention to one
     another, following the command of the MELANCHOLY
     STRAINS OF THE SIRENS.



     BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 256

     His concern has turned to apprehension as he tries
     to grasp the meaning of what he observes.



     EXT. THE SIRENS ON THE SPHINX - FULL SHOT - (DAY)      257
     (MINIATURE)

     It is the source of the sound.  There are little
     bursts of vapor from the tops of the sirens as
     they repeat their tones, like a fantastic pipe
     organ behind the Sphinx.



     TIME TRAVELLER AND ELOI                                258

     All of them walk in the same direction.  The Time
     Traveller looks this way and that, bewildered.
     But the Eloi disregard him and march straight
     ahead, eyes forward.

     The Time Traveller breaks into a run.



     TWO SHOT                                               259

     The Time Traveller overtakes the Young Man, seizes
     his arm and jerks him to a halt.  Around them pass
     the shadows of the marching Eloi.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What's happening?  Tell me!

     The Young Man shows no emotion as he struggles to
     free himself.  His movements are almost mechanical.
     This unnerves the Time Traveller.  He stares at
     him, releasing his grip.

     The moment the Young Man is free, he faces about
     and continues his march.  The Time Traveller re-
     mains motionless, watching him go.  The ECHOING
     SIRENS are now getting on his nerves.



     EXT. ENTRANCE TO THE GREAT BUILDING - LONG SHOT -      260
     (DAY)

     The Eloi pour out of the Great Hall, walking in
     a trance-like state.



     EXT. LANDSCAPE - EXTREME LONG SHOT - (DAY) - (SPLIT?)  261

     From all directions the Eloi in their bright robes
     are moving, singly and in long files.  The impres-
     sion is one of vastness -- a feeling that mankind
     is marching to some unknown doom.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           262

     He spots a girl, rushes up, grabs her from behind.
     But it is not Weena.  Disappointed, he releases
     her, then goes on again, covering his ears with
     his palms, fighting to retain command of his own
     reason.



     SEVERAL SHOTS OF THE SIRENS - (MINIATURE)              263-265

     At various angles -- up, sideways, tilted.  The
     WAILING is DEAFENING.



     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                266

     He still strives to control himself, moves forward,
     then pauses in amazement, looking straight ahead.



     EXT. THE SPHINX - FULL SHOT - (DAY) - (MATTE)          267

     It is toward the white sphinx that the Eloi have
     been marching.  But now the panel, upon which the
     Time Traveller had pounded so hard, is wide open,
     revealing a dark entrance into the pedestal.

     And despite their previous repugnance to the
     Sphinx, all of the people are now marching across
     the lawn resolutely to it.



     AT THE PEDESTAL - LONG SHOT                            268

     The Young Man is the first to reach it.  He enters
     the wide opening and starts descending into sub-
     terranean darkness.  Others follow, Weena among
     them.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (o.s.)
               Weena!

     Without hearing him she passes through the entrance.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           269

     He desperately pushes forward, elbowing his way
     past others in his haste to overtake Weena.  The
     crowd impedes his progress and he shoves the
     Eloi impatiently aside as he fights on.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (shouts in
                    despair)
               Weena!



     THE PANEL                                              270

     Slowly closing and the sound of the SIRENS gradually
     DIES AWAY.  The Time Traveller reaches the panel as
     it shuts tight before he can touch it.  He spreads
     his palms against it in despair, then turns to face
     those Eloi who, like him, are locked outside.  What
     he sees astonishes him.



     GROUP OF ELOI                                          271

     They no longer approach the sphinx.  The ceasing of
     the sirens seems to have released them from their
     hypnotic spell and now, awake again and frightened,
     they are retreating.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 272

     As he goes after them to the edge of the flagstones
     and calls out angrily.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Stop!



     BACK TO ELOI                                           273

     Featuring the Man in White in the f.g.  They halt
     and stare back.  The Time Traveller's voice comes
     over like a whip.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (o.s.)
               What are you running from?

     None of the Eloi answer.



     TOWARD THE SPHINX - FULL SHOT                          274

     Beyond several Eloi the Time Traveller stands in
     the shadow of the white sphinx.  He steps slowly
     forward onto the lawn, looking around the big
     semi-circle of his audience.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (sharply,
                    gesturing back toward the panel)
               Where have they gone?
                    (no answer)
               What happens to them?
                    (no answer)
               Don't stand there like a fatted
               cattle grazing contentedly in lush
               pastures. - Answer me!  What's
               wrong?

                         MAN IN WHITE (calmly)
               There is nothing wrong.  It is all
               clear.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What do you mean, all clear?

                         MAN IN WHITE (repeating)
               All clear!

                         TIME TRAVELLER (thinking
                    rapidly, talking to himself)
               Once....in the middle nineteen
               hundreds I heard a man...
                    (it bursts upon him)
               The falling bombs!
                    (to the Man in white
                    and the crowd)
               That's over.  Gone.  Dead for
               hundreds of thousand of years.
               There are no more flying machines.
               No bombs.  No wars!

                         MAN IN WHITE
               Yes, the rings have told us that
               story.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED SHOT                              275

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               But you didn't listen.  You didn't
               learn anything.  All that is left
               is fear...a blind animal fear.
               Ages ago men were taught to hide in
               the ground when the sirens blew...
               taught to run from a raining death...
               but those men are dead!  And so are
               the men who slaughtered them.  Don't
               you understand?
                    (looks around pleadingly)
               You are slaves of a dead past... You
               don't even own your souls.  You're
               led to slaughter like sheep!

                         MAN IN WHITE (o.s.)
               But there is nothing to fear now,
               it's all clear.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               What about those who went below?
               How are they to come back?



     MAN IN WHITE                                           276

     He looks ominously at the Time Traveller.

                         MAN IN WHITE
               They never come back.  Nobody can
               bring them back.

     Unimpressed, the crowd begins to disperse, the Man
     in White following them.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 277

     Calling after them.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               You can try.  Won't any of you
               even try?

     He sees that the situation is hopeless.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (almost
                    to himself)
               Well, someone has to try!

     He runs off.



     SERIES OF SHOTS                                        278

     The Time Traveller running through the forest.         (a)

     He is laboring up the open hillside.                   (b)

     The Eloi in a semi-circle silently watch.  A few       (c)
     of them hesitantly start after the Time Traveller.



     EXT. THE WELL - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                      279

     Arriving, the Time Traveller pauses to catch his
     breath, picks up a piece of wood that could serve
     as a torch, then jumps over the wall and starts
     to descend.

     Over this a faint THROBBING OF MACHINES can be
     heard.



     SHOOTING INTO SHAFT - HIGH ANGLE                       280

     The Time Traveller climbs down, gripping the walls
     with his hands and feet.  The depth beneath him is
     dizzying.  THROBBING LOUDER.



     IN THE WELL - FULL SHOT                                281

     As the Time Traveller descends, the CAMERA FOLLOWS
     him, step after step.  The deeper he goes, the darker
     it becomes and the THROBBING OF MACHINES INCREASES as
     well.

     Suddenly a rock gives beneath his weight.  He barely
     saves himself.  Not without fear he pauses to rest,
     glancing upward.



     FROM THE THROAT OF WELL - LOW ANGLE                    282

     A couple of the curious Eloi peer downward, watching
     the Time Traveller's progress.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 283

     A metal ladder affixed to the wall brings him finally
     to the opening of a transverse passageway.  In almost
     complete darkness he steps from the ladder into the
     tunnel and pauses to take the piece of wood from his
     belt, but decides not to light it.  He bends and peers
     ahead.



     INT. GREAT CAVERN - FULL SHOT                          283X1

     The Time Traveller emerges onto the bridge in the b.g.,
     pausing for a moment to survey the surroundings, then
     starts slowly down the staircase carved along the wall.
     The gloom is relieved only by puffing smoke and waver-
     ing lights, revealing occasionally vague shapes and
     grotesque shadows.

     (NOTE:  DRIPPING WATER from the walls and THROBBING OF
             MACHINES punctuate the desolation of this
             scene as well as the following sequence.)



     CLOSE ON T.T. - MOVING SHOT                            283X2

     Walking, he notices an opening ahead and cautiously
     moves toward:



     INT. ENTRANCE TO FEASTING ROOM - FULL SHOT             283X3

     At the threshold of this dark, silent cell the T.T.
     pauses, then slowly enters.  Behind him, across the
     cavern, an indistinct figure watches, but quickly
     disappears as the T.T. strikes a match.  The sight
     that the T.T. beholds fills him with revulsion and
     horror.



     THE FEASTING ROOM - T.T.'S P.O.V.                      283X4

     This is obviously a feasting place of the Morlocks.
     In the flickering light we see stone tables and
     scattered around the floor far below the unmistak-
     able remains of human bones after the flesh has been
     carnivorously picked away.

                         T.T.'S VOICE
               So, this was the destiny of the
               Eloi.



     CLOSE ON T.T.                                          283X5

     His features twisted in horror in the flickering
     light of his match.

                         T.T.'S VOICE
                    (continuing)
               They were being bred like cattle
               by the Morlocks who had degenerated
               into the lowest form of human
               life...cannibalism.

     The match dies between his fingers.  Suppressing a
     shudder, the T.T. turns and as he leaves this chamber
     of horror, the rock behind him comes to life.  A pale,
     spectral Morlock crosses the screen in the f.g.
     descending.  Another in the b.g. does likewise.



     MACHINES - FULL SHOT                                   283X6

     Morlocks, their indistinct bodies obscene in their
     mockery of the human form, labor endlessly tending
     the needs of their machinery.  They look up toward the
     intruder as they HEAR his APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS, then
     hide.



     STAIRWAY - MOVING SHOT                                 283X7

     The T.T. slowly descends the slender stone stairway
     that hugs the sheer wall.  Meanwhile at the base of
     the feasting room under the stairway on which the T.T.
     is moving a Morlock moves a curtain aside and reveals
     itself.  It silently watches as another Morlock
     appears at the top of the stairs and follows.

     Passing near the T.T.'s hiding place.  Weena and the
     Young Man are side by side.



     AT THE MACHINES                                        283X16

     The Morlocks who followed the T.T. are closing in.



     BACK TO T.T. - MOVING SHOT                             283X17

     He is unaware of the Morlocks behind him.  Hugging
     the rock, he makes his way to the closest possible
     point where he can still remain unobserved by the
     herding Morlocks and get Weena's attention.  He
     reaches out.

                         T.T.
               Weena!

     But she continues on with complete resignation to her
     fate.  Unmindful of his own safety, he leaves his hid-
     ing place and grasps her by the shoulders.

                         T.T.
                    (shaking her)
               Girl!
                    (he turns and grasps the
                    passing Young Man)
               Come to your senses!  All of you!

     As the T.T. pulls Weena toward the staircase, the
     Young Man follows.



     FOOT OF STAIRWAY                                       283X18

     Morlocks block the escape.



     THREE SHOT                                             283X19

     The CAMERA MOVES with the T.T., Weena and the Young
     Man as they are forced to retreat.



     AT ENTRANCE OF FEASTING ROOM                           283X20

     Where other Morlocks with CRACKING WHIPS herd the Eloi
     into the chamber of horrors.

     One of the Morlocks spots the T.T., Weena and the
     Young Man.  He swings his whip.



     BACK TO THREE SHOT                                     283X21

     The CAMERA MOVES with them as vicious CRACKING
     WHIPS drive them back to the entrance of the
     feasting room.



     TWO SHOT                                               283X22

     The T.T. tries to protect Weena.  Suddenly a long
     lash of a whip strikes like a serpent and coils
     about the T.T.'s neck.  He drops his unlit torch
     and whirls in pain.

     Another whip scares Weena into the chamber of
     horrors, while several other whips land on the T.T.'s
     shoulders.  Finally he grabs the whip from around
     his neck and jerks it, wrenching it free.



     AT THE ENTRANCE OF FEASTING ROOM                       283X23

     The T.T., wielding the whip fiercely, drives the
     Morlocks back several paces, then suddenly from
     above a pale body of a Morlock lands on him,
     knocking him down, causing him to drop the whip.
     On the ground the cowardly Morlock stumbles
     away leaving the T.T. a prey to the battery of
     CRACKING WHIPS.  He crawls in pain into the
     chamber of horrors.



     GROUPSHOT INSIDE FEASTING ROOM                         283X24

     The T.T. comes to his feet among the Eloi.  The
     WHIPS HAVE STOPPED, then the silence is broken by
     the GROWL of approaching MORLOCKS.  Through the
     curtains, dark shapes swarm toward them.  Then
     suddenly the T.T. pulls out his matchbox from his
     pocket.  A match flares!



     GROUP OF MORLOCKS                                      283X25

     In the glare of yellow light we see the leprous
     figures of blinded Morlocks, dropping their whips,
     shielding their eyes.



     THROUGH MORLOCKS'S EYES - (OPTICAL EFFECT)             283X26

     The T.T.'s hand with the burning match rapidly zooms
     into the center of the picture in a BLINDING FLASH
     turning the screen momentarily white, then yellow
     and red.  Then the CAMERA MOVES BACK indicating the
     Morlocks' retreat.  Slowly the normal colors
     reappear.



     BACK TO THE GROUP OF MORLOCKS                          283X27

     Regaining their sight in the darkness, they start
     to close in.



     THROUGH MORLOCKS'S EYES - (OPTICAL EFFECT)             283X28

     Followed by the Eloi the T.T. exits the feasting
     room and again lights a match.  A BLINDING FLASH
     starting from the flame as a center engulfs the screen,
     momentarily white again, then yellow, finally red.
     Once more the CAMERA RETREATS, then still seeing
     through the Morlocks' eyes the CAMERA ZOOMS CLOSE
     ON THE MATCH BOX and the scaley hand of a Morlock
     slaps all the matches except one to the floor.



     T.T. - MED. SHOT                                       283X29

     He lights his last match and moves forward, looking
     for his lost torch.



     GROUPSHOT                                              283X30

     The T.T. leads the Eloi toward the stairway, the
     light of the match his only weapon in keeping the
     Morlocks away.  Finally he spots his torch and
     picks it up hurriedly.



     CLOSE ON T.T.                                          283X31

     His face streams with sweat and is taut with appre-
     hension while he applies the dying match to the
     intended torch.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (muttering)
               Burn, will you!

     He holds the match steady, but it burns lower and
     lower without starting the wood.  In despair he
     turns to Weena.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Quick, something to burn!  It's
               my last match!



     BACK TO THE MORLOCKS                                   283X32

     As they are closing in.



     CLOSE ON WEENA                                         283X33

     With a fierce gesture she rips open the loose sleeve
     of her robe, tears off a piece of cloth and holds
     it out.



     BACK TO T.T.                                           283X34

     As match is about to die, he holds it beneath the
     cloth.  It flames up and he seizes it, dropping the
     dead match.

     He holds the burning cloth beneath the wood and
     in this hotter flame it begins to burn.  Once it
     starts he again attempts to make his way by blind-
     ing the Morlocks and leads the Eloi to the stairway.



     GROUPSHOT                                              283X35

     As the Eloi slowly make their way toward the stairway,
     one Morlock gains courage, and with his long whip
     strikes the torch out of the T.T.'s hand.



     A CORNER                                               283X36

     The torch rolls in and begins to sputter.



     BACK TO SCENE                                          283X37

     The Eloi huddle against the wall in terror as other
     Morlocks gain courage and move forward toward the
     T.T.  As they face one another, the fight begins.



     [PAGE 90 MISSING FROM HARD COPY]



     Eloi below him.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Weena!  Weena, get the torch!



     CLOSE SHOT - WEENA AND YOUNG MAN                       351X5

     Huddled against rock - React to fight - Weena
     looks quickly toward the Time Traveller, then
     turns searching for the flickering torch.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 351X6

     As he turns to fight with Morlock on ledge.
     Morlock swings at him.  He ducks and almost
     falls off ledge.  He grabs Morlock, and hangs
     on until he can scramble up on ledge again.
     He clutches at Morlock's throat, banging his
     head against the rock wall, finally throwing
     him off ledge.  At the same time another Mor-
     lock appears on ledge, while the Morlock he
     had previously kicked rises to menace him from
     the other side.  The Time Traveller jumps across
     cavern to ramp and starts down toward the floor,
     trying to get back to his torch, his only weapon
     against the Morlocks.



     CLOSE SHOT - THE TIME TRAVELLER                        351X7

     He pauses momentarily against Rock Wall.  He
     sees Eloi, still huddled in a group, apparently
     too confused to move.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Weena!  Go on!  Go on the
               steps!



     CLOSE SHOT - AT ROCK - WEENA AND YOUNG MAN             351X8

     Weena spots the still flickering torch and
     starts toward it.



     INSERT OF TORCH                                        351X9

     Lying on ground, still burning, Weena bends
     down to pick up torch, when suddenly a Morlock
     appears facing her.  She screams and jumps back,
     watching in terror, as the Morlock comes toward
     her.



     MED. SHOT                                              351X10

     The Time Traveller comes down ramp to meet several
     Morlocks converging on him.  He tries to fight his
     way past them.



     CLOSE SHOT - WEENA AND YOUNG MAN                       351X11

     Morlock rushes in, grabs Weena and carrying her
     over his shoulder starts across toward Feasting
     Cave.



     MED. SHOT - TIME TRAVELLER                             351X12

     JUMPS up on ramp, kicks back at Morlocks - sees
     Morlock carrying Weena - JUMPS through Morlocks
     and runs toward her.



     FULL SHOT                                              351X13

     The Time Traveller runs to Weena, pulls her away
     from Morlock, knocks him against rock.  In the
     meantime another Morlock runs up on rock and
     jumps at Time Traveller, knocking him down.
     The second Morlock rebounds from rock and leaps
     on the Time Traveller and starts to choke him.



     CLOSE SHOT - TIME TRAVELLER                            351X14

     Looks up toward YOUNG MAN - silently appeals for
     help.



     CLOSE SHOT - YOUNG MAN                                 351X15

     Stancing in front of group of Eloi returns the
     Time Traveller's silent plea for help.  Slowly
     raises his right hand, stares at it as he
     gradually clenches it into a fist.  Then, making
     up his mind, raises both hands and strikes Mor-
     lock hard on the back of his neck.



     MED. SHOT                                              351X16

     As Morlock relaxes his grip the Time Traveller
     kicks him back to rock, scrambles up and runs
     to get his torch.  Several Morlocks try to herd
     Eloi back into Feasting Cave, but led by the
     Young Man and his newly discovered strength, the
     Eloi resist them.  The Time Traveller runs back
     in with torch, and herd the Eloi toward stairs.



     FULL SHOT                                              351X17

     The Time Traveller urges the Eloi up the stairs
     pushing Weena ahead of him.  They climb up past
     Cauldron.  Morlocks come in after fleeing Eloi,
     shielding their eyes from the light of the Time
     Traveller's torch.



     CLOSER SHOT                                            351X18

     The Time Traveller looks ahead to be sure the
     Eloi are all on their way out.  Then turns back
     and drops his torch into the oil flowing into
     the Cauldron.



     FULL SHOT                                              351X19

     The burning torch catches the Cauldron on
     fire, which quickly spreads across the floor
     of the Cavern, to the steaming Machine on
     the right, which explodes.  The Time Traveller
     herds Eloi out across Stone Bridge.



     MED. SHOT                                              351X20

     Pursuing Morlock runs up steps in back of
     burning Cauldron hiding his face from the
     flames.  He bumps into the Pipe coming down
     the wall, loses his balance and falls into
     the burning Cauldron - Flames shoot higher.



     PAN SHOT                                               351X21

     Another Morlock comes from behind machine, as
     fire creeps across floor, almost reaches machine
     at same time as fire - and it explodes.  Morlock
     catches fire and runs across into Feasting Cave.



     PASSAGEWAY - LONG SHOT                                 352

     Smoke is thick as the Time Traveller and Weena
     run toward a circle of light on the floor far
     ahead.



     CIRCLE OF LIGHT - HIGH ANGLE                           353

     Weena and the Time Traveller reach the light
     that comes straight down from above, and look
     up the shaft.  Smoke belches from the passage-
     way as he helps her start up the ladder and
     then he, himself, follows, clambering out of
     sight.



     IN THE WELL                                            354

     The CAMERA FOLLOWS Weena and the Time Traveller
     climbing up, COUGHING from smoke.  The light
     becomes slowly brighter and he looks up.



     FROM THROAT OF WELL - LOW ANGLE                        355

     Gradually the top of the well becomes visible
     through the swirling smoke.  The Young Man is
     peering down.  He reaches to help Weena and the
     Time Traveller.



     SHOOTING INTO SHAFT - HIGH ANGLE                       356

     Weena and the Time Traveller are both dark with
     soot, near exhaustion.  Far below them red flames
     pierce through the smoke.  They each in turn grasp
     the helping hand of the Young Man and climb up out
     of the well.



     EXT. THE WELL - MED. SHOT - (SUNSET)                   357

     As their eyes meet, the Time Traveller grips the
     Young Man's shoulder and gives it a brief shake
     of approval.

     The Time Traveller then grabs up branches and twigs,
     carries them to the mouth of the well, ignites the
     pile of kindling with his torch and drops the burn-
     ing wood down in to the well.



     SHOOTING INTO SHAFT - HIGH ANGLE                       358

     The burning wood drops to the bottom where it ignites
     the oil with a burst of flame that shoots up the well.



     BACK TO SCENE                                          359

     The Time Traveller picks up his jacket and points to
     the other wells.  The Young Man first, then the rest of
     the Eloi grasp the idea.  They also light branches
     from the torch and dash for the various wells to
     duplicate the Time Traveller's action.



     VARIOUS SHOTS OF ELOI                                  360-362

     Carrying bundles of burning wood to the mouths of
     wells and dumping the fire below.



     TWO SHOT                                               363

     With Weena at his side, the Time Traveller gazes on
     with approval at the Eloi's work.



     EXT. LANDSCAPE - FULL SHOT - (SUNSET)                  364

     It is dotted with wells, each of which has been
     turned into a fiery furnace shooting flames and
     smoke up from the burning oil below, preventing
     the Morlocks from any avenue of escape to the
     surface of the Earth.



     A WELL - (MINIATURE)                                   365

     It falls with a CRASH to the ground and begins to
     spew smoke and flame into the undergrowth of the
     forest nearby.



     EXT. ENTRANCE TO GREAT BUILDING - LONG SHOT -          366
     (SUNSET)

     Smoke drifts out of its windows.  The Eloi hurry
     out, led by the Man in White.  They stop and stare
     at the sight of the Morlock world being destroyed
     below.



     EXT. THE BLAZING FOREST - (SUNSET) - (STOCK)           367-368

     The sun on the horizon is a dim red ball through
     the smoke.  Several trees fall over, blazing.  LOW
     UNDERGROUND RUMBLING is heard.



     WEENA AND THE TIME TRAVELLER                           369

     They start down the hill after the Eloi, seeking
     safety together.  Suddenly a DISTANT RUMBLE OF THE
     EARTH makes them pause and look o.s.



     EXT. LANDSCAPE - FULL SHOT - (DUSK) - (MINIATURE)      370

     Then comes a SERIES OF TREMBLORS, each more powerful
     than the one before.  The earth shudders and the
     blazing forest begins to collapse.  It does
     not explode into the air.  Rather, the solid
     earth seems to give way so that the entire
     surface of the ground begins to fall into the
     subterranean chambers.



     ANOTHER ANGLE - (MINIATURE)                            371

     A section of the earth sheers away and falls
     in an ever widening rift.



     A WELL - (MINIATURE)                                   372

     As it is swallowed by the earth, followed by a
     belch of steam.



     BACK TO LANDSCAPE - (MINIATURE)                        373

     Leveled off by the earthquake.  There are no more
     flowers, no more buildings, wells, smokestacks or
     obelisks.  There is no movement -- only the
     flickering of low flames and the smoke driven by
     the gentle breeze.



     GROUP OF ELOI                                          374

     Staring into the vast destruction.



     TIME TRAVELLER AND WEENA                               375

     He holds her hand.  The CAMERA MOVES IN SLOWLY and
     we begin to hear the

                      TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
                 (calmly)
             The underworld of the Morlocks was
             gone...and so was the life of leisure
             for the Eloi.

     He looks o.s.



     GROUP OF ELOI                                          376

     The Man in White, with others, approaches the group
     headed by the Young Man.  The two men look at each
     other, their gestures and expressions showing their
     joy at release from centuries of fear.

                      TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
             From now on they would have to work
             to survive.  And looking at their
             faces, I somehow knew that they could
             start over again.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER AND WEENA                       377

     He looks down to Weena and we HEAR:

                      TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
             Another night was coming, but this
             night no Eloi needed to fear.

     The CAMERA MOVES CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER who looks
     up in concern.

                      TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE
             But what of me? - I was imprisoned
             in a world in which I did not belong.

                                  DISSOLVE TO:



     EXT. THE POOL - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT)                    378

     This is the same pool where the Time Traveller
     saved Weena's life.  The peaceful SOUND of the
     RUSHING STREAM is occasionally interrupted by a
     REMOTE RUMBLE of EXPLOSION from the earth below.

     There is no sign in the sky of old constellations,
     only the face of the full moon looks familiar.
     The Time Traveller, wearing his velvet jacket,
     relaxes on the white sand, playing with the
     blossom Weena gave him earlier that day, and
     WHISTLING "The Land Of The Leal".

     Weena sits on a large rock nearby at the edge of
     the pool, washing the soot from her face and hands.
     She glances over to the Time Traveller.

                      WEENA
             Are you sorry?

     He STOPS WHISTLING, but the MUSIC CONTINUES.
     He turns.

                      TIME TRAVELLER
             Sorry? - Sorry for what?

                      WEENA
             That you have to stay.

                      TIME TRAVELLER
                 (gazing into the night)
             Yes. - I am sorry because I could
             tell so much to the people of my
             own time... I could tell them about
             the happiness and sorrow the future
             has in store for them.  They could
             learn from it...or would they?

                      WEENA
             You don't want to stay, do you?

                      TIME TRAVELLER
             It isn't that, but I don't fit here
             anymore than you would in my time.

                      WEENA
                 (a pause, and then)
             I would like to see your time.

                      TIME TRAVELLER
             No, Girl, you wouldn't be very
             happy there.

                      WEENA
             Do you have someone like me -
             there?

                      TIME TRAVELLER
             No.  No one like you.  But there
             are friends who will miss me. - As
             a matter of fact, I'm probably late
             already.

                      WEENA
                 (stealing a glance,
                 then quietly)
             Women?

                      TIME TRAVELLER
             No, men.
                 (teasing)
             There is a woman too, of course!
                 (noticing her disappointment,
                 he relents)
             She looks after my house for me.
             She is sixty-two years old. - Much
             older than you are.

     Weena, relieved, starts to comb her wet hair
     into a new arrangement.

                      WEENA
                 (suddenly)
             How do they wear their hair?

                      TIME TRAVELLER
             Who?

                      WEENA
             The women in your time.

                      TIME TRAVELLER
                 (after a thought)
             Up!

                      WEENA
             Up? - How?

                      TIME TRAVELLER
                 (with awkward gesture)
             Like this.

                      WEENA
             Show me.

     The Time Traveller puts the flower back into his
     pocket, gets up and walks over to Weena.



     WEENA - MED. SHOT                                      379

     The Time Traveller appears behind her.  He first
     hesitates, then gently lifts her hair into a fair
     imitation of the upswept Edwardian style.  She
     smiles, then with an impulsive move turns her face
     toward him.

                      WEENA
                 (innocently)
             Would I be pretty?

     The gesture brings her eyes and lips close to his.
     He still holds her upswung hair and, as he gazes
     into her young eyes, he feels her warm breath on
     his cheek.

                      TIME TRAVELLER
                 (slowly)
             Yes...you would be.  More than
             pretty.
                 (his voice sinks to a whisper)
             I wish we could go back together,
             Weena, back to my own time...or to
             times before that when the world
             was young.  We could...

     EXCITED VOICES o.s. interrupt this interlude.  They
     both look in the direction of the voices.



     EXT. HILL - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) - (MATTE)              380

     A group of Eloi, led by the Young Man and the Man
     in White, approach them, talking excitedly,
     pointing to the ruins of the white sphinx just
     revealed by the rolling smoke.  The face is
     broken and the pedestal partly in shambles.  The
     panel is open.



     TIME TRAVELLER & WEENA                                 381

     Joyfully he grabs her hand and, pulling her,
     breaks into a run.



     GROUP OF ELOI                                          382

     The Young Man steps forward, pointing o.s.  The
     Time Traveller and Weena run through the haze,
     then the Eloi follow them.



     EXT. THE WHITE SPHINX - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) -          383
     (MATTE)

     The face is broken in half.  It is left with only
     a half a smile and thin smoke drifts through the
     remaining eye.  The rest of the statue and the
     sirens are on the ground beside the partial ruins
     of the pedestal.  Beyond it the hill is gone and
     gray haze covers the once green world.  The Time
     Traveller and Weena come through the charred
     bushes onto the lawn.  Here they stop.



     THE OPEN PANEL - THEIR P.O.V.                          384

     The Time Machine sits in the midst of the swirling
     smoke.  The flames, licking at the inside walls,
     have not yet reached the Machine.



     TIME TRAVELLER & WEENA - MED. SHOT                     385

     He releases her hand to reach into his jacket pocket
     and bring forth the lever without which the Machine
     will not function.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (without
                    looking at her)
               Come, Girl!

     He walk, toward the panel.  Weena follow,
     hesitantly, but the long habit compels her to
     halt before the threshold.  Unmindful of this,
     the Time Traveller enters.



     INT. PEDESTAL - LONG SHOT                              386

     Shooting from inside the pedestal, the Time
     Traveller and his Machine are black silhouettes
     in the foreground, while beyond him Weena stands
     on the lawn outside, the moonlight flooding her
     radiant features.

     Inside, black smoke still rises and whirls around
     as the Time Traveller examines his Machine and
     starts to fit the lever into place.



     REVERSE ANGLE                                          387

     The Time Traveller working eagerly.  A shadow
     starts sliding across his figure, moving more
     swiftly until darkness falls and the panel closes
     with a CLANG.



     OUTSIDE THE PANELS                                     388

     Weena, seeing the panels close, runs up to them
     and POUNDS her fists vainly on the metal doors.



     INSIDE THE SPHINX - MOVING SHOT                        389

     The Time Traveller leaps to the panels and struggles
     to open them.  From without he hears Weena's
     POUNDING and CRIES.  Suddenly he senses a living
     presence within the sphinx.  For a moment there is
     silence.  Then from the right comes a hacking,
     weak COUGH.  Another from the left.  Then some-
     thing STUMBLES OFF, down the stairway.  He whirls
     around, GASPING and COUGHING, to see three of the
     enmaddened Morlocks rising before him.  Avoiding
     them, he stumbles to his Machine and gets into
     the saddle.  The suffocating smoke blinds him as
     he gropes for the lever.  Morlocks seize his legs and
     try to wrest him off the Machine.  The fire and
     smoke become dense, half obliterating the struggling
     bodies.



     INSERT:  THE CONTROL PANNEL                            390

     The Time Traveller's hand gropes for the lever and
     finally grasps it.

     INSERT OF DIALS                                        404

     Spinning backwards.  Suddenly, a gloomy shade falls
     over the instruments, followed by a burst of
     whirling smoke and the twinkling red light of fire.
     There is a flash of sunshine, then finally total
     darkness.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             405

     Passing back in time through his captivity beneath
     the lava.  He reels in the saddle, then coming
     from darkness a red glow quickly engulfs the scene.
     As the red hot lava leaps away from him and the
     daylight returns, we can see that his face is
     covered with perspiration.  He looks off to see:



     SERIES OF SHOTS - (ANIMATION, MINIATURE, SPLIT)        406

     (NOTE:  These shots seen previously are now printed
             backward.)

             The red hot lava withdraws through the         (a,b,c)
             street ruins and the great rents in the
             ground gulp it up quickly.  Out of the
             ruins building are molded and then
             atomic explosions in reverse flash
             across the screen.  The SOUND OF
             EXPLOSIONS, RUMBLING ETC.  IN REVERSE
             AND SPEEDED UP join the HUMMING of the
             Time Machine.

             alternately across the sky, gradually
             slowing.



     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 407

     INTERCUT his reaction to the previous scenes until
     he straightens and readjusts the lever.  The
     HUMMING DECREASES, then walls rise about him.
     Watching the dials, he carefully moves the lever.
     The flickers of the days and nights decelerate
     and, with a sudden pull, he halts the Time Machine.
     The HUMMING ABRUPTLY CEASES.



     INSERT:  DIAL                                          408

     It stops on:  "5 January 1900".



     INT. LABORATORY - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT)                  409

     The Time Machine has returned, but it is resting
     in the far corner of the room instead of in the
     spot where we originally saw it.

     In the gloom, the Time Traveller clambers pain-
     fully from the Machine.  Then, FOLLOWED BY CAMERA,
     he staggers to the workbench and sinks onto it.
     His eyes explore the room and finally come to rest
     on the clock.  It is "8:04".

                                        SLOW DISSOLVE TO:



     PENDULUM CLOCK - CLOSE SHOT                            410

     Now showing "9:22".  For a long while only its
     MONOTONOUS TICKING is heard. - A welcome change
     from the cacophony of time traveling.

     The CAMERA MOVES slowly to reveal the DINING ROOM
     where the five men, their meal finished, are
     sitting silently around the table.  Mrs. Watchett
     is quietly serving the liqueur.  The Time Traveller
     is puffing on his pipe.  Kemp is chewing on his
     cigar and Hillyer's face is red with indignation.

                         DR. HILLYER
               It is ridiculous!  Simply preposterous!

     Filby is bent over his coffee playing absorbedly
     with the spoon which CLINKS loudly in the room's
     silence.  Bridewell, of course, takes a big gulp
     from his brandy.

                         BRIDEWELL
               Well, there's one thing I'll say
               for you, George.  You always could
               tell a good story.  Best adventure
               yarn I've heard for years.
                    (loudly)
               You're a truly fine inventor,
               George!

     He alone starts to laugh at his 'joke', but a
     hiccup quickly puts a period to that.  Mrs. Watchett
     steps to the Time Traveller to pour him a bit of
     brandy.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               I'll turn down your bed for you!

     As she exits Kemp looks up.

                         KEMP
               Truthfully, where have you been
               for the past week?

     Bridewell examines the remaining brandy in his glass.

                         BRIDEWELL
                    (voice of experience)
               Now, we shouldn't ask such questions,
               Walter.  It's not hard for a man to
               lose a week now and then.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (smiling)
               I understand your doubt.  Take it
               as a lie if you wish.  Now that
               I'm back I scarcely believe it
               myself.
                    (a flash of memory)
               Except that...
                    (groping in pocket)
               ...here are the flowers Weena gave
               me.

     He places the blossoms on the table before Filby.
     They are actually less than a day old and fairly
     fresh.



     FILBY AND THE BLOSSOMS - CLOSE SHOT                    411

     As he picks them up to examine.

                         TIME TRAVELLER (o.s.)
               A present for you, David.



     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             412

                         TIME TRAVELLER (to Filby)
               You were always interested in
               botany. - Try to match them with
               any species known today.



     BACK TO FILBY                                          413

     As he looks up, puzzled.

                         FILBY
               I don't think I can.



     GROUP SHOT                                             414

     A still unimpressed Hillyer slams his hands on
     the table, stands up, looks around and then down
     to Kemp.

                         DR. HILLYER
               Are you coming, Kemp.

     Rising hesitantly, Kemp turns to the Time Traveller.

                         KEMP
               It's getting late and you look
               exhausted.  You had better get
               some rest.

     Everyone gets up, Bridewell with difficulty, and
     starts to leave.



     COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) - (MATTE)                415

     The snow falls softly, big flakes wobbling down
     from the sky.  The front door opens letting out
     the four guests wearing hats, capes and overcoats.
     They walk toward a waiting carriage, Kemp helping
     the staggering Bridewell.  Filby is the last to
     leave.  He pauses at the step of the carriage
     looking back to the Time Traveller who stands
     motionless in the doorway.

                         FILBY
               Goodnight, George.



     AT THE ENTRANCE                                        416

     The Time Traveller lifts his hand and waves.

                         TIME TRAVELLER
               Thank you, David, for being such
               a good friend - always.

     With this he turns and goes into the house, closing
     the door slowly.



     AT THE CARRIAGE                                        417

     Those inside are waiting for Filby to get in,
     but he, deep in thought, still stands gazing back.
     Kemp thrusts his head from the window.

                         KEMP
               What do you think, Filby?

                         FILBY (after a pause)
               One thing is certain.  Those
               flowers couldn't have possibly
               bloomed in the winter-time.

                         HILLYER (in the b.g.)
               You don't really think that story
               was true?

     Filby reaches a decision.

                         FILBY
               Look, you chaps go on.  It's
               just a short walk home for me.

                         HILLYER (o.s.)
               Go on, driver!

     The WHIP CRACKS.



     THE DRIVEWAY                                           418

     As the carriage rolls off leaving Filby standing
     in the falling snow.  He waits until the carriage
     disappears, then retraces his steps to the front
     door and raps on it.  He pauses a moment, then
     uses the heavy knocker.  There is still no answer.
     He steps back and looks off toward the:



     EXT. LABORATORY WING - FILBY'S P.O.V.                  419

     No light shines through its windows.



     BACK TO FILBY                                          420

     He raps once more, and getting no reply tries the
     door.  It is unlocked.  He steps into the house.



     INT. LIBRARY - FULL SHOT                               421

     The coals still glow in the grate as Filby enters
     the fully lit room, looking for his friend.
     Suddenly a clock from the neighboring room CHIMES
     ONCE.  Filby turns, goes toward it and stops at
     the doorway.



     DINING ROOM - FILBY'S P.O.V.                           422

     The table is cleared, candles extinguished.  The
     pendulum clock is TICKING lazily.  The time is
     "9:30".



     FILBY - PANSHOT                                        423

     He calls into the darkness.

                         FILBY
               George!...

     No answer.  Then an odd HUMMING sound brings
     him to stiff attention.  The SOUND INCREASES in
     VOLUME and PITCH until the entire house seems
     to tremble.  Then a violent gust of wind blows
     open the door that leads to the laboratory.

     Filby pivots and runs up the steps, through the
     corridor.



     AT THE DOOR OF LABORATORY - FULL SHOT                  424

     Filby, dishevelled and out of breath, arrives
     and tries the door -- it is locked.  The NOISE
     is almost DEAFENING.  He puts his shoulder to
     the door and finally bursts it open.  At the
     very instant he does so, the SOUND CEASES abruptly.
     He stops short, gazing aghast.



     THE LABORATORY - FILBY'S P.O.V.                        425

     The Time Traveller with his Machine FADING,
     leaving the present.

     Then the CAMERA MOVES ACROSS the workbench to the
     corner where we last saw the Time Machine.  It is
     not there!  The CAMERA WHIPS to the other corner.
     Nor is it there!  A few sheets of paper whirl
     desolately in the center of the floor.



     CLOSE ON FILBY                                         426

     He looks tense, ignoring the APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS
     behind him.  Mrs. Watchett hurries in.

                         MRS. WATCHETT (nervous,
                    breathless)
               Oh, Mr. Filby...what...
                    (her eyes widen)

                         FILBY (with finality)
               He's gone!

     The CAMERA FOLLOWS Mrs. Watchett as she slowly
     approaches the center of the room.  Here, with
     squinting eyes, she leans down to observe the
     floor.

                         MRS. WATCHETT (to
                    Filby)
               There's something funny here, sir!

     Filby steps aside her to investigate.



     WHAT THEY SEE                                          427

     The CAMERA MOVES ALONG parallel grooves resembling
     the ones the Time Machine left in the lawn at the
     front of the sphinx.  They are scratched deep in
     the floor leading from the spot where the Machine
     was last seen to the other corner of the laboratory
     where it originally stood.  Here, not only its
     imprint, but also the color and finish of the
     floor is preserved.



     TWO SHOT                                               428

     They straighten.  Mrs. Watchett looks at Filby,
     puzzled.

                         FILBY
               I think I understand. - Look!



     LABORATORY - FULL SHOT                                 429

     Mrs. Watchett listens as Filby moves to the imprint
     in the floor where the Machine first stood and
     explains.

                         FILEY (pointing)
               See the imprint?  This is where
               the Time Machine originally
               stood.
                    (he paces across to the
                    end of the grooves)
               But the Morlocks moved it.
               They dragged it across the lawn
               right into the sphinx...right
               here.
                    (turns and points)
               And Weena was standing there when
               he last saw her...the same space -
               in a different time. - So he moved
               back his heavy Machine from here,
               across the room, scratching this
               floor...
                    (indicating the grooves
                    that lead to the imprint)
               So that he can appear outside the
               sphinx again and help the Eloi
               build a new world...and build a
               new world of his own.

                         MRS. WATCHETT (faintly,
                    sentimentally)
               Where he left her!..

     Filby doesn't answer.  He looks about the labora-
     tory for the last time, then takes Mrs. Watchett's
     arm and leads her from the room.  The MUSIC STARTS
     THE THEME:  "The Land Of The Leal".



     INT. LIBRARY - FULL SHOT                               430

     Filby and Mrs. Watchett come into the room.

                         FILBY
               But it isn't like George. - To
               return empty handed.  To try to
               rebuild a civilization without
               a plan.
                    (to Mrs. Watchett)
               He must have taken something
               with him.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Nothing.

     She looks around and discovers three empty spaces
     on the tightly packed book shelves.  She walks to
     them.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Nothing except three books.

                         FILBY
               Which three books?

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               I don't know. -- Is it important?

                         FILBY (smiles)
               No, I suppose not. - Only...what
               three books would you have taken?

     She looks at him, pondering the question as they
     leave the library.



     INT. ENTRANCE HALL                                     431

     They stop at the door and Mrs. Watchett stands
     beside Filby as he opens it.  Outside the snow
     is falling softly.

                         MRS. WATCHETT
               Mr. Filby, do you think he will
               ever return?

                         FILBY (quietly)
               One cannot choose but wonder. -
               You see...he has all the time in
               the world!

     With these words, Filby turns up his collar, pulls
     the brim of his hat over his eyes and walks into
     the night.  Mrs. Watchett looks after him.  She
     hears the SOUND of his DIMINISHING FOOTSTEPS
     SQUEAKING in the virgin snow.  Slowly she closes
     the door.



     EXT. COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) - (MATTE)           432

     Drifting like a curtain, the snow falls quietly
     as Filby, a solitary figure in the night, pauses
     a moment to look up at the sky, then selects a
     path and starts walking the long way home.

                                            SLOW FADE OUT.



                          THE END

                                "TOTAL RECALL"

        FADE IN:

1       EXT. DESERT - DAY

        All we can see, filling the entire frame is a flame-orange
        sky...almost like the sky from the burning of Atlanta in
        "Gone with the Wind".

        SUPERIMPOSE:  Presenter credit.

        PAN DOWN lower and lower until we see the terrain below...
        the desert.  There is no vegetation whatever, just sand and
        odd-shaped rock formations.  The air is filled with red dust,
        which alternately obscures and then reveals the image.
        CAMERA MOVES FORWARD optically - enlarging the film grain in
        the process.

        SLOW DISOLVE

        OPENING CREDITS BEGIN.

        ANOTHER SHOT of a barren landscape, once more with bizarre
        rocks.  Dust.  Sound of wind.  CAMERA MOVES FORWARD again.
        DISSOLVE.

        ANOTHER LANDSCAPE, but this time, in the distance are some
        enormous plastic domes.  Sunlight striking them and reflect-
        ing causes brilliant rainbows.  CAMERA optically tracks
        toward the dome, seen in tantalizingly indistinct fashion
        through the red dust.  DISSOLVE...

        ANOTHER ANGLE, and, in the distance, on the horizon of the
        arid landscape is a huge SPHINX-LIKE STRUCTURE.  (It is
        reminiscent of the Egyptian sphinx, but both body and face,
        though gargoyle-like, are different in design.)  There are
        some large pyramids not far from the sphinx.  CAMERA MOVES
        optically FORWARD.  DISSOLVE.

        CAMERA is much closer to the sphinx and is directly in front.
        It moves (combination of zoom and optical printer move)
        towards the eyes, which appear to be red gems.

        As CAMERA APPROACHES one of the eyes, it appears to be
        stained red glass, as in a temple.  Suddenly there is a
        terrific explosion and the glass shatters into millions of
        fragments which hurtle toward the camera...


2       INT. CATACOMB BELOW "SPHINX" - DAY

        A MAN wearing a LIGHTWEIGHT THERMAL SUIT is RUNNING THROUGH
        THIS LABYRINTH of TUNNELS.  The GROUND TREMBLES under him,
        as if in an earthquake.  We cannot clearly make out his face,
        especially since he wears some kind of BREATHING APPARATUS
        over a portion of it.

        The surface of the tunnel's "walls" is curious;  the walls
        are, again, bright reddish orange, and a composite of two
        different substances:  rough-textured, clay-like material
        and red quartz, which glistens like crystal.

        The man throws a backward glance over his shoulder, fear-
        fully, as he runs.  His HANDS are SPLATTERED with BLOOD.
        Because of this, the RED GLOW, the air of FEAR to the man,
        and the GROUND HEAVING and BUCKLING, there is almost a
        SATANIC suggestion to the scene.

        Suddenly, up AHEAD of the man, there appears a BRILLIANT
        WHITE LIGHT.  He SEES IT, and runs even faster towards it.

        We are ALMOST UP TO THE LIGHT, and we SEE HANDS REACHING
        OUT OF THE LIGHT TOWARDS US... that seem to beckon him to
        SAFETY.

        ABRUPTLY, the ENTIRE SCREEN GOES RED, BUT IN REVERSE NEGATIVE;
        with YELLOW LAYOVERS.  (So that all the images we see --
        ENTIRE FRAME -- are small YELLOW AREAS diffused on a RED
        BACKGROUND.)  It is much like looking at a tableau made out
        of molten lava.

        SUPERIMPOSE MAIN TITLE:

                                TOTAL RECALL

        HOLD.

3       INT. BEDROOM IN SMALL APARTMENT - MORNING

        DOUGLAS QUAIL and his wife KRISTEN, are asleep in bed.

        Gradually the room lights BRIGHTEN.  The CLOCK CHIMES and
        begins SPEAKING in a soft, feminine voice.

                                 CLOCK
                           (sweetly)
                   Tick, tock, seven o'clock.  Time
                   to rise and open your eyes.

        They don't budge.  Shortly, the clock CHIMES again.

                                 CLOCK
                           (continuing)
                   Tick, tock, seven-oh-one.  Time
                   to get up, the day had begun.

        Quail's wife stirs.  Maddeningly, the clock CHIMES a third
        time.

                                 CLOCK
                           (continuing)
                   Tick, tock --

        Quail reaches out and shuts the clock off.  Then he sits up
        in bed.

        He swings his legs out from under the covers and sits on the
        edge of the bed.  He puts on his glasses and sits, lost  in
        thought.

        He is a good-looking but conventional man in his early
        thirties.  He seems rather in awe of his wife, who is
        attractive and rather off-hand towards him.

        Kirsten pulls on her robe, lights a cigarette, sits fishing
        for her slippers.

                                 QUAIL
                   I dreamed about Mars again... it
                   was bizarre, yet is was so real...

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (casual)
                   It's your time of the month again.

        Quail looks at her quizzically.

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (continuing;
                            world-weary air)
                   At least once a month.  Douglas
                   Quail's obsession.  For twelve
                   years you've been talking about
                   Mars.

                                 QUAIL
                   People do go to Mars, you know.

                                 KIRSTEN
                   That's right, Douglas.  But not
                   you.  Not us.

        Quail looks crestfallen.

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (continuing;
                            disdainful)
                   As it is, we can barely scrape by
                   on your lousy ten thousand a week.

        She leaves the room.  He meditates on what she said,
        depressed.


4       INT. KITCHENETTE - MORNING

        Quail and Kirsten sit at a small table, eating breakfast.
        On the WALL is projected the front page of a NEWSPAPER.

        Drinking his coffee, Quail studies the wall with the air
        of a man who had his "node stuck in a newspaper," ignoring
        his wife.

        The newspaper headline reads:  "RIOTING ON MARS OVER WATER
        TAX."

        His wife is reading a different article:  "Four Women Rape
        Man in Park."

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (mumbling)
                   What do they expect ... the
                   way men dress these days ...
                   then they scream rape.

        Quail is absorbed in his own paper and doesn't hear her.

                                 QUAIL
                   You know -- let's really do it.

                                 KIRSTEN
                   Rape men in the park?

                                 QUAIL
                   No.  Go to Mars.

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (withering)
                   Go to hell.

                                 QUAIL
                   We can pool our savings and
                   I've got some sick leave
                   coming, besides my regular
                   vacation...

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (interrupting;
                            corrects herself)
                   ...more of a half-wit.  For
                   a start a war could break out
                   there any day ...

        She gestures toward the TV screen where Martian police
        are keeping protesters behind a barrier.  Some have signs
        reading "A FREE MARS", "DOWN WITH COHAAGEN", "EARTH - OUT"
        etc.

                                 QUAIL
                   That's just media talk.  They're...
                           (indicating
                            the protesters)
                   ...just a minority.  They're
                   powerless.

                                 KIRSTEN
                   Well, there's a lot of things
                   we need around here before
                   we waste our money on a trip
                   to Mars.  We're broke.  I'm
                   just a slave around this dump.
                   Now if you were capable of
                   finding a better job....

        The kitchen clock chimes and talks.

                                 CLOCK
                   It's now eight.  You'll be
                   late!

                                 QUAIL
                   I'll be late!

        He jumps up quickly from the table, picks up his coat and
        briefcase, kisses KIRSTEN's perfunctorily offered cheek
        and leaves.


4A      EXT. CITY - EARLY MORNING

        CAMERA TRACKS with Quail as he walks along the busy modern
        street towards a subway station.  Modern cars (out of focus)
        pass noiselessly between the camera and Quail.  There is a
        plaintive tune being played on violin.  Quail pauses and
        gives a wad of notes to the aged violinist, then walks on
        briskly.


5       INT. SUBWAY STATION - EARLY MORNING

        Quail enters the station.  Everybody must pass through a
        weapons check before proceeding to the platforms.

        TWO ARMED GUARDS stand at either side, as commuters pass
        through an electronic beam.  On a screen, the entire body
        of each person is seen in X-ray.  All of them are clearly
        carrying a gun in their inside coat pocket.

                                 GUARD
                   No weapon again, Mr. Quail?

                                 QUAIL
                   I keep forgetting, Herb.  They
                   frighten me.

                                 GUARD
                   Yeah?  Well, it's the law,
                   Mr. Quail.  Has been since
                   1990 they tell me.  Tomorrow -
                   ya carry ya gun or ya get
                   reported.

        GUARD gestures to his associate.  They've obviously been
        through this with Quail before.

                                 QUAIL
                   Okay.  Herb, okay.

        Quail walks on to the track area.  The train arrives.
        Signs above each approaching car say "CAR FULL", "ROOM
        FOR 10 PERSONS", etc.  Quail goes to a carriage marked
        "NEW CAR".


6       INT. URBAN TRANSIT TRAIN - DAY

        The doors open and the crowd surges on.  Quail grabs a
        seat.  At intervals throughout the car are VIDEO MONITORS
        on which a NEWS BROADCAST is showing.

                                 NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                   -- more violence today from Mars's
                   strike-torn ore colonies --

        Everyone ignores the broadcast -- except Quail, who perks
        instantly at the word "Mars."

        The NEWSCASTER is a young black man.

                                 NEWSCASTER
                           (continuing)
                   ...but Earth Intelligence Operations
                   Director Vilos Cohaagen, clearly
                   worried about the damage to Mars's
                   all important tourist
                   industry was today dismissive
                   of the dissident groups....

        TV scene switches to a press conference.  COHAAGEN, sur-
        rounded by AIDES, steps in front of a podium packed with
        news network microphones and cameras.  Cohaagen is a
        striking, intense man with an obvious air of power.

                                 COHAAGEN
                  We're dealing with a bunch of
                  extremists and unrepresentative
                  lunatics.  Mars is a happy and
                  prosperous protectorate of Earth...
                  and will remain so.

        The train stops at another station and more people pile on.
        Quail tries to watch the broadcast through the bodies
        passing in front of him and intermittently blocking the
        image.

                                 REPORTER (V.O.)
                   There have been some criticisms,
                   sir....

                                 COHAAGEN
                   I have no further comment.

        The news conference ends and a bright looking young man
        comes on the screen.  Quail continues to watch, though
        not as interested, initially, as he was by the Mars story.
        Few of the other passengers bother looking at the screen.

                                 ANNOUNCER
                   Good morning, commuters.  This
                   portion of your trip is brought
                   to you by Rekall, Inc.  Do you
                   have a dream that never came
                   true?  Do you aspire - but
                   only perspire?  Has the great
                   adventure passed you by?  Then
                   come to... REKALL, where what
                   might have been will have been.
                   For the memories of a
                   lifetime... REKALL.

        Quail watches the commercial through to the end, but doesn't
        seem to take it very seriously.  He glances away as a card
        comes on the screen with REKALL's numbers.


6B      INT. QUAIL'S OFFICE - DAY

        Quail is seated at a computer console in a vast beehive
        of a room.  Numerous people are typing information onto
        the screens.  Quail pauses in his typing, thoughtful.  He
        then types in a little more information, then pauses again.
        On the screen, a sentence types itself...

        WHY HAVE YOU STOPPED?  REQUEST MORE INFORMATION.

        Quail read it and continues.


9       INT. McCLANE'S OFFICE - REKALL - DAY

        Scene opens on a CU of McCLANE, a genial, bubbling, enthus-
        iastic man.

                                 McCLANE
                   We're all dreamers, Douglas.
                   But here at Rekall, dreams
                   are our business.

        He presses a button on his desk and the chairs on which
        they are seated appear to be in outer space.  Countless
        stars glitter all around.  Startlingly, a comet whizzes by.
        Quail is amazed.  McClane grins and presses the button
        again.  The scene changes to a beautiful underwater coral
        reef.  Multi-colored fish swim around the chairs and desk.

                                 QUAIL
                   But... is the process really
                   that effective?  A false
                   memory!?

                                 McCLANE
                           (shaking his head;
                            smiling)
                   We prefer the term "extra-
                   factual implant".  Your
                   memory will be complete in
                   every way.  You will have
                   gone to Mars.  We guarantee
                   that.

                                 QUAIL
                   Is it in any way dangerous?
                   I mean, the medical techniques?

                                 McCLANE
                   Not when you deal with
                   qualified operators - like
                   us.

        He presses the button again and the normal office returns.
        Quail looks around, impressed.

                                 QUAIL
                   It's just - incredible.

                                 McCLANE
                   And look at our follow-up
                   program!

        He puts items on the desk as he talks.

                                 McCLANE

                   we plant these things where
                   you'll come across them at
                   random in the future.

                                 QUAIL
                   But... I'll know I hired you.
                   That'll destroy the whole
                   illusion.

                                 McCLANE
                           (smiling; self-
                            satisfied)
                   But you won't remember me, or
                   having been here.

                                 QUAIL
                   I won't?

                                 McCLANE
                   Your money back if you do!
                   We've never paid out yet.

        Quail slumps backs in his chair, overwhelmed.

                                 McCLANE
                           (continuing)
                   And we have a special this
                   month, for only two-hundred
                   thousand dollars more.

        At the press of a button, a list appears on the wall...

        A14  MILLIONAIRE PLAYBOY
        A15  SPORTS HERO
        A16  INDUSTRIAL TYCOON
        A17  INTELLIGENCE AGENT

                                 McCLANE
                           (continuing)
                   You can have a new identity
                   for the duration of the trip.
                   Pick one.

        Quail's eyes linger on "Intelligence Agent."

                                 QUAIL
                   "Intelligence Agent"... wouldn't
                   that be dangerous?  I might
                   attack....

                                 McCLANE
                           (airily)
                   No.  No.  You're a retired
                   agent.  Mars was your last
                   mission and you're never to
                   break your cover.  But you'll
                   have got the girl, killed the
                   baddies, and saved the
                   Universe.  Not bad, eh?

                                 QUAIL
                   I don't know... about the
                   whole thing... it's all such
                   a fake.  I won't really have
                   gone.  I won't really....

                                 McCLANE
                           (kind but firm)
                   Let's face it, Douglas, you,
                   and millions of people like
                   you have no chance of ever
                   getting to Mars and you'd
                   never qualify as a secret
                   agent for EIO.  This - REKALL
                   - is the only way to achieve
                   your dream.

        He gets up and walks around to Quail's chair.

                                 McCLANE
                           (continuing)
                   Think about it, Douglas.
                   Think, too, what a terrible
                   boor a real holiday is.
                   Lost tickets, endless arguments,
                   lousy hotels, missed connections,
                   rotten weather... Rekall will
                   supply you with perfect, happy
                   memories.

        Quail is thoughtful, willing to be totally convinced.


9A      INT. QUAIL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

        Quail is sitting, distracted, in an uncomfortable modern
        chair.  Kirsten is watching a near-pornographic film on
        TV.  She casually lights a cigarette.

                                 QUAIL
                   You know that's illegal.

                                KIRSTEN
                   Yeah?  Who's going to report
                   me?  You?... wimp....

        She watches a torrid love scene on the video.

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (continuing)
                   Screwing around's illegal,
                   too.  But just give me half
                   a chance...

        Quail looks at her with distaste.  His expression changes
        to one of resolve.


10      INT. MEMORY STUDIO - DAY

        Quail is stretched out on a plush reclining couch, alongside
        some strange-looking lab equipment, wearing a hospital-type
        smock.  In the b.g. hovers a TECHNICIAN, adjusting some
        instrumentation (discreet banks of computers, etc.) -- that
        apparently relates to the lab equipment next to Quail.  The
        room in a dim, soothing booth, lit by indirect lighting.

        Quail looks a little concerned as he studies all the
        instrumentation next to him -- as one always does at the
        dentist's, looking at the drills.

        The door opens abruptly, in walks a cute-looking LITTLE
        OLD LADY, wearing a JOGGING SUIT.  (A RUTH GORDON-TYPE.)

                                 OLD LADY
                   Hi, I'm Doctor Sophie Lull.
                   Sorry I'm late.
                           (walks toward
                            coat closet)
                   I'll be right with you.

        She dons a white medical smock that covers her jogging
        suit, then slings on heavy, lead-lined protective vest.

                                 QUAIL
                           (looking at
                            instrument
                            console)
                   This really going to work?

                                 LULL
                   It the Pope Martian?

        Lull's assistant, the TECHNICIAN in b.g., who had been
        steadily working on the instrumentation, now looks over
        at Lull.

                                 ERNIE (TECHNICIAN)
                           (at machine)
                   Okay -- that's it.

        Now, Lull extends a long rubber tube, a hypodermic needle
        attached to it.  Quail eyes it warily.  She swabs the back
        of his hand in preparation, notices his apprehension.

                                 LULL
                   Now, just relax, kid.  This
                   ain't gonna hurt.  Just a
                   controlled drip of Narkadine.
                   When you're under, I'll just
                   ask ya a few questions, nothin'
                   real personal, just full
                   details of yer private life
                   so's we can tailor the
                   wish-fulfillment program to
                   your needs.

        She injects the needle into his hand as she speaks, tapes
        it down.

                                 LULL
                           (continuing)
                   See?  Painless.  I didn't feel
                   a thing.  Hey, you're a nice
                   kid... you like a little
                   somethin' extra?

        Quail, embarrassed, starting to go under, nods.

                                 LULL
                           (continuing;
                            pleased)
                   Good!  Kid -- have I got a
                   girl for you!  She's gonna
                   like you.  You're good-lookin'.
                           (beat)
                   Gettin' sleepy?
                           (he nods)
                   Good.  Now, what's the first
                   thing you think of when you're
                   thinkin' about Mars?

                                 QUAIL
                           (wistfully)
                   Well... I'd like to see the
                   Martian Sphinx...

                                 LULL
                   Okay -- you will, Dougle!  I
                   want ya to start counting
                   backwards from a hundred for
                   me.

                                QUAIL
                           (sleepily)
                   One hundred... ninety-nine...
                   ninety-eight... ninety-seven...
                   ninety-six... ninety-five....

        His voice drops off; his eyes close.  Lull studies him,
        adjusts some instruments, then turns to Ernie, glancing
        briefly at a typed sheet in front of her.

                                 LULL
                   Okay, Ernie, the trip to Mars;
                   number sixty-two... and throw
                   in that blonde... We'll give
                   him a real good time.

                                ERNIE
                   Sixty-two... and... the blonde...

        He takes two discs and inserts the first one into a machine.

                                 ERNIE
                   Boy, is this one wild.  He
                   won't want to come back.

        Ernie inserts the second disk.

                                 LULL
                   Dougie?  This Sophie Lull.
                   Can ya hear me?

                                 QUAIL
                   ...Sophie....

                                 LULL
                   Good! ... I'm gonna ask ya
                   a few more questions now.  Ya
                   think you'll be able to
                   answer 'em?

                                 QUAIL
                   ...Yes....

                                 LULL
                   Attaboy!  To begin with, I
                   wanna ask ya; -- You sex
                   life.  How many orgasms a
                   week?


11      INT. McCLANE'S OFFICE - DAY

        McClane has several file drawers open and is removing diverse
        objects and placing them on his desk.

        These items apparently are objects Rekall, Inc. intends
        to "plant" for some client of theirs to find (perhaps
        even Quail) -- as part of his fantasy.

        While he is putting these things on his desk, the PHONE
        BUZZES.  He answers it.

                                 McCLANE
                   Yes?

                                 LULL (V.O.)
                           (filtered;
                            tense)
                   Howie?  Listen, you'd better
                   get in here.

                                 McCLANE
                           (not too
                            concerned)
                   Not another schizoid embolism.

                                 LULL (V.O.)
                           (filtered)
                   You'd better get in here.


12      INT. MEMORY STUDIO - DAY

        McClane come quickly in, brushing the swinging door open.

        Lull and Ernie look up as he enters.  Quail lies on the
        couch, breathing slowly and regularly, his eyes closed.
        McClane looks queryingly at Lull, who motions him to
        silence.

                                 LULL
                           (bends over
                            Quail)
                   Quail?  Dougie, can you hear me?

                                 QUAIL
                   Yes.

                                 LULL
                   Tell McClane what you told us.

        McClane glances sharply at Lull, then turns to Quail.

        Quail's eyes open and scan the room.  They settle on
        McClane.  These eyes have changed:  they have become
        cold and steely.  In fact, Quail's entire personality
        seems to have changed -- his face has acquired a flint-
        edged hardness.  He is chillingly menacing.

                                 QUAIL
                           (a deadly
                            voice)
                   All of you in this room are
                   dead.

                                 McCLANE
                           (not quite
                            taking it
                            seriously)
                   What's he talking about?

                                 QUAIL
                   You've broken my cover.

                                 McCLANE
                   What is this?...

        McClane's eyes flash angrily at Lull.

                                 LULL
                   The Narkadine cracked a memory
                   cap.  Mars --
                           (she's scared)
                   He's really been there.

        There is a chilly silence in the room as McClane digests
        this.

                                 McCLANE
                   Forced suppression?

                                 ERNIE
                   With spontaneous breakthrough.

                                 McCLANE
                   Holy shit.

        They stare at Quail as if he's a ticking bomb.

                                 QUAIL
                           (coldly)
                   You've compromised the Sphinx
                   Project.  You'll have to be
                   silenced.

        Now they're all panicked.

                                 McCLANE
                   Wait a minute.  Quail --

                                 QUAIL
                   My name isn't Quail.

                                 McCLANE
                   Listen... whoever you are...
                   sir....
                           (almost
                            pleading)
                   ...This is all an accident.
                   We'll destroy all the records.
                   No one will know.  I swear it.
                   Believe me.

                                 QUAIL
                   I believe you, but that won't
                   stop E.T.O. from killing you.

        The Rekall people stare at each other in quiet horror.

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   Killing you... killing you...
                   killing you....

        His voice trails off, his eyes close.

                                 LULL
                           (intensely)
                   He wants a false memory
                   implanted -- of a trip he
                   really took.
                           (pause)
                   Someone at Earth Intelligence
                   Operations erased his memory.
                   All he know was going to Mars
                   meant something special to
                   him.

                                 ERNIE
                   What do we do?  Graft a false
                   memory pattern over the real
                   memory of the same thing?

                                 LULL
                           (shaking her
                            head)
                  Uh-uh... That could promote
                  a partial breakthrough of
                  the real trip.

                                 McCLANE
                           (overlapping)
                   Revive him without any false
                   memory implantation and get
                   him out of here.

                                 LULL
                   Why don't we just wipe out
                   the memory of his visit
                   here?

                                 McCLANE
                           (nodding;
                            relieved)
                   Yes.  Good.  I'll destroy
                   his file and cancel his fee.
                   I have a feeling that the
                   longer he doesn't know who
                   he is, where he's been,
                   where he's going and who we
                   are, the better off we'll
                   all be.  I'm taking a holiday.
                   A real one.

        He leaves.  The others stare after him, looking very grim.


12A     INT. RECEPTION AREA OF REKALL - DAY

        A dazed and disoriented Douglas Quail comes out of an
        inner door and walks through the lobby towards the exit
        door.

        An attractive RECEPTIONIST, her bare breasts visible
        through a clear plastic blouse, watches him; she then
        looks toward McClane who has half-opened the door to view
        Quail's progress.


12B     INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

        Quail travels down.  Uncomprehendingly, he looks out at
        the city.


12C     INT. BUILDING FOYER - DAY

        Quail stumbles through the fairly crowded foyer, oblivious
        to anything around him.  A red-headed man may or may not be
        watching him.  He makes a phone call from a pocket phone.


12D     INT. ROBOT TAXI CAB - AFTERNOON

        Scene open on Quail, in the back of the cab; he looks
        around, slowly coming to his senses.

                                 QUAIL
                   Where am I?

                                 DRIVER
                   Travelling south along Third
                   Avenue, passing Fourty-third
                   street.

        Although the driver's voice is a little mechanical (flat
        in tone) he is filmed from Quail's POV, and it isn't
        obvious he is anything other than an ordinary cab driver.

                                 QUAIL
                   Where am I going?

                                 DRIVER
                   Thirty-three thirteen "G"
                   Street, Sector "L", Twin
                   Towers, Apartment six-thirty-
                   five.

                                 QUAIL
                   How did I get here?

        Camera now cuts to a shot in front of the driver.  He is
        a fairly human-like robot.

                                 DRIVER
                   I don not understand the
                   question, sir or madam.

                                 QUAIL
                   How did I get into this cab?

                                 DRIVER
                   You stepped into it in the
                   normal manner, sir or madam.


15      INT. CORRIDOR OF QUAIL'S APARTMENT - DAY

        The reception area and hallway leading to the elevators is
        smart and clean, though not lavish.  A uniformed and armed
        DOORMAN is standing by the entrance door.

        Filmed from the elevator end of the area, we see the cab
        pull up and Quail alight and enter the building.  He nods
        to the doorman and approaches the elevators.  As he reaches
        them a MAN steps out from behind the camera.  A 2ND MAN
        enters from a door opposite the elevators.  Quail looks
        at them and becomes quite panicky.

                                 1ST AGENT
                   Aren't you the man from Mars?

        He takes a modern, lethal gun from his pocket.  Quail turns,
        but the other man is behind him.

                                 2ND AGENT
                   Don't give us a reason to
                   kill you.

        Quail looks toward the doorman, who is paying little
        attention to the events.  As the two men edge Quail towards
        the door, he call out...

                                 QUAIL
                   Mr. Zimmer...Mr. Zimmer...
                   help me... they're...

        But the doorman turns calmly away.


16      INT. BASEMENT CAR PARK - DAY

        The two men lead Quail past a number of cars to their own
        vehicle.

                                 QUAIL
                   Where are you taking me?

                                 1ST AGENT
                   You told everyone at Rekall
                   about you trip to Mars.
                   Where you went, who you worked
                   for, what you did --

                                 QUAIL
                   But I didn't... Are you telling
                   me... I did go to Mars?  I
                   don't remember?

                                 1ST AGENT
                   You've remembered too much.
                   The Sphinx Project, for a
                   start....

                                 QUAIL
                           (confused;
                            remembers only
                            fragments)
                   Sphinx?... No, no, I don't,
                   I... What about the people
                   at Rekall?  I don't recall
                   Rekall but you said if they
                   know what I did?  Why don't
                   you ask them?  They'll tell
                   you I didn't...

                                 1ST AGENT
                   They've been taken care of.

                                 QUAIL
                   What do you mean?

        Neither man bothers answering.  They arrive at their car
        and open the door for Quail.  He hesitates.

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   What are you going to do with
                   me?

                                 1ST AGENT
                   Get in the car.

        He slaps Quail hard across the face.  Quail is terrified.
        He is tearful with fear.

                                 QUAIL
                   My God!  No!  You're going to
                   kill me!

        He cringes.  His hands across his face.

                                1ST AGENT
                   No one's going to kill you if
                   [you do what you're told.]
                   We're visiting E.I.O. for some
                   new tests.  Now get in, or do
                   we start playing rough?

                                 QUAIL
                   No!  It's not my fault!  You
                   can't do it!

        They start to force him into the car physically.

        Suddenly, Quail stops cringing.  the FEAR DISAPPEARS FROM
        HIS FACE, and is replaced by an odd, thoughtful expression.

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   Wait a minute, I remember --

                                1ST AGENT
                   What, Quail?  What do you
                   remember?

                                 QUAIL
                   On Mars... they tried to kill
                   me... And....

        QUAIL TRANSFORMS INTO A HIGHLY SKILLED KILLING MACHINE.

        In an instant, he karate-chops both agents across the
        windpipe, and they crumple to the ground.

        Quail steps back.  He stares at the two bodies, incredulous;
        then stares at his own deadly HANDS.  It is as though they
        belong to someone else.

        Then, leaving the two agents sprawled across the alley, he
        races back into the basement door of his building.


18      INT. QUAIL'S APARTMENT - EVENING

        Kirsten is watching another pornographic video when Quail
        bursts in.  He is still disoriented.

                                 QUAIL
                   Did you know I've been to
                   Mars?

        Kirsten gets up and turns off the movie.

                                 KIRSTEN
                   What!  This stupid obsess...

                                 QUAIL
                           (interrupting)
                   I think I've been.  I vaguely
                   recall...

                                 KIRSTEN
                   Doug, you've got to forget...

                                 QUAIL
                           (interrupting)
                   Forget?  Remembering is the
                   problem I must've been
                   to one of those artificial
                   memory places...

                                 KIRSTEN
                   Oh my God...

                                 QUAIL
                   But something went wrong...
                   something about a real
                   memory... and then those
                   men...  tried to kill me.

                                 KIRSTEN
                   What men?  Doug, you're crazy.

        She starts to mix a drink from a well-stocked cabinet.

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (continuing)
                   You're here now.  They didn't
                   kill you.

                                 QUAIL
                   No.  That's what's so amazing.
                   I killed them.  I think...

        Kirsten stops pouring her drink and look at him sharply.

                                 KIRSTEN
                   Where?  Where are they?

        Quail points down with his finger.

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (continuing)
                   Doug!  It's something they
                   put into your mind at the
                   memory place.  Fantasies.
                   That's their business.

        She sips her drink.

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (continuing)
                   You're a computer operator.
                   You're a bore.  You're a
                   wimp.  You're not a killer.

                                 QUAIL
                   I'm involved somehow with
                   E.I.O.  It's true.  It's no
                   fantasy.

        He walks around the apartment drawing curtains and putting
        out the lights.

                                 KIRSTEN
                   Doug, I want you to see a
                   doctor.  Now Alec and Shirley
                   Turnbull have a good man.  He
                   helped Alec through his
                   breakdown.

                                 QUAIL
                   For fuck's sake, this is no
                   breakdown!

        Kirsten is taken aback at his use of language.  He strides
        into the bathroom and slams the door.  She turns on one
        lamp, goes to a telephone and dials.


19      INT. BATHROOM - TWILIGHT

        Quail takes a washcloth, turns the hot water up full and
        soaks the cloth under the steaming water.  Using it as a
        compress, he presses it against his face and his neck, to
        drain off some of the tension.

        He turns off the water.  Towelling his head dry, he opens
        the bathroom door.

        The instant he does this, a blinding white BURST OF LIGHT
        comes arcing into the bathroom, and the back wall crinkles
        and CHARS into a swatch of blackness.

        QUAIL DIVES OUT THE DOOR, just as ANOTHER BOLT incinerates
        the spot where he was standing.


20      INT. LIVING ROOM - TWILIGHT

        THE ROOM IS IN TOTAL DARKNESS.  The only thing visible is
        the pale rectangle of the balcony window, with the curtains
        drawn over it.

        QUAIL and his ASSAILANT cannot be seen -- but they can be
        HEARD.  There is the sound of a SCUFFLE -- the meaty THUD
        of a FIST CONNECTING WITH FLESH -- and a painful GRUNT as
        someone's breath whooshes out.

        The LIGHT COMES ON.  Quail is standing with one hand on the
        lamp, and the other twisting KIRSTEN's arm up behind her
        back.  A pistol lies on the floor.  Quail is totally stunned.
        He releases her arm, shoving her away from him, at the same
        time scooping up the pistol.

                                 QUAIL
                   My God!  Did you say I need a
                   psychiatrist?

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (coolly)
                   I haven't seen you move that
                   fast since I've known you.

                                 QUAIL
                           (outraged)
                   How could you do it?  After
                   eight years!

                                 KIRSTEN
                   I'm not your wife, Quail.

                                 QUAIL
                   Not my wife!  You are out of
                   your mind.

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (indifferent;
                            nursing her
                            arm)
                   It's a false memory implant.
                   I never saw you before six
                   weeks ago.

        Quail is totally disoriented.

                                 QUAIL
                   Why are you lying like this?

                                 KIRSTEN
                   No, Quail.  It's true.  You
                   work for E.I.O.  So do I.

        As she speaks, she walks to a picture on the wall and from
        behind it pulls out a small wallet.  She flips it open to
        show him her E.I.O. badge.  He looks down uncomprehendingly
        at the holographic lettering "Earth Intelligence Organisation".

                                 QUAIL
                           (indicating their
                            surroundings)
                   But why all of this?

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (shrugging)
                   We had to watchdog you...make
                   sure the erasure took.  A wife
                   seemed like a good idea.

                                 QUAIL
                   But I remember it!  All of
                   it!... Us!

                                 KIRSTEN
                   All implanted.

                                 QUAIL
                   Our friends... my work...
                   eight years.

                                 KIRSTEN
                   The job's real -- you've had
                   is six weeks -- since you got
                   back from Mars.

        He sits down, holds his hand to his head.

                                 KIRSTEN
                           (continuing)
                   It's all a fabrication, Quail.
                   Everything you know.

                                 QUAIL
                   This is crazy!  If all my
                   memories are false, who am
                   I?  What am I?  Jesus... it's
                   like I don't exist.

                                 KIRSTEN
                   You exist, all right.
                           (very cold)
                   That's the problem.

        A pause as Quail mentally gropes frantically, for what to
        do next.

                                 QUAIL
                   Why did you try to kill me?
                   Why does E.I.O. want me dead?

                                 KIRSTEN
                   They don't particularly.  That
                   was my idea.  This assignment was
                   boring me to death.  The
                   personality they gave you
                   wasn't too thrilling.

                                 QUAIL
                   Well, what did I do on Mars
                   that they have to keep me from
                   telling?

                                 KIRSTEN
                   I've no idea.  I just work
                   here.

                                 QUAIL
                   All right... I'm leaving.
                   Don't try and follow me --

                                 KIRSTEN
                   I don't have to follow you.
                   You can't get away from E.I.O.
                   Nobody does.

        Quail looks at her as if seeing her for the first time.

                                 QUAIL
                   No wonder you got the role as
                   my bitchy wife -- type casting.

        He leaves.  Kirsten smiles secretively.  She goes to a
        drawer, opens it and removes a tiny instrument that looks
        like a TV channel-changer.  There is a very small light
        on the instrument, which begins flashing on and off, as
        the instrument  begins to make BEEPING SOUNDS.


21      EXT. STREET OUTSIDE QUAIL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

        Quail walks briskly out onto the street, controlling his
        paces, trying not to look suspicious.  After a beat, he
        heads for the nearest subway entrance.


22      INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

        Now underground, Quail tries to blend in with the other
        subway people.  He heads toward the weapons check.


23      EXT. STREET SUBWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT

        An OFFICIAL VEHICLE slams to a halt next to the subway
        entrance and a whole load of INTENSE MEN pours out of it.


24      INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT

        Quail now shuffles along in a lineup of people waiting
        to get through the WEAPONS CHECK.  He tries to control
        his nervousness.  He passes.  The guard smiles at him,
        pleased to see he has remembered his gun.


25      INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT

        All the men with guns drawn come pouring down the subway
        stairs.  The SUBWAY COPS and WEAPONS CHECK are stunned to
        see four large men brandishing guns push their way through
        the weapons check gate without seeming to notice them.  One
        gunman flashes a HOLOGRAPHIC BADGE ENCASED IN PLASTIC at
        them.

        The gunman reach the bottom of the stairs and race closer
        to the subway train, which is just departing.  The men
        halt abruptly.

                                 FIRST GUNMAN
                   Fuck it!

        The second gunman adjusts a small plug - a radio receiver -
        in his ear.

                                 SECOND GUNMAN (EARPLUG WEARER)
                   We won't be able to track him
                   again until he comes up above
                   ground!


26      INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT

        Quail sits in the subway car as it barrels through the
        night, not knowing exactly where he will go.  He is
        confused, distraught.  A commercial comes onto the video.

                                 TV AS VOICE OVER

27      EXT. SUBWAY STOP - NIGHT

        Quail emerges from underground and looks around.  The
        streets are almost deserted.


28      INT. MOVING OFFICAL VEHICLE - NIGHT

        THE GUNMEN SIT IN THE OV.  The one with the ear plug
        [suddenly talks.]

                                 EARPLUG WEARER
                   Coming in again.  Loud and
                   clear.

        He looks down at an illuminated street map built into the
        car's dashboard.


28A     EXT. SUBWAY STOP - NIGHT

        A cab comes into view.  Quail quickly hails it and jumps
        in.  Cab moves off.


28B     INT. CAB - NIGHT

        Quail is still pondering what to do next.  He glances out
        one window, though not at anything in particular.  Suddenly,
        the silence is shattered as bullets rip through the window
        on the other side.  Quail ducks to the floor.


28C     EXT. CAB - NIGHT

        A wide shot shows that the cab is being fired on by a man
        leaning from the window of an official patrol vehicle.  He
        is aiming at the tires and driver, rather than directly at
        Quail.


28D     INT. CAB - NIGHT

        Bullets are still pouring in.

                                 ROBOT DRIVER
                           (unemotionally)
                   You are being fired on, sir
                   or madam, please leave the
                   cab at once.

        From the floor, Quail pushes the door handle and rolls
        out onto the street.  The pursuing car occupants fail to
        notice his exit.


28E     EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

        Cars continue, as Quail picks himself up from the gutter
        and moves off down a narrow side street.


28F     INT. CAB - NIGHT

                                 ROBOT DRIVER
                   [Please....]

        Bullets rip into the robot driver's neck, severing the
        head from the body.  The head hits the window then bounces
        back onto the front seat.  It continues talking.

                                 ROBOT DRIVER
                           (continuing)
                   ...leave the cab as bullets
                   are hitting the vehicle in
                   considerable quantities.


28G     EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

        The taxi mounts the footpath and smashes through the display
        window of a store.  Clothes models are scattered and broken.
        When the noise abates, the severed head of the robot driver
        is lying among the dummies.

                                 ROBOT DRIVER
                   This company, sir or madam,
                   will institute legal action
                   for damages...


29      EXT. STREET - "END OF THE LINE" HOTEL - NIGHT

        Quail emerges from the side street and sees "End of the
        Line" Hotel.  It is clean, bland, middle class.  He quickly
        crosses the road and enters.


29A     INT. "END OF THE LINE" HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

        The foyer is brightly lit and empty.  Quail approaches the
        DESK CLERK, who is reading a book.  "Dr. No", marked, in
        flowing script, "from the classic series".

                                 DESK CLERK
                           (without looking
                            up)
                   Help you, sir?

                                 QUAIL

                            money)
                   A room for the night.

                                 DESK CLERK
                           (reluctantly
                            putting down
                            the book)
                   ID.

                                 QUAIL
                           (handing over

                   Here's ten thousand.  Forget
                   the ID.

        DESK CLERK looks up at him, with interest.  His hand
        hovers over the money.

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   I have a liaison with a
                   lady... and I'm married...

                                 DESK CLERK
                   I understand, sir.  Nothing
                   like a bit on the side, eh?
                   Bit of fugitive flesh.  The
                   greatest aphrodisiac is a new
                   body, wouldn't you say, sir?

        Quail looks at him with distaste but is only anxious to
        be given the key to his room.  He says nothing.


30      INT. "END OF THE LINE" HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

        Quail unlocks the door and enters.  No sooner does he
        relock the door then THE PHONE RINGS.  He freezes, stares
        at it for three rings, then picks it up.

                                 QUAIL
                           (into receiver)

        Quail is stunned.  He says nothing, but doesn't hang up.

                   And don't bother shaking down
                   your clothes -- the monitor

                   is this?


30A     INT. BAR BASEMENT - NIGHT

        The man telephoning Quail is calling from a bar.  Occasion-
        ally people pass him on their way to the toilets.  He is
        youngish and conservatively dressed.  He speaks rapidly
        and urgently.

                   take longer for them to

        Quail puts the phone down and rushes to the bathroom.


30B1    INT. PATROL CAR - NIGHT

        The earphone wearer and driver are moving in on the signal
        generated by Quail's bug.  Suddenly, the small illuminated
        cross on the dashboard map cuts out.

                                 EARPHONE WEARER
                   Shit!

        Quail rushes back into the room with a wet towel,
        turban-like, wrapped around his head.  He rapidly picks
        up the phone.

                   candlesticks.

                                 QUAIL
                           (infuriated)
                   What do I want with Grecian
                   candlesticks!


30C     INT. BAR BASEMENT - NIGHT

        The man on the phone looks around anxiously.

                                 TELEPHONE VOICE
                   Just do it!  This is no time
                   for small talk.

                                 QUAIL (V.O.)
                           (filtered; not
                            quite convinced)
                   How did you know where to
                   find me?

                                 TELEPHONE VOICE
                   I've been tailing you since you
                   get back from Mars.


30D     INT. QUAIL'S ROOM - NIGHT

                                 QUAIL
                   You're E.I.O.  You're on the

                   I'm E.I.O.  But I was your
                   best friend.  Scott Stevens -
                   we arranged this...

                                 QUAIL
                           (trying to
                            recall)
                   I can't remember - only bits...

                   I was your fail-safe -- if and
                   when the shooting started.
                   Good luck.  Look me up if you
                   remember me.


30E     INT. BAR BASEMENT - NIGHT

        Scott Stevens hangs up the phone.  He looks around
        cautiously, then walks a few steps to the mens room.


30F     INT. MENS ROOM - NIGHT

        Scott Stevens walks to the row of troughs and begins to
        urinate.  The room is empty.  He hears a noise and looks
        around.  Two EIO men are standing there aiming lethal-looking
        high-velocity weapons at him.  One of them is the red-headed
        man we've already seen.

                                 1ST MAN (RED-HEADED)
                   Well, look at that.  He's
                   really got his hands full.

                                 2ND MAN
                   Not so full, so I've heard.

        Still urinating, the frustrated Scott Stevens can only look
        back over his shoulder.  Laughing, both men open fire,
        riddling him with bullets.  He collapses in an undignified
        heap, his head in the water at the base of the trough.


31      INT. "END OF THE LINE" CORRIDOR - NIGHT

        Quail, with towel around his head, glances up and down the
        corridor -- spots a sign that says "FIRE EXIT".  He races
        towards it.


32      EXT. "END OF THE LINE" FRONT ENTRANCE - NIGHT

        The OV slams up in front of the hotel and a carload of
        MEN tear out of it and barge into the hotel.


32A     INT. "END OF THE LINE" HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

        The startled clerk jumps to his feet as the group of
        armed men enter rapidly.

                                 EARPHONE WEARER
                   Quick.  The guy who checked
                   in fifteen minutes ago.

                                 CLERK
                           (nervous)
                   Room...thirty-six.

        Most of the armed men instantly head off up the stairs,
        their weapons at the ready.  Clerk watches, astonished.

                                 CLERK
                           (continuing)
                   He was only meeting a lady...
                   Aren't you guys overdoing it
                   a bit?


32B     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

        Quail is walking along briskly, still with the towel
        around his head.  A few passers-by look at him curiously.
        He puts his hand together and greets them Indian-style.


33      EXT. PARK AVENUE - NIGHT - CLOSE ON STREET SIGN

        which reads: "PARK AVENUE / 58TH STREET".

        PULL BACK to reveal "The Lucky Stub Pawnshop".  WINOS
        lurk on the corner.  Park Avenue has deteriorated into
        a slum.

        QUAIL ENTERS FRAME, and approaching the pawnshop, stepping
        over a BUM in a doorway.


34      INT. PAWNSHOP - NIGHT

        Quail is just entering; an old-fashioned BELL overhead,
        tripped by the door opening, announces his entrance.

        At once, an immense FAT MAN emerges from the back room.

                                 PAWNBROKER
                   You wanta camera?  I got some
                   good, top-quality ones.  You
                   want silk rugs?  Handmade last
                   century in Iran...all perfect.
                   You want videos?  Old movies...
                   classics...all those Vietnam
                   war ones...real quaint stuff...
                   you want...

                                 QUAIL
                           (interrupting;
                            awkwardly)
                   I'm Hotchkiss...I came for
                   the...Grecian candlesticks...

        The Fat Man studies him warily for a long moment; then
        he disappears through the curtain.

        In a brief moment, he emerges again, carrying a small,
        "makeup-sized" case, as well as two large candelabra.

        The Pawnbroker puts the case on the counter.  Quail looks
        at the case with curiosity.

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   I wonder if you could tell
                   me...

        They both look around as someone enters.

                                 PAWNBROKER
                   I trust these will look well
                   in you... mosque.


35      INT. FLOP HOUSE - NIGHT - CLOSE ON HANDS

        Opening up the small case.

        PULL BACK to reveal they are Quail's hands.  The hotel
        room he's now in is obviously a different one than the
        last one we saw him in.  The room is large but run-down,
        the walls are peeling, the architecture is much older,
        etc.

        Quail examines the contents of the case:  there are CREDIT
        CARDS and also MONEY, several stacks of bills, neatly
        tied -- some of it the conventional green, but most of
        it red.


        CLOSE ON RED MONEY

        On the face of it is printed:  "MARS FEDERAL COLONY".

                                 QUAIL
                           (mutters)
                   Martian money....

        Quail thumbs through the money, and whistles softly to
        himself as he sees how much there is.

        Also in the case are:  TWO PASSPORTS;  a small CASSETTE
        RECORDER;  a rolled-up LEATHER POUCH and a spray can of
        some sort;  and a strange thing that looks like a silver
        mask.  He examines the face mask, studies BLACK LETTERS
        WRITTEN ACROSS IT (which we are not close enough to read)
        and then puts it aside.  Another item now catches  his
        eye:  a wristwatch.  He sees a conspicuous red button on
        the side of the watch, and PRESSES IT.  INSTANTLY, TO HIS
        SHOCK, QUAIL SEES A MAN MANIFEST HIMSELF HIMSELF OUT OF
        THIN AIR AND STAND THERE IN THE ROOM A FEW FEET AWAY FROM
        QUAIL:  he's an EXACT HOLOGRAPHIC DUPLICATE of Quail --
        down to the clothes Quail is wearing now.

        The image stands and watches Quail.

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   What the hell...?

        Quail smiles, presses the red button again.  There is a
        HUMMING SOUND -- and the man FADES INTO THIN AIR -- like
        a television set being turned off.

        Quail looks bemused.

        Now he unrolls the leather pouch and looks inside.  There
        he finds what look like SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS;  a sponge,
        a long piece of wire doubled over, with some attachments
        and a tiny METAL HEAD on one end, and some tubes of salve.

        He turns on the cassette recorder.

        The VOICE he hears on the cassette TAPE is HIS OWN!

                                 CASSETTE VOICE (V.O.)
                           (Quail's voice)
                   "Hauser, this is Hauser -- or
                   whatever you think your name
                   is now.  If you're listening
                   to this, I'm talking to myself.
                   Your memory's been erased and
                   you've got a wet towel around
                   your head.
                           (he does)
                   "The first thing you've got to
                   do is get rid of that bug in
                   your head."


36      INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT

        The sound of the tape continues as Quail follows
        instructions - pushing the wire up into a bloody portion
        of his neck, just below the ear.

                                 CASSETTE VOICE (V.O.)
                   The monitoring device is
                   located in your left maxillary
                   sinus cavity.  Make a small
                   incision in your neck just
                   below the left ear, and
                   insert the wire up into the
                   sinus.  The head is
                   self-guiding.  Just shove.

        Quail makes a face.

                                 CASSETTE VOICE (V.O.)
                           (continuing)
                   You won't feel a thing.  The
                   spray cartridge contains a
                   local anesthetic and a blood
                   coagulant.  Careful, it's my
                   neck, too.

        Holding the wet towel against his neck, Quail slowly
        withdraws the wire.  On the end of it is a tiny, metal
        bead, the Transmitter.


37      INT. MOVING OFFICIAL VEHICLE - NIGHT

        The man with the ear plug suddenly reacts.

                                 EARPLUG WEARER
                   It's come on again.

                                 DRIVER
                   Where?

        The 1st man quickly check the map-grid in the dashboard.
        A small bright 'x' is flashing.

                                 EARPLUG WEARER
                   He's in that old flophouse.
                   Plaza Hotel.  Central Park
                   South.


37A     INT. HOTEL BEDROOM - NIGHT

        Quail is anxious to get rid of the transmitter.  He looks
        around and notices a rat trap near a rat hole in the
        skirting board.

        He carefully - avoiding springing the trap - removes the
        piece of cheese and pushes the transmitter inside.  He
        then throws the cheese into the rat hole.


38      INT. MOVING OFFICIAL VEHICLE - NIGHT

        The car is moving swiftly through the streets.

                                 EARPLUG WEARER
                   Boy, he's really moving
                   around.

        A CU of the screen shows the small 'x' moving in circles.


38A     EXT. HOTEL SIDE ENTRANCE - NIGHT

        The car pulls up.  Another follows it.  Armed men leap
        out from both.  The EARPLUG WEARER indicates they should
        go down an alley at the side of a service door.  They
        advance cautiously, guns at the ready.  They see no one.
        The EARPLUG WEARER indicates another, even narrower, alley
        leading off to one side.  Two of the men sneak cautiously
        up to it, their guns at the ready.

        A large rat scurries out from behind overfull garbage
        bins.  Furious, they fire.  The bullets rip the bins to
        shreds, scattering refuse everywhere.  The rat is killed.
        They all stare in disbelief.

                                 EARPLUG WEARER
                   Ya dirty rat!


40      INT. E.I.O. HEADQUARTERS - MEMORY LAB - NIGHT

        OPENING CLOSE on a MONITOR SCREEN slated "HAUSER/QUAIL"
        followed by a serial number and some dates.  The slate
        vanishes, replaced by a scene of Quail -- undergoing
        some KIND OF MILITARY TRAINING.

        PAN to OTHER MONITORS, all depicting Quail in other
        action scenes -- on some kind of mission, driving a car,
        etc.

        TECHNICIANS man the monitors, scrolling through them in
        fast-forward and fast reverse as if searching files.

        The technicians turn as Cohaagen and his aides enter.

                                 COHAAGEN
                           (demands)
                   Anything?

                                 SUPERVISOR
                   We're running every one of
                   his memory tapes for the past
                   fifteen years.  Nothing yet,
                   sir.

                                 COHAAGEN
                   There must be something -- some
                   place he would go, some friend
                   he would run to.

        The red-haired E.I.O. man joins them.

                                 RED-HEADED MAN
                           (to Cohaagen;
                            quietly)
                   They lost him.

                                 COHAAGEN
                   Again?!

        The red-headed man nods.

                                 COHAAGEN
                           (continuing)
                   Are you sure the original
                   suppression took?

                                 SUPERVISOR
                   Absolutely, sir.  He thinks
                   he's Quail, a computer...

                                 COHAAGEN
                           (interrupting)
                   Then how do you explain what
                   he's doing?

                                 SUPERVISOR
                   Just his instincts.  He was
                   well trained by E.I.O.... Maybe
                   the memory cap's fractured.
                   Portions of his prior identity
                   could be leaking through.

                                 COHAAGEN
                           (very anxious)
                   He'll remember Mars?  The
                   Sphinx Project?

                                 SUPERVISOR
                   Fragments.  Nothing more.
                   Nothing he could piece together.
                   I did advise terminating him,
                   rather than implanting an
                   identify alternative.

                                 COHAAGEN
                   What do you think I am?  A
                   barbarian?  We're not living
                   in the twentieth century!

        He looks at the video screen again.  An image has flashed
        onto it of an attractive Eurasian girl.

                                 COHAAGEN
                           (continuing)
                   Hold it there.

        He studies the picture, which changes to show the same
        girl from different angles.


42      INT. SPACE PORT - DAY

        Passengers are boarding a COMMERCIAL SPACECRAFT.  In
        addition to the STEWARDESSES checking their tickets, there
        are two PLAINCLOTHES MEN checking every passenger.  They
        carry some kind of small, portable ELECTRONIC DEVICE that
        they shine in the face of each passenger going through.
        (It gives off a BLUE BEAM and HUMS.)

        The passengers are a diverse group - businessmen, officials,
        government people, etc.  There is also a large tour group
        consisting of a predominately middle-aged and determinedly
        jolly crowd, many of them carrying duty-free bags.  They
        are being marshaled by an harassed TOUR ORGANIZER, who is
        carrying aloft a hand-painted sign... "MARTIAN TOUR GROUP".

        The last of the passengers board the spacecraft.  The
        chief PLAINCLOTHES MAN nods to an official and the door
        begins to close.

                                 PLAINCLOTHES MAN #1
                   If he had to travel to Mars
                   with that bunch, I'd be sorry
                   for him.

                                 PLAINCLOTHES MAN #2
                   We couldn't have missed him?

                                 PLAINCLOTHES MAN #1
                   No way.  Let's get a coffee
                   before the next shuttle.


43      INT. SPACELINER - IN FLIGHT

        One of the PASSENGERS -- a middle-aged WOMAN - unbuckles
        her seat belt and heads for the restroom, carrying her
        handbag, and some clothes on a hanger.


44      INT. LAVATORY - IN FLIGHT

        The woman locks the door and turns to the mirror.  She
        opens her bag, takes out a spray container, SPRAYS HER
        FACE with it, and takes out -- the SILVER FACE MASK we
        saw in Quail's emergency kit.

        She holds the mask to her face.  There is a SIZZLING
        NOISE, and SMOKE rises from behind the mask.

        She lowers the mask.  Her face is now that of QUAIL.
        He tears up a passport and drops it down a chute.

        He reaches inside his dress, starts to REMOVE his "FALSIES."

        CLOSE ON MASK

        We can read the BLACK LETTERING written across it now:
        "LASER FACIAL".


45      INT. SPACELINER - IN FLIGHT

        Quail exits from the lavatory and glances toward the
        ebullient tour crowd.  He turns and looks in the other
        direction and sees a video theater advertising "ROCKY 36"
        with Sylvester Stallone III, Jnr.  He isn't too excited,
        but heads towards it.  He pauses a little when an
        announcement comes over the intercom.

        A LITTLE BELL sounds, followed by INTERCOM STATIC.  Quail
        looks up.

                                 CAPTAIN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                   Ladies and gentlemen, if you'll
                   glance out the starboard
                   viewports, you'll behold an
                   indeed awesome sight --

        Quail goes to a viewport and PEERS, transfixed.  He is
        seeing... at last... the object of his obsession.


46      EXT. SPACELINER - IN ORBIT AROUND MARS

        The SPACELINER -- which we have deliberately not seen before
        this moment for dramatic effect -- banks and turns, suddenly
        bringing into view -- MARS.

        AN IMMENSE ORANGE GLOBE -- so close it looks like it's
        going to fall on us.  It dwarfs the spaceliner.

                                 CAPTAIN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                   Those long gorges you see,
                   clearly are the legendary
                   canals of Mars....

        The liner drops toward the surface of Mars.  Below:  a
        NETWORK OF INTERSECTING LINES crisscross the planet.

                                 CAPTAIN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                           (continuing)
                   Of course, they are not manmade
                   canals, but vast natural chasms
                   ...many deeper and larger than
                   the Grand Canyon.  Though
                   utterly without moisture now,
                   scientists have determined
                   that they were formed by
                   massive flooding millions of
                   years ago.


47      INT. SPACELINER

        Quail stares, his brow furrowing as if with some deep
        hidden memory he can't quite recall.

                                 CAPTAIN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                           (continuing)
                   Surface temperatures at the
                   Martian equator is minus
                   one-hundred and twenty degrees 
                   Centigrade -- in winter.
                   Fortunately, this time of year
                   it's slightly more seasonable:
                   Sixty degrees, Fahrenheit,
                   outside the domes.
                           (beat)
                   Please remember, folks, that
                   outside the domes you'll need
                   to carry your own personal
                   oxygen supply at all times.
                   The atmosphere of Mars is
                   almost a vacuum.  Thank you
                   for flying with Interstellar
                   and we hope your stay will be
                   a pleasant one.


48      EXT. MARS - OUTER SPACE

        CAMERA follows the spaceliner until the ENTIRE FRAME is
        filled with the RED-ORANGE sands of MARS.


49      EXT. MARTIAN DESERT - DAY

        An endless expanse of boulder-studded red sand, under
        a red-orange sky.

        The desert is cut by a ROAD, which snakes across the
        rocky terrain.  Some surface TRAFFIC moves along the
        road (all pressurized vehicles since the atmosphere
        of Mars is almost a pure vacuum) - including the
        MARSPORT BUS.

        PAN WITH THE BUS - TO REVEAL

        A CITY UNDER A DOME.

        In the midst of the stark, trackless landscape -- it's
        midday, scorching -- rises a huge weatherbeaten GEODESIC
        STRUCTURE, its glass surface scarred by sandstorm damage.
        Its feeling is like an old Western, when Clint Eastwood
        rides into Tombstone -- the raw, forbidding vistas, with
        a tough town carved out of the wilderness.


50      INT. MARSPORT - DAY

        Quail is looking out at the desolate landscape.  The TOUR
        ORGANISER, an amiable middle-aged man sits beside him.
        It is possible he is not a married man.

                                 QUAIL
                   It's no Garden of Eden.

                                 TOUR ORGANISER
                   No.  Quite a bit to see, though.
                   The canyons, the old Sphinx...

                                 QUAIL
                   What do you know about that?

                                 TOUR ORANISER
                   Not much, really.  Millions
                   of years old.  Bit like the
                   one that used to be in Egypt,
                   you know...

                                 QUAIL
                   Yeah.  Got destroyed in the
                   Arab wars... What about this
                   independence movement?

                                 TOUR ORGANISER
                           (dismissive)
                   Not worth worrying about.
                   Mostly descendants of the
                   original colonists from Earth.
                   Now they want self-rule so they
                   can sell us all the minerals...
                   I don't think we've met.  You
                   with our group?  Takes me a
                   while to know everyone.

                                 QUAIL
                   Sure.  Douglas Quail.

                                 TOUR ORGANISER
                   Richard Toltz.
                           (they shake hands)
                   Well, Doug, I hope we'll see
                   a lot more of each other.


55      EXT. CITY (UNDER THE DOOM) - DAY

        The bus pulls up outside a modern tourist hotel.  The
        buildings surrounding it have a much more improvised,
        temporary look.  Most are pre-fabricated structures.
        The streets are crowded and there is a "frontier-town"
        atmosphere.  Stalls sell fruit and vegetables, also water
        and air containers.

        A lot of greenery is evident - this is to absorb CO2 and
        emit oxygen, thus helping with the air supply under the
        dome.

        Some small, ragged boys look at QUAIL as he looks around
        before going inside the hotel.  Suddenly, one of them throws
        a small sack at him.  It hits his chest and leaves a yellow
        stain.  The hotel DOORMAN chases the boys away....

                                 BOY
                   Smogpsucker!

        From the other side of the street, a gang of URCHINS with
        a harmonica start singing some kind of defiant PATRIOTIC
        SONG.

                                 DOORMAN
                   You know how it is, sir.  Some
                   of these red-asses are a bit
                   prejudiced.

                                 QUAIL
                   Prejudiced?  Against what?

                                 DOORMAN
                   Earthmen.

        The street song has swelled, adult MINERS and CITIZENS
        joining the belligerent chorus.

                                 QUAIL
                   What are they singing?

                                 DOORMAN
                   The Martian National Anthem.

        Quail tips the doorman, enter the hotel.


57      INT. MARS HILTON LOBBY - DAY

        Quail passes several kiosks -- a magazine stand, currency
        exchange, clothing store, shoeshine stand.  A SHOESHINE
        BOY looks up at Quail.

        Quail walks past, enters the main lobby.  The atrium
        entryway is absolutely fabulous; a complete contrast to the
        dirty, Casbah-like streets.  AFFLUENT-LOOKING PEOPLE in
        spotless linen fill the lobby.

        Quail stops to examine a large ROTATING DISPLAY sitting on
        a table in the middle of the lobby.  It is a stand-up model
        of a SPHINX.  Across the top is written "THE FIRST WONDER
        OF MARS".  A recorded VOICE repeats a canned speech --

                                 CANNED VOICE
                   "...the Martian Sphinx...
                   only evidence of non-human
                   civilization ever discovered
                   ...age estimated at over
                   eighteen million years...


        CLOSE - SHOESHINE BOY

        He stares at Quail.

        BACK TO SCENE

        Quail approaches the Registration Desk.

                                 CLERK
                   Nice to have you back with us,
                   Mr. Hauser.

        Quail is startled to be recognized -- particularly by
        this name.  He tries to stay casual.

                                 QUAIL
                   Nice to be back.
                           (pick up pen)
                   I'm flattered you remember me.

                                 CLERK
                   Part of my job, sir.

                                 QUAIL
                           (starts to sign;
                            hesitates)
                   Do you remember my first name,
                   too?

                                 CLERK
                   Charles.  Charles Hauser, right?

                                 QUAIL
                   I'm impressed.
                           (now he signs)
                   Listen.  I need transportation
                   to the... uh... the Sphinx.
                   Can you arrange it for me?

                                 CLERK
                   I'm sorry, sir.  But Earth
                   government has sealed off the
                   excavation site completely.
                   No one but survey teams and
                   archaeologists are allowed
                   closer than twenty miles.

        The Clerk taps a few keys on a computer.

                                 CLERK
                   Oh...
                           (spots something
                            on the computer)
                   Do you want the item you left
                   with us?

                                 QUAIL
                   What item?  Oh... yes, please.

        The Clerk turns to the safe, retrieves an envelope. He
        hands it -- and an ELECTRONIC ROOM KEY -- to Quail.


58      P.O.V. - THROUGH BINOCULARS - THE SPHINX

        Far in the distance, a dusty red structure squats amid
        barren dunes.  We see vehicles, scaffolding, a fortified
        perimeter.


59      INT. QUAIL'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

        Quail stands at the window, looking through binoculars.
        He lowers them irritably, tosses them on the bed.

        Quail tugs the envelope from his pocket, tears it open.
        Inside is a single slip of paper, on which is written
        in longhand:

                                 "MELINA NOEL
                           Last Chance Air Station
                        Kilometer 61   Gird Square T9"


60      EXT. MARS HILTON - SUNSET

        It is now sunset on Mars and it's literally of inearthly
        beauty.  The sun is bold and blood red;  the foggy, drip-
        ping glass of the Dome tints the light into strange colors.

        Quail emerges from the hotel, properly attired now in a
        white tropical suit, and starts for the taxi stand.

        Behind him, also emerging from the hotel, is the Shoeshine
        Boy.  He keeps out of sight -- but is definitely tailing
        Quail.

        As Quail nears the first solar-powered taxi in line, he is
        approached by an amiable-looking CALYPSO GUY wearing a West
        Indian shirt and bright straw hat.

                                 CALYPSO GUY (BENNIE)
                   Need a cab, boss mon?

        Quail hesitates, unsure of the protocol.

                                 BENNIE
                           (continuing)
                   Mine's right around the corner.

                                 QUAIL
                           (indicating first
                            cab in line)
                   That one's closer.

                                 BENNIE
                   But I out-hustle him, right?

                                 QUAIL
                           (smiling)
                   Right.

        TWO CABBIES exchange curses as Quail, wary, follows the
        Calypso Guy around a corner, climbs into the small solar
        car.


62      EXT. CITY DOME - AIR LOCK - SUNSET

        An AIR LOCK whooshes open underneath a Checker Cab sign.
        Bennie and Quail emerge in the solar-powered car -- set
        off into the desert.


63      EXT. DESERT - SUNSET

        The taxi traverses the same type desert that Quail crossed
        a few hours ago.  Only now is looks completely different.
        The late light tints everything in pastel shades, Quail is
        awed by the grandeur of the Lawrence-of-Arabia-like setting.


68      EXT. DESERT TRUCK STOP - NIGHT

        Quail and Bennie's taxi approaches a brightly-lit oasis in
        the middle of the desert.  There's a cafe, repair facilities
        and a huge parking lot -- all under a garish neon sign:
        "LAST CHANCE AIR STATION AND ASLOON - EAT HERE AND GET GAS".

        Quail and Bennie's taxi pulls in and parks.  In the lot is
        a collection of strange and colorful vehicles:  huge ore
        trucks that pull eight trailers, mountain prospecting jeeps,
        Grapes-of-Wrath jalopies.  Quail and Bennie disembark, wear-
        ing breathing masks, and enter the main building.


69      INT. LAST CHANCE AIR STATION - NIGHT

        The joint is a combination saloon/cathouse/casino.  There
        are slot machines, HOOKERS, MINERS and HOMESTEADERS; it is
        like a Nevada brothel -- packed with wild and woolly indi-
        vidualists, the equivalent of Old West trappers, prospectors
        and cowboys -- but with a space-age look.

        Quail and Bennie elbow their way to the bar.  Fragments of
        conversation are overheard.

                                 MINER #1
                   ...if that intergalactic little
                   Napoleon thinks I'm sellin' and
                   clearin' outta here, he can
                   think again!

                                 MINER #2
                           (with a laugh)
                   ...watcha gonna do when he cuts
                   off the air, Luke?

                                 MINER #3
                   ...you'll be breathin' red dust
                   and shittin' bricks.

        Bennie and Quail pass another group.

                                 MINER #4
                   ...my wife ain't goin' on
                   one of those space shuttles...
                   she hates flyin'...

                                 MINER #5
                   ...aw, come on... flyin's
                   safer'n crossin' the road...

                                 MINER #6
                   ...yeah, there ain't been a
                   real disaster since that
                   collision off Phobos, nigh on
                   twenty years ago...

                                 MINER #4
                           (alarmed)
                   ...well, that killed twelve
                   thousand...

                                 QUAIL
                   What is this, Bennie...
                   Tombstone?

                                 BENNIE
                   Sorta.  Bunch of miners out
                   here got their own claims, from
                   way back.  Cohaagen's buyin' em
                   all up, says he's gonna cut off
                   the air an' water if they won't
                   sell...

        Quail attracts the attention of the BARTENDER.

                                 QUAIL
                   I'm looking for Melina Noel.

                                 BARTENDER
                   You've found her.

        His nod indicates an area behind Quail.  He turns to see
        an attractive waitress placing drinks on tables.  She
        doesn't notice Quail.  He walks toward her through the
        crowd.  Bennie watches, then tactfully slips away.

        MELINA turns to return to the bar and runs straight into
        Quail.  She stops, obviously astonished to see him.

                                 MELINA
                   You bastard!

        Almost in tears, she pushes her way through the crowd to a
        billiard room, which is separated from the main bar by
        swinging doors.

        There are no occupants and it is almost in darkness.  Quail,
        bewildered, follows her.  Inside the billiard room he turns
        on the lights which illuminates the area of the table.

        (NOTE:  As Quail and Melina speak, the activity in the
                outside bar can be seen above the swinging doors.)

        Melina is still fighting back tears.  Quail stops in front
        of her, unsure about what to do.  He has no recollection
        of how well he might have known this woman.

        Suddenly, she slaps him hard across the face.

                                 MELINA
                           (quietly)
                   You bastard...

        He rubs his painful cheek. 

                                 MELINA
                           (continuing)
                   That's new -- the innocent
                   look.
                           (bitter sarcasm)
                   You didn't have that one
                   before.
                           (beat)
                   Well?

        Quail is speechless.

                                 QUAIL
                   Well, uh... I...

                                 MELINA
                   All right, I'll say it for
                   you.

        He looks relieved (but tries to cover).

                                 MELINA
                           (continuing)
                   Don't worry.  I got the note.
                   You discharged your obligation.

                                 QUAIL
                   What note?

                                 MELINA
                   Oh, the usual one.  "Must
                   return immediately to Earth...
                   the wife needs me..."

                                 QUAIL
                   I don't have a wife.  Well,
                   I do - but not a real wife.
                           (getting
                            desperate)
                   Hell... look... someone else
                   sent that note.  Someone who --

                                 MELINA
                   What are you here for?!

                                 QUAIL
                   For you!  I don't even know
                   why --

        Melina bursts into tears.  Quail rather tentatively puts
        his arms around her.  She welcomes this at first, but then
        pushes him away.

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   Whoever I was, I must have
                   been a helluva guy.

                                 MELINA
                   "Whoever you were"???

                                 QUAIL
                   Listen.  I've for to tell  you
                   something.  I beg you to
                   believe me... help me --

        All Melina's suspicions come rushing back.

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   Something happened to my mind.
                   Memory suppression, false
                   implant, I don't know
                   what --

        Melina backs off.  Quail grows more desperate.

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   What I'm saying is... I don't
                   remember you.  I don't remember
                   us.  I don't remember me --

        Melina's expression grows dead hard.

                                 MELINA
                   [And I thought...]

                                 QUAIL
                   Who is us?

                                 MELINA
                           (ignoring the
                            question)
                   Memory erasure is what they
                   use on agents.  Go away.

                                 QUAIL
                   Wait... I was an agent -- I'm
                   not now -- just tell me who
                   I am!  How did we know each
                   other?  Why are they trying
                   to kill me?!

        He takes a step toward her, nearly frantic.

                                 MELINA
                   I'm not trusting you again.

                                 QUAIL
                   You loved me once, you must
                   have --

                                 MELINA
                   That you was a liar.  Who you
                   are now I don't even know.

                                 QUAIL
                   Please, Melina --

                                 MELINA
                           (tears starting)
                   Get out!

                                 QUAIL
                   I need your help --

                                 MELINA
                           (crying quietly)
                   Get out!  Get the hell away
                   from me!

        Quail gives up; goes through the doors and leaves.  Melina
        slumps her shoulder against the table and cries.


77      INT. LAST CHANCE AIR STATION GARAGE - NIGHT

        Quail enters from the cafe.  Bennie is kneeling beside his
        taxi, repairing a tire.  He look up, sees Quail approach.

        On his right hand, Bennie has a mechanical device
        capable of spinning 360 degrees.  He uses it to twirl
        a lug nut tight on his tire.  As Quail approaches,
        Bennie removes the TOOL ATTACHMENT from his HAND,
        tosses it into a kit beside the taxi.

                                 BENNIE
                   You don't look so good, boss.
                   All over the Universe, women
                   is an awful curse.

        He opens the door for Quail, beams.


80      INT. SOLAR-POWERED CAR - NIGHT - MOVING - DESERT BACKGROUND

        Quail still broods, Bennie tries to cheer him up.

                                 BENNIE
                   It's a tough planet, boss.

                                 QUAIL
                   Yeah, right.

                                 BENNIE
                   Some guy really screwed her -
                   screwed her up real good.
                   Some Earthman.  Just hopped
                   on a space shuttle.

        Bennie bright tone isn't improving Quail's mood.

                                 QUAIL
                   Listen, Bennie.  You're pretty
                   well informed?

                                 BENNIE
                   If that means I know it all,
                   you're right, boss.

                                 QUAIL
                   What do you know about the
                   Sphinx?

                                 BENNIE
                   I don't know nothin'.  Not
                   about the Sphinx.  That's out
                   of the ball park.

                                 QUAIL
                   I have to get there.  Can't
                   you help me?

                                 BENNIE
                   No can do, mon.  You want
                   women, cigarettes, red-market
                   money, booze, even air or
                   water... Bennie's your man.
                   But the Sphinx... that's
                   E.I.O. --


80A     INT. CITY UNDER THE DOME - NIGHT

        The solar car is moving through the crowd, when suddenly
        SIRENS approach on a cross street.  Bennie brakes and stops.
        He and Quail watch as POLICE MOTORCYCLES clear a path for a
        huge, GAS-POWERED LIMO.  MINERS on the sidewalks shout
        CURSES, OBSCENITIES --

                                 BENNIE
                   Well... look at that one, eh?

                                 QUAIL
                   What?

                                 BENNIE
                   Big cheese in town.  Big
                   smelly cheese.

                                 QUAIL
                   Cohaagen?  But isn't he often
                   here?

                                 BENNIE
                   No way.  That cat just cheat
                   the Martian workers without
                   ever leavin' his place in
                   Beverly Hills.  Somethin' must
                   be cookin'.

        Quail keeps his face in shadow and watches Cohaagen with
        curiosity as he passes.  Cohaagen is lit up briefly by a
        street lamp.  His face makes an impression on Quail, who
        perhaps faintly remembers him in the past.


82      INT. QUAIL'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

        Quail enters, turns on the lights, locks the door.  He
        checks all the rooms.  Then he crosses to the dresser,
        studies himself in the mirror.  He looks haggard.

        Quail opens a drawer, takes out his "emergency case," sets
        it on top and opens it.  He removes a shoulder holster and
        pistol, sets them aside.  He takes out a tape recorder.

        He sets the recorder down gingerly, as if somewhere in
        there were contained the answers to all his questions.
        He's just about to activate it, when he hears a KNOCK at
        the door.

        Quail freezes.  Another KNOCK.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                           (through door)
                   Mr. Hauser...

                                 QUAIL
                   Who is it?

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                   Mr. Hauser, I want to talk to
                   you... about Douglas Quail.

        Quail ditches the recorder and the "emergency case" into
        the drawer -- everything except the PISTOL.

        Quail approaches the door very cautiously (from the side --
        out of the line of fire).

                                 QUAIL
                           (tensely)
                   Who are you?

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                   My name is George Edgemar.
                   I work for Rekall, Incorporated.

                                 QUAIL
                           (stunned;
                            incredulous)
                   Rekall??

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                   Yes.  It's difficult to
                   explain... Could you open the
                   door, please?  I'm not armed.

        Quail opens it carefully, his gun at the ready, but out
        of view of the person at the door.

        A dignified-looking GENTLEMAN stands there, calm and
        pleasant, wearing an Earth-style business suit.

                                 EDGEMAR
                   Hello, Mr. Quail.  May I come
                   in?  I won't be offended if
                   you prefer to keep the gun
                   you're holding trained on me.

        He can't see the gun, but somehow knows.

                                 QUAIL
                   All right... come in.

        Quail does keep his gun trained on the man.  The man enters,
        holding in his outstretched hand -- a business card.

                                 EDGEMAR
                   My card, Mr. Quail.

        Quail frisks him, then takes the card, glances at it.

                                 QUAIL
                   Okay -- so you're Doctor
                   George Edgemar of 'Rekall,
                   Inc.'  So?

                                 EDGEMAR
                   As I said... this is going to
                   be very difficult -- for both
                   of us.

                                 QUAIL
                   I'm listening.

                                 EDGEMAR
                   Mr. Quail... I'm afraid you're
                   not really standing here at
                   this moment.

                                 QUAIL
                   Sat that again.

                                 EDGEMAR
                   I said, you're not really
                   here.  Neither am I.  We're
                   both in the Memory Studio --
                   in the offices of Rekall, Inc.
                   On Earth.

        Long pause.

                                 QUAIL
                   Are you trying to tell me that
                   this is all part of some...
                   artificially injected fantasy?
                   That I never really left Earth?

                                 EDGEMAR
                   No, not quite.  We didn't give
                   you this.  You're creating it
                   yourself --
                           (pauses, choosing
                            his words)
                   Remember the option we offered
                   you?  Intelligence agent?
                   Something inside you liked
                   that idea, fastened on it.
                   What you're experiencing now
                   is a free-form delusion that
                   you yourself are fabricating.

                                 QUAIL
                   What is this shit you're
                   giving me?

                                 EDGEMAR
                   This is not -- shit, Mr. Quail.
                   It's the truth.
                           (beat)
                   I know it's very hard for you
                   to accept, but you're having
                   a schizophrenic reaction...
                   we can't snap you out of the
                   Narkadine.  You're in a world
                   of your own fantasy.

                                 QUAIL
                   Then how the hell can you be
                   in my dream -- if you know it's
                   just a dream?

                                 EDGEMAR
                   I've been artificially
                   implanted -- like the first
                   part of your fantasy.  I'm
                   actually monitoring your dream
                   at a psychoprobe console.
                   This is a last resort.  When
                   somebody gets stuck in their
                   own fantasy, we send in
                   someone after them.  A
                   specialist, like myself.

                                 QUAIL
                   I don't believe a word you're
                   saying.

                                 EDGEMAR
                   I was afraid you'd think that.
                   I'm sorry to have to do this,
                   but you really are stuck.
                           (calls out)
                   Doctor Noel, would you come in
                   now please?

        The door starts to open.  Quail pivots and points his
        gun at the opening door.

        MELINA walks in, carrying a CLIPBOARD.  She looks at Quail
        with professional detachment.

                                 MELINA
                   Yes, Mr. Quail, I'm afraid
                   it's all true.

        Quail is staggered.

                                 MELINA
                           (continuing)
                   I tried to break through to
                   you earlier, but you just
                   molded me into your fantasy.
                   Sometimes it takes Dr. Edgemar
                   to get through to a client as
                   tough as you.

                                 QUAIL
                           (wavering)
                   So what's supposed to happen
                   now?

                                 EDGEMAR
                   Just do exactly as we tell
                   you.

                                 QUAIL
                           (stares at him
                            coldly)
                   Somehow that doesn't appeal
                   to me.

                                 MELINA
                   Please, Mr. Quail... try to
                   cooperate.  You're having a
                   schizophrenic embolism.

                                 EDGEMAR
                   If we can't get you out now...
                   you may never come out of it.
                   Your wife calls every day --


        CLOSE - QUAIL

        Even more suspicious.


        TWO SHOT - QUAIL AND EDGEMAR

                                 QUAIL
                   If this is a fantasy, there'll
                   be no real consequences when
                   I pull this trigger.

                                 EDGEMAR
                   But there will by consequences
                   inside your mind.  Consequences
                   that won't hurt me... but could
                   be fatal to you.
                           (beat)
                   If you shoot me, you'll wipe
                   me out of your fantasy -- I
                   can't come back again.  Because
                   to you, I'll be dead.  I can't
                   help you get back to reality.
                   You'll be stuck in permanent
                   psychosis.


        CLOSE - QUAIL

        Trembling, holding the gun point blank in Edgemar's face.


        CLOSE - EDGEMAR

        Showing no fear of tension whatever.

                                 EDGEMAR
                   You're going to lower the gun,
                   Mr. Quail.  You're going to
                   hand it to me --


        CLOSE - QUAIL

        Straining desperately to find the true "reality."


        EXTREME CLOSEUP - TRIGGER OF GUN

        Quail's finger on it.


        TWO SHOT - QUAIL AND EDGEMAR

                                 EDGEMAR
                   You're going to do exactly
                   what I tell you --

        Quail PULLS THE TRIGGER!


        REVERSE ANGLE - BACK OF EDGEMAR'S HEAD

        We SEE the results of the gunshot from this angle only,
        and so BRIEFLY as to produce an almost SUBLIMINAL effect:
        the back of Edgemar's head blows off --

        He collapses to the floor.

        Melina LEAPS at Edgemar's falling form and CLAMPS HER HANDS
        over Edgemar's RIGHT HAND!

                                 MELINA
                   Watch out, Charles!  There's
                   more of them in the hall!

        Quail spins toward the door just as it BURSTS OPEN.  A man
        enters, firing, but Quail has fallen to the floor and
        returns the fire.  He staggers back out into the corridor
        and slams against the wall, dead.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                           (from hall)
                   You've had it, Hauser!  Throw
                   out your weapon if you want
                   a past!

        Melina is still crouched by Edgemar's body, holding his
        HAND for some reason.  Her CLIPBOARD dangles by her side.

                                 MELINA
                           (whispering)
                   There's an explosive in the
                   clipboard!  He has a dead-man
                   switch in his hand!

        Squeezing Edgemar's hand shut with one of hers, she holds
        up her other wrist -- to show that the CLIPBOARD IS BOUND
        TO HER WRIST BY A CHAIN!

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                   What do you say, Hauser?  We
                   haven't got all night!  Hauser?

        Quail (Hauser) SHOOTS OFF the chain.

                                 QUAIL
                   What happens it I come out?

        Quail takes the CLIPBOARD from Melina and eases himself to
        the side of the doorway.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                   We'll put in a word with the
                   big boys.  Maybe you'll just
                   get exile to Venus.

                                 QUAIL
                   All right.  Here comes the
                   weapon.

        Quail reaches around the corner and SAILS THE CLIPBOARD into
        the hallway.  Melina lets go of Edgemar's hand --

        There is a TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION in the hallway,


83      INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

        Quail comes out in crouch, ready to shoot.  On the floor
        lies a DEAD MAN and the body of the Shoeshine Boy, sprawled
        grotesquely.  The hallway is filled with smoke.  The floor
        covered with debris.  Plaster falling from the ceiling.

        All over the hotel, ALARMS begin BLARING.


84      INT. QUAIL'S ROOM - NIGHT

        Quail strides back in, icy-furious.  He seizes Melina by
        the wrist and drags her after him into the corridor.


84A     INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

        Two more E.I.O. men appear but Quail shoots them while
        dragging Melina down the hall in the opposite direction.
        He pushes open the door leading to the staircase.


84B     INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT

        Quail and Melina run down the stairs.  On the next landing
        is a service elevator, from which a waiter is emerging
        carefully carrying a tray with hors d'oeuvres and champagne.

                                 QUAIL
                   Back in, quick!

                                 WAITER
                   Wouldn't you prefer your order
                   in your room, sir?

                                 QUAIL
                   In!

        Quail bundles the waiter unceremoniously back inside the
        elevator.


84C     INT. LIFT - NIGHT

        Quail presses the basement button.  As he talks to Melina
        he opens the champagne and pours two glasses.  The waiter
        is too frightened to protest.

                                 QUAIL
                   Okay.  Answers!  Now!

                                 MELINA
                   They kidnapped me.  Said
                   they'd kill you if I didn't
                   cooperate.  I told them I
                   didn't care, but then when
                   I realized they meant it...

                                 QUAIL
                   I don't know why they're
                   after me, but what's your
                   connection with all this?

                                 MELINA
                   We were together before.

                                 QUAIL
                   Believe me, I'm really sorry
                   I can't recall the details
                   of that encounter.

        The elevator has reached the basement.  They rush out.


85      EXT. ALLEY BEHIND HILTON - NIGHT

        Quail and Melina run from a basement door into an alley.

        A solar car whips out in front of them.  Quail and Melina
        leap aboard.

                                 MELINA
                   Go, Bennie, for God's sake!


86      INT. BENNIE'S SOLAR CAR - NIGHT

        Bennie weaves as fast as he can in and out of the traffic,
        Quail and Melina ducking out of view in the passenger seat.

                                 BENNIE
                           (glances in
                            mirror)
                   Bad news, boss lady.

                                 MELINA
                   What?

                                 BENNIE
                   Black cruiser just pull out
                   behind us.


86A     EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

        A large gas-powered official-looking car is pushing its way
        through the crowds and traffic behind them.


86B     INT. BENNIE'S CAR - NIGHT

        Quail is aiming his gun at the following car.

                                 BENNIE
                   Forget the shooter, boss.  I
                   lose 'em for you.

                                 QUAIL
                   Lose them?  In this?

                                 BENNIE
                   Hang on!

        Bennie reaches down, grasps a KNOB.  He yanks it, like
        someone starting an outboard motor -- and an ear-splitting
        LOUD ENGINE roars to life.

        Bennie opens the throttle and the solar car HURTLES DOWN
        THE STREET.  Quail and Melina are thrown back in the seat.


87      EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

        GUNFIRE blazes all around the car.  Quail FIRES back at
        the pursuing car.

                                 QUAIL
                           (shouts over
                            GUNFIRE)
                   You're gonna get a ticket
                   for that engine, Bennie --

                                 BENNIE
                   Yutani 650 -- you like it,
                   boss?  Nothing like the old
                   gas when you want a bit of
                   speed.

        BULLETS from the cruiser rip through the car.

                                 MELINA
                   You better have two aces,
                   Bennie.
                           (glances behind)
                   There's a second cruiser --
                   and it's gaining --


87A     EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

        Bennie's car hurtles through the crowds with the official
        car gaining on it.  Bennie takes a corner sharply near a
        huge water selling stand.  The official car brakes to make
        the same turn, but clips the side of the water stand.  The
        water container tips and empties water through the open
        roof (i.e. through which one of the Agents has been firing)
        so that the car completely fills.  The driver continues the
        chase, but the occupants are now submerged.  They frantic-
        ally open the windows while continuing to follow Bennie's
        car.


88      EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

        The solar car rushes down what appears to be a dead-end
        street, with the official vehicle (water pouring out of
        the windows) in pursuit.

        At the end of the street, however, Bennie doesn't stop but
        continues going into a large opening.  It is an abandoned
        mine.  The bigger car follows him, but won't fit.  The
        roof is smashed to pieces as the vehicle is wedged into
        the narrow opening.

        The second official car pulls up behind.  A chauffeur jumps
        out and opens the rear door.  Cohaagen steps out.  He sur-
        veys the scene.  The four men in the wrecked car clamber
        their way backwards out of the wreckage.  They are covered
        in blood and their clothes are in shreds.

                                 COHAAGEN
                   I take it, then, you've failed
                   to get him again.

        Cohaagen turns to an associate, EMILE, a youngish,
        well-dressed executive type.

                                 COHAAGEN
                           (continuing)
                   Proceed with Operation Sphinx.

                                 EMILE
                   But, sir...

                                 COHAAGEN
                   With him...
                           (gestures toward
                            the mine)
                   ...on the lose, I'm not
                   taking any more chances.
                   Operation Sphinx will flush
                   him out.



93      INT. OLD MINE - NIGHT

        The solar car proceeds along the tunnel.  It enters an area
        full of smoke.  Dozens of men are sitting around smoking
        cigarettes, pipes and cigars.  Quail looks at them in
        amazement.

                                 QUAIL
                   What's all this?

                                 BENNIE
                   Nothin', boss.  Just old
                   smokies.  Only place they
                   can come for a puff.  It's
                   all banned topside.

        They have now climbed out of the car.  Quail looks
        searchingly at Melina and Bennie.

                                 QUAIL
                   So you two are into something
                   a bit more serious than the
                   taxi and truck-stop business.

                                 BENNIE
                   That's right, boss.

        He unzips his jacket to reveal a T-shirt with "MARTIAN
        LIBERATION FRONT" (and an appropriate symbol) emblazoned
        on it.

                                 QUAIL
                   My God!... T-shirts.  They
                   died out on Earth years ago.

                                 BENNIE
                           (hurt)
                   Well, maybe we ain't fashion
                   leaders, boss.

                                 MELINA
                   No.  But we still believe in
                   a free Mars.

        They walk as they talk - into a room off the main tunnel.
        It is adorned with "FREE MARS" and "MARTIAN LIBERATION
        FRONT" posters.  A group of people are printing T-shirts
        and leaflets.  They exchange greetings with Melina and
        Bennie.

                                 QUAIL
                   So where did I fit into all
                   this?

                                 MELINA
                   You - when you were Charles
                   Hauser with E.I.O -
                   infiltrated our group.  I
                   guess Cohaagen didn't trust
                   you any more when you and
                   I...

        Her gesture suggests their liaison.

                                 QUAIL
                   Yeah.  And I can't even
                   remember it.  We'll have to
                   arrange a return bout.

                                 MELINA
                   ...so he had your memory
                   wiped and fixed you up with
                   a new identity.

                                 QUAIL
                   But - the Sphinx.  Why is
                   that stuck in my mind?  Why's
                   it so important?

                                 MELINA
                   I don't know.

                                 BENNIE
                   Just an ole heap o' stone,
                   boss.

                                 QUAIL
                   It's more than that, Bennie,
                   I know it's more.  Somehow
                   it's connected.

        He slumps into a chair with frustration.

                                 MELINA
                           (reflecting)
                   Maybe there's a way  you can
                   get your memory back.

                                 QUAIL
                   How?  What?  Where?  When?

                                 MELINA
                   A bit of Martian Wisdom.
                   We're not all stupid
                   colonists.


99      EXT. CITY - NIGHT

        Bennie, Quail and Melina are walking in a crowded area
        of town.  Water sellers and food stalls are everywhere.
        An ARMORED LOUDSPEAKER VEHICLE appears, broadcasting to
        the crowd.  It is also swinging a powerful searchlight
        along the footpaths and streets.

                                 VOICE FROM LOUDSPEAKER
                   ...all residents are to
                   report to their nearest
                   space-travel agent within
                   twelve hours, all residents
                   will be departing on shuttles
                   within twenty-four hours.  Air
                   and water supplies will be cut
                   off at that time.  I repeat...

                                 MELINA
                   He's doing it!

                                 QUAIL
                   What?  Why?

                                 MELINA
                   Clearing everyone out!  It's
                   been rumored for months...

        The searchlight approaches Bennie, Quail and Melina.  Bennie
        ducks into a doorway, while Quail grabs Melina and kisses
        her passionately.  The light sees only the back of his head.
        She responds warmly to his kiss.

                                 QUAIL
                   Wow.  I can see why I was
                   willing to betray E.I.O.

                                 MELINA
                   I though you believed in
                   our cause?

                                 QUAIL
                   Yes.  Of course.  That, too.

        They move into the crowd.  The message on the
        loudspeaker is repeated.


101     INT. KUATO'S SANCTUARY - NIGHT

        The interior of the room is an amazing contrast to its
        ghetto exterior.  The decor is a baroque combination of
        Middle Eastern opulence and 21st century flash.  It looks
        like something out of "The Arabian Nights".

        A man enters from another room.  Although the man's features
        are East Indian, he is very much a Peter Lorre type;  he
        wears a small fez cap and a white linen robe with a cowl
        draped around the back of his neck.

                                 STRANGE MAN
                           (nodding to
                            Quail)
                   Your servant, Fahreem Kuato.
                   I greet you by the
                   twenty-seven names that still
                   remain, praying that you cast
                   jewels into the darkness and
                   given them to glow with the
                   colors of life.

        As Kuato speaks, Quail, unimpressed, talks, sotto voce,
        to Melina.

                                 QUAIL
                   What use is this weirdo?

                                 MELINA
                   Ssssh...there are skills on
                   mars that Earth has forgotten.

                                 KUATO
                   No need to introduce yourself,
                   Mr. Quail.
                           (smiles at Quail's
                            surprise)
                   Tolerate my presumption, but
                   it does not tax my powers to
                   know that you are the most
                   sought-after man on two
                   worlds.

        From the street the sound of loudspeakers giving information
        about Quail and Co. can be heard.  Searchlight beams
        occasionally sweep past the windows.

                                 KUATO
                           (continuing)
                   This way, my dear man.  We
                   have much to accomplish --
                           (ominously)
                   -- and very little time.


102     INT. KUATO'S INNER SANCTUM - NIGHT

        A Bysantine salon filled with enormous Oriental pillows.

        (NOTE:  In the scenes inside Kuato's sanctum, the loudspeaker
                vans in the outside streets can be heard from time to
                to time.  They are repeating the evacuation message
                from scene 99, but alternating it with a call for the
                apprehension of Quail and Melina...

                                 VOICE FROM LOUDSPEAKER
                   ...for information leading to
                   these arrests, first-class
                   travel to Earth will be
                   provided plus a weekend at
                   the Leningrad Disneyworld,
                   all expenses paid.  I repeat,
                   an Oriental girl and Earthman,
                   possibly to be found in the
                   company of a black taxi driver.
                   These are dangerous subversives
                   and sworn enemies of the
                   glorious Peoples Republic of
                   Mars...)

                                 KUATO
                   The turbulence you hear
                   outside is but a reflection
                   of the turmoil within you.
                   You have brought it to Mars
                   in your search for yourself.

        Kuato takes a seat on the pillows, invites the others to
        join him.  Quail hesitates.

                                 QUAIL
                   And you're going to help me
                   by reading my mind?

                                 KUATO
                   Indubitably.  There is only
                   small matter of a fee.

        THREE RESPONSES COME TOGETHER.

                                 QUAIL
                   A fee!

                                 KAUTO
                   Naturally.

                                 MELINA
                   This is for our cause!

                                 KUATO
                           (soothingly)
                   Income before ideals.  Shall
                   we say five-hundred-thousand
                   dollars?

                                 QUAIL
                           (appalled)
                   Five-hundred-thousand Martian
                   dollars, that's...
                           (think,
                            calculating the
                            exchange rate)

                                 KUATO
                   Not Martian dollars, Mr.
                   Quail - Earth dollars.

                                 MELINA
                   That's interplanetary robbery!

                                 QUAIL
                   With today's exchange rate...
                   that's over two million
                   Martian dollars!

                                 KUATO
                           (suave)
                   What price do you put, Mr.
                   Quail, on the future of the
                   solar system?

                                 BENNIE
                   Aw, come off it, man.  Just
                   for a bit of mumbo-jumbo
                   with a crystal ball.

                                 KUATO
                           (his manner
                            slipping)
                   Listen, buster, we're talking
                   heavy stuff here.  You try
                   and work out what's with this
                   guy!

        He jerks his thumb toward Quail.

                                 QUAIL
                   Okay!  Okay!  I'll pay it,
                   but the Interstellar Trade
                   Practices Commission might
                   be interested in this.

        Everyone calms down.

        Kuato smiles.  He extinguishes all the lights save one
        small blue one, which illuminates the room eerily, like
        a seance.

                                 KUATO
                   Retrieving the past is like
                   walking backwards along a
                   perilous road.  The
                   half-recalled, the
                   half-forgotten, the repressed,
                   the fantasies, the triumphs,
                   joys, failures, betrayals...

        He closes his eyes and concentrates.

                                 KUATO
                           (continuing)
                   Yes... I can feel it... a
                   wall.  Erasure techniques are
                   so brutal.
                           (frowns; scans
                            harder)
                   Blocks.  Side channels.
                   Future and past all jumbled.
                   I shall have to enter deep
                   trance to break through.
                           (rising)
                   I will be scanning you through
                   the Oracle Head.

        Kauto turns around and sits down with back toward Quail.
        He reaches up and lowers his cowl, REVEALING:

        A TINY LITTLE HEAD GROWING OUT OF THE BACK OF HIS NECK!

        The head's eyes are closed in sleep.  It is utterly hairless
        and looks like one of those dolls made from dried apples; a
        shriveled, ancient-looking yellow little ball.

        The LITTLE FACE TWITCHED, YAWNS and OPENS ITS EYES, BLINKS.
        It looks at Melina, then at Quail.

        It opens its toothless little mouth and SPEAKS.

                                 ORACLE HEAD
                   Do not fear me.  I need your
                   openness...

        ZOOM IN ON QUAIL'S EYES.

                                 ORACLE HEAD
                           (continuing)
                   Open you thoughts to my
                   presence...

        CONTINUE ZOOM UNTIL ENTIRE FRAME is filled by QUAIL'S EYE.

                                 ORACLE HEAD
                           (continuing)
                   Open...

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


        BLACKNESS BROKEN BY PULSES OF WHITE LIGHT

        The alternations between dark (ACTION) and white (LIGHT)
        are RHYTHMICAL so as to create a hypnotic, dream-like
        feeling.


103     WHITE LIGHT

        Fades to reveal a dramatic CLOSE UP of the SPHINX.  We see
        its face, shoulders and behind it the red Martian sky --


103A    PULL BACK

        to reveal the Sphinx is a PROJECTION on a screen in a
        windowless briefing room.  Quail is seated across from
        Cohaagen and other SENIOR E.I.O. OFFICERS.  On the walls
        are numerous satellite photos, recon maps and excavation
        drawings -- all relating to the Sphinx.


107     EXT. MARTIAN SPHINX - SUNSET

        Scaffolding and excavation works cover a wall of the Sphinx;
        the Sphinx's huge CARVED FACE visible in the background.

        Quail and several other E.I.O. agents stand poised, wearing
        breathing masks and protective gear, as a powerful
        excavation device prizes back a huge stone, revealing
        an ENTRANCE TO SOME KIND OF HIDDEN CHAMBER.

        The other agents are fearful, don't want to proceed.  Quail
        ignores them, enters the chamber --


107A    CLOSE - QUAIL'S FACE

        As he enters.  We read awe, shock and fascination on his
        features.  He approaches something we can't see.  His
        hand reaches out.

        Suddenly, a bolt of incredible powerful energy flashes out,
        striking Quail like a bolt of lightning.

        WHITE LIGHT.


105     INT. LAST CHANCE SALOON - NIGHT

        Quail and Melina are dancing.  The faceted mirror ball on
        the ceiling become the --

        WHITE LIGHT.


106     INT. BEDROOM - DAY

        Melina watches from the bed as Quail dresses.  She rises,
        with only the sheet around her, tries desperately to make
        Quail stay.  Plainly he wants to, but he can't.  They kiss
        lingeringly;  then Quail, as if "called to duty," exits.

        WHITE LIGHT.


108     INT. DETENTION CELL - WINDOWLESS

        Quail alone, hands bound, in a holding chamber.  Suddenly,
        the door opens and THREE BEEFY E.I.O. AGENTS enter.  They
        grab Quail to haul him out.  Quail battles them with
        amazing skill and resourcefulness.  With his bound hands
        he SLUGS ONE MAN, hurling him into a wall;  he RABBIT-
        PUNCHES a second man with a two-handed blow and KNOCKS
        HIM UNCONSCIOUS.  The third man sneaks around behind
        Quail and DROPS HIM WITH A BLACKJACK to the back of the
        head.

        WHITE LIGHT.


109     INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - WINDOWLESS

        Quail on his back, all four limbs pinned by some futuristic
        version of "the rack," his head held imobile by a FEARSOME
        DEVICE similar to the one we glimpsed on Earth, in the van
        the two agents tried to shove him into.

        Several DOCTORS stand over him.  INTO FRAME moves...
        Cohaagen!

        Cohaagen orders the doctors to attach electrodes to PROBES
        already inserted into Quail's brain.  As they turn up the
        power, Quail's face contorts in a grimace of agony --

                                 ORACLE HEAD'S VOICE
                   You have seen your past.
                   Now read the future...

        WHITE LIGHT.


110     INT. SURREAL TUNNEL - DAY OR NIGHT

        The same scene we saw during the film's OPENING SEQUENCE.

        A man wearing a LIGHT-WEIGHT THERMAL SUIT races through a
        LABYRINTH OF TUNNELS.  The GROUND TREMBLES beneath him, as
        if in an earthquake.  EXPLOSIONS rumble deep in the ground
        below him.  Suddenly we realize -- the man is Quail


        INSERT - CLOSE - QUAIL

        He throws a backward glance over his shoulder, fearfully,
        as he runs.  Suddenly a BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT floods in
        from ahead of him;  he puts up his hands to protect his
        eyes -- and sees his hands are SPLATTERED WITH BLOOD!

        Quail runs even faster -- ahead the BRILLIANT LIGHT seems
        to promise safety.  He battles toward it.  SOUNDS OF
        EXPLOSIONS increase, building urgency.  Up ahead, emerging
        from the light, HANDS REACH OUT TO HELP QUAIL.  He seems
        almost to safety.  But just as he REACHES THE HANDS --

        TWO GUNSHOTS RING OUT!

                                                      SHOCK CUT TO:


111     INT. KUATO'S INNER SANCTUM - NIGHT

        Quail awakens with a jolt.  White as a sheet... sweating
        like he's just run ten miles.  Then:  a transformation
        seems to come over him.  He LOOKS -- and SEES:

        KUATO slumped across the cushions -- MELINA beside Kuato --
        BENNIE standing holding a smoking GUN trained on Kuato.

                                 MELINA
                           (rushes to Quail)
                   Charles!  Are you all right?

        Quail stares at her, as if an entire bank of lost memories
        were suddenly clicking back into place --

                                 MELINA
                           (continuing)
                   He kept dragging you deeper
                   and deeper into the trance!
                   We couldn't wake either of
                   you!

                                 BENNIE
                   You stopped breathing!

        Quail gives Bennie that same eerie look, then turns to
        Kuato, who is sprawled motionless across the pillows, a
        curl of smoke rising from two entry wounds in his spine.

                                 QUAIL
                   Why did you kill him?  It
                   was the next bit I really...

                                 BENNIE
                   No choice, boss.  It was him
                   or you.

        Quail lunges across the pillows to Kuato's unbreathing
        form.  Quail shakes the ancient mystic, trying to find a
        last flicker of life.

        Kuato's body is dead white.  Quail releases his grip;
        he about to give up when --

        A MUFFLED CHOCKED SOUND comes from behind Kuato's neck.
        It's the Oracle Head!  Quail instantly rolls Kuato's body
        over.  The Head is still alive!

        Quail bends closer, kneeling.

                                 ORACLE HEAD
                           (whispers)
                   -- the vengence you seek...
                   and the salvation of Mars...
                   are waiting for you in the
                   crown of the Sphinx.
                           (sags, gasping)

        The Oracle Head lets out a LONG SIGH and goes limp, a
        small trickle of blood oozing from the corner of its
        mouth.

                                 BENNIE
                   Phobos and Demos!  What was
                   that all about?

        Quail ignores him, still kneeling -- deep in thought --
        over the Oracle Head.

                                 MELINA
                   Are you okay?... Charles?
                   Doug?  Whoever?

        Quail reaches out and closes the Oracle Head's tiny
        eyelids.  Melina and Bennie exchange a glance.  Then:


        QUAIL

        Stands.  For a moment his back is to Melina and Bennie.
        Then he turns.

        He has become a different man.  His eyes gleam.  He is
        forceful, purposeful, contained.  Once again the ace E.I.O.
        agent.  Melina senses immediately that this is the man she
        knew before

                                 QUAIL
                           (even his voice
                            has changed)
                   I'm fine... only I'm not
                   Doug -- I'm Charles Hauser...
                   and I know everything Hauser
                   knew.

        He turns to Bennie

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   Bennie, where's your depot?

                                 BENNIE
                           (working it out)
                   Well... you go outta here...
                   take a left, then down past
                   the first... no second...
                   water bureau you...

                                 QUAIL
                           (briskly)
                   Can you get us there?

                                 BENNIE
                   No problem.

                                 MELINA
                   But why?

                                 QUAIL
                   We're going to the Sphinx.

        He strides off.  The others follow, still full of questions.

                                 BENNIE
                   Impossible, man.  Guards
                   everywhere.

                                 MELINA
                   The Oracle... what did you
                   learn?

                                 QUAIL
                   Only everything.  I've got
                   total recall.

        They are now heading down the stairs toward the street.


114     EXT. STREET - EARLY MORNING

        Quail, Melina and Bennie make their way through the crowds
        to Bennie's depot.  The streets are even busier then before -
        people are now beginning to evacuate the city.  Everyone is
        carrying their possessions - bundles, suitcases, pets, etc.,
        etc.  The loudspeaker vans are still touring and broad-
        casting the same message.

        Bennie indicates a building on their left.


115     INT. CAR POOL - EARLY MORNING

        Bennie and Melina follow Quail as he walks up and down the
        rows of vehicles in the vast building.  There are bull-
        dozers and ore haulers as well as solar taxis.

                                 BENNIE
                   We'll never get near the
                   Sphinx!  They'll blow us
                   apart!

        Quail ignores him as he continues to mumble to himself.
        He rapidly but carefully inspects each vehicle as they
        pass.  Camera tracks rapidly with them.

                                 MELINA
                   What are we doing, Charles?
                   For God's sake, tell us.

                                 QUAIL
                   The Sphinx... it's not some
                   useless artifact, it's a
                   machine built by some alien
                   race eighteen millions years
                   ago.  The same race that
                   built the on one Earth...
                   for the same purpose.

        He stops in front of a large, odd-shaped vehicle with a
        large scoop or propeller on the front.

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   This is what we need.

        He begins to climb in;  the others follow.

                                 BENNIE
                           (referring to the
                            Sphinx)
                   It's a hunk of old stone,
                   man.

                                 MELINA
                           (ditto)
                   Purpose?  What purpose?

        Bennie starts the engine.

                                 QUAIL
                   Come on, Bennie, move it.
                           (then, to Melina)
                   Have you heard the word,
                   "terriform"?

        Melina shakes her head.  The vehicle moves off.


115A    EXT. AIR LOCK - MORNING

        GUARDS are carefully checking every vehicle leaving the
        city, though this has to be done fairly rapidly because
        of the inhabitants leaving for the Space Ports.

        The vehicle with Bennie, Quail and Melina arrives.


115B    INT. VEHICLE - AIR LOCK - MORNING

        Bennie is nervous.  Melina and Quail are in the back, but
        cannot be seen.  Guards are checking all vehicles exiting,
        looking for Quail and Melina.

                                 BENNIE
                           (calling to
                            Guards)
                   Just deliverin' some old junk
                   to the mine out at Apidalia
                   Planitia.  Got them people
                   you're lookin' for in the
                   back as well.

        The Guards laugh and signal him on.

        Once through the second door of the air lock (i.e. to the
        area outside the city), Quail and Melina emerge and sit
        up on the rear seats.

                                 QUAIL
                   The machine in the Sphinx is
                   tapped straight down to the
                   molten core of this planet.
                   There are tunnels and ducts
                   everywhere, all powered by
                   fusion generators...

                                 BENNIE
                   You sure the little man
                   didn't fry your brain, Quail?

                                 MELINA
                           (overlapping)
                   For what?  To do what?

                                 QUAIL
                   To combine elements in the
                   Martian core and release
                   them as oxygen, hydrogen
                   and nitrogen.

                                 BENNIE
                   That's air!


116B    EXT. DESERT - MORNING

        In a wide shot, the vehicle is traversing the desert.  The
        domed city is some distance in the background.  Voices are
        heard in false perspective.  Emphasis is on the dry and
        hostile natural landscape of Mars.

                                 QUAIL
                   That's right.  Air and water.
                   Terriforming will create a
                   permanent livable environment
                   for Mars.  No more pressurized
                   cities, no more containers in
                   the desert.  There'll be
                   rivers, vegetation - life -
                   the same as Earth.

                                 MELINA
                           (baffled)
                   So why is Cohaagen shipping
                   everyone out?

                                 QUAIL
                   Don't you see?!  From being
                   a pile of red dirt with
                   minerals, Mars is going to
                   change into  a chunk of
                   priceless real estate.

                                 MELINA
                   And Cohaagen's going to own
                   it all!

                                 QUAIL
                   Right!  He can start selling
                   it off to well-heeled investors
                   from Earth.  Beach condos, ski
                   resorts, you name it.

                                 MELINA
                   No wonder he wanted you to...
                   penetrate... out group.

                                 QUAIL
                           (nods)
                   Once word of this gets out,
                   the whole planet will support
                   you.


117     EXT. DESERT - DAY

        The vehicle is now approaching the Sphinx.  Both it and
        the pyramids can be seen some distance away.

        Voice are heard in CU perspective.

                                 MELINA
                   So what can we do?

                                 QUAIL
                   Ruin his little scheme by
                   terriforming ahead of
                   schedule - while the
                   inhabitants are still here.

        Melina is amazed.

                                 MELINA
                   But who'll work the machine?
                   Do you know how?

                                 QUAIL
                   I'm the only one who does.
                   Why do you think Cohaagen's
                   left me alone all this time?


118     EXT. DESERT - DAY

        The vehicle is even closer to the Sphinx.

                                 QUAIL
                   I was the first one inside
                   when they cracked the riddle
                   of the Sphinx.  It must've
                   been programmed.  Some kind
                   of...force...shot into me.

                                 MELINA
                   But Cohaagen wiped your
                   memory!!!

                                 QUAIL
                           (smoothly)
                   Just a way of putting me on
                   ice.  He'd of reversed it
                   once the planet was evacuated.

                                 BENNIE
                   Man!  This is real complicated.
                   Go over it again, real slow.


119     INT. VEHICLE - DAY

                                 QUAIL
                           (ignoring Bennie's
                            aside)
                   What he hadn't counted on was
                   your effect on me.

                                 MELINA
                           (smiling)
                   And all without the marvels
                   of modern science!

        Quail looks out the back window, his attention attracted
        by two patrol vehicles.  They are some distance away, but
        approaching steadily.


119A    EXT. DESERT - DAY

        A wide shot shows a total of four patrol vehicles approach-
        ing the vehicle with Quail, Melina and Bennie.  Suddenly,
        it stops moving.


120     INT. VEHICLE - DAY

        The vehicle had just stopped.

                                 QUAIL
                   Bennie, don't stop now, take
                   it...

        He turns to see Bennie is covering him and Melina with a
        pistol.

                                 MELINA
                   You bastard.

                                 BENNIE
                   Like I said.  It's a tough
                   planet.  I'm a baddie, not
                   a goodie.

                                 QUAIL
                   I should have known, you
                   were just too helpful.

                                 BENNIE
                   EIO Rule One, man.  Trust
                   Nobody.  Now you can do
                   your terriforming stuff
                   right when those space
                   shuttles are gone.

                                 MELINA
                   But what about the Martian
                   people?  Out cause?  I thought
                   you believed in it.

                                 BENNIE
                   Your cause?  That bunch of
                   dead beat radicals!  When I
                   hand in this little number...
                           (flicks his gun
                            in Quail's face)
                   ...I'll get real estate rights
                   on the whole of Chryse
                   Planitia...

        At that instant, Melina lunges, PUNCHES A RED EMERGENCY
        BUTTON.  The VENT beside Bennie's hand BLOWS OPEN, [causing]
        a powerful suction caused by Mars's vacuum atmosphere.
        Bennie's gun hand is PLANTED AGAINST THE VENT [OPENING.]

        Simultaneously, the air in the vehicle starts rushing out!
        All three parties begin choking.  As Bennie's mechanical
        hand claws for the lever that seals the vent, Quail has
        a moment to jump him.  He pounds Bennie's gun hand, the
        PISTOL IS SUCKED, CLATTERING, OUT THE VENT!

        Quail delivers a roundhouse punch to Bennie, knocking him
        clear across the bus.

        Melina seals the vent, REPRESSURIZES THE CABIN.

        Bennie gets up off the floor, shaking off Quail's punch--


121     EXT. DESERT - DAY

        The E.I.O. vehicle are a half mile off -- and closing in.


122     INT. SAND MOLE - DAY

        Quail glances at the vehicles, turns to Bennie -- ready
        to jump him.  But stops short at what he sees Bennie doing.

        Bennie is clipping on his MECHANICAL ARM.  It sprouts
        several rows of vicious-looking STEEL BLADES --

                                 BENNIE
                   This makes Bennie a cut above
                   anyone else.

        Bennie presses another button and the BLADES START SPINNING.
        Bennie's mechanical arm is in effect now a BUZZ SAW!

        The fight begins.  Bennie attacks Quail with his buzz-saw
        arm;  Quail dodges.  Bennie's arm shreds various articles
        in the cabin -- and keeps Melina at bay with well-timed
        swipes.  Finally Bennie gets in a roundhouse punch to
        Quail's jaw with his real hand.  Quail sprawls, dazed.

        Now Bennie goes for the kill.  But Melina leaps onto him.
        Bennie grabs her by the hair and moves his SPINNING HAND
        in for the quick kill.  Melina clutches the terrifying
        appendage with both hands, desperately keeping it at bay.
        But her strength is no match for Bennie; the whirring
        blades are just about to bite into Melina's neck when --

        Quail comes back, lands a ferocious rabbit punch to
        Bennie's spine.  Quail lunges at him, grabs the blade
        weapon;  he and Bennie crash into the cabin wall and --

        The BLADE RIPS CLEAR THROUGH THE MOLE'S WALL!  Alarms
        sound as a GAPING HOLE IS BLOWN IN THE SIDE OF THE
        CABIN!  ALL THE AIR IS SUCKED OUT BY MARS'S EXTERNAL
        VACUUM!

        Now no one can breathe.  They all claw for their masks,
        [still] in place.  Bennie is first;  he recovers, lunges
        with his SPINNING ARM for Quail.  Quail barely dodges,
        grabs the arm, muscles it back toward Bennie --

        The SPINNING BLADES SEVER BENNIE'S OWN OXYGEN LINE!  Gasp-
        ing, he falters.  Quail aims a titanic blow, PUNCHES
        BENNIE out through the hole in the mole's wall!

        Quail and Melina, masks on, stare out as Bennie claws
        desperately at his severed air line.  The Martian vacuum
        pulls the oxygen from Bennie's lungs, he chokes, staggers --


122AA   EXT. DESERT - DAY

        Bennie is beside the vehicle.  He implodes like a balloon
        with all its air gone.


122AB   INT/EXT. VEHICLE - DAY

        Melina hides her face in horror.  At that instant --


122A    EXT. DESERT - DAY

        Bullets dig into the sand all around the vehicle.  The
        patrol cars are only a few hundred yards away!  Loud-
        speakers call for Quail's surrender.


122B    INT. VEHICLE - DAY

        Quail lunges for the vehicle controls.  Presses a button
        marked "Dive".  The vehicle tilts.


122C    EXT. DESERT - DAY

        The vehicle burrows powerfully into the sand.  As the
        patrol cars close in and rake the desert with gunfire,
        the vehicle vanishes from sight.  In the distance, the
        Sphinx looms ominously.

        A driver in one of the patrol vehicles (filmed from outside
        the windscreen) is speaking into a microphone.  He can't
        be heard but can only be radioing a report.


123     INT. SAND MOLE - MOVING - UNDERGROUND

        The little mining vehicle moves powerfully, propelled by
        its BORER NOSE.

        Quail mans the controls while Melina struggles to shore up
        the gaping hole in the side, into which SAND is POURING
        as the mole moves forward.  Quail looks at a compass in
        the control panel.  He makes a correction.

                                 QUAIL
                           (shouts over
                            engine noise)
                   Hope I've got this direction
                   right.

        Sand pours over him from bullet holes resulting from the
        encounter with patrol cars.

        CU speedometer:  22 MPH.  Every other gauge is overheating,
        flashing WARNING LIGHTS --


124     INT. SPHINX CONTROL ROOM - DAY

        Cohaagen and a number of his associates, plus scientists
        and heavily arms troops are present.

                                 COHAAGEN
                   The air supply is off under
                   the domes?

                                 EMILE
                   Yes, sir.  In a couple of
                   hours it'll be all gone.

                                 COHAAGEN
                   Any trouble with the rabble?

                                 EMILE
                   Not much, sir.  A lot of
                   complaining.  But they're
                   all heading towards the
                   shuttle areas.

        On some of the video screens a number of space shuttles
        can be seen, ready for departure to Earth.


123     INT. TUNNEL BENEATH SPHINX

        The Mole bores through a sand wall, emerges into a cramped
        horizontal tunnel.  Quail and Melina leap out.  The poor
        Mole is smoking like an overheated drill bit.  Its nose
        is worn to a nub.

                                 MELINA
                   We got in with this thing,
                   but we'll never get back out.

                                 QUAIL
                   A shame.  Such a pleasant
                   trip.

        There's a lighted area at the end of the tunnel.  Quail
        and Melina hurry toward it, moving silently, close to
        the wall.


126B    INT. MAIN DOWNSHAFT

        They draw up an abyss -- where their tunnel intersects the
        MAIN DOWNSHAFT.  Melina gasps at the colossal scale of the
        drilling, hundreds of yards across, deeper than the eye
        can see, and crisscrossed by catwalks, buttresses and
        super-sophisticated technology.

        Quail and Melina are forty feet below the upper end of
        the main downshaft.  They can look up the shaft and
        see the first interior level of the Sphinx itself.

                                 QUAIL
                           (points down
                            shaft)
                   This is the main tap --
                   straight down to the core
                   of Mars.  When we trigger
                   the mechanism, fusion
                   reactors will detonate down
                   there -- four hundred miles
                   deep.

                                 MELINA
                   Remind me not to slip.

                                 QUAIL
                   The new elements will come
                   booming up through this
                   shaft -- and six thousand
                   others all around the
                   planet.

        He's right at home -- and full of confidence.

        Quail climbs onto the ladder, which links various top
        levels.

        He starts to climb.  Melina follows him.  They are tiny
        figures.  The space around them plummets down to infinity.


127     INT. CORRIDOR AT TOP OF SHAFT - LOWEST MANNED LEVEL (LEVEL ONE)

        A patrol of NINE HEAVILY-ARMED GUARDS appear from a corridor
        in Level One -- directly above where Quail and Melina are
        climbing.


128     ON THE WALL OF THE SHAFT

        Quail and Melina's heads inch into view at floor level.
        They take one peek at these formidable warriors and duck
        back swiftly out of sight.


129     INT. TOP OF SHAFT - LOWEST MANNED LEVEL (LEVEL ONE)

                                 GUARD LEADER
                           (to two of his
                            men)
                   Stay in contact.  I want to
                   hear from this checkpoint
                   every four minutes.

        Seven of the Guards move off, two remain in position.

        We HEAR the FOOTSTEPS of the seven guards recede.

        The two remaining guards realize their isolation; they
        glance tensely to one another.

                                 GUARD #1
                   Did you hear something?

                                 GUARD #2
                   No.  Where?

                                 GUARD #1 
                   Over there.

        The First Guard points to the edge  of the main shaft --
        right where Quail and Melina are hiding.  The Guards
        cock their weapons, start cautiously forward.  Just as
        they're about to peer over the brink, guns at the
        ready:

                                 QUAIL'S VOICE (O.S.)
                           (from behind the
                            guards)
                   I'm not there, boys.  I'm
                   here.

        The guards spin around, weapons poised.  Standing in the
        shadows, near the corridor, is Quail!  (Still with no
        gun)

        Both guards walk quickly toward Quail, covering him with
        their weapons.

                                 GUARD #1
                           (to Guard #2)
                   Watch him.  He was EIO trained.
                   They're all full of tricks.

                                 GUARD #2
                   Yeah?  Like...who was that
                   guy? -- Fred Bond??
                           (to Quail)
                   Keep 'em up, Fred, keep 'em
                   up.

        Quail has his arms raised high.  Just as the Guards reach
        him, he fizzes electronically, emitting a humming sound,
        then disappears.

                                 GUARD #1
                   A hologram!

        Before either Guard can react, the real Quail appears --
        one foot behind them.  With two LIGHTNING BLOWS, he
        dispatches the Guards.  (Apparently Quail has climbed out
        of the shaft while the Guards were distracted.)

        Quail snatches both Guards' weapons, grenades and ammo
        belts.  Melina climbs out of the shaft.  Quail tosses her
        one of the Guard's guns.


130     INT. CORRIDOR - LEVEL ONE

        ALARMS go off everywhere.  Quail -- carrying a gun and all
        the grenades and ammo belts -- and Melina (just carrying a
        gun) bolt down a corridor past a sign: "LEVEL ONE".

                                 MELINA
                           (running)
                   Where'd you get that little
                   trick?

                                 QUAIL
                           (running)
                   Mail-order company.  It's a
                   great one for fooling the
                   wife.


131     INT. CONTROL ROOM (LEVEL THIRTEEN)

        Cohaagen and his Aides hear the ALARMS, see Quail and
        Melina on MONITORS as they race down the corridor on
        Level One.

                                 COHAAGEN
                   How the hell did they get in?

                                 SECURITY AIDE
                   Up the fusion core.

                                 COHAAGEN
                   Up the fusion core??

        He exhibits begrudging admiration for Quail.

                                 SECURITY AIDE
                           (studies monitor
                            more carefully)
                   They're on Level One.

        A wall sign behind Cohaagen reads:  "LEVEL THIRTEEN".

                                 COHAAGEN
                   Seal all upper levels.

        A button is pressed and huge doors slide across in front
        of the formidable doors already closing the Control Room
        off from the outside corridors.


133     INT. LEVEL ONE CORRIDOR

        Quail and Melina are still racing through the corridors.
        He passes her a fresh ammo belt.

                                 QUAIL
                           (indicates
                            weapons)
                   Know how to use one of these?

        Melina expertly ejects her spent clip (that Guards fired
        at Quail), slams in a fresh clip and cocks the gun.

        Quail has a half-second to react, impressed, then --
        FOUR GUARDS pound into view at the end of the corridor.

        Melina opens fire, nails two.  Quail heaves a grenade; as
        it EXPLODES, he and Melina bolt down a side corridor --


134     INT. VARIOUS CORRIDORS, CATWALKS, STAIRS

        ALARMS continue as Quail and Melina dash down the side
        passageway.  MORE GUARDS cut them off;  Melina's machine
        gun sends them scattering --

        Quail pauses at a corner.  He looks around quickly and sees
        that an elevator is arriving.  He motions Melina back.  The
        doors of the elevator begin to open.  Very quickly, Quail
        bobs his head and arm around the corner.  He calls out,
        loudly...

                                 QUAIL
                   Catch!
        He hurls something toward the armed men in the elevator.
        Instinctively one of them reaches for the thrown object.
        It is an explosive device of some sort.  Quail and Melina
        press themselves against the wall just around a corner from
        the elevator.  There is a tremendous explosion.

        Quail, followed by Melina, rounds a corner.  The elevator
        is in ruins; bodies are scattered everywhere.

                                 MELINA
                   Great stuff, but how do we
                   get up?

        She points toward the upper levels.


135     INT. CONTROL ROOM (LEVEL THIRTEEN)

        Melina and Quail can be seen on the security monitor from
        a high angle.  Quail looks up, spots the monitor, and
        shoots is to pieces.  The image on the screen goes black.

                                 COHAAGEN
                   Forget them.  We'll pick up
                   Quail once the shuttles have
                   left for Earth.


137     INT. CORRIDOR

        Quail spots a large WINDOWED AIR LOCK at the end of the
        corridor.  He and Melina race to it.  Quail starts to open
        the inner door of the air lock.

                                 QUAIL
                   If you're afraid of the
                   heights, you better get
                   over it real quick.

        He is pulling Melina through the inner air lock door just
        as --

        GUARDS stampede around the corner of the corridor toward
        them.

        Quail is out of sight, but they see Melina poised near the
        window.  She waves and smiles to them, hiding her gun behind
        her body.  They slow down and approach less cautiously,
        beguiled by her manner and attractiveness.  As they get
        close, she suddenly lifts her gun and opens fire, mowing
        them down.


140     EXT. SPHINX'S FACE - DAY

        Quail and Melina climb through the outer air lock door.
        They are at the Sphinx's shoulder, with a dizzying drop
        beneath them.  Melina looks down.  She's sorry she did:
        the fall is at least 200 feet.  (Both are wearing their
        breathing apparatus.)

        Quail and Melina start to climb.  Up the Sphinx's shoulder,
        along its Egyptian-like headdress --


141     INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

        Cohaagen's chief aide, Emile, addresses him quietly.

                                 EMILE
                   If Quail's the only one who
                   can operate all this...
                           (gestures toward
                            Sphinx's controls)
                   ...then he can call all the
                   shots.

                                 COHAAGEN
                   We'll tell him the computer's
                   worked out the operational
                   details so we don't really
                   need him.  We're just doing
                   him a favor.

                                 EMILE
                   And if that doesn't work?

                                 COHAAGEN
                   We offer him rewards.

                                 EMILE
                   What if that doesn't work?

                                 COHAAGEN
                   We'll torture him.  You don't
                   think I got this far by being
                   a nice guy?


142     EXT. SPHINX'S FACE - DAY

        Quail and Melina traverse across the cheekbones, haul
        themselves up at the base of the red translucent eyes --


142A    INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

        The video monitors show the space shuttles.  An operator,
        with earphones, turns to Cohaagen.

                                 OPERATOR
                   First of the shuttles ready
                   for departure, sir.  Two
                   minute countdown.


142B    EXT. SPHINX - DAY

        Quail jams THREE GRENADES against the glass of the eyes,
        pulls Melina back behind the stone cheeks --


143     INT. SPHINX CONTROL ROOM

        A MUFFLED EXPLOSION (due to the thin Martian atmosphere)
        detonates overhead.  THE SPHINX'S RIGHT EYE BLOWS IN a
        storm of shards and shrapnell.

        Instantly, the room turns into a hurricane as the Martian
        vacuum sucks out all air!  Everyone panics, grabbing their

                                 COHAAGEN
                   Seal the breach!  Repressurize!

        An aide dives for an EMERGENCY SWITCH.  But now --

        Quail and Melina, wearing breather masks, bursts in onto
        an overhead catwalk.  They OPEN FIRE on the Guards, who are
        choking, struggling with their masks.

        An EMERGENCY PRESSURE SEAL powers into place, sealing the
        breach in the eye.  REPRESSURIZATION comes up, the internal
        atmosphere stabilizes --

        None of the men inside the control room still moves.  The
        victors tug off their masks, spring down to the main level.
        Melina hurries to the main control panel.

        Melina looks towards the video monitors showing half a
        dozen huge space shuttles lined up for departure.

                                 MELINA
                   Those shuttles are starting up
                   any minute.  If you know how
                   to work this thing, you better
                   do it now.

        Quail tentatively approaches the imposingly complex
        machinery.

                                 QUAIL
                   Yes...

        He hesitates.

                                 MELINA
                   Don't you know how?

        Transfixed, mesmerized, Quail moves closer to the control
        panel.

                                 QUAIL
                   Yes... there's a vital
                   connection missing...

        He approaches even closer.  He begins to raise his arm
        towards a blank area a little above his head.

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   ...me...

                                 COHAAGEN
                   Wait!

                                 MELINA
                   Don't wait!

                                 COHAAGEN
                   If you activate the mechanism
                   you'll die...there were
                   glimpses of it in your
                   memory.

                                 QUAIL
                   Wrong, Cohaagen, there's a
                   long tunnel, a brilliant
                   white light, hands reaching
                   for me...

                                 COHAAGEN
                           (assured)
                   That's your death.  That's
                   what it looks like.  That's
                   what is always looks like.

        Quail looks around him, half-convinced.

                                 MELINA
                           (looking toward
                            space shuttles
                            on video screens)
                   Charles - for Mars's sake....

        Quail hesitates.  He looks from Melina to Cohaagen.

                                 COHAAGEN
                   It's not too late.  Join us
                   again.  U've a lot to offer.
                   A whole world.

        Quail continues to look at him, thoughtfully.

                                 QUAIL
                   You don't deserve a new world,
                   you and people like you made
                   too big a mess of the old one.
                   Time someone else had a
                   chance.

        He turns back to the machine and slowly raises his arm
        again.  His fingers reach towards the blank section on
        the panel.  Slowly, through the panel, a luminous hand
        reaches toward Quail's fingers.  Gently, the fingers of
        the two hands touch.

        The entire control room begins to rumble and shudder.  As
        Quail reaches for Melina, Cohaagen suddenly dives on him.
        They grapple amid the shuddering Sphinx and can be seen
        only intermittently as debris crashes around them.

        The fight ends as Cohaagen is hurled backwards and
        disappears when a section of floor collapses underneath him.


144     INT. SURREAL TUNNEL

        A reprise of the sequence that opened the movie.

        Quail RUNS THROUGH A LABYRINTH OF TUNNELS.  THE GROUND
        HEAVES BENEATH HIM ... HUGE STONE BLOCKS CRASH DONW ON
        ALL SIDES!  We hear an EXPLOSION and ANOTHER and ANOTHER,
        each one SOUNDING CLOSER than the last --

        Quail clamps him breathing mask on as he runs.  Is this
        his own death?  Where is Melina?

        The tunnel walls are just like the ones in Quail's
        original nightmare -- bright reddish-orange, clay and
        quartz.

        Quail throws a backward glance fearfully over his shoulder.
        The EXPLOSIONS are closer.  Suddenly --

        Up ahead appears a BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT.  Quail sees it,
        but it only terrifies him more.  Is it death he's running
        to?  He hurries on with all his strength, but --

        Just as he nears the white light, HE FALLS.  On his knees,
        too weak to move.  He struggles --

        HANDS ARE REACHING OUT TO HIM, from out of the brilliant
        light.  Quail stretches for them, just as --

        A FINAL EXPLOSION blows him forward -- straight into the
        WHITE LIGHT!  The HANDS SEIZE HIM, pull him upward to --


145     EXT. MARTIAN DESERT - DAY

        The hands belong to breather-masked MINERS, dismounting
        rapidly from an overloaded transport vehicle which was
        taking them to the Space Port.  Quail looks from them to
        Melina, who is walking towards the group.

        
        QUAIL'S P.O.V. - MINERS' MASKED FACES

        The miners' desert garb, shield goggles and breathers add
        to the surreal nightmare quality of Quail's tortured
        perspective --


        BACK TO QUAIL

        In terror, lost, disoriented totally.

                                 QUAIL
                   Am I dying?

                                 MASKED MINER
                   I won't lie to you, pal.
                   You are.

                                 MINER (from Melina's bar)
                   I'd say in about forty years...
                           (he and others
                            help Quail to
                            his feet)
                   ...come on, we've gotta get
                   to the Space Port.  That
                   Intergalactic Napoleon's
                   switched off the air.

                                 2ND MINER
                   Shippin' us all out.  Mars
                   is finished.

        A MINER'S WIFE watches them.  She is crying.

        Quail looks up at the sky.  Melina follows his glance.
        So do the others.

        Slowly, but perceptibly, the color is changing from yellow
        to blue.

                                 MELINA
                   It's happening.

                                 MINER
                   What is it?

        All the miners are puzzled, apprehensive.  Quail reaches
        toward the one who spoke to him before and pulls off his
        breathing apparatus.  At first the man is shocked, then
        realizes he can breathe without it.  Quail takes off
        his own, then Melina's

        All the miners watch in amazement.  They all remove their
        breathing masks.

                                 QUAIL
                   That's just the start.  Next
                   there'll be rain and growth
                   and ... life.

        Melina embraces him.

                                 QUAIL
                           (continuing)
                   Rekall could never have come
                   up with anything like this.

        Melina looks oddly at him, smiling, mysterious.

        As the sky becomes more and more blue, more of the Miners
        descend from the bus.  Softly at first, then with more and
        more confidence, they begin singing the Martian National
        Anthem.

        The music swells.  Quail puts his arm around Melina.  They
        both join in the chorus.

        It reaches an impassioned crescendo as the FRAME FREEZES
        and the END CREDITS ROLL UP the screen.


                             THE END
FADE IN:

EXT. SPACE

A small planet glows in the light of its sun. Suddenly, we
hear a loud rumble, and see a thick, electronic mist behind
the planet... Then, the electronic mist begins to engulf the
planet, and we hear the horrible sounds of destruction.
Almost like somebody, or something, is eating it.

                                                   PUSH DOWN TO:

EXT. THE NEAR SIDE OF THE PLANET'S SURFACE

Strange robotic creatures scramble around the planet in a
wild panic. It looks like Pompeii must have looked as
Vesuvius erupted.

ANGLE ON ONE OF THE CREATURES - TRACKING

The creature is KRANIX. We will meet him later on in a very
different context, but for now, he is running from the ever-
growing mist that threatens to engulf him.

ANOTHER ANGLE - THE PANIC

As Kranix runs, another creature, ARBLUS, calls to him.

                       ARBLUS
             Transform and flee, Kranix! You must
             warn all you meet of the horror of
             Unicron! Suddenly, the pitiful creature
             is surrounded by the strange energy cloud
             and it looks like his body has
             simultaneously caught fire and been
             doused with acid.

                        KRANIX
             Arblus!   No!

ANGLE ON KRANIX

The mist threatens to engulf him too. He transforms into a
small rocket ship and...

TRACK WITH KRANIX AS...

He takes off. As we rise higher and higher in the atmosphere,
we see the horror wrought by the hideous and still mysterious
Unicron. The planet cracks like an egg and rivers of lava
leak out. The energy cloud surrounds it and... Dissolves
everything... ... And when the smoke clears, we get our
first look at Unicron. It is horrifying. A massive, metal orb
with a gaping maw and a field of electricity.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

PAN FORWARD to SHOW that this hideous planet is on a direct
collision course with...

MOONS ORBITING CYBERTRON IN DEEP SPACE

There are TWO MECHANISTIC MOONS orbiting the huge planet
Cybertron. But we are most concerned with a small, greenish
metal one.

                    NARRATOR
          It is the year 2005. The treacherous
          Decepticons have conquered the Autobots'
          home planet of Cybertron. But from
          secret staging grounds on two of
          Cybertron's moons the valiant Autobots
          prepare to retake their homeland.

CLOSER ON GREEN MOON

At first, we see nothing unusual or suspicious. Then,
pulling closer, we see that the top of the moon is covered
with moon camouflage "netting" and underneath it is a huge
cache of futuristic weapons. This is the Autobot staging
ground for an assault on Cybertron. DOLLY THROUGH THE COMPLEX
until we arrive at a Command Center where several Autobots
peer into monitors, running constant surveillance on
Cybertron.

ANGLE ON IRONHIDE

He peers into a monitor. As he speaks, we see the monitor
PAN to an area where a huge Decepticon Symbol is emblazoned
on Cybertron.

                    IRONHIDE
          Every time I look into this thing, my
          circuits sizzle. I'm tired of this
          waiting game, Prime. When are we gonna
          start bustin' Deceptichops?

ANGLE ON OPTIMUS PRIME

He stands over a holographic map which shows various invasion
plans for Cybertron.

                    OPTIMUS PRIME
          We still don't have enough Energon cubes
          to power a full scale assault, Ironhide.

                    IRONHIDE
          Then let me make another run to Autobot
          City on Earth. I'll bring you back more
          cubes than you'll know what to do with.

                                                              3.



ANGLE ON PRIME

He solemnly hands down an order

                     PRIME
           Alright, ready the shuttle for launch.

ANGLE ON IRONHIDE

He raises a fist in a warwhoop!

                     IRONHIDE
           YAHOO!
               (looking into monitor)
           Your days are numbered now Decepticreeps.

A SMALL MOON "MOUNTAIN"

Ironhide transforms and Races toward a mountain, which stands
about a half mile from the secret Autobot facility.

                       OPTIMUS PRIME (V.O.)
           Jazz,    report security status.

COMMAND CENTER - ANGLE ON THE CONSOLES

                     JAZZ
           No sign of Decepticons in this sector,
           Prime.

                     JAZZ
           Jazz to Moon Base 2.

PAN UP   and through the sky to -

                      ANOTHER MOON
           This is the second moon. It is much
           closer to Cybertron than the first one.
           This is where Bumblebee and Spike are
           stationed.

                     JAZZ (V.O.)
           Jazz to Moon Base 2.

ANGLE ON BUMBLEBEE AND SPIKE

They stand together a communication console. Spike is now
35 years old. Bumblebee looks as he has always looked, save
for a couple of funny bumper stickers on his tail: I (heart)
Cybertron. I (club) Decepticons.

                          SPIKE
              Hey,   Ironhide, tell my son, Daniel, I
              miss   him, and tell him I'll be coming
              home   as soon as we've kicked Megatron's
              tail   across the galaxy.

THE   LUNAR    "MOUNTAIN"

Suddenly, smoke starts pouring out of the mountain.

                          CLIFFJUMPER
              One....

Then, the "mountain" which must be made of paper mache or
something blows away revealing -- The shuttle!

                          CLIFFJUMPER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
              Liftoff.

Suddenly, the shuttle rips out of the ground in a ball of
fire.

CONTINUED:

As it takes off, we realize this isn't any dinky shuttle, but
a massive ship, capable of carrying all the energon needed
to fight a war and an army to boot. The screen is bathed in
smoke and fire which slowly clears.

ANGLE ON PRIME

As he watches the shuttle shoot into the distance.

                       PRIME
             Now, all we need is a little Energon and
             a lot of luck.

ANGLE BEHIND PRIME

We see a bank of computers. Suddenly, a small tape deck pops
open... a cassette pops out and transforms into...
...Laserbeak who flies away unseen.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

             Autobot city in one piece.

             sure as shootin' dodge a couple of
             asteroids.

Suddenly, there is a terrible BANG! on the side of the ship,
and the two Autobots are thrown from their seats.

                       PROWL
             You were saying?

                       IRONHIDE (IRKED)
             That wasn't an asteroid. There is a blast
             of light and they turn to see...

ANGLE ON THE SHIP

The most powerful laser light anybody has ever seen cuts a
gaping hole in the side of the ship... Then, when the light
clears, a panel of the ship falls in and we see -

MEGATRON!

In all his glory.

                      MEGATRON
            Die Autobots!

Then, he transforms to Gun Mode, spins into STARSCREAM'S arms
and Starscream fires.

                      BRAWN
            is cut in half by Megatron's blast.

                      ON PROWL

                      THE INSECTICONS
            ...eat away at the hole in the shuttle to
            make way for... ...an ARMY of other
            Decepticons including Laserbeak who
            enter, firing.

IRONHIDE AND RATCHET

While FIRING back are FUSED TOGETHER... ... then blasted
apart and fall in smoking, glowing fragments.

ON STARSCREAM AND MEGATRON

As they enter the now empty ship, a number of Decepticons
flood past them, taking positions and searching for other
living Autobots.

                      MEGATRON
            This was almost too easy, Starscream.

                       STARSCREAM
            Much easier, oh mighty Megatron, than
            attacking the real threat: the Autobots
            moon base.

                      MEGATRON
            You're an idiot, Starscream. Were we
            simply to wipe out that minuscule base,
            they could build another one.

          vanquished forever!

                    IRONHIDE
          Fat chance, Megatron!

Ironhide pulls himself up and grabs onto Megatron who flings
him against the wall.

                    MEGATRON
          Such heroic nonsense!

          The Shuttle just zipped past checkpoint
          zeta.

                    ON DANIEL
          Daniel, a classic twelve year old
          American boy watches the portable viewer
          which is like an over-sized Boy Scout
          compass. WIDEN SHOT to show he is at an
          old fashioned "fishin' hole" on Earth -
          surrounded by weeping willows, assorted
          trees and shrubs, and that his fishing
          pole is stuck in the dirt, the line
          floating lazily out on the water.

                    DANIEL
          Let's watch Ironhide land it, Hot Rod! As
          Daniel runs to small skateboard-like
          device, hits a button, and watches, it
          transforms into a hoverboard and rides
          it, like a surfer up a steep, grassy
          hillside we change angle to feature...

                    HOT ROD
          an "adolescent" Autobot. He is in robot

          Hurry or we'll miss it!

                    HOT ROD
          lopes up hill after Daniel.

                    HOT ROD (CONT'D)
          If you're gonna ride, Dan-O ...ride in
          style! Hot Rod catches up with Daniel,
          scoops him off his hoverboard, TRANSFORMS
          to automotive mode and RIDES OVER CREST
          OF HILL with Daniel in the front seat.

ANOTHER ANGLE - ON AUTOBOT CITY

FOLLOW Hot Rod up and over a roadway leading around the
perimeter of Autobot City which becomes visible the instant
Hot Rod clears the rim of a hill. As they travel, we SHOULD
also be getting a sense of what Autobot City is all about.
(DESIGN NOTE: Autobot City looks like a federal energy
project gone mad. Here, the Autobots are trying to exploit
every known means of getting energy. The mountain is covered
with solar panels, windmills spin in the valley, oil derricks
pump, and not far away a hydroelectric dam catches millions
of volts. Near all of these various things are energon
compressors, which turn the raw energy into energon cubes. IN
THE BACKGROUND of these scenes, we should see various panel
truck-type Autobots cruise up in auto mode to stacks of this
energon, convert to humanoid mode, load up their vans, then
convert to Auto mode again and drive the Energon into Autobot
City. In short, it should be clear that the purpose of
Autobot City is to harvest energy. All the while, Hot Rod and
Daniel are riding recklessly out from the Autobot City and up
into neighboring hills for an overview of the -

CIRCULAR LANDING AREA

which resides within the "bowl" created by the City structure
and natural surroundings.

                     DANIEL
          Hey!   Let me out.

ON KUP AND OTHER AUTOBOTS

KUP - a grizzled, "old Soldier" of an Autobot - is directing
the positioning of a large metal road barricade. Hot Rod
barrels through a sign which reads: "STOP -THIS AREA OFF

                    DEVASTATOR
          Roars towards the Dinobots.

                    THEIR BATTLE
          shakes the Earth...

...buckling City walls, menacing the Autobots inside.    Hot
Rod and Kup are released during the struggle.

ANGLE ON THE DINOBOTS

As they try to destroy Devastator... ... Their strength is
more than matched and soon they are overwhelmed by him.

                                                         CUT TO:

EXT. THE BATTLEFIELD - MOMENTS LATER

Prime stands outside the dented shuttle with Sunstreaker and
Hound. As he talks he shoots at a swarm of Decepticons who
battle their way towards him.

                    PRIME
          Megatron must be stopped.
              (pause)

                                                          23.



PRIME'S POV - MEGATRON

The Decepticon leader stands a hundred yards away, vanishing
and reappearing with the shifting waves of Generic
Decepticons that charge back and forth.

                    PRIME (V.O.)
          No matter the cost.

PRIME'S CHARGE:     A SERIES OF SHOTS

PRIME'S CHARGE - HEROIC BATTLE THEME SONG

Optimus Prime leader and hero of the Autobots charges into
certain doom. As he battles his way through the Decepticons,
we HEAR an inspiring anthem of courage, strength and triumph,
like "Eye of the Tiger". This theme will reprise during the
film when the Autobots are battling at impossible odds. He
charges headlong into the Decepticon forces which separate
him from Megatron. Decepticons fire on him, but he takes
the shots, and... Spinning and whirling like the Sundance
Kid, he takes a lot out. Then, Decepticons attempt to block
his charge and Prime... ... Like a powerback, transforms to
Truck Mode and barrels into them, sending Decepticons flying
around like shards of glass hit by a .45. ... finally, he
is engulfed by an incoming swarm, and it looks like his
attack is foiled.

                    MEGATRON
          as he commands his troops.

                    MEGATRON
          Their defenses are broken.    Let the
          slaughter begin.

Then he turns and sees...

                    MEGATRON
          Prime!?

                    PRIME
          smashing through a wall of lesser
          Decepticons.

                    PRIME
          One shall stand, one shall fall.

CLOSE ON MEGATRON

his eyes blazing with hatred.

                    MEGATRON
          Why throw away your life so recklessly?

                                                            24.



ON OPTIMUS PRIME

Dirge takes a sneaky leap at him... Optimus stiffarms him
with a shuddering clank... ...then turns him upside down with
one hand and... ...drives him headfirst into the rocky
ground, letting him crumple and fall.

                    OPTIMUS PRIME
          That's a question you should ask
          yourself.

                    MEGATRON
          hurls himself at Optimus Prime... ....
          both tumble into the walls of the City...
          ...denting the walls and causing the
          electronic panels inside to short
          circuit, surrounding them with a fiery
          nimbus of crackling electrical energy.

Ultra Magnus in car carrier mode barrels out of city carrying
several Autobots. He and the others transform into robot
mode and fire lasers at the Decepticons.

INTERCUT TO HOT ROD, KUP, DANIEL, ARCEE, BLASTER, PERCEPTOR,

fighting their way to the battle of the titans.

                    HOT ROD

...And charging.

ANGLE ON OPTIMUS AND MEGATRON

Megatron attempts to kick Prime in the throat... ...Prime
catches his foot, twists it... ... and hurls Megatron
backwards into a metal pile.

                    MEGATRON
          grabs a jagged, spearlike piece of steel
          and hurls it at

                    PRIME
          The steel "spear" pierces his side and
          sticks in him as... ... he charges
          Megatron, ...dodging shots from
          Megatron's gun to... ...deliver a huge

                    MEGATRON
          lands and stealthily slips a laser dagger
          from his boot, turning and slashing at...

                    PRIME
          as he comes for him, tearing... ...a gash
          across Prime's midsection, which spews
          smoke and sparks and...

... dropping Prime to one knee.

                    MEGATRON

                    MEGATRON
          who claws his fingers and digs them into
          Prime's eyes

                    MEGATRON
          I'll rip out your optics! Optimus grabs
          Megatron's clawed hand in one of his
          hands, twists it in see-sawing test of
          strength which... Optimus wins in a judo
          toss which sends Megatron - - skidding
          face first through steel rubble, in a
          shower of sparks until he crashes into
          the side of the city.

ANGLE ON HOT ROD

He dispatches a Decepticon and turns to Prime.

             No more, Optimus Prime!    Grant me mercy,
             I beg of you!

ANOTHER ANGLE FEATURING OPTIMUS PRIME AND HOT ROD

as Optimus Prime warily moves out to look down at the
cowering Megatron, keeping him in his gun sights.

                       OPTIMUS PRIME
             You who are without mercy now plead for
             it. I thought you were made of sterner
             stuff, Megatron!

with him

                       PRIME
             Out of the way, Hot Rod.

MEGATRON AND HOT ROD

as Hot Rod grabs for the Blaster - - Megatron quickly gets
Hot Rod in a headlock and using Hot Rod as a shield, gets the
gun and...

BLASTS PRIME IN THE WOUND HE'D MADE WITH HIS LASER DAGGER

ON OPTIMUS PRIME

his midsection now glowing and smoking, a huge hole where the
Blaster has struck.

                        MEGATRON
             Fall!   Fall!

Megatron tosses Hot Rod aside like a rag doll and stands
above the dying Prime.

                       MEGATRON
             I would have waited an eternity for this.
             Crawl, slave! On your knees!

with both fists clasped together.

                    OPTIMUS PRIME
              (gasping painfully)
          Never!

He bashes in Megatron's torso casing, fracturing the sides
which split, spilling wires, fuses, lights, circuitry.
Megatron falls! Prime falls to his knees, tries to rise,
collapses to his side and falls slowly back. HOT ROD runs
over to him.

                      HOT ROD
          Optimus!    Forgive me!

ANOTHER ANGLE- MEGATRON

Starscream and other Decepticons stand over the smoking body.

          Take this scrap to Cybertron!
          Astrotrain, transform and get us out of

ANOTHER ANGLE- ASTROTRAIN

as he MOVES ONTO SCENE in Humanoid mode, showing battle burns
and scars. Then, he converts to train mode, and rolls through
a crowd of generic Decepticons, crushing many under his
wheels, as he makes his way towards Starscream.

ANGLE ON THE EXODUS

Ramjet, Thrust, Dirge, the Constructicons, Soundwave and his
cassettes, et.al. run towards Astrotrain.

                                                             28.

          Prime did it. He turned the tide! He
          shoots (O.S.) into...

A CROWD OF DECEPTICONS

Who fight each other for a place on the shuttle.

ANGLE ON STARSCREAM

Megatron's head and upper body BUMP AND GET KNOCKED from

                    THE AUTOBOTS
          fire after them, closing ranks on the
          shuttle, and pouring shots into the
          melee.

ANGLE ON ASTROTRAIN

Decepticons make way for Starscream as he tosses the nearly
lifeless Megatron into the shuttle and gets in. Then,
standing at the door, he kicks other Decepticons away.

                    STARSCREAM

ANGLE ON ASTROTRAIN

The shuttle takes off, leaving a number of generic
Decepticons behind, who immediately raise their hands upon
realizing that they are surrounded by Autobots.

          his gaping middle wound.

HIS P.O.V. - OPTIMUS PRIME

His head is turned so all assembled can see. His eyes flicker
weakly, his voice RUMBLES with overtone of vast weariness and
resignation

               with great effort)

TIGHT SHOT - ULTRA MAGNUS AND OPTIMUS PRIME

Optimus Prime is tilted into half sitting position by other
Autobots manipulating the platform as Ultra Magnus grasps his
hand with great emotion

               with it)
          Until that day...

Until all are one... Continue the struggle... (sags, gasps,
hanging on) Transfer the Matrix of Leadership.

TIGHTEN SHOT ON ULTRA MAGNUS AND OPTIMUS PRIME

A distraught Ultra Magnus nods, reaches out with free hand
and points his forefinger at Optimus Prime's chest. Then,
pressing a button on Prime's chest, a small, secret doorway
opens, and we see something extremely bright glowing in
there. Ultra Magnus, nearly blinded by the intense light,
reaches in, and lifts out --

THE AUTOBOT LEADERSHIP MATRIX,

-- and holds it for a moment in his hand.

ANGLE ON ALL

The bright light, which emanates from the perfect crystal,
seems to blind everybody and washes all color out of the
shot. Then, slowly, Ultra Magnus moves it into his own chest,
closes the door, and the light is gone, save for a momentary,
and extremely powerful glow from his eyes.

ON KUP, HOT ROD, ARCEE AND PERCEPTOR

They are all full of great sorrow.

ON PRIME - HE DIES

All of his lights go out, including his eyes.

UNICRON

Rotating satellite dishes on the surface spark with
electricity. Dissolve inside Unicron to reveal scenes of
Prime's death and the passing of the Matrix to Ultra Magnus
playing on various monitors. Some of the scenes are in slow
motion, others are sped up. The effect should be eerie.

MEGATRON IN SPACE - TRACKING

He shakes his fist.

The last of the weak Decepticons is tossed, and the others
dust off their hands.

          Death comes to anyone who crosses me. He

He is flying a very wobbly course past Pluto...

EXT. SPACE - LATER

Megatron and the other dented, dinged and dead Decepticon
bodies float through space. we follow the wailing Megatron
and the others down to:

THE SURFACE OF UNICRON

littering the otherwise beautiful technological expanse.

                    UNICRON
          Welcome, Megatron.

                    MEGATRON
              (looking around)
          Who said that?

                    UNICRON
          I am Unicron.

                    MEGATRON
          Show yourself!

                    UNICRON
          I have summoned you here for a purpose.

                    MEGATRON
          Nobody summons Megatron!

                    UNICRON
          Then it pleases me to be the first.

                    MEGATRON
          State your business.

                     UNICRON
          Bring me the Autobot Matrix. It is the
          one thing - the only thing that can stand
          in my way.

                    MEGATRON
          You have nothing to fear. I have already
          crushed Optimus Prime with my bare hands.

                    UNICRON
          You exaggerate.

                    MEGATRON
          The point is, he is dead!   And the Matrix
          died with him.

                   UNICRON
          No. It has been passed to their new
          leader. Get it for me.

                    MEGATRON
          Why should I? What's in it for me?

                    UNICRON
          Your bargaining posture is highly
          dubious, but very well, I will provide
          you with a new body, and new troops to
          command.

                    MEGATRON
          And...

                    UNICRON
          And nothing.

You belong to me now.

                    MEGATRON
          I belong to nobody.

                    UNICRON
          Perhaps I misjudged you. Proceed on your
          way to oblivion. The Mist appears and
          starts to dissolve Megatron.

                    MEGATRON
              (pleading)
          No, no. I accept your terms.   I accept!

                    UNICRON
          Excellent! Behold - Galvatron! X-ray
          images: wiring, circuitry, etc. flash on
          and off as a new and larger being starts
          to form, changing from dented Megatron to
          a huge, new creation: Galvatron.

THE TRANSFORMATION - CREATION

ends in a blinding flash and Galvatron - who still resembles
Megatron - laughs and flexes his muscles and stretches. His
voice is deeper, different from Megatron's

                    GALVATRON
          Long live Galvatron!

                    UNICRON

STARSCREAM AND OTHERS

The Decepticon plane looks slightly ridiculous with cloak on
his shoulders and Thrust and Ramjet at his side, weapons held
high, but ready for action should anybody question
Starscream's rule. In front of him stands Astrotrain holding
a huge Metallic CROWN over his head.

HAIL OF FIRE FROM SCOURGE AND HIS SWEEPS.

                    ON SCOURGE
          as he TRANSFORMS to Humanoid mode and
          shouts orders, FIRING AT Blurr who BLURRS

          No survivors!

IN DINOBOT SHUTTLE

as Hot Rod squeezes past   Sludge Swoop, and Slag to join Kup
who is already at control deck where Grimlock sticks his head
down to look out the window. Kup shoves him aside.

                    KUP
          This reminds me of the battle on Alpha 9,
          when the Petro-Rabbits were...(annoyed)
          Grimlock, get your noodle out of my face!
              (starts throwing switches)

          You're living one now!
              (to Hot Rod)
          Engage the boosters for Cybertron's sake!
          Hot Rod nods and quickly passes his hand
          over bank of SWITCHES all of which GLOW
          AND PULSE with the action.

                    ANOTHER ANGLE

Springer springs onto scene with Daniel, Ultra Magnus and
Perceptor are guarding the entry ramp, firing at Decepticons.

              (to Daniel)
          Looks like we're shipmates, squirt!

          shuttle slowly leaves the ground.

Just as the wind and gravity are about to knock her off, she
jumps up and...

INSIDE THE SHUTTLE

Springer grabs her hand and pulls her in, narrowly avoiding a
barrage Daniel is watching, terrified.

                    DANIEL
          That was close!

Concussion of Decepticon hit rocks the shuttle

                    SPRINGER
          Believe it or not, this is the fun part.

IN "COCKPIT" OF ULTRA MAGNUS' SHUTTLE

Ultra Magnus is at control deck with Perceptor as they "taxi"
for launch and we see oncoming Decepticon jets firing at them

                    ULTRA MAGNUS
          No time to preheat....Can this ship take
          it?

          With an accelerated ignition procedure
          the ceramic housings might create a

              (ENTERING SHOT, reaches in and
               pushes joystick forward)
          He says "go for it!"

Powerful rockets ignite, and the shuttle   SHAKES with the
sound.

ANGLE ON RUNWAY

The Shuttle's rockets surge, melting the pursuing    Sweeps as
the Shuttle hits the sky and soars upwards.

overtakes and smashes through them, scattering them as it
pulls up alongside the Dinobot shuttle

ON THE SHUTTLES

They fire (O.S.) at...

A LARGE ASTEROID

With incredible precision, the rays strike the asteroid,
splitting it in two parts.

ANGLE ON ONE OF THE ASTEROID HALVES

It shoots through space and strikes another asteroid, which,
breaks into several pieces, many of them angling back
towards...

                    GALVATRON'S SHIPS
          which swerve to avoid them as....

THE OTHER ASTEROID PART

Hits another moon or asteroid or general rock in space,
doing the same thing... WIDEN SHOT to show that the pieces
are shooting around like pool balls after an incredibly
violent break... ... zinging into each other... ....
Narrowly missing Galvatron's ship... ... Filling space with
incredible amounts of Dust, lava from inside the moons,
multi-colored gasses, explosions and generally making a mess
of space. (Note: think of this scene as the "Asteroids"
video game.)

ANGLE ON THE AUTOBOT SHUTTLES

As all of this is going on, they jam into hyperspace... ...
Corkscrewing and arcing off into the galaxy, leaving only
blurred images of themselves as...

Kup sits spinning yarns, leaning back in chair as Grimlock,

ON HOT ROD

He is practicing sparring with a SPINNING AUTO-COMBATANT - a
very high tech quintain with many arms, legs, and weapons
that test the user's skills, and reflexes. Hot Rod wears
sparring gauntlet, and holds a small LASER DAGGER and special
shield. As he lowers shield and reacts to Dinobot reactions
to Kup's story.

                       HOT ROD
             Don't you think we have better things to

Then hammers its fists on top of his head...

Particularly deadly looking missiles shoot out.

ANGLE ON THE DINOBOT SHUTTLE

It zooms towards a whopper of a planet, surrounded by several
small moons. We will later learn that this planet is
Quintesson, but for now, it's mysterious. The moleculon
missiles streak after it like sidewinders.

                    KUP (O.S.)
          You got a better idea?!! With that, the
          ship seems to stop, on a dime, in mid
          air! The missiles zoom past it.

INT. THE SHIP (KUP AND HOT ROD)

Hot Rod watches wide-eyed, as Kup watches ahead warily, hands
on the controls.

THE DECEPTICON FLAT TOP AND CYCLONUS' ARMADA

                    ON GALVATRON
          as he works controls which eject more
          Moleculon Missiles.

HIS P.O.V. - ULTRA MAGNUS' SHUTTLE

electrical outline envelopes it and there is a... ...
blinding flash after which... .. remnants of the hull and
superstructure explode toward camera and past camera
accompanied by explosive sound and then, silence! ... Where
the shuttle had been there is now...nothing! Just loose
asteroids and clouds of space dust

                    CYCLONUS
          The Autobots have been terminated!

                    GALVATRON
          Excellent. And soon we shall say the
          same of that infernal Unicron. Suddenly,
          Galvatron's body begins to twist, and he
          writhes in pain.

                     GALVATRON (CONT)
          Aaaah!   Take me to Unicron...Aaaah!

LONG SHOT ON THE HUGE FLAT TOP

as it veers off and away from the space cloud, followed by
Cyclonus' Armada. Hold for a beat, and then CLOSE IN on the
dust cloud as... ... part of Ultra Magnus' shuttle flies into
the clear.

ANGLE ON THE COCKPIT

Arcee, Perceptor, Springer, Blurr are crowded together in
cramped remnant of cockpit as Daniel and Ultra Magnus sit at
the control deck

                    ARCEE
          Did we have to detonate three- quarters
          of the ship?!

                    SPRINGER
          Seeing how they would have detonated four
          quarters, I think it was a good choice.
          SUDDEN SHUDDER AND THE SHIP DROPS
          SHARPLY, all holding on to each other and
          to any protruding handhold

                    ULTRA MAGNUS
          Perceptor....can you still locate the
          Junk Planet?

                    PERCEPTOR
          Gamma waves in this sector of space
          create marginal navigation probabilities,
          however.....
              (looks at Ultra Magnus)

                    ULTRA MAGNUS

          grimaces

RESUME ON PERCEPTOR

realizes he's overdoing it again, clears his throat

                    PERCEPTOR
          Ahem.....yes I think I can.

LONG SHOT- SHUTTLE CHANGING COURSE TOWARD LARGE DISTANT
PLANET

A small, falling object appears high above Quintesson and
hurtles down, down, over and over until it is in view and we
see it is...

                    HOT ROD
          still cartwheeling down toward the planet
          below, trying to change the angle of his
          fall

HOT ROD - TRACKING

He plummets down through layers of atmosphere and continues
to fall past shiny rock pinnacles of unusual construction as
we

CHANGE ANGLES TO

AERIAL VIEW OVER A VAST SEA OF LIQUID ENERGY

as Hot Rod falls into the sea, we CUT TO THE SILVERY ENERGY
SEA Hot Rod sinks to the bottom where he collides with... ...
a metallic reef, bounces, manages to right himself, shaking
his head as he regains equilibrium, and... Then he transforms
into auto mode modified for undersea action and starts riding
off as he calls through intercom.

                       HOT ROD

             rounds a "corner" of the Reef Wall and
             reacts

HIS P.O.V. - A HUGE, MECHANICAL 0 SQUID CREATURE

The ROBOTOID SQUID is tearing Kup to pieces and tossing the
pieces across the ocean floor with its silvery metal
tentacles

ON HOT ROD

                       HOT ROD
             Kup!

He transforms and blasts...

                       THE SQUID
             angrily streaks toward Hot Rod.

                       HOT ROD
             Fires at the Squid, but not stopping him.

                       ANOTHER ANGLE
             Hot Rod's shot plinks off a couple of
             tentacles, but the squid keeps coming...

... Wraps his tentacles around Hot Rod and starts crushing...
... Hot Rod looks like he's about to be crushed, but he...
... Shoots ... Its hideous Optical Sensor.

                       THE SQUID
             releases a laser print ink stream which
             boils out in the water in a series of
             dots and "x" shapes and retreats.

                       HOT ROD
             Don't worry, I'm not coming after you.

                    HOT ROD
          lowers his head and blows blast of air
          through head-piece. The air blast clears
          the water, revealing Kup's head and torso
          half buried in the "sand"

ON HOT ROD AND KUP'S HEAD

as hot Rod kneels

                     HOT ROD
          Kup!   Say something!

CLOSE ON KUP'S HEAD

as he turns head around to look up at Hot Rod and spits out a
mouthful of sand

                    KUP
              (bubbling as he speaks)
          Fix me!

                    HOT ROD
          Sure, Kup....right away! Hot Rod rapidly
          PULLS KUP'S SCATTERED BODY PARTS
          TOGETHER.

                                                         CUT TO:

KUP AND HOT ROD ON THE RED DESERT SHORE OF THE ENERGY SEA

Kup stands impatiently while Hot Rod reassembles them.

                    HOT ROD
          Well...what do you think? Kup feels his
          elbow joint, twists his neck side to side
          and gets creaks and squeaks and moves
          legs in odd, creaky way as he is trying
          himself out.

                    KUP
              (a beat, then grimaces)
          There's a piece missing.

                     HOT ROD
          No way....
              (sifts through pile of SCRAP
               METAL PARTS lying at Kup's
               feet)
          See, this wasn't yours...it's some kind
          of prehistoric ion cruncher....and this
          doohickey looks like a funky energon
          funnel... and this...

               arms and hands, CREAKING,
               CLUNKING, SQUEAKING)
          Well, I still think I'm short a part!
              (sees Hot Rod hang his head)
          But all things considered, you did an
          amazing job, lad! Amazing!

                    HOT ROD
              (brightening)
          Really?

                    KUP
              (rotates arm rapidly)
          Yeah, you even got rid of a nasty burr on
          my rotator! Now, let's find the Dinos
          and get off this twisted planet!

                    ON KUP
          as he transforms it's evident that a
          fender is misplaced and a wheel mounted
          improperly so it wobbles and he rides
          unevenly with much chugging and oil
          spewing

                    KUP (V.O.)
              (in vehicular mode)
          Of all the circuit glitched diode blowin'
          dim-wittery... I told you a part was
          missin'.

we watch Hot Rod and Kup move off into the distance as we:

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

ANOTHER PART OF QUINTESSON

Kup and Hot Rod walk along a swampy, marshy area. Suddenly,
there are several loud gurgles, and we can see the shapes of
something terrible emerging through the muck. Hot Rod spins
to fire, but Kup bats down his arm.

PAN TO SHOW

EIGHT SHARKTICONS (in humanoid mode) surrounding them. The
Sharkticons are smaller than the Autobots, but they look ugly
and vicious.

                    KUP
          Don't act hostile. I'll use the
          universal greeting.


                                                    (CONTINUED)

                    HOT ROD
          Universal Greeting.

                     KUP
          Watch.   I'll have them eating out of my
          hand.

                    HOT ROD
          Or our faces.

Kup holds out his hands to show that he has no weapon.    Then,
he addresses them...

                    KUP
          Bah-weep-Graaaaagnah wheep ni ni bong...

                    HOT ROD
              (mocking, mimicking)
          Bah-weep-Graaaaagnah wheep ni ni bong...
          The Sharkticons look interested.

SHARKTICONS

(GROWL VERSION OF THE SAME

THING)

                    KUP
          See, the Universal Greeting works every
          time.
              (pause)
          Now, without making any sudden moves,
          give them an Energon goody. Kup reaches
          into his belt, presses a button and pulls
          out an Energon cube. Hot Rod, somewhat
          suspicious of the whole process does the
          came.

They hold out the cubes and two of the Sharkticons take the
Energon cubes, like dogs getting a treat. Then, the other six
show up looking for cubes.

                    HOT ROD
          This is getting expensive.

                    KUP
          Don't worry, they'll reciprocate. They
          each hand out three Energon goodies to
          the remaining six Sharkticons... The
          Sharkticons eat them happily. Then, they
          back off, eyeing the two Autobots with
          menace.


                                                     (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


                    HOT ROD
          I thought they were supposed to
          reciprocate.

                    KUP
              (not sure of himself)
          Customs vary from place to place.
          Suddenly, the Sharkticons transform to
          their vicious mode and lunge at them.

The two robots, taken by surprise, fall backwards. PAN FROM
the fallen robots to an area behind a tree. For just a
moment, we see a small yellow Autobot in robot mode. There,
then, as quickly as we realize what it is, it transforms into
automode and vanishes in a flash. It was Wheelie.

THE SHARKTICON CAMP ON QUINTESSON - KUP, HOT ROD AND
SHARKTICONS

Sharkticons march Kup and Hot Rod into a HOLDING PEN within a
walled compound. As we FOLLOW THEM INTO PEN we PULL BACK and
PAN to establish that entry procession is being watched by...

                    THE QUINTESSONS
          slender, spindly framed robotic creatures
          with oversized five sided heads, each
          side bearing a different mechanistic face
          with a different expression on each -
          smiling, angry, grimacing, suspicious and
          the fifth face is not yet to be seen. As
          Hot Rod and Kup are led to certain death
          in the Quintesson dungeons, harsh,
          dissonant, metallic and terrifying music
          plays, underscoring the brutal evil they
          face,

                    KUP (V.O.)
          Reminds me of the Niter Slave Mines on
          Golgonath Seven....

                    HOT ROD
          Every place reminds you of some place
          else.....

                    KUP (V.O.)
          Experience, lad. You should learn to
          appreciate it.

                    HOT ROD
          A lot of good it's done us so far!

                                                            62.



ON HOT ROD AND KUP

as Hot Rod looks around and reacts sharply

HIS P.O.V.- THE QUINTESSONS

as we feature the Leader Quintesson who is taller and wears a
different color robe from others. He is watching arrival of
Kup and Hot Rod and his faces rotate so it goes from smiling
face to suspicious face to angry face to furious grimace.

RESUME ON HOT ROD AND KUP

as Sharkticons shove and prod them, JOLTING them into the
holding pen and locking the gate. Then, they install
RESTRAINING BOLTS.

                    HOT ROD
          I can't transform!

                    KUP
          They're restraining bolts, lad.

                    HOT ROD
              (looking around)
          We got to get a new travel agent....
          What is this place?

PAN FROM HIS P.O.V. - A SHADOWED, ALCOVE LIKE HUT

as a figure moves forward slightly and speaks in a harsh,
bass'o voice. It is GRANIX. We saw him in the first scene,
escaping from his planet when Unicron ate it. {Note: The
script says *G*ranix here. Not my mistake.}

                    KRANIX
          The world of the savage Sharkticons and
          their cruel masters the Quintessons.
          They hunt down those who try to escape
          the wrath of Unicron, and put them on
          trial.

                    KUP
          But what if they're innocent?

                    KRANIX
          Guilty or innocent, the sentence is
          always the same - death!

                      HOT ROD
          Unicron?!    Who's Unicron?

                      KUP
            So that's the monster's name.

                      HOT ROD
            I wonder if there's any connection
            between it and Galvatron.

Suddenly, a Quintesson Guard roars in...

                        QUINTESSON GUARD (V.O.)
            That one!

All turn and look off, reacting as two Guards thunder in,
grab Granix and pull him back out of the door. {NOTE: Another
instance of the spelling of Granix}

ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING THE LEAD QUINTESSON

as he points at Kup and Hot Rod

THEIR POV    - OUT THE WINDOW THE ARENA

Kranix stands on what almost looks like a wide diving board
over a watery (or oily) pit teeming with Sharkticons.

            Guilty.....Or innocent. I repeat.

                      KRANIX
            Spare me this mockery of justice.

                      LEAD QUINTESSON
            I repeat, guilty...or innocent.

                        JURORS
            Guilty!!

Jury's faces rotate to fifth expression - a DEATH'S HEAD ON
GRANIX   {NOTE: Yet another, final, reference to Kranix as
Granix} Suddenly, the Robot is dumped into a pit of teeming
Sharkticons and there is a mad frenzy. In moments, he is no
more.

ANGLE ON KUP

He watches grimly through the bars.

                    KUP
          Not the end I'd wish for, lad.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

THE EDGE OF A HUGE, SHADOWY PLANET IN SPACE

as Ultra Magnus' Shuttle is BUFFETED BY WINDS AND STORMS as
it enters the atmosphere of JUNKION.

INT. THE SHUTTLE

as it SHAKES AND RATTLES VIOLENTLY

                    DANIEL
          Where are we, Springer?

                    SPRINGER
          The place where everything ends up after
          you throw it out.

TIGHT ON BLURR

as he holds up hands and CROSSES fingers.

RESUME ON SPRINGER

Tenses and crouches protectively around Arcee and Daniel as
we see mountains of junk whizz past the window.

                    ULTRA MAGNUS
          Brace for impact!

ON SHUTTLE - TRACKING

It plummets through the mountains and canyons of junk,
narrowly avoiding crashing, but frequently hitting junk
pinnacles or sides of junk walls, and causing avalanches of
junk. By the time the ship lands, it is nearly
indistinguishable from the junk.

                                                          65.



INT. THE SHUTTLE

Everyone is in a jumbled tangle - Ultra Magnus beneath Blurr,
Perceptor upside down and hanging from torn end of stairway,
Arcee crouched over Daniel and Springer with half his body
sticking through the hull

                     SPRINGER
              (pulling himself free of hull
               wall)
          Remind me to give the Auto Pilot a
          raise... Daniel creeps out from under
          Arcee and shakes bits of broken metal and
          dust off his shoulders

                    DANIEL
          Wow! That was better'n the Roller
          Coaster at Future World!

                    PERCEPTOR
              (working scanner, computer
               device, thoughtfully)
          The composition of this planet seems to
          be a chaotic amalgam of discarded ferrous
          and non-ferrous articulations.

                    ULTRA MAGNUS
              (baffled)
          How's that?

                    SPRINGER
              (opening hull door with a
               RIPPING OF METAL)
          He says the planet's made of junk.

SPRINGER AND PERCEPTOR AT OPEN DOOR

as they look out on landscape of "living" junk

                    SPRINGER
          Yep, this dump is a dump......

                    ULTRA MAGNUS
          as he straps on TOOL BELT

                    ULTRA MAGNUS
          We might be able to salvage this thing.
              (checks LASER DRILL, turns it
               on, off)
          Ultra Magnus starts for door followed by
          Blurr who takes up a saw and tool belt
          and Perceptor who rolls up Shuttle Plans
          as Daniel moves out to join them

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                            66.

                    DANIEL
          Can I help, too?

                    SPRINGER
          It's rough out there, kid. Stay inside
          and play with crayons or something.

                    ARCEE
          as she steps forward with a smile, a
          strange GRID LIKE "SUIT" in her hand

                    ARCEE
          I think Daniel can make himself useful
          with....this! It used to be Spike's.
              (holds Grid-like metal frame
               "suit")

                    DANIEL
          Wow! Dad's exo-suit. He told me about
          it but I never saw it.

                    ARCEE
          Here, try it on.

She starts helping him into the exo-suit.

                    ON DANIEL
          as he gets inside the "suit" which fits
          over his body like a grid-work metal
          "cage."

Daniel clips "cage" of Exo-Suit shut and stands up inside the
gridwork which makes him taller and broader. He moves
awkwardly, barely able to advance a step

                    SPRINGER
          Just think about what you want to do
          before you do it!

                    DANIEL
          brows knitted, thinking.

                    SPRINGER
          Don't fight it Dan-O.

He suddenly starts moving rapidly backwards, then sideways,
then forward, then he starts dancing rapidly, then bounces
off walls... ..spinning upside down, then flips over several
times and lands in a splatter, legs spread, arms this way and
that - amused, startled and unhurt.




                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                            67.
CONTINUED: (2)


                    DANIEL
              (continuing)
          It's kind of tricky....

He suddenly flips around twice in mid-air then regains his
feet and leans way over against Arcee for support. She laughs
and pats his shoulder

                    ARCEE
          For the first time out, you were great!

ON SPRINGER AT DOOR

as he sends down RAMP and motions to the others curtly

                    SPRINGER
          Show time's over! We've got work to do!
              (he starts out)

EXT. THE SHUTTLE

as Springer, Arcee, Daniel et.al. come down the ramp and look
around at the lush "vegetation" of growing junk clumps all
around them and a long vista of junk mountains and spires of
weathered junk-rock.

                    DANIEL (V.O.)
              (whistles)
          This must be the junk capital of the
          universe!

LONG SHOT- DANIEL AND THE OTHERS

as they start DIGGING for parts to repair the ship, sinister
Junkions begin to emerge from the junk to watch them. Their
leader, WRECK-GAR, speaks to his fellow Junkions.

                    WRECK-GAR
              (in guttural, rusty, metallic
               rumble)
          Stop thief! No welcome-wagon, "hello
          stranger!" that good coffee flavor

                    OTHER JUNKIONS
          Yeah, or your money back! Wreck-Gar shows
          large JUNK GUN with all sorts of razor
          sharp fins and rusty little rocket
          missiles mounted around the howitzer like
          barrel

                                                             68.
CONTINUED:


                     WRECK-GAR
           Operators are standing by! They laugh in
           guttural, clanking sounds and look out at
           Springer and the others who keep working
           as we

                                                         CUT TO:

EXT.   THE GATE TO THE QUINTESSON PALACE

At first, we see only the face of a sinister Quintesson
gatekeeper, backed up by heavily armed Sharkticons.

                     QUINTESSON
           Greetings, noble strangers.

ANGLE ON THE DINOBOTS

They stand at the gate, looking more like kids showing up at
your door wondering if you can come out and play, than like
serious robots on a serious mission.

                     GRIMLOCK
           Yes, me, Grimlock, noble! Me, Grimlock
           search for friends.

ANGLE ON QUINTESSON AND GRIMLOCK

The Quintesson, showing his friendly face, smiles.

                     QUINTESSON
           And who might they be?

                       GRIMLOCK
           Autobots.    Hot Rod and Kup.

                     QUINTESSON
               (feigning recognition)
           Oh yes. A young one and an old one.

                      GRIMLOCK
           Yes.   You know friends.   Where are they?

                     QUINTESSON
           They went down that path. He points to...

                     A PATH
           It probably isn't lined with primroses,
           but it should be.

                     GRIMLOCK
           GRIMLOCK You good friend to Grimlock.    I
           reward you, sometime.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                             69.
CONTINUED:


With that, the four Dinobots head towards the "primrose
path."

ANGLE ON THE QUINTESSON

His head rotates and he smiles a sinister, evil smile.

EXT. UNICRON

Galvatron stands upon the demonic planet, in an extremely
contorted position.

                    GALVATRON
          Why do you torture me?!

VARIOUS ANGLES ON UNICRON

We have no idea where this godly voice is coming from, but
this place sure is spooky.

                    UNICRON
          You have failed.

                    GALVATRON
          No, Unicron. Ultra Magnus is dead.

                    UNICRON
          Then where is the matrix?

                    GALVATRON
          Destroyed, with him.

                    UNICRON
          The matrix can not be destroyed.
              (pause)
          And Ultra Magnus lives on the planet of
          Junk. Stalk him. Cut him open! And
          bring the matrix to me.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. THE PRIMROSE PATH

They step along the primrose path, not noticing as sinister
things start to happen all around them.

ANGLE ON A METAL EATING PLANT

This thing looks like a metal version of a "venus fly trap,"
and it has a malevolent red eye which lights up. Swoop walks
past it in humanoid mode.

                                                            70.



SNAP!

It misses him by an inch.

                    GRIMLOCK
          Me Grimlock, positive Hot Rod and Kup
          close! Get thump, thump, thump...
              (taps his head hard)

ANGLE ON THE GROUND - IN FRONT OF SLAG

Suddenly, a section of stones drop away in front of Slag
revealing a spiked pit...

                    SLAG
          Me, Slag say you are full of beryllium
          balony. He is just about to fall in
          when...

ANGLE ON GRIMLOCK AND SLAG

Grimlock, in dino mode, slaps him with his tail, knocking him
away an instant before he steps into the hole...

                    GRIMLOCK
          Me, Grimlock, say you full of cesium
          salami! Slag gets up...

                    SLAG
          Beryllium balony!

                    GRIMLOCK
          Argh!

ANGLE ON GRIMLOCK

He is about to pounce on Slag when a massive tree, which is
actually more like a sword, suddenly is spring and arcs
toward him. The machete like blade strikes the ground,
between Grimlock and Slag narrowly missing them. He turns
and sees the thing stocking in the ground.

                    GRIMLOCK
          Me, Grimlock think trees here are cheap
          model.

                    SLAG
          Like your head! (laughs at own joke)
          Grimlock jumps on Slag and wrestles him
          to the ground. Suddenly, a SQUEAKY, ODDLY
          CHILDISH VOICE speaks from o.s.



                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                            71.
CONTINUED:


                    SQUEAKY VOICE (WHEELIE)
          Friends find. Look behind.

                    GRIMLOCK
              (furious)
          Who say that?

HIS P.O.V. - WHEELIE

WHEELIE is the Wolf Boy of Quintesson - an Autobot who's been
evading the Sharkticons since his parents' ship crashed,
killing everybody else in his party. He wears a necklace of
Sharkticon teeth, packs a three bladed laser knife and a
special SLING which hurls FIRE STONES. He fears nothing,
especially the Dinobots, and he cockily struts into the
clear... ... walks right up Sludge's tail onto Sludge's back
and then shinnies up his neck and jumps onto... ... Slag's
head where he stands eye to eye with Grimlock

                    WHEELIE
          Friends find. Look behind.   Many Face
          lie. You fool! You buy!

GRIMLOCK AND WHEELIE

                    GRIMLOCK
              (eyes blaze, furious)
          Me, Grimlock, "fool?"

                    WHEELIE
              (smiling breezily)
          Picture you got. Now fool you not!
              (he laughs in a wild, metallic
               cackle)
          Grimlock raises a claw to swipe Wheelie
          off Slag's head

                    GRIMLOCK
          Me, Grimlock, no like you!

                    ON WHEELIE
          as he scowls and quickly loads FIRESTONE
          IN SLING and slings it onto Grimlock's
          nose where it EXPLODES making Grimlock
          yowl and pull back, feeling his reddened
          nose and speaking through his nose
          angrily

                    GRIMLOCK
              (continuing)
          Doooooooow! Why boy hit by dose?



                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                            72.

                    WHEELIE
              (folds arms across his chest)
          Wheelie say, find friends today!
              (nods defiantly)
          Grimlock and Slag react as we

                                                        CUT TO:

THE QUINTESSON "COURTROOM"

Kup and Hot Rod stand on the platform over the Sharkticon
pit. They are "bound" by restraining bolts.

ANGLE ON THE QUINTESSON JUDGE

                    QUINTESSON JUDGE
          Before we deliver your verdict, would you
          like to beg for your lives?

ANGLE ON KUP AND HOT ROD

Kup turns to Hot Rod.

                    KUP
          Remember when you put me together today?

                    HOT ROD
              (sarcastic)
          Sure, that's all I got to think about.

                    KUP
          I know what part you forgot.

                    QUINTESSON JUDGE (V.O.)
          Silence or I'll hold you in contempt of
          this court.

                    HOT ROD
          I have nothing but contempt for this
          court.

ANGLE ON THE QUINTESSON JUDGES

Suddenly, their heads swivel around to deaths heads.

ON KUP AND HOT ROD

The platform drops away and they tumble...

KUP AND HOT ROD - TRACKING

Suddenly, Kup in double-jointed fashion slips out of the
restraining bolt...

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                             73.
CONTINUED:


                    KUP
          That doohickey you lost was part of my
          shoulder socket. Watch this, lad...
          without it, I'm double jointed as
          Houdini.

Then, he transforms to humanoid mode and shoots off Hot Rod's
bolt.

                    HOT ROD
          Wish you'd figured that out a little
          sooner.

                    KUP
          Better late than never!

ANGLE ON THE SHARKTICON PIT

In full humanoid mode, they land, their weapons drawn.

ANGLE ON ALL

Kup and Hot Rod fire, driving some Sharkticons back.

                    HOT ROD
          They've got more Sharkticons than we have
          photon charges!

Kup transforms to Auto mode.

                    KUP
          Let's hold a demolition derby! Then, he
          roars into a bunch of them, slamming a
          massive stack into the wall.

ANGLE ON HOT ROD

He transforms, too and does the same thing.

ANGLE ON THE SHARKTICON PIT

As fast as the Autobots can run the miserable things over,
new swarms of them come out.

ANGLE ON KUP AND HOT ROD

They clear out a circle in the center of the pit and
transform to humanoid mode.

                    HOT ROD
          Didn't even bend a fender.

CONTINUED:


                    KUP
          Yeah, but look. There are a lot more of
          those cam dinging, grill-crackin' things.

WHAT HE SEES

is a wave of larger, more powerful Sharkticons.

                    HOT ROD
          We can't hold out forever, but we can
          give them one whopper of a repair bill.

ANGLE ON THE SHARKTICONS

They charge Kup and Hot Rod Kup and Hot Rod fire into them,
destroying several, but are.... ... Soon overrun. The
Sharkticons crawl all over them, munching on their metal.

SUDDENLY --

                     DINOBOTS (O.S.)
               (WAR WHOOP)

ANGLE ON THE DINOBOTS

They fly down and land on the pile, transforming into Dinobot
mode.

ASSORTED SHOTS OF DINOBOT CARNAGE

SLUDGE in brontosaurus mode, swats several around with his
tail, while stomping them with his feet.

                    GRIMLOCK
          Lowers his teeth to devour a much smaller
          Sharkticon, the Sharkticon bares his
          teeth, realizes that he's a second
          stringer, and scampers away.

                    GRIMLOCK
          Me Grimlock want to munch metal! Slag
          barrels into Sharkticons, making a quick
          shishkebob out of them, while...

Swoop picks two up with his claws, flies in the air and drops
them on other Sharkticons.

                    THE SHARKTICONS
          suddenly back off and begin transforming
          (bowing) to the dinobots.

                                                             75.



ANGLE ON ALL

Kup and Hot Rod dig themselves out of a pile of Sharkticon
parts.

                       HOT ROD
             I never thought I'd be so happy to see
             those big bozos.

ANGLE ON GRIMLOCK

He turns to Hot Rod.

                       GRIMLOCK
             Me Grimlock no bozo.   Me king!

ANGLE ON QUINTESSON JUDGES

They look down, their angry faces showing.

                       QUINTESSON JUDGE
             Sharkticons! Execute them.

ANGLE ON GRIMLOCK

He points to the Quintessons...

                       GRIMLOCK
             Me Grimlock say execute them.

                       THE SHARKTICONS
             for a brief instant, don't seem to know
             what to do. Then, they charge the
             Quintessons.

                       THE CHASE
             The Quintessons start to flee, but it's
             clear that the Sharkticons, who climb
             over the stacked bodies of other
             Sharkticons, are going to catch them.

                       KUP
             I think the problems on this planet will

             But what about our problems.    We need a
             ship.

                       WHEELIE
             WHEELIE You get a ship if I get a trip.

ANGLE ON HOT ROD

He turns to the little, feral, robot.

                    HOT ROD
          Who are you.

SLAG AND WHEELIE

The dinobot lifts up Wheelie.

                    SLAG

                    HOT ROD
          HOT ROD He'll be mine too, if he can find
          a Quintesson ship.

ANGLE ON WHEELIE

He points into the distance...

WHAT WE SEE

is the strangest looking corkscrew ship   we've every seen
sticking out of the ground.

                    HOT ROD
          That's a ship?

EXT. THE SECOND MOON OF CYBERTRON

PAN ACROSS an enormous stockpile of weaponry as we hear the
terrible roar we have come to associate with Unicron.

                    SPIKE
          If this doesn't do it, nothing will.

ANGLE ON SPIKE

He sets a timer to 20 seconds.   The L.E.D. clicks down.

                    BUMBLEBEE
          now with a new bumpersticker which is a
          Unicron with a red circle and slash
          through it, looks very fidgety.

                    BUMBLEBEE
          Let's get out of here.

                                                            77.



BUMBLEBEE AND SPIKE

They run over to a small space ship as... ... The timer
counts down.

                          THE SPACESHIP
             takes off.

ANGLE ON THE SECOND MOON

Now, for the first time, we see what is really going on.
Unicron looms behind it, about to do the big munch.

ANGLE ON BUMBLEBEE AND SPIKE

They roar away.

                       ON UNICRON
             His mist surrounds the planet...

They stop their ship in space.

             Five, four, three, two, one...

ON THE SECOND MOON AND UNICRON

BLAMMMOLA!

An incredible display of fireworks goes off, seemingly
blowing Unicron to smithereens.

ON BUMBLEBEE AND SPIKE

They slap palms. Then, they look up, horrified.

                       BUMBLEBEE
             It isn't even dented.

                       SPIKE
             Let's get out of here!

                       ON UNICRON
             The great Maw opens and we hear a grand
             cosmic roar! Suddenly, the smoke and
             space junk from the explosion are sucked
             into his mouth.

ON BUMBLEBEE AND SPIKE

They try to fly away.

ANGLE ON THEIR SHIP AND UNICRON

Despite the fact that their thrusters are on full power, they
are still sucked into...

UNICRON...

Whose great mouth shuts when he's got the human and the
Autobot.

                       BLURR
             Weld? You? Really? Well, why not? Give it
             a try, but think it through first! Daniel
             knits his brow, extends FINGER OF EXO-
             GLOVE which is part of exo-suit.

CLOSE ON EXO GLOVE AND DANIEL'S HAND

as hand quivers and his finger shoots out a tiny flame which

          Decepticons!

             Your estimated survival time is 10
             seconds.

ANGLE ON ULTRA MAGNUS

He shoots at the junk walls.

                       ULTRA MAGNUS
             Then use that time to escape! The Matrix
             was designed for an emergency like this.
             I'll try to unleash its power.

                       SPRINGER
             But what if it doesn't work.

                       ULTRA MAGNUS

THE OTHER AUTOBOTS AND JUNK WALLS

Ultra Magnus' ray hits the walls and they tumble down,
separating him from the other Autobots.

ANGLE ON ULTRA MAGNUS

His back to a wall of fallen junk, he pulls out the matrix.

ANGLE ON GALVATRON IN CYCLONUS

Galvatron pops out of Cyclonus and both transform, to land in
front of Ultra Magnus.

ANGLE ON ULTRA MAGNUS

Struggling to open the leadership matrix. He puts his hand
inside of it and gets a powerful shock! He pulls his hand out
quickly.

                        ULTRA MAGNUS
             Damn it!   Open it!

ANGLE ON GALVATRON

          Prime, you said the Matrix would light
          our darkest hour.

ANGLE ON GALVATRON

Four sweeps fly TOWARD CAMERA in formation.    Galvatron pops
out a communication device from his helmet.

ANGLE ON THE SWEEPS - TRACKING

Four rope-like rays shoot out of them and...

wrap around his arms and legs.

ANGLE ON ULTRA MAGNUS AND THE SWEEPS

His arms and legs caught by the four ropes, he knows he's
just about had it. He struggles for one last moment, then...

ANGLE ON THE SWEEPS AND ULTRA MAGNUS

Pulling their rays taut, the Sweeps fly in four separate
directions, effectively drawing and quartering the Autobot
leader...

ON ULTRA MAGNUS

As all of his limbs are separated from his body and scattered

WRECK-GAR AND AN ARMY OF JUNKIONS

as they are moving in battle array towards the Shuttle.
Junkions are an interesting species. They ride themselves.
That is, the Junkions ride transforms of themselves, so that
if their vehicle breaks down, the driver will become the
vehicle, and the vehicle will transform to become the driver.
They are gibbering, singing almost a wild kind of junk-rock,
war-cry song which, like their language, is constructed of
bits and pieces of the museum junk of our culture - a
humorous aggressive song which makes a surreal kind of sense.
"Slice 'em dice 'em... And that's all folks or your money
back..."

                    ON WRECK-GAR
          as he roars into the lead and shows his

Blurr bringing up the rear- - zig zagging back and forth to
keep the Junkions from getting at Daniel.

                    A JUNKION
          roars alongside Springer on his
          motorcycle and throws out laser barbed
          grappling hook, trying to hook Springer.

          hops on the new motorcycle and then...

...turns around to come back.

          He looks over, astonished.

                    SPRINGER
          It's not hard to knock 'em down. It's

surrounding their friends as they SWOOP BY

                    KUP
          Not since the Crocodillos of Strontero
          have I seen such a sight....

ANOTHER ANGLE GRIMLOCK

as he sticks his face up next to Hot Rod. Wheelie, riding on
Grimlock's head, slips down to stand on console next to Hot
Rod

                    GRIMLOCK
          Maybe they make me king, too!

                    KUP
          Don't hold your breath, your majesty.

                    WRECK-GAR
          as he watches Cruiser descend and start
          gliding in for a landing

                    WRECK-GAR
          Steady as she goes, mob! Snoopy visitors
          get mud in the eye bye and bye, and film
          at five!
              (gives thumbs up sign, RIDES
               OFF)

                    JUNKIONS
          Everything must go by midnight! With a
          SINGING ROAR of musical, tribal
          excitement, the Junkions sweep Springer
          and our friends along with them,
          following course of landing Cruiser to

CRUISER LANDING SITE

Cruiser sets down and Junkions line up with weapons aimed at
rampway as they watch door

                       ON DOORWAY
             as Hot Rod steps out with big smile and
             hand full of energon sticks followed by a
             very wary Kup, and the Dinobots with
             Wheelie riding Sludge's neck.

INTERCUT TO SPRINGER, DANIEL, ARCEE ET. AL FOR REACTIONS

ON WRECK-GAR AND OTHER JUNKIONS

as they react to hot Rod's smile, Wreck-Gar trying to mimic
that smile to his followers who laugh

ON HOT ROD

as he steps up beside Kup and gently pushes Kup's rifle aside

                       HOT ROD
                 (aside to Kup, still holding
                  smile)
             Guns aren't exactly friendly.

                       KUP
                 (through his teeth to Hot Rod)
             Neither are they in case you haven't
             noticed.

                       HOT ROD
                 (sotto)
             What was the Universal greeting again?

                       WRECK-GAR
             growls and slips a SNIPPER, BLOW TORCH
             CUTTING TOOL out of a holster and starts
             toward Hot Rod with it

                       HOT ROD
             HOT ROD
                 (big smile)
             Bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong?

WRECK-GAR AND OTHER JUNKIONS

They look at one another, blink, then beam with smiles

                       WRECK-GAR
             Bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong?

                       HOT ROD

              (presses energon sticks
               forward)
          As Hot Rod says this...

...Wreck-Gar takes the energon sticks and holds them over his
head and... ...all the Junkions smile and cheer and start
chanting the universal greeting phrase, laughing, clapping
their hands and dancing around, taking Arcee's hand and...
... taking Springer and Perceptor and Daniel out into center
of a square dance type gathering, moving back and forth with
them dancing happily, singing the universal greeting in a
melodic, rhythmic way

                    EVERYBODY
          Bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong Bah
          weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong! Bah

                    WRECK-GAR
          hugs Hot Rod, and Perceptor who winces
          and tries to enjoy it, and then hugs
          Daniel, Wheelie, Arcee, laughing and
          dancing as SINGING goes.

                    ON GRIMLOCK
          as he reacts to Wreck-Gar kissing his leg

                    GRIMLOCK
          Yuck! Me Grimlock, not a kisser!   Me,
          Grimlock, a king!

                    WHEELIE
          claps his hands and gleefully makes
          noises as he hops about, dancing with
          Junkions until we CUT TO

                    WRECK-GAR
          as he stands on top of platform and RINGS
          JUNK BELLS AND SIRENS getting silence and
          smiling as he waves hands all around

                    WRECK-GAR
          Have a nice day and please, close cover
          before striking, friends! Amigos, buddies
          and side kicks, Breep drit, aw rootie! So
          say the Junkions!
              (holds hands over his head)

ANGLE ON HOT ROD

He looks at them, strangely.

                    HOT ROD
          Where did you learn to talk like that?

                                                            90.



ANGLE ON WRECK-GAR

He reaches into his body, and about where a heart or some
other organ would be, he pulls out a Watchman.

                    THE WATCHMAN
          On it is a crazy Eddy-type commercial.

                    WRECK-GAR
          We talk T.V. You talk some T.V.?

                    KUP
          looks around nervously.

                    KUP
          I talk some TV. And now, Hot Rod for the
          news. Don't touch that dial. Void where
          prohibited. JUNKIONS cheer wildly while
          the Dinobots react with uncertainty

RESUME ON WRECK-GAR

as he points off and shouts happily.

HIS P.O.V. - JUNKIONS WITH ULTRA MAGNUS

The Junkions move Ultra Magnus' mangled body through an
amazing assembly line, quickly piecing together his body
parts, using junk when they can't find a part. Then, they
lube him, dust him, spray him and polish him. Then, Wreck-Gar
hits a switch, and Ultra Magnus' eye lights go on.

                    WRECK-GAR
          Happy motoring! Cock-a-doodle-do!

ON ULTRA MAGNUS

as he steps away from Junkion line of reconstruction and into
group consisting of Hot Rod, Kup and Springer.

                    SPRINGER AND OTHERS
              (Ad lib jubilation)
          Ultra Magnus!

                    ULTRA MAGNUS
          You're all alive...

All turn to Ultra Magnus.

                    ULTRA MAGNUS
          It's gone...

                    KUP
          And with it, all hope.

                    HOT ROD
          No...
              (inspired)
          The matrix will not fail us.

                    ARCEE
          Didn't you hear Ultra Magnus. We don't
          have it anymore. Galvatron does.

                    HOT ROD
          Then we've got to trust in ourselves, and
          no matter what they odds, destroy
          Unicron.

                    ON WRECK-GAR
          His eyes light up.

                    WRECK-GAR
          Yeah! Destroy Unicron... Kill the grand
          poobah.... Flush cosmic troubles down the
          drain.

ANGLE ON JUNKIONS

                    JUNKIONS
              (almost chanting)
          Destroy Unicron... Kill the grand
          poobah... Flush cosmic troubles down the
          drain.

ANGLE ON SPRINGER

The Quintesson ship in the BACKGROUND.

                      SPRINGER
          Listen,   I don't want to rain on anybody's
          parade,   but how are we going to move the
          army to   Unicron. We don't have enough
          room on   that ship.

          No fuss, no muss.

          Hurry, hurry. Sale must end! Rush right
          on down to bridge and test drive latest
          with no obligation.

Suddenly, several Junkions scramble to concealed doorways in
the Junk.

                    ULTRA MAGNUS
          You have ships here?

                    WRECK-GAR
          New, improved Junkion planet, is sleek
          sexy import with turbo handling.

                    SPRINGER
          What's he talking about?

ANGLE ON QUINTESSON

Suddenly, boosters fire from the back side of the junk, and
somewhere under all of the junk, we realize is a real space
ship. Maybe the junk is the space ship. It takes off, bits
and pieces of junk flying off as it moves.

                    SPRINGER
          This is what I call traveling in style.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

LONG SHOT- UNICRON

as Galvatron stands on the surface of Unicron, holding the
Matrix.

                    GALVATRON (V.O.)
          Listen to me, or suffer the consequences.

                    UNICRON
          Aren't we getting pompous?

                    GALVATRON
          I now possess that which you most fear.
          Unicron LAUGHS and the force of it rocks
          the surface of the planet, knocking
          Galvatron to his knees.

                    GALVATRON
          You will do my bidding, or... Unicron
          roars with laughter.


                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                             93.
CONTINUED:


                    GALVATRON
          ...taste my wrath.

He leans down and starts trying to open the matrix.

ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING GALVATRON

IN THE BACKGROUND, we see Cybertron getting closer. Galvatron
struggles with the Matrix, but gets a big shock.

                    UNICRON
          You underestimate me Galvatron.

ANOTHER ANGLE - GALVATRON ON UNICRON

He desperately struggles to open the matrix. The planet
suddenly starts shaking. Galvatron is bathed in a reddish
light, and looks up in horror!

ANGLE ON UNICRON

A hideous transformation is beginning. The surface of the
planet in front of Galvatron opens up, and we see that the
hideous light comes from eyes set on a hideous head!

GALVATRON AND UNICRON

Galvatron is maybe the size of a single tooth on the horrible
head before him.

                    UNICRON
          For a time, I considered sparing your
          measly little planet, but now you shall
          witness its dismemberment!

ANGLE ON GALVATRON

Suddenly, the ground he stands on drops away, and he falls
through space... ... Landing on a protruding plate which
sticks out of Unicron's chest.

GALVATRON - CLOSE

He looks around himself in horror and lets out a loud scream
as he realizes the unimaginable horror that surrounds him.

ANGLE ON UNICRON - LONG SHOT

The massive planet transforms, arms and legs fold out of the
enormous body, hands unfold from the arms, jets from it's
back propel it towards... ... Cybertron, which, now looks
lonely and vulnerable in space.

                                                             94.



ANGLE ON GALVATRON

He stands on a ledge on Unicron and desperately tries to open
the matrix, but no cigar.

                     GALVATRON
          No!!!

ANGLE ON CYBERTRON

Unicron enters shot and grasps at Cybertron with a hideous
claw...

ANGLE ON A TOWER ON CYBERTRON

Shockwave talks into a communications device, as alarms sound
and troopers run everywhere.

                    SHOCKWAVE
          Decepticons...we're under
          attack...Scramble - Then his voice is cut
          off as...

SHOCKWAVE'S POV - OUT HIS WINDOW

Unicron's hand reaches towards the window, squeezes, and the
walls crash in.

SPACE - UNICRON AND CYBERTRON

Unicron tears off the tower and crushes it as...

A FLEET OF DECEPTICON SHIPS

streak out of Cybertron and begin firing on the enormous
planet. Here, we see the true scale of Unicron. The fighters
are the size of bees as they attack.

ANGLE ON UNICRON

He looks down on the swarm of fighters and... ...Breathes
fire down on them. The fighters POP and burn like popcorn in
a blowtorch. In moments they disappear like sparks from a
fire.

ANGLE ON CYBERTRON

Decepticon troopers man a massive gun emplacement as... ...
Unicron's huge hand reaches down... ... scraping buildings
and... ... tearing out gun emplacements.

                                                             95.



ANOTHER ANGLE- UNICRON'S FACE

as he puts his face down so his mouth will receive all the
rockets, laser blasts, etc.

THE DECEPTICON DEFENDERS

are silhouetted like ants in the foreground as Unicron OPENS
HIS MOUTH and swallows the fire barrage

                     GALVATRON
           GALVATRON Stop feeding him, you fools!

ANGLE ON UNICRON AND CYBERTRON

As yet more Decepticon fighters rip out of the planet, it
looks like Unicron is going to have a field day tearing it
apart.

                                                        CUT TO:

           Nope, never seen anything like it.

LONG SHOT- HOT ROD'S CRUISER AND THE JUNKION SPACE SHIP

INT. - CRUISER

Hot Rod shoves joystick forward and Cruiser DRIVES TOWARD
UNICRON whom we see turn to take a swat at it through glass
canopy

ON JUNKION SPACE SHIP

as it pulls up beside Hot Rod's Cruiser so they are both in a
line.....The Dinobots behind both ships ...all diving toward

INT. JUNKION SHIP - WRECK-GAR AT CONTROLS

Unicron's face loom closer, closer, closer

LONG SHOT- CRUISER, JUNKION SHIP AND DINOBOTS IN FORMATION

catch the lot of them as soon as they get within reach

                    UNICRON'S CHEST
          Galvatron, the matrix hanging around his
          neck. Transforms to Cannon and fires up
          at... ... A bright panel on Unicron's
          chest...

BLAAAM!

He hits the panel and lights and sparks fly out, causing the
gigantic robot to flicker momentarily.

ANGLE ON UNICRON

The monster lets out a ROAR! Then, reaches down, picks up
Galvatron and drops him into his mouth like a raisin.

ANGLE ON GALVATRON

He drops into the deep pit of Unicron's mouth, narrowly
avoiding both a torrent of fire, and his sharp, crushing
teeth.

                                                            97.



EXT. THE SPACE BATTLE - SAME TIME

As they Junkion cruiser comes close, Unicron lets out a burst
of fire... ... Flames lick the ship, but when the fire
subsides, nothing has happened.

The ship fires back, dumping rays into... ... Unicron's face,
but not really doing any damage.

UNICRON AND JUNKION CRUISER

Unicron grabs the Junkion cruiser with both of it's hands
and...

                       CLOSER
             ... tears it in half.

                       WRECK-GAR (V.O.)

welding things... ...screwing things together... ... and

Both halves of the Junkion ship act as independent space
ships.

EXT THE SPACE BATTLE

As the Quintesson ship shoots toward Unicron's face.

                    THE CRUISER
          Is suddenly struck by a ray from
          Unicron's eye, and half of it is knocked
          off.

INT THE CRUISER

Lights go off, and the Autobots are thrown around like toys.

ANGLE THROUGH THE VIEWSCREEN

They are heading right to Unicron's eye.

ANGLE ON UNICRON AND THE CRUISER

Unicron swipes at the cruiser, but misses. The Cruiser
crashes right through Unicron's eye like a corkscrew!

                    UNICRON (V.O.)
          Graaaaaaaaaaa!

INT. UNICRON'S HEAD - SAME TIME

The cruiser rips through the eye socket and smashes through
several electrical membranes that are, in fact, Unicron's
brain.

ANGLE ON THE SHIP

As the ship tumbles through, it dumps off the various
Autobots like rubbish and disintegrates.

ANGLE ON HOT ROD

He tumbles out of the rubbish and down a deep pit (which we
can assume is a robotic sinus or something)

EXT. THE BRAIN AREA

Kup, Springer, Daniel and Arcee are scattered about the floor
in the giant, flickering chamber.

                    DANIEL
          Where's Hot Rod?

                    SPRINGER
          Sees something in the distance.



                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             99.

                       SPRINGER
             I don't know, but I hope they didn't get
             him.

WHAT HE SEES

Are dozens of hovering Robots that look like floating bear
traps, snapping their jaws as they drift slowly towards the
Autobots.

ANGLE ON THE AUTOBOTS

                          KUP
             Debugoids!

                        ARCEE
             Quick!   This way.

They run into a long, cave-like chamber which looks like the
central nervous system or something.

                                                         CUT TO:

INT. ANOTHER CHAMBER - LATER

Hot Rod drops through the darkness and lands in a pile of
miscellaneous junk.

ON HOT ROD

He slowly gets up and looks around the chamber.

WHAT HE SEES

Pan as Hot Rod looks over various different bits of junk,
until he sees the glowing shape of the Autobot Matrix
apparently suspended in mid air.

                       HOT ROD
             The Autobot Matrix!

Then, suddenly two red, burning eyes light up above the
matrix, and we see the hideous form of Galvatron.

                       GALVATRON
             It will do you no good, Autobot.   It
             cannot be opened.

ON HOT ROD

He stands up and walks towards Galvatron.



                                                     (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


                    HOT ROD
          Not by a Decepticon.

ANGLE ON HOT ROD AND GALVATRON

Hot Rod steps towards Galvatron.

                    GALVATRON
          It is strange that we should find
          ourselves as allies...

                    ON GALVATRON
          Suddenly, his body is violently twisted,
          and his arms are almost broken off.

                      GALVATRON
          Uhhhh...

                    UNICRON
          Destroy him, or feel yourself torn from
          limb to limb.

                    GALVATRON
          Of course, my master!

ANGLE ON GALVATRON AND HOT ROD

Galvatron takes a shot at Hot Rod. ... Hot Rod dives away, as
electricity seems to flash everywhere.

                    ON GALVATRON
          He peers into the gloom.

GALVATRON'S POV   -   PANNING THE ROOM

Hot Rod is nowhere to be seen amidst all of the junk.

                    ON GALVATRON
          Weapon drawn.

                    GALVATRON
          Puny Autobot, you lack even Prime's
          courage. There is no response.

                                                        CUT TO:

          kicking.

                    GRIMLOCK

ANGLE ON UNICRON

Suddenly; he looks down, sending down a searing blast of
fire.

ANGLE ON THE DINOBOTS

They transform to robot mode and fly away.

                    GRIMLOCK
          Me, Grimlock, need new strategy.

INT. THE CORRIDOR IN UNICRON -- SAME TIME

Kup, Arcee, Springer and Daniel dash down the corridor.
Suddenly, Daniel's foot is caught in a maze of wiring.

ANGLE ON THE OTHERS

Not noticing, they keep running.

ANGLE ON DANIEL

He tries to pull his foot out. No luck. Then, he looks up.

WHAT HE SEES

The Robotic Antibodies are drawing very close to him.

                    DANIEL
          He looks o.s. towards the others.

                      DANIEL
          Help...

ANGLE ON KUP AND ARCEE

They turn around and see Daniel about to be munched by the
antibodies.

                      ARCEE
          Daniel!

                                                            102.



ANGLE ON SPRINGER, KUP AND ARCEE

They dash down the corridor firing on...

THE ROBOTIC ANTIBODIES

Their shots hit some, knocking them to scrap, but there are
so many of them, that they can't hold back the tide as it...

ANGLE UNDER THE ANTIBODIES

Daniel, unscathed by the things, which hover over his head,
munching their way towards the Autobots, gets his foot free.

                       DANIEL
           I'm okay.    They don't even see me.

ANGLE ON THE AUTOBOTS

It looks like Custer's last stand as they are surrounded by
the vicious antibodies.

                      KUP
           They must not programmed to catch flesh
           creatures.

           Daniel... Try to find help! Arcee
           fires...

HER SHOT   - TRACKING

Misses the Antibodies, but strikes a large tube.

ANGLE ON THE TUBE

When it is hit, it pours a torrent of liquid which... ...
Goes over the swarm of Antibodies, but hits Daniel... ...
Carrying him away in a flood of glowing liquid.

ON DANIEL - TRACKING

He shouts as he finds himself in a river of flowing goo.

                                                      CUT TO:

INT.   UNICRON - A FLOWING TUNNEL

Daniel    rips through what seem to be endless caves on the
torrent    of liquid, until he is dumped down a high waterfall
into...    .... A glowing lake. ... He stays under for a
moment,    and then bobs up to see...

                       UNICRON'S STOMACH
             This is the central processing area for
             Unicron's "food" and "energy." A long
             conveyer belt drops junk into a clear,
             bubbling vat, where it is separated into
             raw material and energy. The energy,
             which comes out in raw form, goes into a
             machine and is crunched into energon
             cubes, while the solid material, is
             separated into it's component metals and
             plastics, formed into ingots and sent
             elsewhere in an assembly line fashion.

                       DANIEL
             watches this with awe until he sees...

ANGLE ON THE ASSEMBLY LINE

... Several Decepticon troopers hanging from cables like
shirts at a dry cleaners are dropped into the bubbling vat,
and in moments converted to nothing... ... Then, Cliffjumper
and Jazz roll out of the line...

                       ON DANIEL
             He dashes to the shores of the glowing
             lake...

                       DANIEL
             Cliffjumper! Jazz!

And then Spike comes rolling down, followed by Bumblebee!

                          DANIEL
             Bumblebee!     Dad!

ON CLIFFJUMPER, JAZZ, AND SPIKE

They look down, but can't move because they are held by
massive pincers.

                       SPIKE
             Shut off the control, Daniel. Daniel
             looks around.

Then, he sees.

          He runs up a catwalk towards it....

ANGLE ON DANIEL

He reaches the flickering panel.

                    DANIEL
          What do I do? It doesn't have any
          buttons or anything.

ANGLE ON SPIKE - TRACKING

He looks down.

                    SPIKE
          Shoot it, Son.

                    DANIEL
          But I don't have a gun.

                    SPIKE
          Use your exo-suit.

ANGLE ON DANIEL

He looks down at his hand and concentrates as hard as he can.
Then, a spark comes out. It grows longer.

ANGLE ON THE MACHINE

Spike and the Autobots are about to go in.

          Hurry!

          Starts frying the command console!

ANGLE ON THE LINE

It keeps moving. Then, Cliffjumper is dropped in!

ANGLE ON DANIEL

He looks back, and to his horror sees Jazz, Bumblebee and his
father about to be dropped in. He keeps firing. The panel
starts exploding!

           turns around and sees this.

           Dad!

There is no answer. Play the moment. Then...

                     SPIKE
           Son.

ANGLE ON THE VAT

It is empty. The Autobots and Spike sit at the bottom,
smoking but alright.

Galvatron, the Matrix at his neck, stalks around the room.
Looking everywhere for Hot Rod.

                     GALVATRON
           Come out, Autobot. We all must die
           sometime.

Suddenly, shockingly, Hot Rod jumps out of the floor and
grabs Galvatron, sinking his fist into the Decepticon's face.

                     GALVATRON
           stumbles backward.

Hitting him as he transforms back to humanoid mode and

          No, I will crush you with bare hands. Hot
          Rod transforms back to car and tries to
          race away... ... Galvatron jumps after
          him and catches him... ... Hot Rod,
          nearly pinned by Galvatron transforms to
          humanoid mode.

... Galvatron wrestles him to his back.. ... The Adolescent
Robot tries to fight back, but the other is stronger. ...
Galvatron puts his hands around Hot Rod's neck and starts
squeezing. ... We hear the crunching of metal.

                    GALVATRON
          First Prime, then Ultra Magnus and now
          you. It is a pity Autobots die so easily
          or I might have a sense of satisfaction
          now. Hot Rod desperately gasps and pulls
          at Galvatron's hands...

EXT. SPACE - THE BATTLE

Unicron shoots down more Decepticons with his remaining eye,
while he crushes the Junkion ship.

INT. THE JUNKION SHIP

The walls crush in.    The Junkions and the Autobots are   being
smashed together.

                    WRECK-GAR
          Ashes to ashes. Junk to junk.

INT. THE DARK CAVERN

Galvatron still strangles Hot Rod.

ANGLE ON THE MATRIX

Suddenly, it lights up.

                    ANOTHER ANGLE
          A miraculous transformation takes place.
          ... Hot Rod begins to grow at an
          alarming rate. ... Age shows on his
          face. ... He is stronger and wiser.

          Nooooooo!

... Hot Rod gets up. ...    The shot doesn't even dent him.

                    HOT ROD
          This is the end of the road, Galvatron.
          With that, he picks up the Decepticon and
          throws him through...

EXT. UNICRON - SAME TIME

INT. THE DARK CAVERN

Hot Rod, bathed in the glow of the matrix. Sticks his hand
in the way we saw Galvatron and Ultra Magnus try earlier.
There is no shock. Then, like pulling the pin on a hand
grenade, he unleashes the spiritual equivalent of a bomb!

ASSORTED SHOTS -   INVASION OF THE MATRIX

The matrix rips through Unicron's body, blowing up wires
causing floods and generally causing havoc.

EXT. SPACE - THE BATTLE

Unicron suddenly lets out a scream and lets go of the Junkion
ship, sending it hurtling.

                                                             108.



INT. THE JUNKION SHIP

It tumbles through space.

AUTOBOTS AND JUNKIONS

(THEY SCREAM WITH EXHILARATION)

ANGLE ON UNICRON

Suddenly,    he starts tearing into his body.

EXT. SPACE

Unicron writhes in space, tearing himself apart, ripping off
a leg, and sending out sparks like a roman candle.

INT. THE CORRIDOR WHERE KUP ET.AL ARE TRAPPED

They are overrun by the antibodies. One takes a whopper bite
out of Springer's chest.

                       SPRINGER
             I'm almost out of energy. Suddenly, he
             looks up and sees one of the creatures
             explode above

HIM.

Then another explodes, then another.

SPRINGER'S POV - A WALL OF ANTIBODIES

Suddenly, every antibody in the wall begins exploding, and
through the carnage, we see Bumblebee, Spike, Daniel,
Cliffjumper and Jazz.

ANGLE ON THE BATTLE

The last of the antibodies is blown away, and Kup, Arcee and
Springer sit up amidst a pile of antibody bodies.

                       SPRINGER
             That's what I call the nick of time.

ANGLE ON ALL

Suddenly, an entire wall vanishes as Unicron's hand tears at
things.

ANGLE ON THE TUNNEL

They transform. The humans jump in.

THE CHASE - TRACKING

They race up the tunnel, one step ahead    of Unicron's hand
which shoots after them, pulling apart    what we know must be
pieces of his brain... Then, they reach    what seems like a
dead end. In fact, it is the back side     of Unicron's good
eye. The hand comes in after them!

ANGLE DOWN THE CORRIDOR

An unbelievably fast and powerful robot races towards the
Autobots. When it gets there, we realize that it is Rodimus
Prime.

                    KUP
          I knew you had potential, lad!

ANGLE ON RODIMUS PRIME

                    RODIMUS PRIME
          Autobots, transform and roll out. Rodimus
          Prime transforms into truck mode as the
          other Autobots also transform. Daniel
          and Spike jump into him. Then, in a
          continuous line, he shoots off, the other
          Autobots racing behind him.

                                                      SMASH CUT:

EXT. UNICRON

Rodimus Prime shoots out the second eye...    Followed by the
others.

ANGLE ON UNICRON

An arm and a leg dangle uselessly as the Autobot essence
spreads throughout the body, blowing circuits. Suddenly,
Unicron lets out a loud agonized ROAR. SPARKS seem to shoot
out of every part of his body. Then, he spins in space like
some kind of a fireworks display, shooting off sparks. And
then...

                                                         110.



BANG!

We get the big visual explosion.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. SPACE - MUCH LATER

Unicron's head orbits Cybertron. PAN to Cybertron where and
PUSH IN on Rodimus Prime, Arcee, Kup, Springer, Ultra Magnus,
Wreck-Gar, Daniel, Perceptor, Blaster and Spike watch
construction being done on Cybertron below.

                    RODIMUS PRIME
          Let this mark the end of the Cybertronian
          wars as we move forward to a new age of
          peace and happiness....

                    ALL
